The Psalter of David in English / purely and faithfully translated after the
text of Felyne: every Psalm having his argument before / declarynge brefely
thentente and substance of the hole Psalm.

To the reder.
BE glad in the lord (dear brethern) and give hi^ thanks / which now at the
last / of his merciable goodness has sent you his Psalter in English /
faithfully and purely translated: which ye may not mesure and judge after the
come^ text. For the troth of the Psalms must b^ fetched more nygh the
Hebrew veri^te / in the which tongue David with the other si^gers of ye Psalms
first song them. Let the gostly learned i^ the holy tongue be iuges. It is the
spiritual man (says Paul) which has the spirit of god that must decerne
and judge all things. And the men quietly syttyng (if the truth be showed them)
must judge and stand up and speak (the first i^terpretour holding his peace)
god give you true spiritual and quiet sitting iuges. Amen.

Beatus vir. Psalm..i.
The argument of the first psalm.
They that forsake their cou^seyls / the ways / the lernyng / and conuersatyon
of the ungodly: geuynge the^self holy to the knowledge of gods ^awe / and to
live thereafter / ar blessed: the other ar wicked and ungodly. The blessed ar
lykened to a moist frutful tree fast planted by the wa^ side: the ungodly / to
dri baren dust scatred with the wi^de

BEatus vir. Blessed is that man / which walks not in the counsel of the
ungodly / and stands not in the way of si^ners / and sytteth not in the seat
of the pestele^t scorners. But has all his pleasure i^ ye law of ye lord /
and upon it his mi^de is ocupied both day and night Since a man shall be like a
tree planted by the river ^yde: which will give forth her fruits in due time /
and her leaves shall not wither / for what so ever he shall do / shall prospere.
But so shall not ye ungodly: for they shall be like dust which is dyspersed with
the wind. Wherefore these ungodly shall not stand in the judgment / neither
these sinners may abide in the company of the rightwyse. For the lord
aproueth the way of the ryghtwyse: but the way of sinners shall perisshe.

The argument into the.ii. psalm.
This psalm. shows who were against god and his son Christ / their vain
study / how god above scorneth their enforcementes / how that Christ's
kingdom stands and encreseth whiles they perisshe / and that the way of
health is to trust and to cleue to Christ our king.

QUare fremueru^t gentes. Wherefore do the gentyls thus swell and clustre
together? Wherefore do ye people of the jews thus gnaste in vain? Wherefore
conspire ye kings of therth / and ye chief prestes thus cast their hedes
together against the lord and his anointed. Saying / let us break their
bonds / and let us cast of their yokes. But he yt has his reside^s i^
heaven derideth the^ / ye lord scorneth the^* Than shall he thrust them down
in his wrath / and in his indignation shall he all to trouble the^. I have
constitute and ordened my king / to be over Sion my holy hyl. I shall show
forth ye lords commandment / for he said unto me / you art my son who^ I
have now openly declared. Ask of me / and I shall give the yt nations into thy
heritage / to be thyn own possession through out all the world. Thou shalt
smite the^ together with an yerne scepter / and shall br^ke the^ like erthe^
vessels. Now therefore ye kings be wise and understand / ye rulers of the earth
be content to be monished and learned. Serve ye ye lord besely / study to give
him his honor joyfully with reverence. Kiss ye the son / lest (he being
wrath) your life perish / for his anger shall be shortly kyndled. And tha^
blessed ar all men that trust in him.

The argument in to the.iii. Psalm.
David merueleth and complains to the lord of the multitude and boldness of
his enemies and commits hi^ self with great trust to the lord which will
shortly smite the^ down / for no man else may save / and no man is pertaker of
health but he trust in hi^. The title of the ps. The song or ditie of David
flei^g from his son Absalo^. Thistori is written i^ the.ii. book of kings
from the xv. cha. to the xx.

DOmine quid. Lord / see what a sort there are that trouble me: full many
there are yt rise against me. Many there are that think thus upon my soul /
surely there is no health to be looked for from god / unto this man. Selah. But
thou lord / you art my help and my glory / thou liftest up my heed. The lord
I called upon with my prayer / and he answered me even from his holy hill.
Selah. I shall lie down and sleep / I my self shall vpwake me for the lord
sustayneth me. I shall fere / ye thousands folk / although they besige me
round about. A rise lord / save me any god / you shall give all my enemies
such a clap on their chekes / yt anon the tethes of these ungodly shall be
broken. It is ye lords properte to save / and thy people it be houeth to be
helped and endued with thy ^enefytes. Selah.

This word Selah / sygnifyeth the sentence before to be pondred with a deep
effect / long to be rested upon / and the voice there to be exalted.

The argument into the.iiii. psalm.
David shows the goodness of god and his help brought to hi^ / whiles his
son Absalon coniured against him / he reproves the madness of the nobles of
Israhell co^spirynge against hi^: and calls the^ to repentance / after this
he reioyseth of the great ple^tuousnesse / pease / and surenes / restored
through the goodness of god unto him. The title of the psalm. Dauides song upon
an instrument played for his victory.

CUm inuocarem. When I called upon the / thou answeredest me / which art ye
god of my rightwysnes. When I was in astrayte / thou dyddest set me at large /
have mercy upon me / and hear my deep desire. O me^ / how long entende ye to
turn my glory into shame / how long will ye love vain things and seek
lies? Selah I would ye knew it / yt the lord has set aparte and chose^ unto
hi^ his saint / the lord shall here when I call upon hi^. All though ye be
moved / yet se ye sin not / pondre all things in your mind as ye lie in
bed / that ye might so set your hertes at rest. Selah. Make your sacri^fice
with rightwysnes / and put your trust (...) the lord. Many think saying / se
who shall show us our desire / lord let thy shy^nyng face illumine us. Thou
have poured my heart full of gladness / whete and wy^e have been encresed unto
them in time. Now therefore (they restored to peace^ I shall lie down and sleep
/ for you (lord) have so ordered me that I may live fre and safe

The argument into the.v. psalm.
This psalm. is a prayer of a man oppressed of wicked enemies / whom when he
knows to be hated of god / he takes heart unto him again trustyng that al
peril passed he shall thank god his savior in the congregation of his sai^tes
/ wherefore he prays god so to lead hi^ / that he be not trapped with their
snares / and also to cast the^ down and to make glad the faithful. The title
of the psalm. Dauides song played upon an instrument for his victory into the
counfort of his people.

UErba mea auribus. Lysten unto my words (lord) and consider my loud
complaint. Give ear unto my crieng / my gouerner / and my god / for before the
/ do I pour forth my prayer. Lord / you shall here me i^ the morni^g / i^ the
morning shall I make my prayer and look up unto the. For thou art not the god
which may delight in ye ungodly / the wicked men shall have no place with the.
Sinners shall not abide in thy presence / you hate who so ever are given to
wickedness. Thou shall destroy these troublers with their lies bloudsheders / and
men given to deceyte (lord) you shall abhor. But I under thy ple^tuouse favor
/ shall go to thy house / and shall worship the with reuerente fear in thy holy
temple. Led me forth of danger for thy rightwisnes sake / and from the
danger of my adversaries / and let thy way be defe^sed for me. For the truth
is not in their mouths / in their hertes they norishe deceyte / their throat
is an open grave / and with their tongue they flater. Give them into their sin /
o god / let the^ fall i^ their own counsels / cast the^ down hedlynge for the
multitude of their si^nes / for against the they ar rebel. But they might
rejoice who so ever trust in ye / they might pray perpetually also / and thou
defend the^ yt they which seek ye glory of thy name / might be glad of the.
For thou lord shall be favorable and gracious to ye rightwise / thou shalt
compase him round about with thy goodness / like as with a shylde.

The argument into the.vi. Psalm.
This Psalm. co^teyneth a fervent desire / and prayer of a man grievously de^ecte
and wounded in his heart / and sore fearing death / but afterward rejoicing of
health restored him. The title of the Psalm. The song of David for his victory
played of the.x. strynged instrument.

DOmine ne. Ah lord / rebuke me not in thy wrath / neither chasten me in thine
anger. But deal favorably with me (oh lord) for full sore broken am I / heal
me lord for my bones ar al to shaken My soul tre^bleth sore / but lord how
long. Turn ye (lord) and deliver my soul / save me for thy mercyes sake.
For they verily that are in this dedly anguishe can not think upon ye / in this
helly pains / who may praise the. I am weary with syghyng / I shall water my bed
every night with my tears / so that it shall swi^me in them. My face is
wrincled and dried up with care and anger / my enemies have made it full thynne
with trouble. Avoid from me ye workers of wikednes / for ye lord has hard my
co^plai^tes poured out with wepi^g. The lord has hard my deep desire / the
lord has received my peticio^. Al mine enemies shall be shamed and astonned /
they shall be put to flight and confounded suddenly.

The argument into the vii. Psalm.
In this psalm. David desires to be delivered from the troublous and perelous
persecution of Saul: he reme^breth his innocence / he prays for the
possessyon of his kingdom that the people might be gathered to god / all
cursed me^nes hastynes put away / after this he declares that this ungodly
shall perysshe with their own sw^rde / and so at last he concludes in the
praise of god. The title of the ps. The song of David played upon a certain
musycall instrument which he song to the lord as concerning the besynes to
the which Cush the son of Iemi^^ put hi^. Read thistory i^ the ii of the
kings. the.xvi. cha

This Ps. serves to be said of a man falsely vexed and troubled.

DOmine deus meus. Oh lord which art my god / my trust is in the / save me
from all that persecute me and deliver me. Lest this man rauysh my life like a
lion / ^earyng my soul / no man delyuering me. Lord / mi god if I have
committed this thing / if I be about to do so wiked a thing. If I have not
done good for evil / ye / if I have not done good to my enemies / freely
delyueryng them from periles. Let my enemy persecute my soul and take it /
let him cast down my life and bury my glory. Selah. Arise lord and show thy
self / repressyng the wrath of my troublous adversaries with worthy vengeance /
make me at the last to enjoy the authorite which y^ have given me. For so shall
the congregation of thy people be gathered together before the / ye / if there
were none other cause / yet at the lest for delyuera^ce of thy pore
congregation set forth thy power. Lord which art the judge of the people judge
me after my ryghtwisnes and innocence which you espied in me. Let the wickedness
of the ungodly (I pray the) be made ones an end of / and thou (o rightwise
god) sercher of heart and reins / give prosperous good luck to the rightwyse.
My defense is i^ god the savior of the^ which are of pure and perfet heart.
God is a rightwyse judge / and he is ye god whose ve^geau^ce is ready at all
times. If this man will not turn him from his evil / but will whet his swerd
co^tynually / be^de his bow and prepare it to shote. He shall p^pare dedly
arowes for his own self / and smite his own company. Lo / he traueleth and
groueth forth wickedness / he has conceived laborous affliction / and at last
brings forth lies. He dug a pyt and has made it holowe / and he is fallen
into the dyke which he made. The mischefe which he ente^ded me shall fall upon
his own head / and his viole^s which he ordained for me / he shall bring upon his
own crown. I shall magnifye the lord after his own rightwisnes / and I
shall sprede the name of the lord which is the most highest.

The argument into the.viii. psalm.
This psalm. is an high praise of god / in the which David with great
admiration magnified thi^estimable everlasting virtue and power of god / maker
of all things / declaryng hi^ self euerywher gloriously: but especially
shewinge unto man his favor / his benefice^s: and lyberall goodness. The title
of the Psalm. The song of David committed to the chau^ter / to be played upon
the harp.

DOmine dn^s nt. Lord / ye / our lord how wonderful reverent is thy name in
every land / which have lift up thy high magnifice^ce above ye heue^s. Ye /
and that of the mouths of the litel souklinges have thou stablisshed thy
mighty praise against thy enemies / to smite down adversary / and hi^ that
will avenge him self. I shall therefore look up and wondre at thy heuens / lo /
this are the works of thy fyngers / the moon and sterres / thou have set the^
so goodly. And lo / what thing is man mortal yt thou thus reme^brest hi^?
what is the son of Ada^ yt thou regardest him so greatly? Thou have made hi^
not much less and inferior tha^ Angels / with so great dignite and glory have
thou e^dued hi^. Thou have made hi^ lord of thy handy works / thou have cast
all things under his fete. As flocks of sheep all herdes of nete / and also
the wild bestes. Fowls of the air and fisshes of the sea / and what soever
swi^meth in the water. Lord / ye our lord / how wo^dreful reverent is thy
nam i^ all therth.

The argument into the.ix. Ps.
David in this psalm / sings his song of victory / in the which he gives
thanks for his noble victory upon Goliath / afterward he extolleth the
ryghtwysnes of god which delyuereth his children in time: at the last he
concludes with prayer desiring god to repress and to quench the ungodly. The
title of the psalm. The song of David committed to the chau^ter of the qu^re
to be so^ge upon their musycall i^strume^tes.

COnfitebor tibi do. I shall magnify the lord with my heart / I shall show forth
all thy miracles. I shall rejoice and glory in the / I shall sprede thy name /
oh most highest. For thou have brought it so to pass / that al my enemies are
fled / they are ded / one falling upon another in their flyghte. For thou have
given sentence with me / thou have affirmed my cause / you sit i^ judgment a
rightwyse judge. Thou have sore blamed the hethe^ / the ungodly is fallen down
ded / you have quenched their name for ever. O thou adversary / have thou
distroied for ever / have you throwe^ down cities / is their memorial with the^
ded / as you thoughtest to bring to pass. No verily / for the lord reigns
yet still for ever / his seat of judgment is made ready He shall judge the world
of his rightwysnes / and shall give sentence upon the people eue^ly. The lord
shall be a refuge for the pore oppressed in time of affliction. In the shall
they trust yt know thy name / for you will not forsake the sekers of the lord.
Sing ye to the lord / which dwells in Sion / declare his noble faytes
among the people. For he makes enquera^ce for murder / and forgetteh not the
bloudsheders / he shall not forget the cryyng of the pore afflicte Have mercy
upon me (lord) behold my affliction which I suffer of my haters / lift me up
eue^ from the very thresshold of death. That I might remember all thy praises
within the gates of Sio^ / I shall rejoice of the health which you have brought.
The heythen ar drouned in their own pyt / and their fete ar tied in their own
net which they bet so preuily. Noble is the lord and full wide is his power /
i^ yt the ungodly is thus trapped i^ his own snare / for such is his praise.
Selah. The ungodly shall slide down to hell and al heithen yt forget god. But
the pore forsaken shall not be forgote^ for ever / nether ye good hope of the
aflicte shall always be vayn. Arise lord let not the mortal man p^uayle /
execute judgment upon the hethe^. Lord smite the^ with fear / learn the hethe^
to konw their selves mortal. Selah

The argument into the.x. Psalm.
This psalm. is a prayer against the perverse / malycious / and importune men
oppressynge and undoing the pore afflict with crafty violence / in the which
also their intolerable pride / their ungodliness and both their craft to hurt
and their study are all descrybed.

QUare dn^e reces. Wherefore abydest thou so far (oh lord) wylt you be hyd from
us in time of our afflyction? whiles the ungodly is a lofte he persecuteth the
pore afflycte / let them be snared with their own crafty deceyt which they study
for. For what thing so ever lyketh him yt he prayseth / he bends him self al
to lucre / he cares not whither he speak well or evil of the lord. This
ungodly man looks a loft / he regards not that there is any god neither is he
in his thoughts. What things he take in hand / they prosper a long time to
his mind / thy punyshement is lift up high from him / he thinks to cast
down all his enemies with a blast of his mouth. He thi^keth in his heart I shall
not fall / I shall continue throw out the worlds without hurt. His words
swi^me in perjury / fraud / and deceit / what so ever his tongue says / it is
injury and shrewdnes. He lies bent to catch decayed vyllages / he kylleth the
innocent preuily / his eyes ar fast upon ye pore wretches. He lays pryuy
watches / he lies bent like a lion i^ his de^ne to devour the poor afflicte
/ he distroyeth hi^ whiles he draw him into his net. He makes him self like a
sick weyke man / but the pore afflyct fall away through his strength He thinks
in his heart / god cares not for these me^ / he turns his face from the^ /
and will never se the^. Arise lord (oh god) lift up thy hand / dyspise not thy
pore afflict. For how long shall this ungodly blaspheme god? for he says in
his here that thou see not. But thou see verily / for thou beholdest i^iury
and indignation / and wha^ it shall please ye / thou will declare thy self in
very deed. The poor afflicte commits him self to the / which art wont to
be an helper to the young fatherles. Al to break the strength of the ungodly and
hurtful man / follow upon hi^ / serchyng out his ungodliness and than shall he
nowhere apere. The lord is ki^ge for ever / and these hethen ungodly have
perisshed and are fallen from his earth. The desires of the pore afflyct the
lord has herd / you shall give them aquy^^ mind / and thy ear shall be intent
unto the^. To deliver ye yo^g fatherles and pore oppressed so yt this mortal
mo^stre be no more fered upon therth.

The argument into the.xi. Psalm.
Here David chalengeth these men which made him to avoid and to fle from every
part of the lordshyp of Israhel / having no place to hyde him He does here
also declare his trust in god / and magnifyeth his judgment against both good
and evil. Read the history i^ the first of the kings / from the xxii* Cha.
unto the.xxvii. The title of the ps.

For Dauides vyctory was this Psalm. song.

IN domino confido. I have put my trust in the lord / wherefore tha^ by bid ye
me fle down from your hyl like a bird* For lo / the ungodly have bent their
bow ^ and have set their arowes therein / to smite the perfyte in heart espied i^
preuy places. For there is no place sure to abide i^ / but what (I pray you)
have ye ritwise deserved? The lord is resyde^t in his holy temple / in heaven
is his seat regal / his eyes look forth / he be holds to epsy ye sons of
me^. The lord examyneth ye rightwise / but he hates in his heart ye ungodly /
and the man also yt loves vyole^ce and wrong. He will se^de fire upon the
ungodly like rayn / bre^ning lyghteni^ges / brimsto^ / and hot whirlwindes for
such part shall they drike. For rightwise is the lord / he loves the
rightwyseman and favors the mayntener of the right.

The argument into the.xii. Psalm.
Here David co^playneth of the comen fall in every place of rightwisnes and
faith / and that the ^rafty deceytfull flaterers occupy all places: he prays
the lord to have mercy of the poor af^licte whom they vex / and that he
would help the^ according to his promise.

SAluum me fac. Help lord / for full few faithful ar left among the chyl^re^
of me^. It is but vanite what so ever ^ne speaks to another / they flater
falsely ^hewyng one thing with their mouth / and ^oueryng another in their heart.
The lor^e shall cut these proud spekyng tongues ^ute of these false glauerynge
mouths. Which say thus of tho things which we make / we will challenge
auctorite of our own tongues / our mouths ar the auctorite / who should be our
lord to command us. For the destruction of my pore afflicte / and for the
waylyng of this nedeons now shall I rise (says the lord) he shall say with him
self / I shall bring them into saving health. Now the speches of the lord ar
purespeches they are like silver puryfyed and tried to the vttermoste in erthen
caldrens. Thou lord preserve these pore ones / keep them from this wiked
nation for ever. These ungodly houer about in every place / and where such
belly bestes ar promoted / there encrese the wicked children of men.

The argument into the xiii. Psalm.
Here David set in a Ieoperdous straight / called in his anguisshe to god for
help: left his enemies rejoice of his fall / and that he rather him self
might rejoice of his received health / and so magnifye worthily god his savior.

USquequo. How long lord will thou tarry? will thou forgette me for ever?
how long will thou turn thy face fro me? How long shall I thus co^tynue
musinge with my self / fyllynge my heart full of sorrow day by day? How
long shall mine enemy be thus exalted over me? Behold and answer me lord /
my god / keep me waking / lest the slomber of death come upon me. Ye / lest
peradventure mine enemy may say I prevailed against him / for if I fall my
troublers will rejoice. But I trust in thy mercy / my heart shall be glad of
thy help / I shall give thanks to my lord for he has rewarded me.

The argument in to ye xiiii. and.liii. Ps.
Here David co^playneth all to be full of ungodly and very damnable men: he
descrybeth their natural disposytion which there may no thing be more corrupt
/ fylthy and / violent / and than he shows that ve^geaunce abides the^: and
health abides the innoce^tes whom they trede under their fete.

DIxit insipie^ce. The folyshe wicked men think in their hertes yt god is not.
Shrewde and abominable things do they / nowhere is there one yt will do good
The lord looked from heuens down upon the men / to se if there were any that
had any knowledge or regarded god. And said / is every man and altogyder swarued
so far from the way / perisshed and unprofitable / that there is no man that
will do good / not one? Are they so far besides them selue all these workers
of wykednes? Se / they devour my people as one should ete up bread / they are
holden with no fear of the lord. Wherefore they shall be feared with fear
incomparable: for god has shaken the bones of thy besegers. Thou shalt
dispyse the because god has repelled them / for god is in the just and
rightwyse nation. They scorned the^ because they followed the counsel of the
poor afflicte and put all their trust in the lord. Oh / would god that the
saving health would ones come to Israel from Sion / that the lord would make
an end of the captivity of his people / that Jacob might be glad and
Israhell might rejoice.

The argument into the.xv. Psalm.
In this Psalm is descrybed of what living and with what manners the right
cytezens of heaven and members of Christ's church must be adorned and endued.

DOmine quis ha. Lord who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? Who shall sit in thy
holy hill? Even he that lives in syngle and pure innocence studieth to do
rightwisnes and speaks the truth even from his heart. He that backbyteth not
with his tongue / and in nothing hurts his neighbor / neither suffers him to
be reuyled or hurt unworthily. But abhors such sclanderous and noughtye
persons / and such as worship the lord / he sets much by. Ye / and what
soever he swereth / he will perform / although it be to his great hurt and
hynderaunce. And lends not his money for auantage / nether receives gifts
against any innocent. He that studyeth to do these things / shall abide
always and never be moved.

The argument into the.xvi. Psalm.
In this Psalm. David desires gods help: affermyng that god has no need of
his goods: but that his goods ought to serve his poor neighbors which he
call sai^tes / and they that bestow their goods of any other thing than
profyteth these saints / make Idols with them.

COnserua me domine. Defend me (god) for I have trusted in the: o my soul
say you unto the lord / my goods profyt the nothing at all. I shall therefore
study with all my heart to help thy noble saints / which yet live upon therth
For they which bestow their goods of any other thing / shall make them ydols
/ and folowen fervently strange gods. I shall not offer their blody sacrifyce
/ no I will not know ne remember the names of their idols. The lord is the
portion of my heritage and my substance / my lot is in thy hand. The lottes
fell to me happily in to plesaunt places / a goodly rich heritage chaunsed to
me. I shall thank the lord which has well counseled me: but yet my raynes
teach me these things by night. I set ye lord evermore before mine eyes / for
whiles he is at my right hand / I shall not slide. Wherefore my heart shall joy
and my tongue shall rejoice / ye / my body shall have sure rest. For you will
not so forsake my soul / yt it should go and abide in the grave / neither
will thou there suffer thy saint to go into corruption. Thou shall show me
the path / wherein I may go to life / thy presence fylleth men with all gladness
/ All joy is ever out laid by thy right hand.

The argument into the.xvii. Psalm.
This psalm is a feruente prayer of David to be delivered from the persecution
of Saull / as he did in the.vii. psalm declaring his innoce^cye desyringe
help: he descrybeth the proud behauyour and vain study of his persuers: and
at last he knowledgeth his felycite to stand in the knowledge of god. The
prayer of David.

EXaudi dn^e iusticia^. Lord / here my rightwyse prayer / and take up my
peticyon / give head unto my prayer / which I bid with pure mouth. Let thy
judgment declare my i^nocency / show thy self to have respect unto thy right.
Search my heart / and look into it even in the night try me as metal with
fire / and yet shall thou find that my thought differ not fro my words. I
endeuer my self to auoy^e me^nes ways / according to thy wor^e / and I kept
them in the way that fled unto me. Make fast my steps (I pray ye) in thy
paths / lest my fete slide. Upon y^ I call for you art wont to here me (o god)
lay thyn ear to me and hear me speak. Declare thy excellent mercy / which
art wont to save me / trusting i^ the from the risers against thy right
hand. Keep me even as the aple of thin eye / and hyde me as though I were
under the shadow of thy wings. Hyde me from the violent ungodly / hyde me from
my enemies closing me in to take away my life. Which have their preuy riches
/ and speak proudly with their mouths. Now lay they a wait at our steps /
their eyes have they fastened upon us to epsy if they may at any time cast us
to ye ground. He lies bent like a lion eue^ flat down for his pray to be
devoured / he lurked like ye young lion in his privy de^ne. Arise lord and
prevent him / cast him down / deliver my soul from the ungodly who^ you use
for the sword. Deliver us from these mortal me^ which are thy hand wherwt
thou smitest / even ye mortal me^ addict to this world. Which desyer their
perte in this present life / to have their beles filled with thy treasure / and
their children to have enough / and also to leave to their neuewes. But I armed
with thy ryghtwysnes shall behold thy face and shall be satisfied wha^ I shall
vpwake arisynge in the beauteous symilitude.

The argument in to ye xviii. ps.
This psalm is a noble vyctoriouse song / in the which David first declares
his feruente trust in god. Than he expresses with how grievous yuels he was
oppressed: afterward he shows the power of god / and his will toward him and
that by the description of a great tempeste / he shows his delyueraunce / his
innocence / gods iugementes against all men / his great vyctory of his
enemies / the marvelous increase of his kingdom / his power for ever confyrmed
/ at last concludyng the Psalm. with a praise and prophecye of Christ. Read
thistorye of David in the two first books of kings. The title.

The song of David the servant of the lord which song this praise to the
lord when now ^horow the lord he having the victory escaped the hands of
Saul and of all his ennemies

DIligam te. To thy mercy shall I cleue (lord) which art my strength / The
lord is my rock of stone / my bulwark / my delyuerer / my god / my defender
/ unto whose faithfulness I betake my self / my child / my saving power / my
refuge. I magnifyed and worshypped ye lord / and so was I saved fro my enemies
Dedly anguysshe invaded me / and the soden rysynges like a rosynge flode of
these men of perdicyon assailed me. The straight helly ieopardes closed me i^ /
the snares of death hampred me. But while I was in this strait I called upon ye
lord I cried unto my god / and he hard my voice in his kings hall / my cryeng
came up to his ears. For ye earth was moved and tre^bled / the fete of ye
hills staggard and were smytten all to powder / for he was angry. Smoke
ascended / as ye would say / into his nostrels / and fire deuouringe all
things flewe out of his mouth / and he spouted forth burning coals. He left
the heuens and came down / a derke cloud was under his fete. He rydeth upon a
swyfte foul and flies / borne with the wings of the wind. He made hi^ a
preuye closet / pouring darkness round about his tabernacle / congeli^ge
there unto black waters into thycke clouds. But at his shyninge presence /
these derke clouds vanished away again / with hail stones / and fyry
thunder boltes. The lord thundered in the heuens the most highest sent forth
his voice / with hayle stones and fyry thu^dreboltes. He cast forth his arowes
and threw the^ down / he sent forth much lyghtnynge / and cast them into
great fear Whiles thou thretenest and blamest (oh lord) blowing forth thy
wind / the holowe banks of the floudes ar seen under dry / and the
foundations of the world stand naked. He put down his hand from above and
took me up / he drew me out of much waters. He delivered me from mighty
enemies / and from my haters for they prevailed against me. He prevented me
being in ieoperdye with his help / the lord was my socour. He led me forth
and set me at large / he defended me because he favored me. The lord gave me
after my right dealing / and rewarded me according unto the pureness of my
hands. I observed verily ye ways of the lord and fell not vngodlely fro my
god. For I had all his decrees before mine eyes / and I did not thruste away
his law fro me. I behaved my self purely and perfitly toward him / and took
great head lest I should commit any yuell thing. And ye lord has rewarded my
right dealing / and the pureness of my hands which he aproueth For you art holy
to the holy man / and offrest thy self pure to the pure man. With ye pure
innocent you dealest pure innocently / and with the shrewde man thou playest ye
over whart. Thou have verily saved thy pore oppressed people / and have cast
down men yt look alofte. Thou (lord) have lightened my ca^del / my god has
put away my derkenes with his light. Through the have I broken the hole raye of
the battle / through my god I ouerlept the walls. God is he whose deeds are
pure and parfyte / the words of the lord are purifyed / and tried like as
with fire / he is a buckler to all that trust in him. For who is god but the
lord? who is a defender / but our god? Even the same god which has decked
and endued me with a lordely power and has furthered my way spedely. He has
made my fete as light as the fete of gotes / and has made me to ouerronne
places were they never so high. He has exercysed and accustomed my hands with
battle / and has made me to break bows of stele with my arms. Thou have
defended me with thy saving shylde and bukler / and thy right hand stayed me
/ thy favorable ge^tylnes made me to have the ouerha^de of my enemies. Thou
dydest hedge in my way that I might go frelye therein / so that my heles should
not slide. I followed upon my enemies and took the^ / and never turned until I
had slain them. I slew them / for they might not stand in my hands / they
were throwe^ down under my fete. Thou have taught me to fight / ye / and that
with a puyssaunte power / and as many as rose against me / thou haste thruste
them under me. Thou broughtest it so to pass / that mine enemies were feign to
turn their backs / and I made them away that hated me. They cried / but
there was no man to keep them / they cried to the lord / but he answered them
not. I knocked them together as small as dust laid ready for ye wind / I
trod the^ as small as dyrte of the streates. Thou have delivered me from this
chiding / and contentyouse people / and haste made me ruler over the gentyles
/ the folk of who^ I had little knowledge served me. As soon as they herd of
me / they came to gyther and did homage unto me / the lyenge alyauntes were
made subjects and servants unto me. These aliau^tes were made dry for fear
/ and trembled whiles they were shyt up in strong holds. And yet lives the
lord / my defendour moughte be praised / and god my savior might be exalted.
Even god which has given me power to avenge me of my enemies / and has
subdued the people to me. Which has delivered me from mine enemies / he has
set me over them which rose against me / and has delivered me from the vyolent
man. Wherefore I shall magnifye the (oh lord) with hye praise among the
nations / and shall sing with thanks geuynge unto thy name. Which has made
great health for his king / he has delte gentely with his anointed David / and
also with his seed into everlasting.

The argument into the.xix. psalm.
In this psalm David declares the exellent virtue and power of god /
expressed in the meruelouse creation of this present world above: and than he
shows the preciousnesse of gods law at the last he prays to be preserved
from sin and that what soever he thi^keth or speaks might he plesante and
accept before god.

CEli enarrant. The heuens declare the majesty of god / and the fyrmamente
shows what are his works. One day succedynge another / whetteth contynually
our thoughts / and one night following another / increases our knowledge These
creatures have nether spech nor words / neither is their voices any where
herd. And yet their poyntinge and showing has taught all the world / and
their do^me speech has gone forth i^to all the costs of ye world. He has
fastened in the^ a tabernacle for ye son / this son comes forth of his
clouds like a bridegro^e ye like a fresshe valyant knight to make his course.
From the farthest eest part of the heuyns comes he forth / having his
recourse unto the other extreme / neither is there any man that may hyde hi^
from his heat. The law of the lord is perfyte / refresshynge the soul / the
testymonye of the lord is faithful / ministri^g wisdom to the vnleeued. The
commandments of the lord are right / making glad the heart. The things
which god commands are plain and pure / and lyghte^ the eyes. The fear of
the lord is pure and holy abidynge for ever / the plesures of the lord ar
true and right in every part. More worthy to be desired than gold and
precyouse stones / sweter than the honye comb when it dropeth. And thy servant
is taught and monisshed by the^ / that same observing of them is a great
reward. Who may perceive and consider what thing is sin? purge me from
secret euyls. Also turn thou these great sins from thy servant / lest they
have domination over me / and than shall I be pure and clear from every great
sin. Let ye speches of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be plesaunte
and accept unto the lord my defender and my redemer.

The argument in to the.xx. Psalm.
This Psalm is a prayer in the which the people prays for the health of David
going to an hard and ieopardous bataile: and it is a joyful tha^kynge for his
health and victory given him of god.

The title of the Psalm. The dytie of David committed to the chaunter to be
song.

EXaudiat te dn^s. When thou art in any strayte / than the lord might here
the / the name of the god of Jacob might set the in sauegarde. He might send
the health from his holy place / and from Sion might he stre^gthen the. He
might remember al thy offringes / and thy brent sacrifyces he might accept.
Selah He might give the thy hertes desire / and might stablysshe all thy
intent. We shall rejoice in thy health: in the name of our god lift we up our
baners with triumph / when the lord has given the thy desire And let every
man say / now do I know that the Lord has preserved his anointed. He has
herd him from his secret heavenly place / ye / and that in the saving power
of his right hand. Some trusted in their chariettes / and some in their horse:
but we called upon ye mighty name of the lord which is our god. Now they are
thrust down and all fallen: but we stand and are made fast. The lord
preserved us / he is our king and answerith us when we call upon hi^.

The argument in to.xxi. Psalm.
This Psalm is a victorious song / in the which the people reioyseth with
thanks for the victory and other benefytes of god / with the which he endued
David so excellently. And they praise god through whose goodness he accepted all
things thankefully.

DOmine in virtute. Lord / ye king shall joy in thy power / and shall rejoice
greatly in thy help. Thou have given him the desiers of his heart / and the
prayers of his mouth thou have not turned away. Selah. Thou have prevented him
with all manner of benefytes / you haste set a crown of precious stones upon his
hedde. He asked life of the / and thou gave it him / ye / and that a full
long life. Thy help turned him to great glory / thou have endued him
richely with noble fame and clerenesse. For thou have set him in such estate /
yt he may flow perpetually in all manner of goodness / thy comfortable
presence makes him glad. For this king trusts in ye lord / and he
strengthened with the mercy of the most highest shall not swerve. Thy hand
has overtaken all thy enemies / thy right hand has holden as many as hated
the. Thou have brent them like a bre^nyng furnace / when thy indignation wexed
hot. The lord swalowed the^ up in his wrath / and fire consumed the^. Their
progeny perisshed from therth / and their postirite were worn out among the
men. For they had bent their myschefe upon the / they began cou^seyls which
they might not bring to pass. Thou shall set them before the for a mark /
that with thy bow thou might shote the^ even in their faces. Be thou lift up
lord in thine own power / we shall si^ge with praise / and magnifye thy
strength.

The argument into the.xxij. Psalm.
Here David declares him self plainly to be the very figure of Christ.
wherefore first of al he syngeth and expresses his great deiectyon and down
fall: and anon after his exaltatyon / his increase and purchasing of his
kingdom / even to the uttermost part of the land / and the contynuance
thereof unto the worlds end. The title of the Psalm. It is the song of Dauyd
committed to the over chaunter to be song of the erly heart or of the day
star.

DEus meus deus. My god / my god lo / wherefore forsakest you me? how far is
thy help from my out cryenge? My lord shall I thus cry and call upon the all
day / and yet will thou not here? shall I cry all night and never cease?
Uerily yet art thou that holy on which dwell in Israhell extollynge the
with praise. Our fathers trusted upon the they trusted upon the and thou
deliueredest them. They cried unto the and were delivered / they trusted upon
the and were not shamed. But as for me I am but a worm and no man / even the
very approbry of the men / and am abiecte from the vylest folk. All that se me
made but a laughing stock on me / they mocked me with their lips / and
wagged their heddes at me. Saying / this vyllayne referred all things to the
lord / let him now deliver hi^ if he will / for he loves him well. But yet
thou art he which leddest me out of my mothers womb mine own refuge / even
from my mothers tears. As soon as I came into this world / I was laid in thy
lap / thou art my god even from my mothers womb. Go thou not far fro me /
for my trouble draws nigh / neither is there any man yt will help. There are
beset me round about great sturdy steares / ye / that fat bulls of Bashan
have hedged me in. Like a rori^ge lion pantyng and gapyng for his prya^ / their
mouths ar open upon me naked before them. I sanke away like water / all my
bones shoke out of joint my heart within m^ melted away like wax. The moyster
of my body was dried up / and I was like a po^sherde / my tongue cleued to the
sides of my mouth / thou (...) me to my grave. For even like dogs they came
about me / the chy^^he of noyous men hedged me in / they dygged through my
hands and fete. A man might have told all my bones / and they gasyng upon me
thus petylesse entreated / took their pleasure. They parted my over clothes to
them selue / and for my the other cote they casted dyse. But thou (oh lord) be
not far / o my strength / haste the to come and help me. Deliver my life
from ye death stroke / and my dear soul from the wodnesse of these dogs.
Save me from ye mouths of these lions / and defend my pore symplenesse from
the horns of these vnycorns. I shall sprede thy name among my brethren / in
the mids of the congregation / I shall praise the. I say / ye that fear the
lord / se that ye praise him all ye of the seed of Jacob glorifye him / and
all ye of the progeny of Israhell fere him. For he has not despised nor
abhorred the troublouse afflyctyon of the pore / in no manner of wise turns he
his face from hi^ / but when he cried unto him he herd him. I shall praise the
in ye great congregation / I shall perform my vows before his worshippers. The
meke me^ shall ete and be satisfied / they yt seek the lord shall praise him /
their heart shall live and joy for ever. The dwellers in thextreme parts of
therth shall remember the^ selves and be turned to the lord / and all hethen
nations shall fall down before the. For the kingdom is the lords / and he is
lord over all nations. All the rich men of therth shall ete and do him homage
/ they shall be bowed down before him and disce^de in to their graves / for they
may not prolonge any life to their souls. But their posterite shall serve him
/ and shall be no^bred to ye lord for ever And thus their chylders children shall
show the rightwisnesse / which he has given to ye people / which is yet to be
borne

The argument in to ye xxiii. ps.
In this psalm David declares and sets forth the marvelous surety of the
trust in god and also how blessed a thing it is. The song of Da.

DOminus regit me. The lord is my pastore and feder / wherefore I shall not
want. He made me to feed in a full plentuous batle ground / and did drive and
retche me at layser by the sewte ryuers. He restored my life and led me by
the paths of ryghtwysnes / for his name sake. Ye / if I should go through the
mids of death / yet will I fear non yuel / for thou art with me / thy staff
and thy sheep hoke counfort me. Thou shall sprede and garnyshe me a table / ye
/ and that in the sight of mine enemies thou shalt souple my head with
oyntement / and my full cup shall laugh upon me. Ye / and thy mercy and
gentelnes shall follow me all my life / I shall sit in the house of the lord
a long time.

The argument into the.xxiiij. Psalm.
In this psalm. David syngeth all things to be the lords / how wonderful he
has laid the foundation of the earth under the sea / and yet the earth
appears above it: He asks a questyo^ who shall enter into the kingdom of
god / and answers thereto / co^cludynge all things be they never so stout
and strong to be obedyente to his word / and to be opened at his pleasure
which is the most valyant and gloriouse king. The title of the psalm. The
song of David.

DOmini est terra. The earth is the lords / and all that is contained in it:
the round world and all that inhabyt it. For in the sea has he set his
fou^datio^s / and has builded her above the flodes. Who shall clymbe into the
hill of ye lord or who shall abide in his holy place? An innoce^te in his
deeds / and he that is pure in heart / that has not extolled himself proudly
into vanyte / neither has sworn for any disceyte. This man shall be fed with
the blessing of the lord / and with the mercy of god his savior. This is the
nation given all unto him / and seeks him this is the very right Iacob^ Selah.
Oh ye gates / lift up your selves / ye gates ever lasting be ye opened / and
this gloryouse king shall in enter. Who is this king y^ is so glorious? it is
the mighty valiant lord / Noble in power / a lord exellent in strength to
wage battle. Oh ye gates lift up your selue / ye gates everlasting be ye
opened / and that glorious king shall i^ enter. Who is this king that is so
glorious? it is the lord of hosts it is he y^ is this glorious king. Selah.

The argument in to the.xxv. Psalm.
This Psalm is a prayer of an holy man oppressed with sin and with the hasty
violence of his enemies / wherefore he prays the lord to deliver him from his
sins: to teache him his ways to deliver him from the fury of his enemies /
and that for his mercyes sake / through which he was wont to save such as
trusted in him and not to forsake sinners holden yet with any fear and trust
which both he knowlegeth of him self: and at last he sets to a little
prayer for all the people of god. The title of the psalm, The song of David.

AD te dn^e leuaui. Unto the (oh lord) I lift up my mind: my god I trust in
the / let me not be shamed lest min enemies rejoice upon me. For they shall not
be shamed who so ever depend upon the: but they shall be shamed that wrongfully
hurt innocents. Show me thy ways lord / and wont me to thy paths. Led
me forth for thy faithful truths sake / acquainte me with the / for thou art
god my savior of whom I depend parpetually. Lord remember thy mercy and thy
gracious favor / for in these things thou excellest eue^ from the beginni^g.
But the sins of my youth with my ungodliness also / remember thou not /
remember me according to thy goodness and for thy mercyes sake (oh lord).
Good and rightwyse is the lord / wherefore he will instruct and te^he sinners
the way. He will make the low lions to go in rightly and in due order: and
will teache meke men his way. All the paths of the lord are mercy and
faithfulness / to those men which keep touch and covenant with him. For thy
names sake (oh Lord) forgive me my wickedness / for it is very much. Who
soever that man be that fereth the lord / he shall tech him the chose^ right
way. His mi^de shall enjoy good things / and his posteryte shall possess
the land as right heritage. The lord is a secret sure thing to the^ that
fear him / and them shall he make to know his conuenaunte and promise. My
eyes shall be ever open upon the lord / for he will draw my fete out of the
net. Behold me and have mercy upon me / for I am alone forsaken / full of
afflyction. The sorrowful syghes of my heart increase more and more / led me out
of mine a^guish. Behold my poor state and my heaviness / forgive me all my
si^nes. Consider my enemies / for they are full many ^ and with furiouse
hatered they pursue me. Keep my soul and deliver me lest I be shamed / for I
have put my trust in the. Defend me yt I may live rightly hurtynge no man /
for of the do I depend. Redeem and lose Israhell (oh god) from all his
aduersyties.

The argument into the.xxvi. Psalm.
Here Dauyd declares in to the example of good men / how ernestly (god
approuynge it) he was given to innocence fleing the company of evil men /
gyui^ge great study to godliness: Afterward he declares what vengeance
abides the ungodly: whiles he himself lived faithfully and how that he
desired nothing more tha^ the glory of god to be sprede abroad and known.

IUdica me domine. Be judge for me (Lord) for I am purposed to live innoce^tly
/ and whiles I trust in the lord I shall not waver. Prove me (lord) and search
me / try my reins / and my heart / like as metal with fire. For thy mercy is
ever before mine eyes / I led my life i^ thy faithfulness. I have not delyted
in the company of vain men / neither have I assocyated my self with these
holowe and subtle men. I hate the church of hurtful and noyouse men / neither
have I co^spyred with ye ungodly. I shall endeuer my hands to be pure / void
all disceyte / and thy altar (oh lord) shall I go about. To sing thy praise
and to show forth what soever wounderfull deed thou have done. Lord /
derebeloued is thy house unto me / and the fear of thy beautyfull tabernacle
also. Take not away my soul with the ungodly / neither yet my life with these
blody men. In whose hands deceyt is turned and canuast / and their right hand
is full of brybes. But I live harmless and innocently / redeem me and have
mercy upon me. My fete is fastened in a place well worthy for me / in the
congregatio^s I shall magnifye and praise the lord.

The argument into the.xxvij. Psalm.
David song this psalm bei^ge in some great peril / in the which he
reme^bringe the promise of god / did animate himself strongly against so
present and stormy tempests: promisyng himself vyctorie upon his enemies and
quyet^ life in heavenly meditatio^s / he makes his vow to give thanks: and
thus he confermed with fas^e hope / desires the help of god / prayenge to
teach him his way: and again he excyteth himself to trust strongly in god.
The title. Dauides song.

DOminus illuminatio. The lord is my light and my saving health / of whom tha^
shall I be afraid? The lord is the strong defense of my life / of who^ than
shall I be afraid? Wha^ the noi^ous and harmfull men which were my adversaries
/ fall upon me to devour my flesh: than shall they smite themself against
the rock and fall. Ye / and if they pit^he field and bend their ordinance
against me / yet shall not my heart fear. If battle be bente against me / yet
shall I trust to the promise of god. One peticyo^ asked I of the lord which I
will follow upon that is / I might sytte in the house of the lord all days of
my life. Where I mit behold the beautefull regalty of ye lord and vyset his
holy temple. For he has hyd me / as though I were i^ his tabernacle in time of
persecutyon / he shall hyde me in the preuy place of his tente / and shall
lift me up into a rock. He shall give me the over hand of mine enemies which
have compassed me in / and I shall offer joyful sacrifyces / I shall sing and
play the psalms before ye lord. Lord here my voice / I call upon the / have
mercy upon me and answer me. My heart thought upon the / I sought to se the /
it is the lord that I seek. Turn not thy face from me / suffer not thy
servant to styde in thy wrath / hitherto have thou ben my helper cast me not
now away / neither forsake me / o god my sauyoure. For where my father and my
mother failed me / there the lord gathered me to him. Lord teach me thy way
/ and led me forth in the right path from them that lay awayte for me. Let
them not take their pleasure upon me which are my troublouse enemies / lyynge
witnesses stood to gyther styffe against me. Whose vyolence had grievously
oppressed me / had I not believed to enjoy those things which are good among
the living men. Depend and wait thou upon the lord / be thou strong / it is
he that shall strengthen thy heart / depend upon the Lord.

The argument in to the xxviij. Psalm.
Here Dauyd expresses his prayer / whereby he being in some great peril: as
peradventure in the coniura^yon of Absalon / first desires the help of god:
Furthermore he prays that he him self being innocente / might not be joined
with the harmefull in vengeance taking: than desires he / that worthy
judgment might fall upon these ungodly. After this he remembers a* certain
Hymn / wherein he gives god thanks for his vyctorie and hel^he / and last of
all / he byddeth a prayer for the people.

AD te domine clamabo. Upon the lord do I call / which art my strong defense
dispyse me not / neither forsake thou me unless I be like men let down in
to their graves.

Here my prayer / whiles I cry unto the and lift up my hands unto thy holy
temple. Pluck me not into vengeance with the ungodly / with those which study
for shrewdness / spekyng pesable with their neighbors whiles they norissh
evil in their hertes. Give them as they deserve and after their malycious
study / give the^ after their deeds / acquyte them their deseruynge. For they
regarded not the works and deeds of the lord / he shall therefore destroy
them / and not edyfye them. Praised be the lord / for he has hard the deep
desires of my mi^de. The lord is my strength he is my bukler in him trusted my
heart and I was helped / wherefore my heart reioyseth and I shall magnifye hi^ in
my so^ge. The lord is their strength and a saui^ge power to perserue his
anointed. Save thy people / do good to thy heritage / feed and govern the^ /
and lift them up for evermore.

The argument in to the.xxix. psalm.
This is a praise i^ the which David magnifyeth god for his power and virtue
which he declares by thunder and other heavenly tempests. Also he reioyseth
of his benifycence showed upon his people of Israhell.

AFferte dn^o. Give unto the lord ye that excel in mighty power / give ye
unto the lord honor and the praise of his power. Give the lord worship
worthy his name / honor ye lord in his holy kings halle. The voice of the
lord is in the watery clouds / God / whose majesty is to be feared with
reverence thundreth / the lord is declared upon great waters. The voice of the
lord is passing strong / the voice of the lord is full of majesty. The voice
of ye lord smyteh together ceder trees / the lord breketh together the ceders
of Libany. He makes the mountains of Libany and Hierion to leap together
like calves / they run together like the calves of vnycornes. The voice of
the lord casts and cutteth forth fyrye lyghteninges. The voice of the lord
makes the desert to quake / the lord made even the deserte of Kades to
tremble. The voice of the lord makes hearts and does to groan and to bray /
and uncovers the thick wodes / which all makes for his praise to be said
in his temple The lord rules over the universal flode / the lord there
keeps resydens / a king everlasting. The lord mynistreth strength to his
people / the lord is benefyciall to his people / gyueng them prosperous peace.

The argument in to.xxx. Psalm.
In this psalm Dauyd gives thanks for his health restored / whereupon he
declares with a deep afflycte the goodness of god which se^deth aduersyte to
his chosen for a good end / which is but an hour in respect to the joys
everlasting here he makes protestation that he desires not long life but
only to maynteyne and to encrese tho things which make for gods glory / and
the health of his saints. The title of the Psalm. A song or a dytie song and
played in the dedication of Dauides house.

EXaltabo te domine. I shall exalte the (lord) for thou have axalted me / and
have not made my enemies to rejoice upon me. Oh lord my god / I have called
upon the / and thou have healed me. Lord / thou haste led my soul forth of my
grave / thou have restored my life lest I should have gone down into the pit
Ye saints of the lord sing unto him a praise / and se that ye sprede his
holy memorial. For it is but a moment that his wrath endures / but long is
the life y^ comes of his benevolence. Weeping and waylynge comes in at the
even tide but anon after / gladness arises with the morning. When all things
were prosperous about me / I thought with my selue that I should never slide.
Lord of thy good will / thou stablysshedest my kingdom like an hill / for as soon as you had turned away thy face / I was asto^ned and troubled. The
lord called I upon / to ye lord did I make my prayer. I said with my self /
what profyteth my life if I be put now in to my grave? shall the duste of my
carcass magnifye y^ / or yet declare thy faythfulnes. Here lord and have
mercy upon me: lord / be thou my help. Thou haste turned my mourning in to
joy / thou have shaken me out of my mourning sack / and clothed me with
gladness. Wherefore my tongue shall sing thy praise / and shall not cease (lord
my god) I shall magnifye the with praise into everlasting.

The argument in to the.xxxi. Psalm.
In this Psalm David shows by what things he stablysshed his hope / what he
desired / of what things he complained / and in what state he was / and mind
when he was compassed in of Saules host in the deserte of Maon / wha^ he for
anguysh of mind he sought flyghtes / but al in vain. After this he moves us
to consider the meruaylous goodness of god against every man that feared him /
and exhorts to seek the knowledge of god which may not forsake any that
depend upon him.

IN te domine sperau^. In the (Oh lord) hau^ I trusted / let me never be
shamed / for thy ryghtwysenes sake deliver me.

Bow down thine ear unto (...) speed y^ to deliver me / be you my stonye rock
where upon I might sit fast / be thou my strong defe^ced castle wherein you
may p^serue me. For thou art my rock and my bulwark / wherefore led thou me
forth for thy names sake / and take the charge of me. Led me forth of the
net^e which they have set so pryuely for me / for thou art my strength. I
betake my spirit into thy hands / for you shall redeem me (lord my god) which
kepest true promise at al times I hated these vain witches observing
inchauntementes / for I cleued and trusted to the lord. I shall joy and
rejoice upon thy mercy / for thou have looked upon my affliction / and have
known my soul being in anguisshe. Neither have thou shyt me up in the hands
of my enemies / but have set my fete at large. Have mercy upon me / for
anguisshe and tribulation are come upon me / my face / soul / and body / ar
wasted away for anger. My life is broken sore with sykenesse and my years with
sorrowful sighs / my strength is wasted for sorrow of mi^de / beholding
things amysse / and my bones were consumed I was reuyled of all my aduersares /
and chefly of mine own neighbors / mine own famyliare acquayntance /
abhorred and feared me / and they that se me anon renew forth at doors fro me.

I fell from their hertes / clean forgoten as one that had been ded / I was
as a thing all for lorne. For I herd great offenses put upon me / ye / and
that of many men / fere closed me about when they took their counsel togider
against me / for they cou^selled craftily to take away my life. But I trusted
in the (O lord) I said that thou art my god. The time of my age is in thy
hand / deliver me from the hand of mine enemies / even from the^ which
persecute me. Let thy presens shine upon thy servant / save me for thy
mercyes sake. Lord suffer me not to be shamed for I have called upon the / let
the ungodly be shamed and be nombred with the^ that cease i^ their graves. Let
their liynge mouths be made domme / which speak proud things arrogantly with
dyspite against the rightwysma^. Oh / how bounteous are tho good things which
thou have laid up in store for thy worshyppers? ye / the which thou have done
all ready to them which / commytte them selves to thy faithful promise / ye /
and that before all mortal men. Thou kepest them from the stomblyng stocks of
these proud men / and hydest them privily before the / thou hydest them in thy
tabernacle from their sclaunderous tongues Praised be ye lord / for he has
wrought his excelle^te mercy meruelously with me ye / and that in a city well
defenced. I when I fled so hastily thought sayynge / I am cast out of thy sight
/ but yet for all this thou herdest my desire when I tried unto the. Love ye
the lord as many as are his saints / the lord defends and keeps his
faithful / and rewards these proud doers plentuously. Be ye strong and he
shall stablysshe your hertes / as many as depend and trust upon the lord.

The argument into the.xxxij. Psalm.
In this Psalm David declares all punysheme^t to come for sin. wherefore he
affirms that man to be happy whose sins ar forgiven also that the defense
of god comes through pure confessing of our sins unto him and instant
prayer / than techeth he how men should know the iugementes of god which
deals punyshemente to the ungodly and good things to the good men / whereof
the good men may greatly rejoice in god. The title of the Psalm. An instruction
or a lesson of David.

BEati quorum. Blessed is he whose ungodliness is forgyuen / and whose sins
are covered. Blessed is that man to whom the lord rekeneth not his sin /
neither is there in his spirit any dissembling deceyte. Whiles now I held
my pease daily musing with my self / and other whiles cried out / my bones
wasted for sorrow. For day and night thy hand pressed me down / my moyster
was dried up / like as one tosted in the mids of somer. Selah. I shall
knowledge my sin and shall not hyde my wykednes. I thought saying with my
self I shall confess my ungodliness which is against me to the lord / and
thou eue^ straight forgauest me my wickedness which opens her self by my
outward sin. Selah. For the which / even every saint shall pray unto the
in time of besechynge / and than if afflyction come upon him like a great
swellynge floude / yet shall it not touch him. Thou art my defender from
tribulation / thou shall keep me / and shalt make me glad excedyngly for my
delyueraunce. Selah. I shall instruct the / and teache the / the way wherein
thou may go / I shall counsel the / and se for the right well. Se that ye be
not as horse or mule which ar unreasonable / whose chawes must be refrayned
with bit and bridle / lest they strive against the. Many sorrows fall upon the
ungodly / but him that trusts in the lord / mercy closes round about. Be
glad therefore in the lord / and rejoice ye rightwyse / make ye merry all
faithful and upright in heart.

The argument in to the.xxxiij. Psalm.
This is a very praise / worthy much to be noted and red / in the which first
he exhorts us to magnifye god: than he shows all things to be replenisshed
with his goodness / making mentyon of his meruelouse creation and governance
of this world. And at last he syngeth one god to have made and to give all
things / and to be ever merciful present with his beloved.

EXultate iusti. Be glad ye rightwise for the lords sake / for praise becomes
just men. Magnifye ye the lord in praise with harp and lute / sing ye unto
him with ten stringed instruments. Sing ye unto him a new ditie / tune it
swetely with joyful melody. What soever the lord has institute / it is right /
all his deeds proceed of faythfulnes. He loves to do all things ryghtwysly
and in due order / therth swymmeth in the mercy of the lord. By the
commandment of the lord / heuens were made / and all their ornourment at his
bidding. He gathered together and included the waters of the sea / as ye would
say / into a bottell / and laid up their depnesses like treasure. Let all
regyons therefore fear the lord / let all ye inhabyt the round world dread
him. For it is he / which so sone as he had spoke the word / all things were
present / every thing stands perfyte / even as he commanded. The lord
scatereth the counseyls of the heythen / and makes vain the thoughts of the
people. But the counsel of the lord stands for ever / the thoughts of his
heart endure through all worlds. Happy is that natyon which has the lord for
their god / even the people whom he chooses to him self in ye place of his
possessed heritage. From heuens the lord looks down / and beholds narrowly
all men. From his sure seat / beholds he all the inhabytours of ye earth. He
made also the hertes of all men / he understands what soever they have done.
A king is not saved because he has a great host / neither the valyaunte
captain escapes perils through his own puissaunte power. That horse shall
deceive the / by whom thou lokest to be saved / he shall not deliver y^ be he
never so strong. But behold it is the lords eye that is upon the^ which
fear him / and depend upon his mercy. That he might deliver their souls from
death / and nourysshe the^ in time of hunger. Our souls might trust in the
lord / he is our help / and i^ stead of a buckler. In hi^ shall our heart
joy / for we trust in his holy name. Thy mercy lyghte^ upon us / oh lord /
even as we depe^de and trust upon the.

The argument into the.xxxiiii. Psalm.
In this psalm Dauyd was moved of that same synguler benefyte / by the which
god meruelously preserved him wha^ he was known of Aches king of Palestine
(whose kings were called always Abimelec) where he was in ieoperdy of his
life: prayseth excedyngly the cure and goodness of god against his beloved.
Exhorti^g every man to the dilygent study of i^nocency and gods worship /
with the which who so ever are endued / they must needs be delyuerd from all
trouble / and bond in all manner of goodness. The title of the psalm. The
song of David after he had feigned himself mad before Abimelec / there
changynge his mouth and his wit whom when he had put out of his house /
he went his way. Read the history in the first of the kings the.xxi.
Chapter.

BEnedicam dn^m. I shall praise and magnifye ye lord at all times / his praise
shall be in my mouth contynually. In the Lord my soul shall glory / the meke
sprited shall here and be glad. Magnifye ye the Lord with me / and let us
extolle his name all to gyther. Busely sought I the lord / and he answered me
/ he delyuerd me from all things that I feared. Men shall look unto hi^ / and
shall make have / and their faces shall not be shamed. This poor afflycte
person / as soon as he called upon him / the lord herd / and he preserved
him from all strayt anguyssh. Even the angels pytch tents round about them
that fear the lord / and deliver them. Taste / and behold how good is the
lord / happy is that man that trusts in him. Worship ye the lord which
are his saints / for his worshyppers shall never want. Strong lions shall
fainte and famisshe for hunger / when no good thing shall fail ye dilygent
sekers of the lord. Have done children and here me / for I shall instruct you
unto gods worship. Who soever thou art which desire to live / and love
long life: to delight in goodness. Keep thy tongue from evil report and thy
mouth from disceytfull speech. Se thou do no man wrong / but bend thy self
to goodness / seek studyously and follow upon peace. The eyes of the lord are
fastened upon the rigktwyse / his ears lysten unto their cryenge.

But the gri^me cou^tinance of the lord is set upon these that do wrong /
even to cut out their memorial from therth. But those men cry and the lord
hereth / and he delyuereth them out of every strainte. Full nyghe is the lord
men broken in heart / he saves the contryte in spirit. Although full many
yuels fall upon the rightwyse / yet the lord delyuereth them from the^ all. He
keeps all their bones so that not one of them be broken. But every trouble
shall make an end of the ungodly / and the haters of the rightwyse shall be
shaken away. The lord shall loose and redeem the life of his servants /
neither shall they be distroied whosoever commit their selves to his faithful
cure.

The argument in to the.xxxv. Psalm.
In this psalm David standing fast in his innocency / lokyng surely for
vengeance to be taken upon Saul and his flaterers / abiding for gods help /
desires the punisshmente of Saul with his flaterers / and health for
himself: but these two things desires he natte: but for the good will of god
for his glory and praise.

IUdica dn^e nocen. Lord set against my adversaries / smite down them that
fight against me. Take anon unto the / shield and buckler / and rise up spedely
to help me. Set out thy spear / and come forth to mete my persuers / close
them in and say thou unto my foul / I am thy health Let them be confounded with
shame and ignominy / that seek my soul / let the^ be constrained to turn
their backs / let them bear opprobry yt think me any yuel. Let the^ be like
dust before the wind / and the angels of the lord shaking them to naught.
Let their ways be beset with derknesses and slybery / and thangell of the
lord persuyng the^. For they have prepared their pytfall and their net for
me without cause / without cause also have they reuyled and slaundred my soul.
Let his unjust vexatyon fall upon his own neck unawares / let him be hampred
in his own net which he has hyd / let him fall into his own mischef. But
my soul might joy in the lord / and be glad of his help. All my inward
parts shall say / lord / who is like the? which delyuerest the weak afflict
from his stronger / and the sely vexed from the thief. There arose vyolent
witnesses / and asked me things which I never thought. They aequyted me evil
for good / leui^g my soul all alone without any help. I my self (whiles they
were blame worthy) clothed me with sack) and scourged my soul with fasting /
and gave my self hole to prayer for them. I behaved my self to them / as
though every one of the^ had been my neighbor and mine own brother / I went
bente unto ye ground mourni^ge al i^ black / as one yt had buried his mother.
But they (whiles I thus febled my self) reioysed / and were gathered to gyther
/ there came with them the most vylest abiectes to scorn me / whom I looked
nothing / for they rent my fame / and ceased not. Flaterynge parasytes all
thing derydi^g / gnasted upon me with their tethes. Lord how long wylt thou se
me thus entreted? restore my soul / from these perilous and sedicious men /
deliver my life from these lions. I shall magnifye the with praise in the great
congregation / among the mighty people shall I praise the. Let not my false
enemies rejoice upon me / let not my haters wi^ke of each other in to my deceyt
without any cause. For they speak nothing peasably / and against ye meke
sprited of therth they paint their colored deceytes. They writhed their
mouths against me / saying / fie / fie upon hi^ / our eyes have seen the
thing for which we longed. Ye / thou have seen (lord) cease thou / lord /
no longer / be not far absent. Arise / awake / for my defense in judgment /
to affirm my cause / my god and my lord. Give sentence with me for thy
ryghtwysnes sake / lord / my god / lest they rejoice upon me. Let them not
say among their selves fie upon him / we have our pleasure / let the^ not say
we have devoured and conuicte him. Let them be shamed and also confounded
together / that thus rejoice upon my trouble / let the^ be clothed with shame and
ignominye yt thus swell against me. Let the^ be glad and rejoice ye favor my
ryghtwisnes / and make the^ to say / ye lord might ever be magnifyed / whom it
has thus plesed to set his servant at rest. And my tongue also shall speak of
thy rightwisnes / daily showing forth thy praise.

The argument in to the.xxxvi. Psalm.
In this psalm. David co^sidereth meruelously the ple^tuouse goodness of god
poured out i^to all things of the which consyderation the more he rests the
more he merueleth of the frowardnes of the ungodly which although it be neu^ so
great yet god shitteth not his goodness from the^ / also he syngeth how that the
chosen perceive his goodness by a more blessed and especial way tha^ any other.
The title. The song of Da. the lords servant.

DIxit iniustus. The ungodliness of the sinful man persuadeth me in my heart /
yt there is in him no fear of god. For he stands i^ his own conceyte /
whiles his worthy iniquite grows i^to his extreme hatred. What soever he
speaks it is wyckednes and deceyte / he refuses to be taught because he would
not do well. As he lies in his bed he studieth and inuenteth myschefe /
whereupon he set him self in to a way not good / and escheweth nothing
that yuell is.

Oh lord / eue^ up unto the heue^s strecheth thy goodness / ye / and up to the
clouds recheth thy faithfulness. Thy ryghtwisenesse is higher than the
highest hills / thy iugementes ar full deep and boto^les lord / thou sauest
man and be.

How excedyng / clear and noble (oh god) is thy mercy / how p^cious also are
they which commit the^ to thy faithful cure / as unto the shadow of thy
wings.

They shall be satisfied with the ple^tuous treasure of thy house / and thou
shalt give the^ drink of thy delycious and plesa^t flodes For with the is the
very well of life / and we endued with thy light / shall se at the last the
very light. Stretch thy mercy to them that know the / and thy rightwisenesse
to the upright in heart.

Let not the prounde men fall upon me / neither let the ungodly move me.
There shall fall the workers of iniquite they shall be cast out / and may nowher
abide

The argument in to the.xxxvii. Ps.
Let not the prosperity of yuell men move the good (says David here) and that
all things shall well hapen to the fearers of god / and to them that live of
rightwisnes / and that these shall be blessed in time to come wha^ the ungodly
(how so ever they appear to florysshe here for a time) shall be cut away and
utterly destroyed.

NOli emulari. Frete not thy self with these cursed harmfull me^ / neither
envy angrely these workers of wickedness For even like grass anon shall they be
cut down / and like the grene fresshe ben^e of the flower shall they wyther
away. But cleue thou to the lord and study to do good / and thou shall
inhabit the land / led thy life in good faithfulness. Thou shalt delight in
the lord / for it is he that shall give the what so ever thy heart desires.
What so ever thing thou take in hand commit the fortheraunce thereof to
the lord / trust in him and he shall bring all things to good pass. He
shall led forth openly thy ryghtwysnes even like the light / and thy right
living shall he make to shine like the myddaye. Suffer / be still / and let
the lord work / abide his pleasure / be not angry with hi^ that prosper in
his way / which is the man that is given to deceyte. Refrain thy self from
wrath let thy anger be blown over / be not moved to revenge. For who so ever
ar harmefull and cursed shall be cut away / but they that abide the lords
pleasure shall inherit the land. It shall not be long but the ungodly shall be
clean gone / thou shall consider his place / but he shall no where apere. Meke
sprited with pacie^t suffrers shall inherit the land / and they shall have
pleasure with much prosperyte. And for this cause the ungodly shall have
indignation at the rightwyse / and shall grynne upon him with his tethe. But
the lord shall laugh him to scorn because he seith his day of judgment at ye
hand. The ungodly shall draw out their swerdes / they shall bend their bows
to smite down the poor careful afflycte / and to sley the right treders in
the way. But their swerdes shall smite through their own hertes / and their
bows shall be broken. That little is better which the rightwyse man has / than
the many fold riches of the gloriouse ungodly. For the strength of the ungodly
shall be broken: but the lord susteyneth the rightwise. The lord approves
the days of the parfyte faithful / and their heritage shall be parpetuall. In
time of aduersyte they shall not be shamed / in time of hunger they shall be
well satisfied.

When the ungodly shall perissh / and the enemies of ye lord being in fat
pasture at their highest / than shall they vanisshe away like smoke. The
ungodly shall borowe and blow to gyther other men's goods and never repay /
but the rightwise shall do mercy and give forth gracyously. And they that do
good to the rightwise shall inheryt the land / and they that do evil shall be
cut away. For of the lord the steps of this man are dyrected / and he
favors all thenges that he take in hand. When he shall fall he shall not be
hurt / for the lord puts under his hand. Uerily I have been young and old
/ and yet saw I never the ryghtwyse forsaken / or his seed beggynge their
breed. But daily he does mercy and lends / and his seed is in a blessed
increase. Eschew evil and do good / and thou shalt abide for ever. For ye
lord loves that yt is done rightly and in good order / neither forsakes her
his saints / but they shall be laid up for ever / when the seed of the ungodly
shall be cut of. The rightwyse shall inheryt the land / and shall dwell upon it
for ever. Wysedo^e shall ever be in ye mouth of the rightwyse / and his tongue
shall be occupied i^ that which god iugeth good. The law of his god is in his
heart / the steps of his fete they shall not slide. The ungodly beholds the
rightwyse / and seeks occasyon to sleye him. But the Lord will natte leave
him to his hand / neither shall he repute him ungodly / all though he be so
judged of the wicked. Abide the lord and observe his way / and he shall
exalte the to his heritage / when thou shall se the destruction of the ungodly.
I se this sturdy and fearful ungodly rotyng and dilatynge himself / like a
tree never removed from his natural first soil / freshly spredyng his
branches. And anon he vanisshed away / and lo / he nowhere apered / I sought
him but he was not found. Take good head upon the innocent / and mark well
him that seeks the right / for such a man at the last shall enjoy that
pleasant rest. But these sinful me^ shall be distroied all to gider / at ye last
the ungodly shall be cut a way. Health shall come unto the rightwise men from the
lord / he is their strength in time of tribulation. The lord for a surety
will help them / and will deliver them from the ungodly / and he will save
them because they have trusted in him.

The argument in to the xxxviij. Psalm.
David here cast into a grievous disease desires god to take of his hand /
although he be worthy to suffer it / he complayneth here meruelously of the
intolerable pain / of the forsaking of his friends and of the cruelty of his
aduersares and at last desires gods help / to who^ he betake him self. The
title of the Psalm. The song of David for his remembrance.

DOmine ne. Banishe me not (lord) of indignacion / neither chasten me in thy
wrath. For thy arowes ar sore smytten into me / and the disease which thou
haste cast upon me / presses me down sore. There is no health i^ my flesh
for thy wrath / there is no rest in my bones for my sins. For my sins have
pressed down my head like an heavy burden / they are heuyer than I may bear.
My old preuy sores festered wtin and now ar they broken forth / for mine own
folysshenes. I am depressed and sore broken / I walk in co^tynuall mournyng.
For a foul botche occupies all my thyghes / so that there is no health in my
flesh. I am feeble / and sore broken / I gnasted with my tethe for sorrow of my
heart. Lord all my desires ar before y^ and my sorowfully syghes are not
unknown unto the. My heart tre^bleth and pa^teth for sorrow / my strength
fails me and even ye very sight of mine eyes cease from their office. My
friends and my fellows stood against my wound / and my nyghe kynnesfolke stood
all a far. In the mean season they that sought my soul made snares for me /
and they that hunted for my fault spoke deceyt / whisperynge to deceive me
contynually. But I / as it had been one deffe / herd nothing at all / and as a
domme man opened not ones my mouth. I was as one that herd not / and as one
that had not a word in his mouth to answer for him self For the / lord /
do I abide / thou shall answer for me / lord my god. For I said with my self
/ these men parauenture will rejoice upon me / and as soon as my foot begi^ne
to slide / they shall run upon me. For I am but an halting creple / ready ever
to fall / my sorrow never goes fro me. For I confess my ungodliness / I sorrow
for my sins. But in the mean season my enemies live and wexe strong / even
they which pursue me falsely are increased in power. Which acquit me evil for
good and ar against me / because I sought studyously to profyt them. Forsake me
not / lord / be not far fro me / my god. Speed y^ to helhe me / lord / my
saving health.

The argument in to the.xxxix. Psalm.
Here David not withsta^dynge he was vexed with full bitter and grievous
diseases / yet he refrayned his tongue / l^st in complaynyng he might have
spoken some inconvenient words / namely his adversaries hearing him / but to
god he co^playned of those things which he / suffered and of the shortness of
al his life / and desired of god delyueraunce of his disease which he
knowleged to have suffered for his sin and that worthily. The title of the
Psalm. The song of David committed unto Ieduthun the chief cha^ter among the
si^gers of a certain order / i^ their quere

DIxit custodiam. I thought with my self saying / I shall so keep my self that I
will not offend with my tongue. But that I would be moseld for spekyng my
adversary being present. By the reason of long silence I was made so domme /
that I might not speak of any thing were it never so good / but i^ ye mean
season my sorrow freted / me inwardly. My heart brent within me like fire /
whiles I mused with my self / breaking to no man my mind. But at last I losed
my tongue / and I brake forth in to these words. Sewe me / lord I beseech the /
what mine end shall be or what shall be the measure of my life / let me know
/ I beseech the / how short is my time. Lo / as for my days they are but an
ha^dfull / ye / they are nothing to the / what said I? ye every man / stand
he never so fast is but vanite and naught. Selah. What is he? ye / every man
walks like a shadow / it is but vanite and nothing what so ever mortal me^
enforse. They heap together riches / but they know not for whom they gather
the^. And now / my lord / wherefore do I tarry? in y^ verily my hope is laid
up. Wherefore deliver thou me from all my sin / and set me not forth for a
laughyng stoke before ye wiked man. I held my pease / and opened not ones my
mouth / for thou made me thus to do. Take away therefore thy plage / for thy
strong hand has almost made an end of me. Surely whiles thou in chastening
any man for his sin / do but chyde him only / anon thou consumest him. So
that what so ever thing is pleasant in him / anon it perissheth / as a might
eten cloth / what said I? verily every man is but vanyte and nothing worth.
Selah. Lord / here my prayer / give ear unto my cryenge / cease not whiles I
weep / for I given unto the / am here but away faryng stranger / as were all my
fathers. Spare me that I might brethe a little before I cease and go out of
this world.

The argument in to the.xl. Psalm.
In this psalm David glories of his delyuerance through the help of god from
a great peril: he merueleth of the infynite mercy of god toward them that
fear him / for which thing (seeing that he desires no sacrifyce: but even man
himself) he yeldeth himself to him / magnifie^g hi^ rightwysnesse and mercy:
he touches that his sins were cause of his peril: and at the last he
prays god to cast down his enemies / and to make glad good men with his
gentilnes.

EXpecta^s expectaui. Whiles I abode / I tarried for the lord / and he bowed
down his ear to me and herd my crienge. He led me out of the tough cley and
muddy pit / the water arisyng round about me / he set my fete upon the stone
/ and gave quycke speed to my steps. And he put in to my mouth a new so^ge
to praise therewith our god.

Which thing many perceive to be worship to the lord / began also like wise
to trust in him. Blessed is that man that sets the lord before him for his
hope / and has no respect to the proud men ^leuynge to vain lies (the truth
forsaken) Many things have thou done (lord my god) thy noble deeds and deep
counsels as concerning us / no man may comprehend / no man may show ne
express them / neither may they be nombred. Thou delytedest neither in
sacrifyce nor in oblation / but have opened my right ears to here the /
neither burnt sacrifyce / nor yet any slain be have thou desired. And than
I said / lo / I myself am here present / of me it is written in the books of
the law. It has lyked me well to do thy will / my god / thy law is set fast
with in me in my very heart. I shall preach thy rightwysnes in the full
congregation lo / I have not holden my mouth as thou (lord) well know In no
manner wise have I hid thy rightwisnesse within me / but thy faithfulness and
thy saving will have I sprede. I have not cessed to show forth thy mercy and
thy truth / in the full congregation. Neither thou / lord / also have holde^
thy gratyouse mercyes fro me thy gentle favor and thy troth preserve me
perpetually. For I was overwhelmed with innumerable troubles / my sins
combred me so / that I might not se the^ all / they were far mo tha^ the
heeres of my heed / for the which thing my heart failed me. Let it please the
/ lord / to deliver me / lord haste the to help me. Let them be confounded
that lay awayt for my life to quench it / let the^ be borne bacwarde with open
shame and ignominye as many as study to do me harm. Let them be destroyed
because they have been about to shame me / even they which said by me fyghe /
fyghe / upon me. But let them rejoice in the / who so ever seek the and loves
the health which thou bring / let these men have ever in their mouth /
magnified and extolled be the lord. I was in adflyction and pouertye / but the
lord looked to me / thou art my help and my delyuerer / my god / you shalt
not tarry.

The argument in to the.xli. Psalm.
In this psalm David reme^breth a certain disease in himself / in which when
he labored / his enemies reioysed greatly / thinking him to be outquenched
through the pain of his disease his friends forsook him: but god help him /
and evermore helps: whereof he affermeth / that man to be happy / which
knows the displeasure of god toward him.

BEatus qi intelligit. Blessed is that man which understands the very thing
/ as concerning the sick man in time of aduersyte / ye lord shall deliver
hi^. The lord shall keep him / he shall restore him to health / he shall enjoy
prosperouse things upon the earth / for thou shalt not leave him to his
enemies pleasures. The lord shall stre^gthen him lyenge upon his sick beed /
thou shalt so bring it to pass yt he shall change all his bed. I verily said
/ lord / have mercy upon me heal my soul / for I am a si^ner against the.
My enemies spoke evil upon me saying / when shall he ones dye / and when
shall his name perisshe? Wha^ any of the^ came in to see me / he spoke vain
lies / he gathered mischef to himself in his heart and he going forth blowed it
abroad. Also / all my haters whyspred together against me / and thought evil
upon me. Saying some greuouse sin has occupied this man / and this man thus
lyenge so sick shall neuermore rise. Ye my friend in whom I trusted / whom I
received to my table supplanted me. But lord / have mercy upon me / and
restore me / and I shall reward these men. In this thing I knew yt thou
fauorest me / that my enemy rejoice the not upon me. And in that I am hole /
thou shalt ones sustain me / and set me before the for ever. Praised be the
lord god of Israhell from world to world. Amen ame^.

The argument in to the.xlij. Psalm.
In this psalm. it is declared / how that through the coniuratyon of Absalon /
David was holden from the holy congregation and feste of the lord: and how he
being dysquieted with the sinful report of the ungodly (which spoke evil of
his godly worship / whereunto he was given) sorowed: showing his mind with an
earnest co^playnte before the lord. The title of the. Ps. In instruction or
lesson showed to the children of Chore / and committed of Dauyd to the chief
chaunter to be song in the temple.

QUe^admodu^ desi. Even as the chased heart thirsts / gapynge for the fressh
water / so do my soul thirst and gape for god. My soul thirsts for god / ye
/ for the lyuinge god / when shall I ones come to se ye face of god? I lycked
in my tears instead of meat / day and night / whiles it was said unto me
daily / where is thy god? All the heaviness of my mi^de I powered forth / as soon as I remembered that I should led unto the house of god such a joyful
multitude / praysynge and halowynge the fest day. Wherefore than art thou so
deiecte and so heuye / my soul / trust in god / for yet shall I magnifye hi^ /
for the saving help which he gives me of his favor. My god / my soul is
deiecte in my selue / because I remembered the in the land beyende Iordane / in
the hills of Hermon / and at the little hill of Myzaar. One greuouse sorrow
bri^geth in another / for thy water courses soundynge so ferfully / all thy
flodes and storms fell upon me. By day / lord / thou gave me to enjoy thy
mercy / and by night thou made me to sing and to pray to the lyuinge god. I
said to god / thou art my rock of stone / wherefore for gettest me? wherefore go
I mourninge so sorowfully my adversary oppressynge me?

Even my very bones are cut in sonder whiles they cast in to my teth this
greuouse opprobry / saying daily / where is thy god? Wherefore art thou so
sorowfully deiecte / my soul / and so sore troubled in me? trust in god / for
yet shall I magnifye him for his help / wherewith he shall make glad my face /
and declare himself to be my god.

The argument into the.xliij. Psalm.
Here it is desired / that Absalon might be delivered from the company of the
coniurers that David might more quyetly and worthily speak the praise of god in
the holy congregatyon.

IUdica me deus. Give sentence for me (god) defend my cause from the ungodly
folk / from the deceytfull and wicked man deliver me. For thou art my god
and my strength / wherefore have thou put me away / wherefore go I thus mourning
/ my enemy oppressynge me? Make thy light and thy faithfulness to shine upon me
/ let these things led me unto thy holy hill / and let them led me unto thy
tabernacles. That I might ones come to the altar of god / even the god of
gladness and the author of my joy / to praise and magnify the with harp / god
/ my god. Wherefore art thou deiecte / my soul / and thus troubled in me? trust
in god / for yet will I magnifye him / for the help wherewith he has made
glad my face / and showed himself to be my god.

The argument into the.xliiij Psalm.
In this Psalm. it is complained of the cruel punisshme^t which Israel suffered
for the name of god and for their true worship / and that (this
natwithsta^ding / yet god would not be with them in present miracles as he was
wo^te to be with their fathers. The title is all one with the.xlii. Ps.

DEus auribus. Oh god / we have herd with our ears / our fathers also told
us what heavenly works thou have done in their time before our days. Thou
did cast out with thy hand the gentyls from their seattes / and plantedest
our fathers i^ their place / thou dydest scurge that people and made our
fathers to increase. For they challenged not nor possessed that land by sword
/ neither their own power saved them / but it was thy right hand / through
thy power and favor because thou louedest them. Thou thy self / oh god / art
my governor / which gyuest health unto Jacob. Through the did we drive out our
enemies / we armed with thy name / trod them down which rose against us.
For I neither trusted to mi bow / nether yet my swerd saved me. But it was thou
that kepest us from our enemies / and thou shamedest and confou^dest our
hateful persuers. We loved god daily / and magnified thy name with perpetual
praise. Selah But yet now you have repelled us / and haste shamed us / neither
will thou go forth with our host together with us in battle. Thou made us to
turn our backs to our adversaries / and they which odyously persued us /
took their proye upon us. Thou gave us in to their mouths like a flock of
sheep / thou scatredest us among the gentyls. Thou soldest thy people for naught
/ so that in this change there arose no a va^tage. Thou settedest us up to be
a reuilyng stock to our neybours / to be scorned and shamed of the^ that dwelt
about us. Thou settedest us up for aiestynge stock to the heythen / we were a
common jest among them / so that who so ever se us / wagged their heddes at
us. All ways is mine ignominy before mine eyes / and even very shame made me
to cover my face. Ye / and that for the reuylers / and chyders / and for my
adversaries so gredy upon vengeance.

All this fell upon us / natwithsta^dinge yet do we not forgette the / neither
are we unfaithful unto the in couenaunte. Our heart fled not bacwarde / neither
out steps swarued from thy paths. Thou haste dampened us in to the place of
dragons / and have overwhelmed us with the shadow of death. If we had forgotten
our god / and had stretched out our hands unto any strange god. Would not God
/ think ye / have espied it? for as much as he knows even the very secrets
of the heart? For thy sake ar we slain daily / we are reputed as slaughter
sheep. Awake / wherefore slepest (oh lord) arise up / wherefore forsakest us for
ever? Wherefore hydest thy face / having no respect to our afflyctyon and
oppressyon? Our soul is depressed to the ground / our belly cleueth to ye
earth. Arise and help us / redeem and lose us for thy m^cies sake.

The argument in to the.xlv. Psalm.
In this psalm the sons of Chore praise king Solomon for his worthy beauty
/ for the grace of his eloquence for his strength / power / clerenesse / and
lyberalyte / both in him self and in his queen: and at last for his lucky
issue. In all these things they fygured Christ and his church / and both the
power and felycitie of his kingdom. The title. A lovely song full of lernyng
made of the sons of Chore / to be song of Solomon.

ERuctauit cor meum. My heart thinks and rests of a good thing / my song

Thou art ye most beautyfull of all mortal men / having a marvelous grace in
thy tongue / because that god has endewed the with perpetual benefytes. Oh
most valyant knight / gyrde thy sword upon thy side / by the which y^ may
declare thy glorious beauty.

Enter thou in happily with clear worship / for that you excellest in
faythfulnes / mekenes / and rightwysnes / with these things shall thou be
endued / that thou maiste do noble acts with thy merueylous power. Thy arowes
ar very sharp / they shall smite the hertes of the kings enemies / the people
shall fall under the. The s^ate regal / Oh lord shall stand for ever / for
ye scripture of thy kingdom loves equity. Thou art the lover of rightwisnes
and hater of unright / because that god which is thy god / has anointed the
with very oil of gladness which art promoted above thy fellows. The playtes
of all thy robes savor of must and aumber / as thou come forth of thy white
y uery palaces. Where the daughters of kings in their precious and rich
ornowrementes of thy gift make the glad / and thy queen on thy right hand also
decked in golden aparell. Here daughter and give head / bow down thy ear /
and forget thy people and thy fathers house. And the king shall be enamored of
thy beauty / for he is thy lord / to him shall you do reverence. Tytus shall
bri^ge the presents / every rich nation shall honor y^ with gifts. She
shall sit next ye king in his priuye chamber all gloriously / her aparel
shall be broyded with gold. In clothe of tyssue she is p^sented to the king / her
handmaydens following her ar brought together also unto the. They are p^sented
with joy / and ar brought into the kings palace. For the fathers / thou shall
have children / whom you shall constitute to be chief in all the earth. I shall
remember thy name through out all ye worlds / wherefore the people shall
magnifye ye for ever.

earth be moved from her place / and the hills compassed with the sea al to

the high hills be borne down with her vyolence. Selah. Let shall the little
ryuers of the sweet floude refresshe the cite of god / which is the most
secretest holy place among the tabernacles of the most highest. God sytteh in
the mids of this holy place wherefore it shall natte be moved / for god shall
help it swyftly. The hethen flocked together sediciously and anon the
kingdoms were moved / he lyfted up his voice and than men shra^ke away. The
lord of hosts stands on our part / the god of Jacob is our high strong
tower. Selah. Come ye hither and behold the noble acts of the lord / what
wonderful things he has wrout in therth. He takes away battle even unto
the farthest part of therth / he breketh their bows / he vnhedeth their
speres / and bre^neth their chariettes in ye fire. Cease ye therefore and let me
alone / se that ye know me for god / above all nations / and above all things
in the earth. The lord of hosts stands on our perte the god of Jacob is to
us an high strong tower. Selah.

OMnes gentes. All people clappe your hands for joy / make ye melody to god

He has chosen us for him self / he has chosen our heritage / even the

MAgnus dominus. Great is ye lord and great praise worthy / in the city of our

The argument into the.xlix. Ps.
This Psalm. reproves the madness of couetousmen and vttreth their wretchedness:
which here take their pleasure and felycite in richis / afterward to be
perpetual wretches in hell. The title is all one with the Psalm before.

AUdite he oe^s. Here ye this thing al people / listen unto these things as
many as live i^ this world. As well ye yt ar of the come^ people as ye yt ar i^
dignite as well ye yt ar rich as they that are pore. My mouth shall speak
wysedom and the medytacyon of my heart shall show ye the rit understanding. I
shall apply mine ear unto a parable / my harp reighted unto me I shall expound
my rydle. Wherefore should I fere i^ time of aduersyte / wha^ my shrewde wayt
layers besege me round about. Which trust in their riches and ar magnifyed for
their habou^da^t goods. And yet no man be he never so high in dignite may
redeem his brother from death / no man pay to god the price of this redemption.
It is without doubt / no small price / their lives to be losed and free from death
to live ever. To prolonge their lives into ever lasting / and never to se
their grave. Surely they se both wise men dye / shrewde men and folysshe / they
dye all a like / and they leave to other men their riches They thought i^ their
mind their housholdes to abide for ever with their habitacyons / they extolled
their names in the earth. But man in his glystryng fortune shall not abide / he
shall be like the bestes which dye down right.

This same their own i^uencyon is their very own folysshnes / and yet their
posterite gredily follow their ways. Selah. Like sheep shall they be cast in
to their graves / death shall be their shepherde / the light ones spronge /
ryghtwismen shall be their lords / their beauty shall fade away / hell shall be
their hospytall. But god shall led back my soul from hell / for he has
taken me up to defend me. Selah. Fear thou nothing when thou see a man
made rich / and have encresed greatly the gloriouse dygnitye of his house. For
he shall not bear all away with hi^ when he dye / neither shall dignitye his
companyon go down with him. For his soul shall have her heaven here by life /
me^ shall praise the whiles thou set forth and magnifyest thy self. These
men shall follow the natyon of their fathers / that is / they shall never se
light. That man to whom happens prosperouse fortune and not understanding /
the gyuer thereof / shall be like a be in his departing.

The argument in to the.l. Psalm.
In this psalm Asaph declares how mightily god would call unto him / all
natyons of the world by the gospel / delyuerynge by his mighty power his
chosen: also how that he would than require of his / rather faith and
knowledge / and declaringe of his goodness / tha^ sacrifyces or works / and
how grievously he will curse and entreat them that boste the^ of his relygyon
without the pure study of his true worship. The title of the psalm. The song
of Asaph.

DEus deorum. The mighty god and lord shall make a cry / and call unto him
all that inhabyte the earth / from the east to the west. God shall set out a
lamp from Syon / which is his most goodly ornamente and beautye.

Our god shall come and shall not tarry / fire shall brenne before him / round
about him shall there be a vehement whyrlwinde. He shall call the heuens above
/ and the earth also / that he might deliver his people in judgment. Gather ye
together my saints / which stycke to my promise before their own deeds. And
ye heuens show forth his mercy wherewith he makes men rightwyse / for god / he
is judge. Selah. Here (my people) and I shall speak / Israhell here thou / and I
shall promise the / that I am god / ye / and that I am eue^ thy god. I will not
reprove the for my suffrynge or omittynge thy sacrifyces / neither will I look
for thy beauty sacrifyces. I will not / neither needs it me to make from thy
house any ox / either from thy fold any gotes. For all the wild beestes of
forestes are mine / the wild beestes that feed in a thousand hills also are
mine. I challenge for me all the souls in the hills all ye live in the feldes
ar mine. If I shall hunger I will not tell the thereof / when the round world
all about is mine / and what so ever is contained therein. Thynkest thou that I
will eat befe / and drink gotes blood? If thou will give god a sacrifyce /
give him his praise and honor / and thus pay thy promise to the most highest.
As to call upon me in time of tribulation / and I shall defend the / and thus
shall thou honor me. For unto the ungodly man god said / wherefore pratest thou
of my ceremonies / and bablest with thy mouth of mye promise. When thou hate
my disciplyne correctynge thy life / and throwest away my words. If thou
espyest any thief / anon thou ro^nest to hi^ / and couplest thy self with
adulterers. Thou have given thy mouth to evil / and thy tongue craftily
paynteth disceytes. Thou syttest and spekest against thyn own brother /
sclanderously and iniustly thou verest thyn own mothers son. These things
thou do and yet I diffar my punisshmente / thou imaginest me to be but a
another man like unto the / but I shall reason with the / and set foot to foot
against the. This thing consider / and know / I pray / ye that forget god /
lest he pluck you by the sleue / and no man may rescu and help you. He yt
sanctifyeth me with praise honoreth me and to him yt goth ye rit way shall I give
godly saving health.

This Psalm. is a prayer of a man unfeignedly knowlegi^ge his si^nes: in which

sin. But lo thou would troth to occupye and rule in my inward parts / you
shewedest me wisdom which you would to sit in ye secrets of my heart.
Sprincle me with hysope and so shall I be clean / thou shall wash me / and
than shall I be whiter than snow.

Pour upon me joy and gladness / make my bones to rejoice which you have
smitten. Turn thy face fro my sins / and wype away all my wykednes. A pure
heart create in me / oh lord / and a steadfast right spirit make a new
within me. Cast me not away / and thy holy ghost take not fro me. Make me
again to rejoice whiles you bryngest me thy saving health / and let thy chief
gouernynge free spirit strengthen and led me. I shall instruct cursed and
shrewde me^ in thy way and ungodly men shall be converted unto ye Deliver me from
the sin of murder oh god / oh god my savior / and my tongue shall tryumphe
upon thy mercy wherewith thou make me ryghtwyse. Lord open thou my lyppes /
and than my mouth shall show forth thy praise. For as for sacrifyces thou
delytest not in the^ / or else I had offered them / and as for brent sacrifyces
thou regardest them not.

Acceptable sacrifyces to god is a broken spirit / a co^trite and a dejected
heart thou shall not despise (oh god). Deal gently of thy favorable benevolence
with Sion let the walls of Jerusalem be edifyed. Than shalt thou delight in
very sacrifyces in the right brent sacrifyce / and in ye oblation of
rightwisenesse: than shall they lay upon thy altar the very oxen.

saying that Dauyd was come to the house of Achimelec.

QUid gloriaris. Wherefore gloriest and auancest thy self of thy sin / oh you
mighty malicious man? ye mercy of god stands forth offered to every man at all
times. Thy tongue is occupied in mischef thou do deceyt even as a new set
raser Thou love rather to hurt than to do good / to lie tha^ to speak yt yt
right is. Selah Thou delitest to speak what soever bring upon mischefe and
murder / and to exercise thy tongue in deceyte. Wherefore god shall break ye all
to pieces / he shall utterly distroy the / he shall scrape the clean out of thy
tabernacle / and thy rote from the earth of this life shall he draw up. Selah.
This shall ye rightwismen se / and shall fere god / but this man shall they
laugh to scorn. Saying lo / the man which set not god before him for his
strength / but trusted in ye multitude of his riches and strenthened him self
with fraud and deceyte. But I abide like a florisshinge olyue in the house of
god / trustinge in ye mercy of god into worlds / and into world for ever. I
shall magnify the evermore before thy saints / for thou haste done these
things / and I shall abide thy pleasure / for it is full gentle and favorable.

The argument in to the.lv. Psalm.
In this Psalm. David complayneth him self to be brought into the most perelous
straight that might be / and that of the most noughtiest / and deceytfull men /
whom he rekened to be his chief friends.

OH god / lysten unto my prayer / and hyde not thy self fro my deep desire.
Give head and answer me / I lament in my prayer / and I cry full loud. And
that for the noise of mine enemies and vexation of the wicked / for they take
mysch^ues counsel against me / and odiously do they pursue me. My heart
mourns / sore troubled within me / and even the fear of death falls upon
me. Horror and tre^blyng fere assailed me / ye they overwhelmed me. And I
thought / would god I had wings like a dove / and than would I fly away to
abide sure somwhere. Lo / than would I fly far hens / I would dwell in some
wilderness. Selah. I would speed me to a void and to escape from this blast /
which tereth up by ye rote and breaks me so sore. Scater them lord / and
make their tongues to vary / for I se nothing in the cite but violence and
strife These things ro^ne about their walls day and night / within this cite
is there wickedness and heaviness. Within her ar there crafty frauds / usury
and deceyte go never out of her streets. For nether was it my enemy that thus
shamfully entreted me / or else I might have borne him / neither was it one that
openly hated me / yt thus did oppress me / or else I could have conveyed me
from him. But it was you (oh man) even mine own fellow / my gyde / and my
famylare. To whom it was sweet for me to break my mind and to utter my
secrets / we were co^uersaunte together even in the house of god. Let death be
brought in upon them / let them go to hell quick: for mischef was in their
conuentycles / and even in the hertes of them. I shall call upon god / and the
lord shall preserve me. Evening and morning and myddaye shall I pray / and
lift up my voice and he shall here me. He shall redeem my soul from battle
which is intended against me / and shall grue me praise / for very many shall be
with me. God shall here and shall scourge them whose majesty has endured from
the beginynge. Selah. For they change not them self / nor yet fear they god.

He has laid hands upon my friends he has broken promise which he made with
them. Their mouths are as soft as butter / and in their heart nourisshe they
battle: their words ar more smothe and plesante than oil / and yet are the
same words as hard and as sharp as darts. Cast thy careful heaviness upon ye
lord and he shall ease the: he shall not suffer a rightwisman to slide and to
fall for ever. Uerily thou (god) shalt thruste down these blodye and
deceytfull men into their graves and tombs / all ready made for them they shall
not bring their days to half their age / but I shall trust in the.

with co^tynuall battle he has all to broken me. My daily awayte layers have
swalowed me up / there are many surely that fight against me / oh right high
god. But when fear brought me into a straynte / I trusted in the.

I remembered the promise of god with praise and trusted in god / wherefore I
fered not what so ever mortal man could do to me. What so ever I began they
enuyed it daily / all their study was bente to do me a mischef / they were
gathered together and laid awayt for me / they observed my fete / and gaped to
catch my soul. By their shrewdnes they trusted them self to escape all
danger / but it is god that throws down people. Thou canste well tell how
often I have fled / and as for my tears thou have put them up into thy bottell
/ that is to say / into thy book. When I shall call upon the / my enemies
shall go back / by which thing I may know that god stands on my part.
With praise shall I remember the word of god / with praise shall I remember
the promise of the lord. In god shall I trust / and so shall I not fear what
so ever man may do to me. I shall make my vows unto the / oh god / unto the
shall I give praises.

For thou will deliver my soul from death / and my fete surely from slydynge /

He shall send down his mercy and his troth. My soul is in the mids of
lions / I dwell among men which are a fire / whose teth are spears and arowes
and their tongue is a sharp sword. Lift up thy self / oh god / above heue^s
lift up thy glorious beauty above all the earth. They laid a net for my
fete / this man depressed my soul / they dygged up a pytfal for me / and they
their selves fell into it. Selah. My heart is well set o god / my heart is well
set / I shall sing and praise. My tongue be thou stered up / stryke up ye
fydels and harpes / I shall si^ge very erly. I shall magnifye the among the

Aspes / when she stopped her ears. Because she would not hear the voice of
the enchanters / or of the charmer that well can enchaunte. O god / distroye
the tethe of the mouth of these men / even the wange tethe of these lions break
thou / oh lord. Let them synke away like water / and let them be a mark /
upon the which arowes sent out of a strong bow / are all to broken. Let them

with thy sodayn i^dignation. The right wise shall rejoice when he consydereth

ERipe me de inimi. Deliver me from mine enemies / my god / take me from these
that rise against me. Deliver me from these men which are all given unto mischef
/ save me from these blodsheders. For lo / they lay awayte for my life / there
are come together against me strong and boystous men / and yet / o lord / no
fault have I made them. They ra^ne upon me and ar now bent to distroye me
gyltles / arise to socour me and behold. And thou lord / god of hosts / the
god of Israel awake that all nations may know the be thou not merciful to
all men that are against the / eue^ of a wiked purpos. Selah They ro^ne about
here and there in y^ night hunting and yellynge like dogs for me ye / they
seek all the corners of the cite for me. And they seek nothing but death /
swerdes ar in their lyppes / for they said who should hear us? But thou /
lord / shalt scorn them / thou shalt mock all these heithen. Of the shall
I tarry for help / which now helpest him / for god is to me a strong castle.
Oh my god / let thy merciful help overtake me / o god / let me se my desire
fall upon my wayt laiers Sley the^ not out of hand lest mi people forget this
thing / but disperse them to wa^dre among thy people / cast the^ down lord /
which art our bokler. For the wickedness of their mouths / and their evil
speech let the^ be trapped i^ their own pride / and for their perjury and their
lies / let the^ be a fable in every man's mouth. Consume / thou kyndled into
vengeance consume / that these men nowhere apere / and let all men even to
the uttermost parts of the earth / know that god is chief gouerner in Jacob.
Selah. They ro^ne here and there in the night hunting and yellynge like
hounds / seeking round about the cite for me. They their selves shall wandre
about for their meat / and yet shall they be sure to rest at night with emptye
belyes.

But I shall sing of thy strength given unto me / erly shall I rejoice of thy
mercy given also / for that thou host be^ my defense and my refuge in my
trouble. Oh my strength / unto the shall I sing / for god is my strong
castle / even thou god / which wetest well safe to bestow thy mercy upon me.

The argument in to the.lx. Psalm.
In this Psalm. David remembers how god some times in his wrath leueth his
people i^ the danger of their enemies / but yet again he helps them gently
gyuynge them clear victories. The title of the Psalm. The song of David
committed to the chaunter to be played at thorgayns called the beautefull Lyle
of the testimoni for an instruction when he should fight against that part of
Syria which is called Mesopotamia / and against another part of Syria called
zoba where Iaob retournynge slew.xii. thausande ^edomytes in the valey of
Salis. Read the storye.ii. Regum.x.

DEus re. Oh god / you hadest ones forsaken us / you hadest cast us away / you
were angry / but yet have thou offered thy self peased again unto us. Thou
smittest the earth together and all to break it / heal her brekynges (we prayed
the) for she was sore bowed down Thou made thy people to feale full hard
things / you gave us poison to drink. But yet again thou lyftedest up a
baner for them that feared the / under which they shulde^ obtain a prosperouse
vyctorie / and this dydest thou for thy trouthes sake. Selah. Wherefore thy
well-beloved were made sure and safe / and now save me also with thy right hand
and here me. God has expressed his mind by word even from his secret holy
place / wherefore I shall rejoice I have now divided Sichem / and have metout
the valey of Succoth. Gilead is mine / and Manashed is mine / Ephraim is my
strong head cite / Judah is my kingdom. Moab is subject unto me / even as a
caldren to wasshe in my fete. Aedom shall be even as a place to cast in my old
shois / Philistea knowlegeth and cries unto me as to her king.

Who shall need now to lead me into any strong defensed city? or who shall
need to lead me until I come into Aedom? Uerily even thou / god / which
sometime hadest forsaken and cast us away / and would not go forth with us
among our host. Help thou us and deliver us from our enemies / for very
vain is ye help of man We armed with Gods help / shall do strongly / for
it is he yt shall tread down our troublers.

The argument into the.lxi. Psalm. which argument is common to many ps.
In this he prays to be delivered from perell.

EXaudi deus. God here my out cryynge / lysten unto my prayer. Unto the I cry
with desyer of heart full of anguissh from the extremest part of the earth /
lead me up in a higher rock than I of my self am able to clime. For thou art
my defense my strong tower / by the which I am preserved from my enemy. I
shall dwell in thy tabernacle for ever / I shall be sure under the secret
defense of thy wings. Selah. Uerily thou god) have herd my desires / thou
haste given thy heritage to the fearers of thy name. Thou shall heap mo days
to the kings age / and shalt draw a long his years in to many generatyons.

He shall sytte before god for ever / declare thy mercy and truth with the
which thou will keep him.

And so shall I praise thy name with songs for ever / that I might perform
my daily vows.

The argument into the.lxij. Psalm.
Here he teaches both by example of him self and also by commandment to
trust only in god and in no mortal man's power.

NOnne deo subiecta. My soul verily with silence looked up to god / for from
him comes my health.

It is he / verily that is my defender / my savior / he is also a castle for
me / I shall not sore slide. How long shall ye thus ^aye awayte for whom ye
list / ye all shall be slain and shall be like a relynge mudde wall / against
the which every man ronneth. Surely whom god exalts / them they counsel to
thrust down / they cover that thing which they shall never obtain / they
bless and speak fair with their mouths / and curse in their hertes. Selah.
Look up unto god (o my very still soul) for upon him depends my abydi^g. He
is verily my defender / my savior / he is also my strong castle / lest I be
moved and fall.

Of god depends my health and glory / it is the power of god whereby I am
defended and helped.

Trust ye in him at all times / oh people / power out before him all the
heuye cares of your heart / for it is god that is our defender. Selah.

Surely / mortal men are naught / men are but vanitye / if they were put to
gyther in a pair of balaunce / they were lyghter than naught.

Trust not in riches gotten with wrong and forse / lest ye mugger up unto you
vanitye / and when your riches increase put not to them your heart.

Ones / and yet again god has spoken / which two things I have herd / that
it is god / that has the very strength. And that it is thou / lord / which
have the very mercy / which gyuest unto every man after his dealing.

The argument into the.lxiii. Psal^
Here Dauyd declares how that through Saules persecucion he was holden abacke
i^ the deserte of Judah from the holy feast. The title of the Psalm. The song of
David / what time he was banysshed into the deserte of Judah. The storye is.i.
Regum.xxii.

DEus deus meus. God you art my god / erly do I sygh for ye / my soul thristeth
for ye / my flesh desires the in this thirsti and wide wildrenes without any
water Thus shall I behold the / as i^ thy secret holy place / yt I might se
thy power and thy glorious beauty. For thy mercy is more desirous tha^ this
same life / with my lyppes shall I praise the. Thus shall I magnifye the
thorowte all my life / in the praise of thy name shall I lift up my hands. Thou
shall satisfye my soul with fat delycious meat / whereupon my lyppes shall
joy and my mouth shall praise. As soon as I shall remember my self upon my bed
/ I shall think upon the / even in the watches of the night.

For thou verily art he that bri^geth me help / and I being sure in the
shadow of thy wings / shall tryumphe joyfully. My soul cleued unto the / for
thy ryghthande sustained me. These men that seek my life to spyll it shall go
down into their graves. Men shall drive them upon the edge of their swerdes /
they shall be hewn and cut into meat for foxes. But the king shall rejoice in
god / and he shall glory that swereth by him / for their mouths shall be
stopped.

The argument into the.lxiiii. Psalm.
This psalm is a prayer against sclanderers and false accusers / whose
natural disposytion Da. here discribeth and prophesies their punishment. The
title. Dauides so^g committed to the cha^ter.

EXaudi deus oratione^. God here my prayer: keep my life from my fearful
enemy. Hyde me from the shrewde counsel and harmfull company / which are all
given to mischef. Which whette their tongues like swerdes / and like as out of a
bente bow / they shote forth bitter words for arowes. To smite the i^nocent
/ they will smytte him suddenly / and will fear nothing. They studied for a
mischef / and talk among themself of snares to be preuily laid: saying / who
shall espy them? They studied what mischef they might do: and (every man's
mind serched) they concluded fast thereupon. But god shall smite them with a
soden darte / they shall receive their dethes wound. Their own tongues shall
smite them selves / and who soever shall se them / shall avoyde sore astoned.
All mortal me^ shall se this thing / and shall speak upon the work of god /
and they shall know his deeds. The ryghtwyseman shall rejoice in the lord /
and shall commytte him self to his cure / all rightwyse in heart shall rejoice
gloriously.

The argument into the.lxv. Psalm.
In this Psalm. David declares god to have his chief seat in Syon there to be
known / and worshypped of all men.

TE decet himnus. Praise abides the / oh god) in Syon / and men shall perform
unto the their vows.

Unto the / which hear prayer / all mortal men shall come. Iniquite
prevailed against us / but it is thou yt purgest us from our sins. Blessed
is he whom thou have chosen / and whom thou haste taken to the / to dwell in
thy house.

For he shall be satisfied with the good things of thy house and of thy holy
temple. Of thy meruelouse rightwysnesse shalt thou grant us / oh god our
savior) wherefore they shall trust in the / all that inhabyt the farthest
costs of the earth / and of the long see. Thou art he which set the
hills in their strength / gyrte round about with power.

Which swageste and peaseste the feerse rorynge of the sees / and ceassest the
noise of their floudes / and the wood furye of ye hethen. They that are in the
extremest parts of the earth / shall fear at thy wonderful tokens / them that
dwell at ye east and at the west thou shall make glad. Thou have vysyted the
earth with rain when it was full dry / thou have made it very rich and
plentuouse / the river of god flows full of water / thou shall make her
wheat to increase luckely / for so is it thy pleasure to endue it.

Lay plain her even vorowes / and moist them temperatly with sweet showers
/ and bless thou the spiringe of her corn. Thou shalt lead the ear about
with thy gentle favor / thy clouds shall drope fat plentuousnesse.

There shall fall drops upon the mantions of the deserte / the hills shall
joy couerde round about with plentuouse fruit. The plain feldes shall be
coueted with flocks of sheep / and the valeys shall be filled with corn /
wherefore every man shall sing and make melody.

The argument into the.lxvi. Psalm.
This Psalm. is a gyuinge of thanks for the delyuerance of the people of
Israhell from the tyranny of the ungodly. The title. The song of David /
committed to the chau^ter to be song.

IUbilate. Make ye melody to god / as many as inhabyt the earth. Give ye glory
unto his name in syngi^g give ye unto him gloriouse praise. Say ye unto god /
oh / how fearful are thy deeds for thy wide power / even thy enemies shall
come crepynge and crouchi^g unto the. Unto the shall profess homage and
worship / all that dwell upon therth / they shall sing unto the / they shall
sing unto thy name. Selah. Come hither and se the works of god / se his
fearful works toward men. He turns y^ sees in to dry land / he makes
men to go through the sea dry shode / and there we reioysed of his power. He
turns the world by his power / his eyes look upon the heithen / these
backslyders from his truth shall never be promoted. Selah.

O people / magnifye ye our god / praise him with loud voices. This is he that
has preserved the life of our soul / and has not suffered our fete ones to
slide. Uerily god has proved us / he has tried us with fire / as men were wo^t
to try silver. Thou broughtest us in to a strayte / and charged our loins with
heaviness. Thou laydest sore men upon our heedes we were brought in to fire and
water / and thou leadest us out again in to a place where we were well
refresshed. I shall go to the lord at all times / I shall pay unto the my
vows. Which I promised with my lyppes and made with my mouth / when I was in
afflyction. I shall offer unto the fat sacrifyces with the ricke and savor
of motton / I shall bre^ne unto the oxen and gotes. Selah. Come ye hither as
many as fear god / and bear what things he has done to my soul.

I called upon him with my mouth / and with my tongue I exalted him. If I had
set my mind upon iniquite / tha^ god had not herd me: but now god has herd
and given head unto my prayer. Praised be god which has not repelled my prayer
/ nether has he wtdrawe^ his mercy fro me

The argument into the.lxvii. Psalm.
Here David desires the favorable presence of god for the people of Israhell.

DEus misereatur. God might favor and have mercy upon us: he might lyghten
us with his presence. Selah That thy way might be known euerywhere in the earth
/ and thy saving health also unto all nations. The people might magnifye the (o
god) ye / all people might magnifye the. The heithen might joy and tryumphe /
in that thou do right unto the people / and dyrectest the natyons upon
therth. Selah. The people might sprede thy name / oh god / ye all people might
magnifye the. The earth also might give again her encrese / and god which is
our god might do us good. God might bless us / and all that inhabit the earth
/ even unto the vttermoste parts thereof might fear him.

The argument i^ to the.lxviii. Psalm.
In this Psalm David syngeth his victory obtained of the alyauntes / as of
the Syrins / that the Acdomites and the Amonites.

EXurgat deus. As soon as god ryseth to help / his enemies are dyspersed /
they flee from him that hate him. He puts them to flyghte like smoke / as
wax melts against the fire / even so wast the ungodly from the presens of
god. But the ryghtwyse joy and are glad before god they leap for joy. Sing
ye to god / sing to his name / lift him up riding upon the ouermoste heuens
/ THE LORD is his name / joy ye before him. The father of ye fatherless /
helper of widows / even god sitting in the seat of his secret holy place.
Even god which gives children to the bareyne / and loses men holden in feters
/ but the forsakers of hi^ shall dwell in ye wide bareyne desert. Oh god / wha^
thou wenyst forth before thy people / and walkedest through the deserte. Selah.
The earth was al to shaken and moved / and the heuens droped at the presens of
this god of Sinay / ye of god / even the god of Israel. But / o god / thou
scatt^edest rain in good time upon the earth which thou chalengest be right
heritage / and when it failed thou restoredest it again. That this flock
might dwell there in / you have so prepared for the poor oh god. afflycte /
that they enjoy thy goods The lord has brought it to pass that women
should bring good tidings / and sing the vyctory of rit great powers Kings
compassed with great hosts have fled / they have fled / and the weak
people that sat at home divided the spoil. Also if ye had been as black as
men sitting among pottes / now shall ye be white / as though ye were couerd
with douues feathers / which are as white as silver / and her wings as yelowe as
gold. When / for her sake the almighty god broke down the kings / she was
made as white as the hill zalmon.

The hill of god is fat / as is Basha^ / it is an high hill / a fat hill
like Bashan. Wherefore set ye so out your selves / ye high hills? this hill
of god is a plesau^t habitacyon / for the lord dwells in it perpetually. The
horsemen and chariettes of god are thousand thousands / ye many thousands of
Angels / the lord is in mydde monge them in his holy place. Thou have lyfted
up thy self and have take them whom thou wylt led captive / thou have
received some me^ among as gifts. And even the forsakers of yt thou have
compelled to obaye the / for that in this place god will have his seat which
has his being of him self. Praised be the lord at all times / he mit encrese
his benefytes unto us / the very same god which is our savior. Selah. God
which is to us both god and savior is the lord having his being of him
self / in whose hands ar diverse kinds of death. Uerily god has smitte^ the
head of his enemies / even the very crown of the hedde of the synful man. The
lord said / I shall restore my well-beloved / even as I did ones restore them
from Bashan ye I shall bring them again / as I did ones from the botome of
the sea. Wherefore thy foot shall be red with blood and thy dogs tongues shall be
red with the blood of thy enemies / both with theirs and with the blood of
the king. Thy beloved se / thy solemn goynges (o god / even the goynges of my
god / my king) sytti^g nobly in his holy secret place Singers go before /
there follow plaers at the orgayns / in the mids went there young mayde^s
playeng upon tympanes In the congregations praise ye god the lord / even ye
which are of the seade of Israhell. There were of the little tribe of Benjamin
certain which bore rule the princes of Judah / their strength / the princes of
zabulon / the princes of Naphthalim. Thy god has given the thy strength:
stablysshe (o god) that thing which thou have wrought for us.

In the temple at Jerusalem / even kings shall bring the gifts.

As thou sharply blamest the spear me^ with thy mighty power among the
capitayns of the host / so make thou the^ to yield and to become trybutaryes
payenge their silver. Cast down the people whose delight is to have battle.
There shall come of the most nobleste from Egypt / and Inde shall stretche
forth her hands swyftly unto god. Ye kingdoms of the earth sing ye to god /
sing ye with praise unto the lord. Selah. Which rydeth upon the heuens / ye
upon the everlasting heuens / lo / he puts forth his voice / ye and that a
voice full of power. Give ye to god the praise of strength / his clear
majesty is upon Israhell / his strength is in the clouds. Thou art to be
feared / o god / i^ thy secret holy place / the god of Israhell / he shall give
strength and power to the people.

Praised be god.

The argument into the.lxix. Psalm.
In this Psalm of David / which is the figure of Christ the head of all faithful
me^ (whom it becomes to be co^formed and made like their head) is contained a
great complaint as of one being in grievous present perels / and afterward a
fervent prayer for delyueraunce.

SAluum me fac deus. Save me god / for waters are risen so high upon me / that
I am in peril of my life. I stycke fast i^ the deep toughe claye i^ the which
I can not co^tynue / I am brought into the deep floude and the violent streme
carries me away. I am weary of criynge / my throat is hoorse / my syghte is
wasted with lokynge up unto my god. They y^ odiously pursue me fautlesse / are
mo in nombre than the hears of my head they have prevailed which undo me
causles / and they whette their enymite upon me they constrayne me to pay tho
things which I never took away. God / thou know if I have done any thing
folysshely / it is not unknown unto the / if I have offended. Oh lord / the
lord of hosts / let them not be shamed for my sake which depend on the /
oh god of Israhel / let them not be confounded that seek the. For I / for thy
sake have borne the opprobrye / shame and ignominye couerd my face. I was made
a stranger to my brethren / and an alyaunte to my mothers children. Even the
very love that I bore to thy house ete me up / the ^^probryes which the
ungodly cast against the burnt me sore. I give me to weeping / my body do I
scourge with fasti^g and for thus doing / I am reuyled. I clothed me i^ hear
and sack for their sakes / and they iested upon me.

They fabled upon me that sat at the gates / and the dronken men in tauers made
songs upon me. But I / lord / i^ the mean time made my prayer unto ye wha^
time was offered me / oh god / for thy infynite mercy and truth hear me / for
the which thou were wont to help.

Deliver me from this tough claye / and suffer me not to be drowned / let me
be delivered from these odious persuers / eue^ from these deep waters.

Let not ye streme carry me away / neither the depthe swalowe me in / nor the
pytte shytte her mouth over me. Answer me / oh lord) for full gentle is thy
mercy / look upon me after thy great humanite. And hyde not thy face from thy
servant / for I draw an heavy cross / speed the to here me. Join the to my
soul and redeem it / lose me fro my enemies. Thou know what approbri / what
shame / and how great confusyon I bear / they that trouble me are in thy
sight. Opprobrie has broken my heart / I am scourged / I looked for one to ease
me with comfortable words / but there was none / I looked up for co^forters / but
I found non. For meat / they gave me gall / and when I thirsted they gave me
to dri^ke vinagre. Let their own table be their trappe / and their own friends
their snares. Let their eyes be blinded lest they see / and make their loins
evermore to slide. Power forth thy wrath upon them / and let thy heavy
indignation take them. Let their houses be desolate / and let there be no man
to inhabyt their tabernacles. For they say that they persecute him / whom thou
would to be smytten / and they boste them self to chasten him whom thou
commaundest to wound. Make that unto these me^ one wickedness be heaped upon a
another / and let them never be partakers of thy rightwisnesse. Let them be
blotted out of the book of life / and let them in no wise be written with the
rightwyse. But me / oh god) for as much as I am afflycte / pore and full of
sorrow / thou shall deliver with thy saving help. I shall praise the name of
god with song / I shall extol him with solemn praise. For this shall be more
accept to the lord / than ox and calfe / which are armed with horns and
houfes.

Meke spryted men shall se these things and shall rejoice / the sekers of god
shall se these and their hertes shall live. For the lord hears the pore /
and me^ laid in prison for his sake he has not despised. Heuens and earth
shall love him / the sees also / and what so ever moves i^ the^ For god shall
save Syon / and shall preserve the cities of Judah / there shall men dwell and
possess that land be rit inherytau^ce The posterite of his servants shall
receive it for their heritage / who so ever love his name shall have their seat
theri^.

song of David committed to the chaunter to be song for a remembrance

DEus in adiutorium. Oh god speed the to deliver me / oh lord haste the to
help me. Let them be confounded with shame and opprobrye which lay awayte
for my life / let them be turned bakewarde / and in open ignomynie which
delight in my trouble. Let them be put back because they labor to shame me
/ even they which say fyghe / fyghe upon him. Let them joy and rejoice in
the / who so ever seek the / and they that love to be helped of ye / might say
/ god be always extolled. I am a careful poor afflycte / speed the unto me /
thou art my helper and delyuerer / se thou tarry not.

The argument into the.lxxi. Psalm.
This Psalm. is of a comen argument wherein David desires help against his
adversaries which were Absalom with other that conspired with him.

IN te domine speraui. In the / lord / have I trusted / suffer me not at any
time to be shamed.

Deliver me for thy ryghtwysnes and take me up / bow down thy ear unto me /
and save me. Be thou unto me a rock of stonne / in the which I might keep me
and to the which I might ever flee / hitherto haste thou taken charge of me to
keep me / for thou art my stonne and my castle. My god deliver me from the
hand of the ungodly man / deliver me from the fist of the mischeuous and
vyolent man. For thou art he of whom I depend / lord / lord / thou art the
same unto whom I have cleued sy then I was a child. Thou sustaynest me fro my
mothers womb / thou dreweste me out of my mothers belly / my laud and praise
is upon the contynually.

I am made a wondering stock unto many men / but thou art my strong defense.
My mouth shall be yet fulfilled with thy praise / let it daily extol thy
clear majesty. Cast me not away in mine old age / forsake me not when my
strength shall fail me. For they spoke upon me among them selue / and they
which lay awayte for my soul have cou^seyled in vain. Saying / god has
forsaken him / follow upon him / and take him for there is no man that will
deliver him God / be thou not far fro me / my god speed the to help me. Let
them be shamed and perish that are against my life / let them be covered with
opprobrie and confusyon which take so great pain to hyndre me. But I shall tarry
for thy help / and shall excede all men in thy praise. My mouth shall daily
speak of thy rightwysnes and saving health / for I know no end of thy
benefytes. I armed with the strength of the lord having his being of him self
shall come: and remember thy rightwysnes only. Oh god / thou haste taught me
even of a child / and unto this time do I publyshe thy marvelous noble acts.
Ye verily / thou shall not forsake me even unto mi old age and hoar hears oh
god / whiles I show forth thy mighty power unto this present generation / and
thy strength unto all the posterite to come And whiles I extol thy ryghtwysnes
oh god / which have done so great things o god / who may be compared unto
the? Which have made me to feel many and grievous adflictions / and thou peased
again shall quicken me / and shall bring me again even from the depest of the
earth. Thou shall encrese my dignyte / for thou pleased again shalt conforte
me. And I shall magnifye the / I shall sprede thy true faythfulnesse / my god /
with musyke instruments / I shall sing unto the with harp which make holy
Israhell. My lyppes shall triumph for joy and my soul also which thou have
redeemed / for I shall sing unto the. Also my tongue shall speak continually of
thy rightwysnes / for they shall be shamed / and in opprobrie which took so
great pain to hurt me.

Christ. The title of this psalm. The psalm of Solomon.

DEus iudicium. Oh god / give thy authorte in judgment unto the king / give
the kings son thexecucion of thy justice. He shall have to do with the
people of his rightwysnes / and shall dele euenly with thy poor afflycte.
Mountains shall bring peace unto the people: and ye hills shall bring
thexecucion of rightwisnes. He shall deliver in judgment the poor afflycte
people / he shall keep the nedyons / he shall smite down the unjust vexers of
men. Men shall worship the / as long as the son and moan shall shine in to
every age.

He shall come down like small rain in to a new mowen medowe / and like rain
which sokingly makes moist the earth. Rightwismen shall florisshe whiles he
reigns / and there shall be much peace endurynge as long as the moon.

He shall have dominyon from the one se to the the other / and from the east
floude unto the worlds end. Before him shall fall down the dwellers of the
deserte / and his enemies shall lie prostrate lyckinge the dust. The kings of
Tharsis and of the yeldes shall give him gifts / the kings of Sheba and
Sebashall offer unto him honorably. All kings shall do homage unto him: all
nacyons shall serve him. For he shall deliver ye pore that cries unto hi^ /
and the man in heaviness without help. He shall have pytie and mercy on the
poor nedyons / and he shall keep the souls of them that are in afflyction. He
shall redeem their lives from fraud and vyolence / and precyouse shall their
blood be in his sight. He shall live and shall have given him of the gold of
Sheba / men shall bless him all times and shall sprede his fame. And the earth
shall be so fruitful that of an handful of wheat there shall arise such
plenty in the hills / that it shall wave with the wind like the thick high
trees of Lybani / and shall grow forth before the cite as thick as grass.
His name shall be ever spoken upon whiles the son shall endure and shall go
from one generation into a another / through him shall all natyons be blessed
and shall extolle him with praise. Praised be the lord god / god of Israel
which alone does meruelouse things. Praised be his gloriouse name / every
land be fusfilled with his beautiful glory. AMEN. AMEN.

Asaph song this psalm for the consolacyon of the faithful: which freate

song of Asaph.

QUam bonus deus. Right good surely is god unto Israhell / even to those men
which are pure in heart.

But my fete were almost gone / my fotynge had almost failed me. For that ye
good fortune of the folysshe wicked men set me so a fire / when I se such
prosperyte of the ungodly. For they are neither co^bred ne constrained to death
/ but they ar well liking / they thrive / and ar lusty. They are not oppressed
with heaviness like other men / they know not the sorrow and care that other
men abide. Wherefore pride has closed them round about / and they are clothed
with vyolence as with garments. They are so full of felycite and wealth that
they swelle / they set forth them selves in the imagynatyons of their own
hertes.

They think to be holden and brideled with no laws: they booste their
mischeuouse vexation / they speak from a lofte. They have lyfted up their
mouths into heaven / their to^ges walked all over therth. They called their
people unto ye same study / and made them to drink of ye same full cup.
Wherefore the people was moved to say within them / how might god know these
things? what knowledge may there be in god above?

Se / says they / these are ungodly men / and yet are they blessed in this
world / and swymme in plentuouse riches. Uerily as for my self / I trow I
have kept my heart pure / and have studied to have hands wasshen with
innocents / clean from wickedness / but all in vain. For I have been scourged
daily / and I suffered my chastisynge every morning / ye / and that erly. But
if I shall thus judge and speak of these things / I should be iniuriouse unto
the natyon of thy chldre^. I mused and studied fore to know these things / but
it was laborious and hard to se it. Untyll I was brought into the secret holy
places of god / and was taught to make the end of these men. Surely thou haste
set them in a slybery place / even to cast them down / and to be utterly
distroied. Oh / how suddenly were they cast down / and made an end of / they
were distroyed with sudden mischef. They were but as a dream of a man suddenly
/ awake / oh lord / even their images and pictures have thou made spitfull in
the city. Surely my heart bleded in bytternes / and my inward parts were
stinged and as pricked with nedles. I was a sotte and perceived nothing at all /
I was like a brute be before the. And yet / not wtstandyng / was I always
with the / thou heldest my right hand fast in the hand. Thou ledest me at thy
pleasure / and afterward tokest me up and helpedest me gloriously. Whom
therefore in heaven / whom in earth should I honor and worship but y^? My flesh
and my heart long sore for y^ oh the very strength of my heart / god is my
portion for ever. For lo / they that absente the^ self long from the / shall
perisshe / you wilt distroie as many as forsake the. But I thought it good for
me to cleue to god / I set the lord before me for my defense to thentent I
would show forth thy works.

The argument i^ to the.lxxiiii. Psalm.
In this psalm Asaph complayneth of the destruction of the temple / and of the
faithful people and also of the blasphemy against god and his holy place / by
the ungodly folk. The title of this ps. It is an instructyo^ showed unto
Asaph.

QUare deus repulisti. Lo / wherefore (o god) have thou put us away from the so
long? wherefore is thy wrath thus sore ki^dlid agi^st the flock of thy
pasture? Remember thy congregatyon who^ thou have chosen to the from the
begi^ning / even the metyarde of thy herytagel who^ thou have redeemed / this
same thy hill of Sio^ in the which thou were wont to dwell. Lift up thy self
/ and come to distroye for ever all enemies / which have brought all myschefe
unto thy holy temple. Thy adversaries have rored in the mids of thy
Synagoges / they have set up their baners in token of the vyctorye. Like as in
time paste full exellent and noble was the works and dilygence of them which
cut down with axes great trees / to the building of the temple. Even so now
are thereof like dilyge^ce and labor / to distroye and to break the carved
images in it with twybyll and hammers. They have burnt it in the fire / and
thus they throwi^g down the house of thy name into therth / have profaned and
polluted it. They thought in their mi^de saying / let us also slaye them all
to gyther and they have burnt up all the sinagoges of god in the earth. We se
not the tokens and miracles which god was wont to show for us / there is no
prophet left us / there is no man with us which have any knowledge / but how
long shall this endure? What end / oh god / shall thy adversary have that
thus shamfully reuyleth the? what shall become of this sclanderouse enemy /
which thus ungodly blasphemeth thy name?

Wherefore haste thou plucked back thy hand? hold not thy right hand thus
still in thy bosom. Uerily thou art god which have hitherto ben my gouernoure
/ thou art even he that bryngest health into the mids of the earth. Thou
verily through thy power troublest the sea / thou breakest the heedes of the
dragons in the waters.

Thou knockest together the heedes of the great whales / and gyueste them for
meat to the people of the deserte. Thou breakeste up the sprynges / thou
make dry the floudes.

The day is thine / the night also belongs to the / thou haste ordained the
light and the son.

Thou have ordained and set all the costs of the round world / somer and
winter thou have made them. Yet se thou forgetest not this one thing / that
this enemy thus blaphemously reuyleth the lord / and that this wyked folysshe
folk thus grievously hurt thy name. Let not the life of thy turtle douue come
into the company of these adversaries / the company of the pore afflicte
forget not for ever. Look upon thy promise / for among these blind wretches of
the earth all are full of vyolence and trouble. Turn not away from the / these
pore lowelyous with shame but rather cause these pore afflycte nedions to praise
thy name. Arise god and give sentence against thy adversaries remember how
blasphemously they reuyled the / and how chorlysshly these wicked men deal
with the daily. Forget not the proud words of thy adversaries / let the
high swellynges of them that resyst the / clyme up still into their own
confusyon.

The argument in to the.lxxv. Psalm.
Here first of all Christ our sauyoure is brought in under the figure of
David / reioysi^g of the power given him / by the which he would restore the
world now being ready to fall: and he monissheth / that no man resyste his
king / because that god is he alone / which exalts who^ he will. The title
of this Psalm. The song of Asaph called Ne perdas.

COnfitebimur tibi. We thank the / god / we thank the / for nyghe is thy
glorious power / those men that call upon the / and they shall remember thy
marvelous deeds. For I shall take up unto me my congregation / and shall execut
true justice The earth and the dwellers there upon began to slide away / and I
have underset it. Sell. I spoke to these made foles / saying / se yt ye be not
besides your wits / I said also unto these ungodly / se that ye extolle not
your power. Lift not up your horns to high / neither speak ye proudneckedly
For this lyftinge up comes neither from the eest nor the weest / neither yet
from the sowthe hills of the deserte. But it is god verily the mighty judge /
he casts down one man and lyfteth up another. For there is a cup full of
troubled wine in the hand of the lord / out of which he powers to be drunk
of / whose very dregs shall be supped of / for all the ungodly of the earth
shall drink thereof. But I / in the mean season shall show forth contynually
his glory: and praise my god / even the very god of Jacob. And shall also
pluck up by the rotes the horns of these ungodly: but the power of the
rightwyse shall be still exalted.

The argument into the.lxxvi. Psalm.
Here Asaph syngeth how that Jerusalem was nobly defended of god: wherefore he
extolleth his power / (...) to be dreded tha^ excedyng all me^nes powers. The
title. The song of Asaph committed to the chanter to be song at thorgai^s.

NOtus in judea. God is honorably known in the land of Judah / and his clear
fame is nobly sprede through the land of Israel. His tabernacle is set up in
Jerusalem / and his mansion in Syon. There he broke into peses both ^owe and
arowes bukler and sword i^ battle Selah. Thou art passing clear and noble /
worthy to be magnyfyed above ye kingdoms full of theft and robery. They are
deprived of their strong heart their slomber has ouergone them / their hands
are beno^med / although they were men valyaunte in battle.

For through thy fearful thretenynge rebuke / o god of Jacob / their horse and
carts went all to hauoke.

Thou art to be feared in deed / for who may stand before the / especyally
when thy anger wa^e hot. Even from heaven thou causest thy fearful judgment to
be herd / the earth feared and durst not ones quitche. When god should rise in
to judgment / to save all the meke sprited of the earth. Selah.

For men's i^dignation occasyoned thy glory / even whiles you brydeledest the
rest of thy fury. Make your vows and perform them to the lord your god /
for he is in the mids among you.

Offer your gifts to him so greatly to be feared / which takes breath even
from princes / it is he that is to be feared of the kings of the earth.

The argument into the.lxxvii. Psalm.
In this Psalm. Asaph declares his heaviness of mind for the calamyte and
wretchedness of the holy people. The title of this Psalm. The song of Asaph
committed to the chef chaunter to be song of the order of those syngers among
whom Ieduthum was chief.

UOce mea ad dominum. With my voice to god / with my voice to god I cried loud
/ and he lystened to me. In the time of my trybulation / lord / I sought the /
my sore ran all night and ceased not / my soul refused all conforte I
remembered god / and I gnasted and grated my tethe together for anger / I spoke
and my spryte was sore vexed being full of anguyshe. Selah.

Thou heldest mine eyes from sleep all the kyght long and I was so tormented in
mind that my sleep failed me.

I called to mind my days paste / even the years of my sore age.

I remembered my merry night songs / I spoke in my heart / and my spirit
serched the cause of this heuye judgment.

Saying / shall the lord than cast me a way for ever? shall he never call
me again into his favor? Is his goodness than thus taken away for ever? is
his counfortable promise thus ended for all ages? Has god than forgotten to
have mercy? or will he shut up his mercy in his anger? Selah. And I thought
this is but mine own weak abiding / until the most highest declare his right
hand as he is wont to do. Wherefore I will call to mind the works of the
lord and I will hold in remembrance thy meruelouse noble acts / which thou
haste wrought of old time. I shall think upon all thy works / and talk upon
thy wonderful deeds contynually.

Oh / how wonderful are thy ways (oh god) which dwell in the secret
holy place? who is so mighty and so great as is god? Thou art god which have
wrote meruelouse things / and haste declared thy mighty power among the
people. Thou have redeemed and losed thy people with strong power / even the
son of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. The waters sometime saw ye / oh god) ye
waters saw the / and they trembled / even the deep botomlesse see was all to
troubled. The black clouds sent down rain / it thundered in the air / and
hayle stones came down like arowes. Great thunder clappes were herd round
about them / fearful lyghtnynges smytte the ground / therth quaked and
trembled. Thy ways lay through the sea / and thy paths in mighty waters and
yet no man shall know the printes of thy fete. Thou ledest thy people like a
flock of sheep / by the hands of Moses and Aharon.

The argument into the.lxxviii. Psal^
This Psalm warns us not to forget the noble acts of the lord and his
wonderful benefytes done for his people led out of Egypt / and brought into
the land of Canaan. The title of this Psalm. An instruction showed unto Asaph.

ATtendite popule meus. Take heed my people unto my law / bow down your ears
unto ye words of my mouth I will open my mouth into parables / and I shall
speak old derke sentences of grauite. Even those things which we have herd /
and known our fathers to have told us. There was nothing hid from their
children that succeeded them / for ever one told a another the lords praises /
and put each other in remembrance of his strong power and meruelouse things
which he wrought. He gave this commandment unto Jacob / and put this law
unto Israel when he commanded the fathers to declare these things to their
children.

That their posterite might know these things / and their children when they
are waxe^ / might show the same to their children also. And so to put their
confyde^ce and trust in god / and not to forget the works of god but to
observe his commandments And not to be like their fathers which were a
froward nation and falling out of kind / a nacyon that dyrected not their
hertes / and their spirytes committed not their selves steadfastly to god. The
sons of Ephraym well armed and good archers / turned their backs in
battle. They kept not touch with god / they would not live after his law.
They forgot his works / and his noble acts which he did for their sakes. For
he did wonderful things in the land of Egypt / in the field of Tanys /
their fathers being present. He divided the sea and led them through he made
the waters to ro^ne together sta^dynge up like walls of their each side. He led
the^ forth by day under a cloud and every night with clear light.

He cut in sondre the rock of stonne in the deserte / and gave the^ drink
out thereof like as out of a great deep water. He led ryuers forth of the stonne
and made the waters to run like sweet floudes. And yet for all this they
sinned against him / and angered the most highest in the wilderness. They tempted
god in their hertes / wha^ they asked meat to save their lives. And they spoke
against god saye^g may god spread us a table here in the deserte? He smytte
the stonne and there flowed out waters ple^tuously / but whether may he
lykwyse / said they / give us also bread / and prepare flesh for his people?
Wherefore the lord when he herd these things was angry / and fire was kyndled
against Jacob / and his wrath was be^te against Israhell. And that because they
believed not god / neither trusted they to his help. And yet he commanded ye
clouds oboue / and opened the doors of heaven. And powered the^ down MAN to ete
he gave the^ heavenly fode. So yt man ete strong and substa^cyally meat that
came from the clouds / he let the^ have meat eue^ their belifull. He turned
about the east wi^de in the heue^s / and by his power brought in the south
wind. And rayned down upon them flesh / as thick as duste / and fethered
fowls like the sands of the se. And they fell down i^to the mids of their
tents / and round about their tabernacles. And they eat / and were well
filled / for he satisfied their appetites. They were not disapoynted of their
lust / and yet their meat was no sooner in their mouths / than the wrath of
god fell upon them. And slew the chief of them: even the most stoutest of
Israel he threw down. But yet above all this they si^ned against him / for
they believed not his meruelouse deeds. Wherefore their days were consumed
myserably and swyftly / and their ^ares passed over in perpetual trouble. When
he distroyed the^ / than they sought him / they turned and besought god busely.
When they called to mind / the god is their defender: and that the high god is
their redemer. But they flatered him with their mouths / and lied unto him with
their tongues. Their heart was not right toward him / nether kept they touch
with him in promise. But yet he (natwithsta^dynge) full mercyfully forgave the^
their wickedness / he did not distroye them / he peased his great wrath and
cast not forth all his indignatyon. He consydred that they were but flesh /
a pufte of fleing wind which comes not again.

Often times provoked they hi^ to anger in the deserte / and agreued him sore
in the wyldernes. Again / they tempted god and casts away him that makes
holy Israel. They forgot his strong hand and the day in the which he
delivered them from the troublouse oppressors. They forgote his miracles also
/ which he wrought in Aegypte / and his wonderful tokens which he showed in ye
field of Tanis. When he turned their pondes and dyches into blood / and their
ryuers also that they should not drink. He sent among them swarms of flies
which devoured them / and frogs to dystroye them. And he gave the profit of
their grass and corn to be eaten up of worms / and their labors to hot
flies. He beat down their vynes with hayle stones / and their fygge trees
were froste byten.

He distroyed their cattle with hayle stones / and smitte down their beestes
with lyghtenynges. He sent into among the^ the heavy indygnatyo^ of his hot
wrath / the consumyng vengeance of his fearful ire / anguyssh and vyolent
wodnes by noyouse spirits. He hedged in the way of his wrath / he spared not
their lives from death but betoke them to pestilence.

He smytte every first begotten in Egypt and what so ever they had most leyfe
and dear in the tabernacles of Cham.

And led forth his people like a flock of sheep / and drove them forth
like an herd of nere into the wilderness.

He led them forth so surely that they neded nothing to have feared / for he
overwhelmed their enemies with the waters of the sea. And he brought them to
his holy place / even to the hill which he challenged with his right hand.

He casted out thereof the gentyles before their faces / and lymited unto them
their heritage / and made the trybes of Israhell to dwell in their tabernacles.

Natwithstandynge / yet they tempted and provoked the high god and kept not his
testymonies. They turned their selves from him / and delte unfaithfully against
him even as did their fathers / they were writhen back like a bow.

They angered god with their worship in high places / and kyndled his wrath
with their Idols. God herd them and was sore amoued / and grievously he
rejected and reproved Israhell. He forsook his habitacyon in Shilo / even the
tabernacle in the which he dwelled among men. He suffered his gloriouse mighty
seat to be taken / and his beautefull house to be brought i^to the hands of
his aduersares* He betoke his people all together in to the sword / his ire
burnt so sore against his heritake. Fire devoured their yo^g children / and
their vyrgyns lost the flower of their ma^yages.

Their sacryfyces were smytten down with sword / and their wives had no
layser to mourn like wydowes.

And the Lord awaked / as though he had slepte / and sterte up with great
noise from slombre / as a man that had surfetted with wine. And smitte his
enemis in the nether afterpartes / and made them to be into perpetual
opprobrye.

Natwithstandynge all this / yet he refused and rejected the tabernacles of
Joseph / and the trybe of Ephraym he would not choose. But he chose the trybe of
Judah / even the hill of Syon his own well-beloved. And he builded thervppon his
temple like high palaces / and laid the foundation as fast as the earth to
abide a long space. And he chose his servant David / and took him from the
shipkote. He led him from the following of his sheep to feed his people / even
Israel his own heritage. And he shall govern and feed them purely with
faithful heart / and shall ^etche them forth driuynge them wisely.

In this Psalm Asaph complayneth of the calamyte and wretchedness done to
Jerusalem of Antyoch / and desires the help of god against him. The title.
The song of Asaph.

DDus venerunt gentes. The hethen / oh god) are come into thine heritage / they
have polluted thy holy temple and have brought Jerusalem in to an heap of
stones. They have given the carcases of thy servants meat to the fowls of
the air / and the flesh of thy saints to the beestes of the earth.

They have shed their blood like water round about Jerusalem / and there was
none that would burye them. We are made an approbrie to our neighbors /
scorn and derision to them that dwell round about us. How long lord? will thou be angrye ever? shall thy indygnatyon brenne still like fire? Power out
thy wrath upon these hethen which will not knowledge the / and also upon these
realms that call not upon thy name.

For Jacob they have devoured / and have left his habytatyon desolate.

Remember not our old iniquytes / let thy mercyable gentylnes preuente us
shortly for we are grievously oppressed and made full poor. Be present with us
/ god / save us for thy gloriouse name and deliver us / pardon our sins for
thy names sake. Lest at any time these hethe^ should say where is their god?
Let the vengeance of the blodshed of thy servants / declare the among these
heithen / in our sight. Let the sorrowful syghes of the^ that are in bonds
come into thy presens / and for thy great power / make them alive which are
now iuged to death. And turn unto our neighbors plentuously their opprobry
into their own bosoms / with the which they have reviled the so approbriously
(oh lord. Make us which are thy people / and the flock of thy pasture to
magnifye the with thanks for ever / and to show forth thy praises from
generatyon into generatyon.

The argument into the.lxxx. Psalm.
This Ps. is of the same argument with that which goth before. The title of
this Psalm. The song of Asaph to be song of the beautyfull Lyle committed to
the chaunter.

QUi regis Israel. Thou herdman and feder of Israhell / lysten and take heed
which driuest Joseph like a flock of sheep / and thou which syttest between
the Cherubyus shine unto us. Thou which art before Ephraim / Benjamin / and
Manasses lift up thy power and speed the to save us. (Oh god) restore us /
make thy face to shine upon us / and we shall be saved. Oh lord which art ye god
of hosts / how long wylt thou be angry with the prayer of thy people. Thou
fedest us with the tears of our eyes / and made us to lycke in them
ple^tuously instead of drink. Thou settedest our borderers against us / and
made our enemies to laughe us to scorn. God of hosts restore / make thy
face to shine upon us / and we shall be saved. Thou translatedest thy vine from
Egypt and (the gentyles cast out) plantedeste it in their places. Thou
prouydedest it a place and dydest rote it fast / in somoch that it sprede over
all the land.

She couerd the hills with her shadow and her broad leued branches shadowed
the high Cedres. Thou made her to sprede forth unto the weest see / and her
broad branches to reche unto the floude Eufratem. Wherefore than haste thou
broke up her hedge / that every man passinge foreby may snatche of her fruit.

Wherefore do the bores of the forest wrote her up? and the wild beestes of the
field feed up on her? Oh god of hosts turn the / we beseech the look out from
heaven / behold and vyset this vine tree. Even the same vine which thy
ryghthande has planted / and have underset it for thine own self.

Wherefore it is now burnt up with fire and broken down? at thy rough
challenge and sharp blaming they perisshed. Challenge them again into thy
hand / for whom thou were wont to declare thy power / deliver them whom thou
haste stre^gthened to be thine.

We swerve not from the in any wise / restore our life / that we might call
upon the. Lord god of hosts / restore us / make thy face to shine upon us /
and we shall be saved.

The argument into the.lxxxi. Psalm.
In this Psalm Asaph exhorts us ernestly to worship god.

EXultate deo adiutori. Sing ye with triumph unto god our helper make ye
melody to the god of Jacob. Lift up your sweet tune / smyt upon your psalteres
/ and touch clenly the strings of your sweet harpes. Blow up your tru^pettes
in the fest of the new moan in the fest appointed for your sacrifyces.

For so it is ordained for Israel / and commanded of the god of Jacob. He
commanded straitely Joseph to observe this thing when he should come out of
Egypt / I herd a langage which I knew not. I took the burden from his
shoulders / and his hands were delyuerd from the furnace. Whiles thy enemies
assailed the with battle thou calledest upon me and I delyuerd the / I bekened
upon the preuily when I thondred full loud / I serched thy heart to prove the
at the waters of thy grudgynge against saying. Selah.

Here my people / and I shall ensure the / Israel / if thou shall here and
belyue me. If thou will not have any other strange god / neither worship any
other unknown god. But will know and worship me thy god / which have
led the forth of Egypt / open thy mouth to ask / and I shall give the all
things. But my people gave no head to my voice / Israel regarded me nothing
at all. And I left them to their own folyshe hardenes of their hertes / and
they wrought after their own inue^cio^s. Oh / that my people had herd me? Oh
yt Israel had walked in my ways. How shortly tha^ had I cast down their
enemies / and had brought back my hand upon their vexers? Also other nations
that hated the lord had been subdued to them / but their prosperity should
have ever florysshed. God should have fed them with the flower of whete / and
I would have satysfyed them with honey flowynge out of the very stonnes.

were distroied in the field of Ender / where the carions lay stinkynge like a
donghyll upon therth. Serve the ouermost of these ungodly like the kings of
Oreb and zeeb / and like zebach / and zalmuna / which all were tyrants.
Which said / let us challenge unto us / the cytyes of god for our heritage. Oh
god / bring these men unto this point / to be like a turnynge whele and like
the stuph of he^pe cast in the wind. And as the fire ronneth in thycke roten

with thy storms / and make them astonned fearfully with thy sudden
whirlwynde. All to shame them casting them in to ignomynye / that yet so (and
it may be) they might seek thy name.

Let them be confounded and amassed for ever / let them be laden with
opprobrye that they might peryshe.

That they might yet thus know the to be god alone / and that thy name is full

This is a prayer wheri^ the sayer prays that he might live innoce^tly and
safe from his enemis. The title of this Psalm. The prayer of David.

INclina domine. Bow down thine ear / oh lord) and answer me / for I am
full poor and full of trouble.

Keep my life for I study to be good / save thou thy seruante / my god / for
he trusts in the without any doubt.

Have mercy upon me / lord / for I call unto the daily. Make glad the mind
of thy seruante / for unto the (oh lord / lift I up my heart. Uerily thou /
lord / thou art both gentle and merciful / thou berest a ple^tuouse good will
to al ye call upon the. God / here my prayer / and receive my deep desyer. When
I am in trouble I call upon the / for thou were wont to here me. Among all
the gods is there not one to be compared unto the / neither is there any of
them that may do such things as thou do. All the nation which thou have
made / shall come and worship the oh lord god / and shall extolle thy name.
For right great art thou which also do marvelous things / thou art god
alone. Teache me thy ways / lord / that I may live of thy faith / knytte my
heart unto the / that it may fear the.

I shall magnifye the / O lord my god / with all my heart I shall sprede thy
gloriouse name for ever. Full great verily have thy merciful goodness ben ever
toward me: for thou delyuerdest my soul even from the nethermost hell.

Oh god / the proud ungodly made insurrection against me / and the cruel
congregation of violente men seek my life / which have no respect unto the.

But yet you / lord / you art prone unto mercy / thou art ready to favor and to
forgive / slow unto wrath / swi^myng in mercy and faithfulness. Behold me and
have mercy upon me / give thy strength unto thy seruante / and preserve the
son of thy hand maiden. Do good unto me openly / that they that hate me
might be ashamed to se yt thou lord / helpest and confortest me.

DOmine deus salutis. Oh lord god the author of my health / I have cried unto

I am reputed as one to be cast into the proytte / even as a man without all
strength I was laid to the dead me^ / as one free from the world / and like
men slain slepynge in their graves out of mind / as a cast away from thy
hand. Thou haste put me in to the nether dyche / even in to derke and deep
dongens. Thy hot indygnatyon lay upon me / and thou ouerwhelmedest me with
all thy flodes. Sell. Thou made men that knew me to fly my company / thou
causedest me to be eschewed of the^ / I am closed in and may not out go. My
face is wrinkled and dried up with sorrow / I called upon the daily / I
stretched forth my hands unto the. Shalt thou work thy miracles with the
deed men? or shall the buried men arise again and praise the? Selah. Shall thy
mercy be publisshed in me^nes graves? and thy faithfulness in our departing.
Shall thy miracles be known in derknes? and thy rightwysnes in the forgetful
land? But yet I / o lord) cry unto the / and in the morning my prayer came
before the. Wherefore / oh lord) put test thou away my soul / and turnest thy
face fro me? I was tormented in mind and in a manner deed / even from my youth
was I pressed down with thy fear / and sythen ever it has continued.

Thy wrath peersed me through / thy fere has dygged me through. Anguysshe and
trouble has closed me in daily like / waters / and have compassed me round

and thus my acquaintance thou hyddest fro me.

The argument into the.lxxxix. Psalm.
In this Psalm. is declared goodly and at large the new and old Testament or
couenaunte which is smytten by Christ the son of David between god and his
chosen never to be broken / and that under the figure of David and of his
posterite. For a declaration of the first part of this Psalm. and knowledge of
these two words merci and faithfulness / ye shall understand that god of his
mercy and goodness first promyseth / and for his truths sake he performs it
/ which faithful performynge / the prophet calls faythfulnes. wherefore these
two words / mercy and faythfulnes / are come^ly joined together in the Psalms
The title of the Psalm. The song of Ethan.

MIsericordias domini. The mercy of the lord shall I praise in my song
perpetually / and thy faythfulnes shall I declare with my mouth into all ages.
For thus thought I with my self / thy mercy shall be p^pared ever to cont^nue /
and thy faithfulness also to encrese in the very heue^s. I smit hands with my
chosen / and swore unto Daued my servant. I shall stablishe his posterite with
encrese to stand for ever / I shall set fast his seat regal i^to al ages. Se.
Heavenly me^ shall celebrate and publishe thy marvelous deeds / oh lord /
sai^tes shall sprede thy faithfulness in the congregation. For what man in the
clouds may be compared to the lord? or who among the gods may be lykened
unto the lord. God is greatly dreded i^ the co^gregacyon of his saints / and
greatly to be feared among the^ which are about hi^. Lord the god of hosts who
is like the in power? oh lord / all things about the ar faythfulnes. Thou
declarest thy power eue^ upon the proud see / and swagest her high waves.
Thou have smyt down and all to broken Egypt / with thy strong power thou haste
dispersed thyn enemies. Heue^s ar thine the earth is thine / the round world
with all that therein is / thou haste made them. The north and the southe thou
have made them / Thabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name. Thou haste an
exceeding strength / thou strengtheneste thy hand and lyftest up thy
ryghthande.

In rightwisnes and equite thy seat is set / mercy and faithfulness go before
thy face. Happy is ye people / oh lord / yt knows the voice of the
tro^pettes / they yt are endued with the favor of thy presence shall in enter.
They shall rejoice upon thy name daily / and for thy ryghtwisnes they shall
lift up their selves.

For thou art the glory of their strength and for thy good wylles sake thou
shall extol our power. The lord is our prince and our shylde / it is our king
yt makes holy Israel. Than thou spokest in a visyon to thy sai^tes / saying.
I have set up a mightty man to be an helper / I have lift up a chosen man out
of my people. I have found my servant David / with my holy oyntmente have I
anointed him. That my hand should be fast with him / and that my arms should
strengthen him.

His adversaries shall not begyle him / a shrewde man shall not vex him.

I shall smite together his adversaries before his face / and his haters shall I
distroy. My mercy and my faythfulnes are with hi^ / and i^ my name shall his
power be exalted. I shall throw the sea under his power / and the floudes
shall be at his commandment. He shall call upon me saying / my father art thou
/ my god / my saving defense. Ye / I shall set him to be my first begote^
child / to be above the kings of therth. Into everlasting shall I lay up my
mercy for him / and I shall be faithful in promise unto him. I shall bring it so
to pass that his sede shall ever endure / and his seat regal shall stand as
long as ye heuens abide. But if his children shall forsake my law / and live
not after mine ordinance. If they shall defyle my ceremonies / and will not
observe my commandments. With a rod than shall I punyshe their sins /
and with beatynges shall I reward their iniquites. But yet my mercy shall I not
take from him / neither will I deceive him of my promise. I shall not frustrate
my bargayne / neither will I change that thing which is ones gone forth of my
mouth. Ones I swore be my holiness / and in no manner of wise shall I deceive
David. His seade shall ever continue / his seat regal shall abide before me
like the son. It shall endure as fast to stand as the moon / which is in
the clouds a sure forshewer of the time. Sell. But yet thou have repelled /
thou have abhorred and turned away thy face in thy gre^ anger from thy
anointed. Thou haste had no consyderacyon of thy couenaunte smytten with thy
servants / thou have cast down his diadem to the ground. Thou have cast
down his walls / and turned his strong defe^ces i^to his great fear They
plucked and tore him / as many as passed foreby / he was brought to this state
/ that even his own neighbors had him for a laughyng stock. Thou
maintenedest the righthande of the^ that assailed hi^ / all his enemies thou
made glad Uerily even thou bluntedest the edge of his sword / and would
not help him in battle. Thou made an end of his dignyte / and his seat
regal thou threwest down into the earth. Thou cuttest of the days of his
youth / and couerdest him with ignomynie. Selah.

How long / o lord) shall thou thus co^tynually turn the away? shall thy
ho^e indygnatyon brenne thus still like fire? Remember of how few days I am /
have thou made all men in vain? For what man is there which must not dye?
may there any man deliver his life from the power of his grave? Selah. Where
are those thy mercys showed of old time past oh lord / which thou sworest
unto David of thy faith? Remember thy rebukes which are laid upon thy
servants / o lord) I received into mine own bosom all the rebukes of much
people.

With the which thy enemies reuyled us / oh lord / they reuyled even thy
anointed / because he tarried so long.

Praised be the lord for ever more.

In this ps. Moses co^playneth of this vain present life: and desires the
favor of god to prospere tho things which he has begone. The title. The
prayer of Moses / the man of god.

DOmine refugiu^. Lord thou have ben a refuge or sanctuary for us / and that
at all times. Before thy hills were brought forth / and the earth round about
was prepared / from worlds unto worlds / thou art god. Thou ledest back man
until he be old / and than thou say / turn ye back again o mortal men.
For a thousand years are before the / even as yesterdaye / which are now past
as one of the watches of the night. Thou make them to slide down all at ones
like a sodeyn great rain / they are like a dream / and like a flower anon ar
they changed. Which florisheth in the morning / and receives fresshe beauty
/ at evening it is cut down and withred. Uerily we are wasted with thy
wrath / and with thy feruente indignatyon ar we thrown down.

Thou haste laid our iniquyties before thy face / and our offenses haste thou
set in the light of thy presens. All our days (thou being angry) shall slide
away / our years go away like a thought. The days of our years ar threscore
and ten / and we be somewhat strong / they are four score / and the best of
them are passed in sin and heaviness / swiftly we must fly away. What man
knows the power of thy wrath? but like as men fear the / so feel they thy
indignation. Wherefore show us plainly the no^bre of our days / that our heart
might get some wisdom. Turn the lord / how long? be pleased / set thy
heart at rest with thy servants. Fill us anon with thy mercy / and we shall
tryumphe and rejoice all our days. Make us glad for the days in ye which thou
have scourged us / and for ye years in the which we suffered afflyctio^s. Let
thy work shine upon thy servants / and thy beautefull magnifycence upon their
children. The glorious majesty of the lord our god be over us / and make you
to prospere / what so ever we go about / what so ever we begin make it to
succeed luckely.

The argument into the.lxxxxi. Psalm.
Here it is declared how sure that man is / and how fre from all yuels which
commits him self with a fast faith unto god.

QUi habitat in. Who so ever sytteth in the secret help of the most highest /
and abides fast under the shadow of the all mighty / for all alone
suffycient. He shall say to the lord / thou art my trusty defense and my
castle / my god / I shall cleue unto him. For he will deliver me from the snare
of the hunters / and from their deedly pestylence. He will cover ye with his
feathers / and thou shall be sure under his wings / defended with his faithful
promise / as with bucler and shylde.

Thou shall not need to be afraid of night bugges / neither of the arowes that
fly by day. Neither of the poison pestyle^ce that crepeth in the derke / nor
yet of the deuylyshe distroyer in the clear mydday. There shall fall of thy
left side a thousa^de / and of thy right hand shall there fall ten thousand /
but such falls shall not come nyghe the. For thou only shalt behold these
things with pleasure / and shalt se these ungodly quyted again. For thou
lord / thou art my hope / thou have set the most highest to be my refuge. No
disease shall come a nygh the / nether any plage shall happen unto thy house.
For he has commanded even his angels to be with the / and to keep the
dilygently in all thy ways. Which shall bear ye up with their hands /
onelesse thou smytest thy foot against any stone.

Thou shalt walk upon lions and venomous edders / and shalt tread under thy
foot the lyo^s whelps and dragons. Because he has trusted in me / I shall
deliver him / I shall give him the over hand because he has knowleged my
name. He shall call upon me and I shall answer him: I shall be present with
him in tribulation / I shall defend him / and shall endue him with dignytie.

I shall fill him with long life / and shall give him my saving health.

In this psalm is expressed / that in the Sabbath day is the chef oportunite
to praise god. The title of this psalm. The ditye of the song which serves for
the Sabbath day.

BOnum est confiteri. Now is conuenyent time to magnify the lord / and to
sprede thy name with praise / oh thou most highest.) To sing erly thy mercy
and thy faithfulness in the night season. And that upon ten stringed
instruments / upon the lute / the psaltry / and upon the harp. For thou have
made me glad with thy works / and I shall triumph upon the deeds of thy hands.

How great ar thy deeds / oh lord) meruelouse profounde and unsearchable are
thy counsels and thy thoughts.

A dull man shall not know this thing neither these shrewde fools shall
understand them. That is to say even these / whiles the ungodly shall
flourisshe like the flower / and all that are addycte unto wyckednes / shall be
given to sprede them self / to the intent they should be blown away for ever.

Than art thou full high to abide in to everlasting / oh lord.

For lo / thy enemies / o lord / for lo / thy enemies perysshe / they are
distroyed who so ever were given to wyckednes.

But thou shalt lift up thy horn like an unicorn / I shall be anointed and
soupled to be made fresshe and lusty again. I shall se my desyer fall upon my
await-layers / and mine ear shall hear that I longed for of those me^ which
pursued me The rightwisman shall florisshe like the palm tree / and shall
excede in strength like the Cedres of Lybani.

They are planted in the house of the lord / and shall flourisshe in the four
porches of our god. Ye / and even now in their old age / shall they yet be
fruitful / fresh and full of lively sap.

To declare / how indyfferent and rightwyse is the lord / my strong defense
in whom is there no shrewdness.

This psalm setteh forth the majesty of god of the creatyon of the world /
and throwynge down of the gentyles most of all be to dreded.

THe lord is king / his majesty is gloriouslye deckte: the lord has done
upon himself strength / and has girte himself mightily. He has verily
builded and set fast the round world / so that it shall not be moved. Thy
seat was prepared in season: but thou thy self art of everlasting. The
floudes are risen / o lord) the floudes have rored / the floudes have lift up
their stremes. Above the noise of the meruelouse stormy and troubled see /
meruelouse is the lord which has his resydence above. Thy words are
certain and very faithful / thy house is right fair / holy / and goodly /
the secret holy place of the lord shall stand into full long times.

The argument into the.lxxxxiiij. psalm.
In this Psa. the prophet calls in the judgment of god against the ungodly /
the oppressors of innocents and poor afflycte: and threteneth them to not
know tho things that here are done.

DEus vlcionum. Lord / god / the revenger of sins / god the punissher of
sins / shine upon us.

Lift up and show forth thy self / o judge of the earth / acquyte these proud
me^ / and give them their reward. How long shall these ungodly / oh lord?
how long shall these ungodly thus prosper and rejoice? Shall they thus prate
and speak proudly? shall they thus boost themself / these men addicte and all
given to wickedness? They oppress thy people / oh lord / they scourge them
whom thou chalengest of right heritage. Pore wydowes and strangers they slay /
and young fatherles children they put to death. And they think that the lord
se not these things / nether that the god of Jacob perceyueth them. Se that ye
have understanding ye foles among the people / and ye sottes when at the
last will ye wexe wise?

He yt made the ear / how should he not here? and he that facyoned ye eye /
how should he not se? He that chastyse all nacyons and gives knowledge to the
men / shall he not correct you? The lord knows even the very thoughts of
me^ / and that they are vain and naught. Blessed is the man whom thou / o
lord / techest and chastynest / and instructest him in thy law. That thou
might set him at rest in a troubelouse season / even than whiles the pytte
is yet a dyggynge for the ungodly. For the Lord shall not cast away his
people / neither will he forsake them / he has taken up into his heritage.

For yet shall judgment be joined with rightwysnes / this rightwysnes shall all
men right in heart follow.

What man will rise for me against the ungodly? who will stand with me against
these workers of wickedness. Except ye lord had helpte me / my soul had
shortly dwelled in the place of silence. But when I thought / now my foot is
slyden away / than thy mercy / oh lord / held me up. These manyfolde and
careful thoughts brent me not within so soore / but thy consolatyons
refresshed again my soul much more. For what have thou to do with the fear
of these flareryng dissemblers? whose manner is to feign injuries. They clustred
and were wrapped togider against the just man's soul and they shed
deuelisshly the i^noce^tes blood But the lord shall be a castle for me / in
which I may be safe / and my god is my rock sto^ne in whom I may be defended.
And he will acquyte them their wickedness / and whiles they ace about to hurt
other with wrong / he shall distroye the^ / the lord our god shall distroye
them.

This Psalm is a bydynge to honor God ernestly and to magnifye his name.

UEnite exultemus. Come and let us triumph / let us make melody to the lord /
the defender of our health.

Let us haste to come in to his presence with praise giuynges / let us sing
unto him with hymns. For the Lord is a right great god and king over all
gods. In whose hand are the deep secrets of the earth / and the highthes of
the hills. The sea is his / for he made it / and al contained therein his
hands have facyoned. Come therefore and let us worship / and fall down upon
our knees before the Lord our maker.

For he is our god / and we are the people of his pasture / and the flock
whom he dryueth / if we this day give head and believe his word.

Se that ye harden natte your hertes as they did in the deserte of Merybah /
in the time of temptacyon.

When your fathers tempted and provoked me / and yet they se my works. Forty
years I chydde with the nacyon / and I said / this people erreth in their

Unto whom I swore i^ mine anger / they shall never entrr i^ to the land of my

right great is the lord and worthy much praise / he is to be feared before all
gods. For all the gods of the people are naught / it is the lord that has

In this Psalm David prophesyeth of the kingdom of Christ.

in rightwisnesse and equity.

Fire goth before him / and brenneth his enemies round about him. His
lyghtnynges smite the world roundabout / ye earth saw them / and trembled for
fear. Hills melted away like wax at the presens of the lord / they melted
even from the presens of the lord of all the earth. The heuens showed forth his
xightwysnesse / and all the people saw his gloriouse beauty. Let them be
shamed who soever worship carved images / which also glory in feigned pyctures
of naught / ye gods all / se that ye fall down and worship him. Syon have
herd and is glad the cities of Judah reioise i^ thy iugeme^t^ oh lord. For thou
/ lord / art higher tha^ all men of therth / and far exalted above all the
gods. Ye that love the Lord / se that ye hate evil / he keeps the lives of
his saints / and delyuereth them from the hands of the ungodly.

The lord has declared his saving health / he has opened and set forth

He reme^breth his mercy and his faithful promise to be performed upon the
house of Israhell. All the costs of the earth have seen the saving health /
which our god has brought. Make ye melody to the lord al therth / lift up
your voice triumph and sing ye. Singe ye to the lord with harp / play upon

bread / and lycke in my tears instead of drink. And all is for thy
indignacion and thy wrath / for wha^ I was a loft ethou threwest me down. My
days are vanyshed away like a shadow / and I my self am wythered like hay.
But thou lord syttest still for ever and thy memorial endures in every age.

Thou shalt rise and have pety on Syon / for it is time for the to favor it /
for the day appointed is now come. For the stones of it please thy servants
verily / and they favor her soil. Even the haythen also shall worship the name
of the Lord / and all the kings of the earth shall knowledge thy glorious beauty.
The lord verily shall bylde Syon / he shall be seen in his beauteful glory. And
he shall have respect unto the prayer of the pore forsaken / his prayer shall he
not despise. This thing shall be written for the world to come / and for his
cause the people which are yet unmade shall praise the Lord.

For he shall look forth of his high holy place / the Lord even from heaven
shall behold the earth. To here the syghes of them that are in bonds / and to
lose the children iuged to death. That they might preach the name of the Lord
in Syon / and his praise in Jerusalem. When the people and the kingdoms shall
be gathered together to worship ye lord. He abated my courage in my journey /
and has cut of my days.

I say ^ my god take me not away in the mids of my days / for thy years
endure through out all ages. In the begi^ning thou laydest the foundation of the
earth / and the heuens are thy handy work. They shall perish when thou shall
stand fast / and all things shall ware old like a garment / you shall dress
them again like a garment and they shall be changed. But thou art even thine
own self / and thy years shall never be ended.

The children of thy servants shall dwell still and their posterite shall live
prosperously and blessedly in thy presens.

The argument in to the.C.iii. Psalm.
In this Psalm the Prophet prayseth the goodness of god toward men / which
forgyueth their sins and gives them plentuously the goodness both of body and
soul. wherefore he exhorts both men and angels / and all creatures to praise
god. The ditie of David.

BEnedic ai^a. Praise thou the lord o my soul / and all that are within me /
praise his holy name. Praise thou the lord o my soul / and forgete not his
benefytes. Which forgyueth the all thy iniquities / and heleth all thy
deseases. He redimeth thy life from perdicyon / and heapeth upon the on every
side his mercy and gentleness. He fylleth thy soul with goodness and renueth thy
yougth like an Egle. Of rightwysnes and equite / he restores all men that
suffer wrong.

He has made his ways known to Moises) and his deeds to the children of
Israel. The lord is prone unto mercy and be^te unto favor / he is slow unto
wrath / and plentuous in goodness. He shall not chyde always / neither keep
hatred in mind ever to be aue^ged. He has not deelt with us after our sins
/ neither rewarded us according to our iniquytes. But look how high heue^s
ar over the earth / even so high has he made his mercy to prevail over the^
that worship him And look how far the eest is from the weest / even so far
has he set our sins from us. Look how the fathers heart yerneth upon his
children / even so does the lord pety them that fear him. For he knows of
what frail metal we are / he remembers full well that we are but duste. The
days of man ar like grass / for as a flower of the field he florissheth for a
time. Whom when the wi^de has ouerblowe^ / by and by is it gone / and his
place where he was knows hi^ no more. But the mercy of the lord endures
from worlds unto worlds over them that fear him / and his ryghwysnes
stretches to their chyldres children. Unto those which keep covenant with him
/ and hold in mind his commandments / to thentent they would do them. The
lord has set fast his seat regal in the heuens / and all things are
subject unto his kingdom. Praise the lord / ye which are his messagers
valiant in power which do his commandments obeynge him at a word.

Praise ye the lord all his host / ye that are his mynisters which do his
pleasure. Praise ye the lord all his works / ye / and that in every place of
his dominion.

The argument in to the.C.iiij. Psalm.
This Psalm. is a praise wherein the Prophet magnifyeth god of the creation of
the world / and of the merciful governance thereof.

BEnedic. Praise you ye lord my soul oh lord my god thou art greatly to be
magnifyed / thou have ornoured thy self with fame / clerenesse / and glory.
Thou deckest thy self with light as with a garment / thou stretchest out the
heuens like a cortayne.

He lays the bemes of his tabernacles above in the waters / he him self is
carried in the clouds / he flies on his journey with the wings of the wind.

He uses blastes of wind for his messagers / and for his ministers he has
the flaming ^yer. He laid the foundation of the earth ^ast stayed / of her own
self / so that she shall not rele for ever.

Thou have wrapped it in / with the deep see like as with a garment / for even
upon the hills waters shall stand.

They fled when you blamedest them / and fell down suddenly at the noise of thy
tho^derynge. The hills apered all alofte / the plain feldes lay beneth at
their place assygned them. Thou have lymyted them their bounds which they
over pass not / unless they return / ouerflowe therth. He sends forth
quycke sprynges into ryuers which ren down between the hills. Whereof drink
the wild beestes / and wild asses slack their thyrste.

Nyghe these sweet flodes the fowls of thayer have their seats / and sing
among the bows. He watreth the hills even from his over parlers / with the
plentuousnes of thy works thou satisfyest therth. He makes ye grass to
spryng and to grow into fother for catall / and the corn also by man's labor
and toyli^ge / whereby he mit get living out of the ground. As wine which
makes merry man's heart / and oil which makes man's face fresshely to
shine / and bred which susteineth thart of man The trees of the lord ar
refresshed / even the Cedres of Lybani which he planted. In the which the
birds nestle / and y^ Curl^ has their her nest. The high hills ar a refuge
and socour for ye wild gotes / and the stonney rocks for the hares.

He made the move to show the apoi^ted festes (the son knows when he shall
go down. Thou bryngest derkenesse upon / to make the night / and than they go
to their relefe / the wild beestes of ye wodes. As the lyo^s roryng for their
proie so to ask their meat of god.

The son risen / they are hyd again / and are laid down in their dens.

But man goth forth to his work and unto his labor / until the evening.

Oh / how excellent are thy works / o lord? all things wisely haste thou
made / the earth swymmeth in thy goodness.

This see is great and of marvelous large bredthe / there are things crepynge
with out nombre / and things that have life both great and small.

There sail ships / and there go these whales which you have made theri^ to
play. All things wait upon the / that thou should give them meat in time.

When thou have given it the^ / than they gather / and when thou have opened
thy hand / than ar they well satisfied with good fode. When thou turnest away
thy face / than are they astoned / when thou gathrest in their breath / than
are they deed and returned into earth.

And again when thou breathest upon them / than are they created a new: and
thus renuest thou the face of therth.

The glorious beauty of the lord stands for ever / the lord shall ever
rejoice of his works. He beholds therth and it trembles: he touches
thylles and they smoke. I shall sing unto ye lord whiles I live I shall sing
unto my god as long as I shall have my being. My speech might be sweet unto
hi^ / I shall rejoice i^ the lord. Let the si^ners be consumed upon therth /
and the ungodly also / until that non be left a live. oh my soul praise thou
the lord.

LOVE IE THE LORD.

The argument into the.C.v. Psalm.
Here the Prophet exhorts to the praise of god in his holy congregacyon at
the Arche / the ernest of his promise of the land of Canaan.

COnfttemini. Magnifye ye ye lord and call upon his name / put the people in
mind of his wonderful deeds. Sing unto him and make ye melodye / show forth
all his meruelouse works. Gloriously sprede ye a broad his holy name / their
hertes might be glad that seek the lord. Seek ye the lord dilygently / and
his mighty seat also / seek ye his face always. Remember his acts which he
has done / his wonders and iugementes which are gone forth of his mouth.

Oh / ye seed of Abraham which are his servants / oh ye children of Jacob his
chosen. The lord / he is our god / which optayneth the rule over all the
earth. He remembers his promise through al ages / that his bargayne might
stand in to thousand generacyons. Which he smyt with Abraham / and swore
unto Isaac. Which he put to Jacob for a law / and to Israhell into a
perpetual couenaunte. When he said / unto the I give the land of Canaan /
the lot and porcyon of thine inheritance. Even when they were but a few sely
men and strangers therein. Going from nacyon to nacyon / from their own
realm to a another people. He suffered not any man to do them wrong / and for
their pleasures he chastysed eue^ the kings. Se therefore that ye touch not my
anointed / neither hurt ye my prophets. He brought an hungre upon the land /
and wasted all their yearly corn. He sent before them a man / eue^ Joseph
sold into bondage.

They tormented his fete with fetters / and his body was cast into yerns.

Untyll his deed came i^to light / the word of gods own mouth restored him
tried with fire like gold.

The king sent and delivered him / and the gouerner of the people did lose
him. He made him ruler of his house / and the dysposer of his goods.

To correct his nobles at his pleasure / and to teach his sage men wisdom.

And Israhell after this is comen in to Egypt / and Jacob became a stranger in
the land of Ham. And god encresed his people excedyngly / and made them
stronger than their adversaries.

And afterward turned the hertes of these men / and made them to hate his
people / and to work disceyte with his servants. And than he sent the^
Moses his servant and Aharon his chosen.

These men showed his miracles among them / and wonders in the land of Ham.
He cast upon them derknesse / and made derke Egypt / and they did not
against his words.

He turned their waters in to blood / and slew their fysshes.

Frogs crepte euerywhere in their land / even in the kings bed chambres.

He did but say the word / and there came swarms of flies and lyse in to all
their costs. Instead of rain he gave the^ hayle stones / and lightening in
their land. He smyt their vynes and fygtrees / and broke down their trees in
their coostes.

He spoke the word / and there came hot flies / and devouring worms
without nombre. Which devoured and bre^te up all the grass in their land /
they eat up the fruit in their feldes. He smyt also every first begoten that
they had / even the first fruits of their wedlock. But he led forth his
chosen / endued with silver and gold / and there was not one in their trybes
that was sick. Egipte reioysed in their forth goinge / for they were a frayde
to hold them any longer. He stretched forth a cloud which covered them / and
sent the^ fire to lyghten them by night. They asked / and their came quayles
and he filled them with heavenly food.

He opened they in the stony rock / and their flowed out waters / the floudes
ran down ye wilderness. For he remembered his holy promise / and also his
servant Abraham. And he led forth his people in great joy / and his chosen with
great triumph. And he delivered them the lands of the gentyles / and they
chale^ged unto them the labors of the flock by right heritage. To thentente
they would observe his ceremonies / and keep his laws also.

LOVE IE THE LORD.

The argument into the.C.vi. Psalm.
The people of god scatered among diverse nacyons of the gentyles for their
sins: exhort themself to praise the goodness of god laydforth always to the^
that seek him. The title of this Psalm. Love ye the lord which has his
beginning of him self / and all other creatures have their beginning of him.

COnfitemini. Magnifye ye the lord / for he bears us good mind / and his
mercy is set forth for us into euerlasti^ge Who may express ye noble acts of
the lord / who may declare all his praises Blessed are they that observe
equytie / and study to do right at all times.

Remember me / oh lord) according to thy good will promised to thy people /
vyset me with thy saving health / which thou have promised. That I might delight
in beholdynge the prosperyte of thy chosen that I might rejoice in the
gladness of thy folk / and that I might glory with thy people / who^ thou
haste claimed to be thy right heritage. We are siners like as our fathers were
/ we have committed wickedness and have done ungodly. Our fathers in Egipte
regarded not thy miracles / neither remembered they thy manyfolde goodness: they
rebelled at the sea even at the red see. And yet he saved the^ for his names
sake / to magnifye his gloryouse power. He rebuked roughly the red see and it
was vpdried / and he led them through the depth like as through a deserte. He
preserved them from the hands of their adversaries / and redeemed them from the
power of their enemies.

And the waters overwhelmed their adversaries / so that not one of them was
left a live. Than believed they his words / and song forth praise unto him.
But full sone after forgote they his works / they would not abide his
pleasure. They were set a fire with lust in the deserte and they tempted god in
the wyldernes. And he gave the^ their aski^ge / but with it he cast their
bodies into a consu^ptyon. They enuyed Moses and angered hi^ in their tents /
and Aharon also the lords saint. Therth opened her self and swalowed in
Dathan / and supte up the congregation of Abyram. Fire consumed their feloshyp
/ the flame burnt up thun godly. They made a calfe in Horeb / and worshipped the
cast idol And they turned his beautiouse glory i^to the symilytude of an ox
that eats grass.

They had forgotten god their sauyoure / even him which did so great things
for them in Egypt.

They forgot the miracles in the land of Ham / even the terryble acts /
which he wrought in the red see.

And he thought to have banisshed them had not Moses his chosen put forth
himself a speker for them reconsyled these of broken / and peasyng his heavy
indygnation unless he shu^^^ have distroyed them After this they dispysed that
land so worthy to be desired / neither had they any faith to his promise.

They murmured in their tabernacles / they gave no head to the lord.

And he lyfted up his hand against the^ to throw them down in the
wyldernes. Ye / to cast down their posteryte among the gentyls / and to
scater them into the regio^s. They were addicte and married unto Baalpeor / and
they eat the ded sacrifyces. They provoked him to anger with their own
inuencyons / and vengeance crept in and sprede among them

Tha^ stepte forth Pinchas and aue^ged gods quarrel and held back the
vengeance. Which fact was a lowed him for a rightwyse deed throwout all ages
into everlasting. They provoked god also at the waters of their grugynge
against saye^g / and Moses was punisshed for their sakes. For they troubled
and vered his mind / and he spoke a mysse with his mouth.

Neither would they distroye the gentyls as the lord commanded them.

They meddled and married with the gentyls and learned their works. They
worshypt their carved images which turned them to co^fusyon. Also they slew
their own sons and daughters / offringe them up to sacrifyces to devils.
They shed thinnocent blood / even the blood of their own sons and
daughters who^ they slew and offered to the Idols of Canaan / and the earth was
polluted with the blood.

They were defiled through their own works / and they were vnshamfased in
their own deeds. And the wrath of the lord was kyndled against his people /
and he turned his face from his heritage.

And he betoke them into the hands of the gentyles / and they that hated the^
were become their rulers. And their enemis oppressed them / and subdued them to
their power. Many times he delivered them and yet they rebelled his pleasur /
and were worn out with their own wickedness. And he beheld when they were
sore laid against / and herd their lamentacion. He remembered his promise unto
them / and of his great goodness he turned himself from indygnation. And he
brought it to pass / that even they which held them in captiuyte had pytie
upon them.

Save us lord our god / and separate us from the gentyles / that we might
publissh thy holy name / and praise the i^ thy laudable deeds. The lord of
Israhell be praised from worlds and in to worlds / and all people might say.
Amen. Praise ye the lord.

The argument into the.C.vij. Psalm.
Here tho Prophet declares all aduersyte to be sent in / and to be taken away
also of god only.

COnfitemini. Magnify ye ye lord / for he is gracious and of good mind
toward us / and his goodness stands forth for us for ever. Let them that are
redeemed of the lord / even the^ whom he has losed from so narowe strai^tes
praise him Whom he has gathered from the parts of therth / as from the Est
and west / from the north and south. For when they err from the way in the
desert / and find no town inhabited. And for honger and thyrst their soul
famysheth in them They cry to the lord in such a narawe straynte / and he
delyuereth the^ from their distress. And leads them into the right way /
which brings the^ to the cite inhabited Of this they magnifye the lord for
his goodness / they publyshe his marvelous deeds among men. As wha^ he
satisfies a thristy soul / and replenysheth an hungry soul with good
sustinaunce.

But they that sit in derkenes / and in the shadow of death / in afflyction /
and yerne. Because they rebelled against the words of god / and casted away
opprbriously the counsel of the most highest. Whose hertes he tameth by
afflyction / for they fall and there is not one that will help them. They cry
unto the lord in such narowe straintes / and he delyuereth them from their
distress.

For he ledeth them forth of derkenes / and from the shadow of death / and
breketh of their bands. And than they magnifye the lord for his goodness / and
publyshe his meruaylous acts among the men. When he had broke the doors of
stele / and distroyed the bars of yerne.

Foles for their sins / and wikednesses are scurged. Their mind abhors
all manner of meat / they are brought even to dethes door. And they cry unto
the lord in to their narowe strainte / and he delyuereth them from their
distress.

For he commands with a word / and heals them / and delyuereth them from
destruction now bey^ge at hand.

And tha^ they magnifye the lord for his goodness / and publyshe his marvelous
acts among men.

They offer unto him the sacrifyce of praise / and show forth his works with
great triumph. They enter into the sea with ships / and labor and strive in
the broad rough waters. They also se the works of the lord / and his
wondrefull things in the deep sees. For at his commandment comes forth the
stormye wind / and lyfteth up the waves of the sea. And they now rise up into
the heuens / and anon they fall down into the depthes / so that their hertes
are clean gone. They are throwe^ here and there / they are tossed / they rele
like dronken men / they are at their wits end. And they cry unto the lord
in this narowe straint / and he through his help delyuereth them out of their
distress. For the stormy wind auoideth / that the sea might be caume and her
waves might be still Than ar they glad that they are at rest / and he leads
them forth unto their pleasant haven. And tha^ magnifye hey the lord for his
goodness / and publishe his marvelous acts among the men. And they extol him
in the congregation of the people / they praise him in the presens of the
elders. He that turns the moist and fruitful soil into a dry deserte / and
caryeth away waters from the thristy earth.

And bri^geth fruitful soil into barons for the offenses of the dwellers
therein. Brings it so to pass / that the dry deserte be turned again in to
moist soil / and waters boil forth of ye chyrsty ground. And there than
sets he these hongry and famisshed men / they prepare them cities to be
inhabited. They sow the feldes / they plant the vynyardes / and they make
fruit and encrese of corn.

He blesses them and they are encresed excedyngly / their catall fail not.

And again / they are mynyshed / and cast down with barons / disease / and
sickness. He makes high princes to be of no reputacyon / and he makes them to
err be wide and strange places.

But in the mean season he lyfteth up ye poor man out of trouble / and makes
hi^ an household like a flock of sheep.

The rightwyse shall fear and be glad / and al men given to shrewdenes shall
stope their mouths. Who is wise? let him observe and mark these things / and
he shall parceyue the goodness of the lord.

The argument in to the.C.viii. Psalm.
In this psalm. the prophet declares how desirous he was to praise god /
both with mouth and instrument. The title of the psalm. The dytie of the song
of Dauyd.

PAratum cor. My heart is full set both to play and to sing a song with my
tongue. Come on Psaltery and harp / for by and by shall I set you in tune. I
shall magnifye the among the people (oh lord / and shall praise the among ye
nations. For thy goodness is so great yt it passes the heue^s and thy
faythfulnes also / yt it lyfteth up it self unto ye clouds Exalte thy self
above ye heuens oh god / and thy glorious beauty over all therth. That thy
well-beloved might be in sauegarde / preserve me with thy right hand and grant
me. God has expressed his mind from his secret holy place / I shall be
glad / and deuyde Shecem / and shall meet out the valey of Succoth. Gilead
is mine / Menasheh is mine / Ephraim is my chief strong hold / Iehudah is my
kingdom. Moab shall be subdued unto me / as a caldren in the which I will wasshe
my fete. Edom shall be unto me like a vile place / wherein I will cast a way my
shoes / upon Philistea will I take my pleasure. Who shall led me in to the
strong defensed city? who shall led me unto Edom? Uerily even thou god which
repellest us / and would not ones go forth with us among our host. Help thou
now us and deliver us from our enemies / for vain is the help of men. In god
we shall strongely prevail / for it is he that shall trede down our enemies.

The argument in to the.C.ix Psalm.
The first part of this Psalm. ar cruel ba^nynges or wisshynges against Doeg
and other flaterers of Sau^e / which with their lies stered him up against
David: In the later part he co^playneth of his own miserable state /
desiring the help of god. The title of this Psalm. The dite of David committed
to the chaunter.

DEus laude^. God in who^ I rejoice and glory / hold not thy self fro me For
the ungodly have opened their mouths against me / and crafty deceyuers have
comuned with me / but with a lyenge tongue. They besege me with odious
co^municacion: and beat me down without cause. For that I loved them / they
hated me again / and yet I pray for them.

They quitte me evil for good / and hatered for love. Set some ungodly ruler
upon him / and let some cruel aduersarye be his superior. So that when he
shall come into judgment / he might go forth like a condemned wretch / and his
own tale for his delyueraunce might condemn him. Let his time be short /
and another ready to take his office.

Let his children be young and fatherles and his wife a careful wydowe.

Let his children be wandryng beggars wretched crauers heuyly / for their
lyui^g put out of their pore cotage.

Let the bribynge usurers catch what so ever he has / and strange men
dispoy^e tho things which he had gotten with great labor. Let there be none
to pity and to help him / neither one yt will favor and socour his young
fatherles children Let his issue be cut of / and his name be done away in one
genetatyon.

Let the vnrightwysenes of his fathers be brought in mind before god / and let
not the sins of his mother be forgote^. But let them be before the lord ever
/ and their memorial be cast out of therthe. Because he thought not to do
mercy / but persecuted and vexed the poor afflicte man to sley him broken in
heart.

He delyted in cursyng / let it therefore fall upon him self / he turned him
from blessyng / let it therefore be far from him. Let him be wrapped in
cursings / as in his clothes / and let them synke in to him like water / and
in to his very bones like oil Let cursynge be as his garment wherewith he be
clothed / and as his gyrdle wherewith he be evermore gyrte.

Let this be the reward from the lord / unto these men which are against me
/ and speak hurt upon my soul.

But thou art ye lord / oh lord / dele with me for thy names sake / for
favorable is thy goodness deliver thou me.

For I am scourged and poor / and my heart laboreth and faynteth within me. I
vanisshe away like a glyding shadow and am hunted up from place to place like
a locust. My knees fold under me for lack of meat / my flesh is gone / my
fatness is lost. I was a laughing stock to as many as se me / they wagged
their heddes at me. Help me lord / my god / keep me for thy mercyes sake.

Let them knowledge yt this is thy hand and that thou / oh lord / haste done
this thing. Let the^ curse / but bless thou / let them rise against me / but
to their own co^fusyon / but yet let thy servant rejoice. Let my adversaries
be lased in with shame / and couerde with confusyon like as with a cloak. I
shall magnyfy the lord dilygently with my mouth / I shall praise him among
many. For he will stand at the poor man's right hand / to keep his soul
from tyrauntes in authority.

The argument into the.C.x. Psalm.
This Psalm. is a song of David wherein he syngeth of the kingdom of Christ
which began in Syon / and from thense it is come forth unto thendes of the
world / and it shall hold until both all the heavenly and erthely creatures
worship Christ / and his enemies be put down to be his footstool. The title
of the Ps. The dite of Da.

DIxit dominus. The lord said unto me / lord / sit on my right hand until I
make thyn enemies thy footstool The lord shall bring forth thy mighty impery
from Syon / exercise thou thy power in the mids of thine enemies. Thy people
shall present themself unto the welwyllynge / in such time as thou shall
declare thy power in the cite / in thy noble and holy cleren^s / even thy
yongons from their mothers womb shall be there present / as thycke as the
fressh morni^ge dew. The lord swore / and he shall not repent him / thou art
the offerer ones for ever to offer thyn own self / according as it was
fygured in Melchizedech. The lord being ever at thy right hand shall smite
down even the kings in time of his wrath. He shall execute judgment upon the
gentyles / and fill all places with their deed caryons / it is he yt shall
smite down the heed that raygneth so wide. But of the troublous water must he
first drink by the way / therefore / than after shall he extolle and lift up
his heed.

The argument into the.C.xi. Psalm.
This Psalm. is a praise in the which the power / wisdom / and goodness of god
ar magnified. The title of this Psalm. Love ye the lord.

COnfitebor. I shall surely magnify the lord with all my heart i^ the counsel of
the rightwyse / and in the congregatyon. Exceeding great are the works of the
lord / which serched dilygently and well thought upon / a man shall find in
them what soever he shall desire. What so ever he does it is solemn and full
of majesty / and his rightwysnes abides for ever. He has brought it to pass
that there shall be a memorial of his miracles / the lord he is gentle /
gracious / and ready to have mercy. He has given a proye to his worshippers:
he has remembered his promise into many worlds.

He declares to his people / with how great power his works were done /
even when he gave the^ the heritage of the ge^tyles. What soever he has done
by his power / they ar faithfulness and equity / what soever he commands it
is faithful. They are made fast to abide in to every age: for they are done
of true faythfulnesse and right judgment.

He has sent redemption to his people / he has commanded that his
couenaunte should be kept holy i^to every world / holy and to be feared is his
name.

The beginning of wisdom is the fere of the Lord / they sauoure right holy
that give dilygence to do his commandments / the praise of these men
contynueth everlasting.

In this Psalm. the prophet declares the perpetual felycitye of them which

Love ye the lord.

BEatus vir qui ti. Blessed is that man that worshippeth the lord / and in his
commandments is ernestly occupied. His issue shall be in great power in therth
the generation of the rightwyse shall prosper. Ple^tuousnes and riches ar i^
his house / and his rightwysnes stands for ever. To the desyrers of rit he
makes light to spring in derknes / for it is he yt is graciouse / bente unto
mercy / and rightwyse. A good man shall deal favorably and freely he will
dispose his goods with judgment. For he shall not slide to fall for ever / a
rightwysman shall be in perpetual remembrance. When he shall here afflyction to
be at hand / he shall nothing fear / for his heart is confirmed / that is to
say stayed in the lord.

His heart is underset / he shall not fere / until he se his desyer fall upon
his enemies. He distributeth and gives forth to ye pore nedy / his
rightwisnesse abides for ever his power shall be exalted with dignitye. All
this shall the ungodly se / and have indygnacyon / he shall grynne with his teth
and shall consume him self / for the ungodly verily shall be dysapoynted of his
desyer.

Here the Prophet exhorts to the praise of god for that he beholds / he
governs / and at his pleasure changes all things / lyftynge up always the
humble men / and restoring the careful wretches. The title. Love ye the lord.

LAudate pueri. Praise ye servants of the lord god / praise ye the name of
the lord. Let the name of the lord be sprede in this time / and into all
worlds to come. From the son risynge unto the down falling / the name of
the lord be praised. High is the lord above all nations / his beautiful glory
is above heue^s Who may be compared to the lord our god / even he that rules
on high?

I mean him which so humbles him self / that he would se all things both
in heaven and earth. Which lyfteth up the pore from the dust / and exalts the
nedy from the donge. To set him with the best / even with the chief of his
people. Which so restores the baren / that she has an house full / and
makes her a glad mother of many children. Praise ye the lord.

The argument in to the.C.xiiij. Psalm.
In this Psalm. the Prophet declares how joyfully Israel was brought out of
Egypt / and touches brefely certain of the chief miracles which the lord
did for them.

IN exitu. When Israel came out of Egypt / the house of Jacob / from the
people of strange tongue.

Judah was gods holy people / and Israel was ye folk over who^ he would have
rule The sea saw the host of god come and she gave back / Iordayne fled and
gave place. The mountayns scipped like wethers / and the hills like the la^mes
of the flock. What ayled the thou see thus to fly? and thou Iordane / why
go thou back? What mean ye mou^tains thus to spri^ge wethers? and ye
hills to play like la^mes. At the presens of the lord the earth must needs
tremble and fear / ye and that at the p^se^s of the god of Jacob. For he
brings the hard rock into a ponde of water / eue^ the very stonne into
plentuous springes.

The argument into the.C.xv Psalm.
In this Psalm. David prays god for glory of his name to do good unto the
people that it might be openly known / him only to be god / and all Images to
be but Idols.

NOn nobis domine. Not to us lord / not to us / but unto thy name give the
glory and praise / for thy mercy / and for thy trouthes sake.

Wherefore should the gentyls say / where is now their god? Wha^ our god is in
ye heue^s / he does what soever lyketh him. Their images are but gold and
silver / even the work of man's hand.

They have mouths and yet speak they not eyes and se not / ears and here not
/ nose and smell not. They have hands and nothing feel they / fete and goo
not / with their throat make they no noise.

Unto these Idols are they like yt make them / and as many as trust unto them.
But Israhell trust thou in the lord / for he helps them and is their shield.

Ye / of the house of Aharon / se yt ye trust in the lord / for he is their
help and their shield. Ye worshippers of the lord / se that ye trust in the
lord / for he is to the^ help and defender.

The lord will have us in mi^de / it is he that will do good / he will do good
to ye house of Israel / and to the house of Aaron. He will be benefyciall to
ye worshippers of the lord / as well to the little as to ye great. The lord
might increase his good mind toward you / toward you and toward your
children.

Ye ar they to whom the lord does good which has made heaven and the earth.

The heue^s / the very heuens ar the lords but the earth has he given to the
children of me^. The deed in no manner of wise shall praise the lord / neither
they that go down to the place of silence.

But we shall magnifye and praise the lord / from this time in to
everlasting. Praise ye the lord.

The argument in to the.C.xvi. Psalm.
This Psalm is a thankful song for the help of the lord / whereby Dauyd
escaped wha^ he was now compassed in of Saules host.

DIleri. I love the lord for he has herd me / he has herd the deep desyers
of my heart. He bowed down his ears unto me / wherefore whiles I live shall I
call upon him.

The sorrowful snares of death held me strayte / strayte anguysshes hampered
me in / anguisshe and afflyction found me. But yet the name of the lord I
called upon I beseech the lord deliver my soul. The lord our rightwyse god is
prone unto favor / he is ready and bente unto mercy. The lord keeps ye pore
si^pleo^s / I was full poor and full of care / and he saved me. Turn the my
soul unto thy rest / for the lord has rewarded the. For thou have delyuerd
my soul from death / mine eyes from tears / and my fete from slydynge. I shall
continue and dwell before the lord among the living men.

I believed / and therefore must I needs speak / but I was fore scurged
therefore. So that I thought and said with my self when I fled so hastily /
every man is a liar What shall I give again to the lord / for all the benefytes
which he has given me I shall take the cup in the thankful fyft for the
help brought me / and I shall call upon the help of the lord.

Now shall I perform my vows unto the lord in the presens of all his
people. Precious is the death of his saints / in the eyes of the lord.

Ye verily lord / for I am thy servant / I am thy servant / and the son of
thy hand maid / even thou have losed my bonds. Unto the shall I make the
sacryfyce of praise / and the name of the lord shall I call upon. Now shall I
perform my vows / before al his people.

In the fore porches of the house of ye lord / in the mids of thy Jerusalem.

The argument in to the.C.xvii. Ps.
In this Psalm. the Prophet prophesyeth the gospel to be preched to the
gentiles.

LAudate dominu^ oe^s. Praise ye ye lord / all gentyls / magnifye him al
nations. For his mercy is sprede over / us / and the faithfulness of the lord
stands for ever.

The argument into the.C.xviii. Ps.
This Psalm is a prayer in which David delivered now from all his afflyctions
/ and promoted to be king of all Israel / openly in the tabernacle of god
gave him thanks / and also laid forth the person of Christ in him self.

COnfitemini. Magnifye ye the lord for he is gracious / and his mercy endures
for ever. Let Israel now magnifye hi^ / for his me^cy e^dureth for ever. Let
the house of Aharon magnifye him / for his mercy endures for / ever.

Let as many as fear the lord magnifye him / for his mercy endures for ever.
When I was in a grievous straynte / I called upon the lord) and he granted to
set me at large. The lord stands on my side / I shall not fear what so ever
man may do unto me. The lord stands on my side with my helpers / and I
shall se my desire upon the^ that hate me. It is beter for one to committee him
self to the tuicion and defense of the lord / than to man's defense.

It is better to put our confydence in the lord / than in men be they never so
great When all the ge^tyles beseged me on every side / well said I / in the
name of the lord / for I shall cut them away.

They compassed me in / ye / they beset me in round about / well said I / in
the name of the lord / for I shall cut them away. They swarmed about me like
bees / and invaded me as fersly as fire yt dry thorns but they were sone
quenched / for I said well / in the name of the lord I shall cut the^ away.
I was cast with great vyolence ready to have fallen / but the Lord sustained
and helpte me.

The lord is my strength and the very same whom I praise / it is he that is my
saving health. The voice of triumph / and of men joyfully publysshynge their
saving help now brought unto them / is in the tabernacles of the ryghtwyse
/ for the right hand of the lord has brot it so mightily to pass. The right
hand of the lord is exellent high / the right hand of the lord has brought
it so mightily to pass. I shall not dye but live / and shall publysshe the
works of the lord. He chastysed him with greuouse and ernest chastemute / but
yet he betoke me not to death. Open ye unto me the gates of the company of
rightwysemen / and I shall enter in at them and magnifye the lord. This is the
gate of the lord / the rightwyse shall enter in thereat.

I shall magnifye the for thou have granted me / and have brought me a saui^ge
help. The stone which the builders opprobriously casted away / is made an head
corner stone Of the lord this is done / and this same thing is a miracle in
our mind. This is yt same day which the lord has made / let us be glad and
rejoice therein. I beseech the / lord / now help us / I beseech the lord make
us now.

Well happen it to that man which is come^ in the name of ye lord / we shall
pray for your welthe to happen unto you from the house of the lord.

The lord is strong / and he will make light to shine upon us / tie your
sacrifyces to be offered / even to the altaris ends with cords. It is thou
that art my god and I shall magnifye the / thou art my god / and I shall
exalte the.

Magnifye ye the lord for he is gracious and his mercy endures for ever.

The argument into the.C.xix. Psalm.
This Ps. declares in how great price and reverence / the saints or holy men
have the laws of god: how ernestly they are occupied in the^ / how they sorrow
to se the^ broken and said against of the ungodly: how they pray to be
taught them of god: and to be acquaynted and accustomed with them / and (to be
short) how they desyer those men to be distroyed (what so ever they be) which
break and say against them.

The first Octonary. Aleph.
BEati immaculati. Blessed ar they which live pure and innocently / even them I
mean which live after the law of the lord. Blessed ar they which observe
his testimonies / and search them with all their heart. For they shall do no
wykednes / that thus trede his ways. Thou have commanded / yt thy
commandments should be kept with earnest delyge^ce. Would god that my life
were so instruct that I might observe thy ordinances. Than should I not be
disapointed / when I shall have al thy commandments before mine eyes. I shall
magnifye the with a pure heart / when I shall learn thy rightwise iugeme^tes.
I shall observe thy ordinances / forsake me not at any time.

The second Octonary. Beth.
How should the young man amend his living? he shall well amend it in
obserui^g thy pleasures. With all my heart have I sought the / suffer me not to
swerve from thy commandments.

In my heart have I hyd thy words / to thentente I would not offend the.
Lord thou art praise worthy / teache me thy ordinances. With my lyppes shall I
show forth all the plesures of thy mouth I shall rejoice of the way which thy
testimonies teach / as upon all manner of riches. Upon thy commandments shall
I set all my mi^de / and shall set thy paths before my eyes. In thy ordinance
shall I delyght / and I shall not forget thy words.

The third Octonary. Gimel.
Reward thy servant / that I may live / and observe thy pleasures.

Uncouer my eyes / that I may perfytly se the marvelous things in thy law. I
am but a stranger in the earth / yet hyde not thy commandments fro me.

My soul is broken with desire / to know at all times thy pleasures. Thou
shalt sharply rebuke the ungodly / cursed are they that err from thy
commandments Take away from me / opprobry and ignominy / for I shall
observe thy testymonyes. Even the chief rulers sit and speak against me / but
yet thy servant is occupied ever i^ thy ordinances. Also thy testymonyes ar my
delyght and my conselers.

The fourth Octonary. Daleth.
My soul cleued to the earth / restore me according to thy promyses.

My life I have showed unto the / and thou have granted me / teache me thy
ordynau^ces Make me to understand the ways of thy commandments / and than
shall I think upon thy merueles.

My soul was melted away with sorrow full thoughts / make me styffe again
according to thy promyses.

Turn thou away fro me the deceytfull way / and make thy law plesaunt unto
me. The true way have I chosen / and thy pleasures have I set before my eyes.
I cleued to thy testymonyes oh lord / let me not be shamed.

I shall ro^ne in the way of thy commandments / for thou shall ease my
heart.

The fyfth Octonary. He.
Teache me / lord / the way of thy ordinances / and I shall mark it for ever.

Give me understanding and I shall keep thy law / I shall keep it with all my
heart. Led me by the pathe of thy precepts / for in it is my pleasure. Bend
my heart into thy testymonies / and not into lucre. Turn away my eyes lest
they behold vain things / in thy way quycken me. Make fast thy promyses to
thy servant which is addicte unto thy worship. Turn away my shame which I
feared / for thy Iugementes are favorable.

Lo / I desired thy commandments / restore me for thy ryghtwysnes.

The syxte Octonary. Uau.
Be present with me / o lord / with thy mercy / come to me with thy help /
according to thy promyses.

That I might have to answer my reuylers / for I stick to thy promises.

Suffer not at any time ye word of troth to be taken fro my mouth / for I have
respect unto thy ordinances.

And I shall observe thy law studiously ever world without end.

I shall go into be at large restrained with nothing / for I have sought thy
commandments. I shall preche thy testymonyes before kings / and shall not be
confounded. But shall delyght i^ thy precepts / which I have loved. I shall
lift up my hands to do thy precepts which I have loved / and shall think
besely upon thy ordinances.

The seventh Octonary. zain.
Remember thy promise to thy servant / into the which y^ have caused me to
trust. Thy promise is my confort in my affliction / for it is it that restores
me.

These proud ungodly have scorned me sore: but yet I swarued not from thy law
I remembered thy iugementes which thou have done even from the begi^nyng / o
lord / and I was well conforted. It kyndled my heart and freted me sore / to
see these proud ungodly thus to forsake thy law. Thy ordynaunces were my
songs / whiles I here way fayred a stranger.

In the night shall I think upon thy name o lord / and I shall observe thy
law. This grace have thou given me / that I might observe thy commandments.

The eight Octonary. Heth.
Thou art my lotte o lord / I am full purposed to observe thy commandments.
I long for thy presens with all my heart / have mercy upon me accordi^ge to thy
promyses. I called to mind my ways / and I turned my fete unto thy
testymonyes. I hasted my self and dyfferred not / to then tente I would
observe thy precepts. The ungodly congregacyon hyndred me sore / but yet did I
not forget thy law. At mydnighte shall I rise up to praise the for thy
rightwyse iugementes.

I assocyate my self with all yt worship the / and with them that observe thy
commandments.

The nynth Octonary. Teth.
Thou have delte favorably with thy servant o lord / according to thy promise.
Learn me rightly to savor and to know / for I believe thy commandments.
Before I was tamed with afflyctyon I erred / but now I mark thy sayenges.
Thou art good and gracious / instruct me in thy ordynaunces.

These proud ungodly framed together their painted lies against me / but I
shall observe thy commandments with all my heart Their gross hertes ar
congeled like talowe / but I shall delight in thy law.

I was happy that thou tamedest me with afflyction / that I might yet so be
instruct in thy ordynaunces.

Better is the law of thy mouth to me / than thousands of gold and silver.

The tenth Octonary. Iod.
Thy hands have facyoned me / and ordained me / give me understanding to
learn thy commandments.

They that fear the shall be glad / to se me so to cleue to thy promyses.

Now know I lord that thy iugementes are right good / and that thou haste
scourged me of a good entente.

But I beseech the let thy mercy be my conforte / accordi^ge to those words
which thou promysedest to thy servant. Let me be in thy favor and I shall
live / for thy law is my delight.

Let these proud ungodly be confounded for they go about to distroy me
fautles / but yet shall I in the mean time set all my mind upon thy
commandments. Let them that worship the and know thy testimonies / turn
unto me.

My heart shall be perfyte in thy ordinances / wherefore I shall not be shamed.

The.xi. Octonary. Caph.
My soul faynted longing after thy saving help / but yet I lift up my eyes
unto thy promyses. My eyes daseled with lokynge up after thy promyses / and I
said / when wylt thou conforte me? I was dried away like a bladder hanged in
the smock / but yet forgete I not thy ordinances. How long shall thy servant
suffer these things? when will you at last give sentence against my persuers
These proud ungodly dygged pitfalles for me which have no respect unto thy
law. All thy precepts ar faithful and true / they persecute me vnworthly /
help thou me. They had almost made an end of me in therth / but yet in no
manner of wise forsook I thy commandments. Restore me for thy mercyes sake /
and than shall I keep the testimonies of thy mouth

The twelfe Octonary. Lamed
Oh lord thy word stands for ever / in the heuens. From generation to
generation continues thy troth / thou haste set therth and it stands still.

The time contynueth still according to thy ordynaunces / for all things are
at thy commandment.

Except thy law had been my delyght / I had peryshed in my afflyction.

I shall never therefore forget thy commandments / for by them thou have
refresshed me. I am thine / save thou me / for I serched thy commandments.

The ungodly wayt to distroye me / but I in the mean time shall endeuer me to
understand thy testimonies.

I perceive that every thing comprehe^syble has an end / but thy
commandments are incomprehensyble.

The.xiii. Octonary. Men.
Oh / how excedyngly have I loved thy law / continually do I think thereof.
Thou have made me wyser than mine enemies / through thy precepts / for they are
ever in my mind. I exceded all me teachers in right understanding / for I am
ever speki^g of thy testimonies. I passed even ye seniours i^ true
understanding / for I observe and mark thy commandments. From every evil
pathe I refrayned my fete / to thentent I would observe thy speches. I have not
swarued from thy pleasures / for thou shall instruct me.

Oh / how sweet are thy speches in my taste / they are sweter than any honey in
my mouth. I fetch my understanding at thy commandments / wherefore I hate
every deceytfully path.

The xiiii. Octonary. Nun.
Thy words ar lantern to my fete / and lyt unto my foot path. I have sworn
and shall perform it / to keep thy just pleasures. I am sore febled with
affliction / lord restore me according to thy promyses. O lord I beseech the
let the well wylli^g sacrifyces of my mouth be accepted / and teach thou me
thy pleasures.

I my self bring my life ever in to peril / but yet the law do I not
forget. These proud ungodly have set snares for me / but yet I swarued not
from thy commandments. I have challenged thy testy moneys for my perpetual
heritage / for they are my hertes joy.

I have bowed down my heart to do thy ordinances / ye / and that for ever
without end.

The.xv. Octonary. Sameh.
The frantyke hardnecked do I hate / and thy law have I loved. Thou art my
lurkynge place and my shylde / I wait for thy promise. Avoid fro me ye
hurtful me^ / and I shall observe the precepts of my god. Stre^gthen me
according to thy promyses that I may live / let me not be shamed disapoynted of
my hope.

Stay thou me / and I shall be saved / and I shall delight busely in thy
ordynaunces Thou shall trede down all that err from thy ordinances / for all
the ^rafty men's study is to deceive with lies.

Like rust thou rubbedest away al those proud ungodly of the earth / wherefore I
loved thy testymonyes. My flesh trembled for fear of the / and I was afraid
of thy iugementes.

The.xvi. Octonary. Ain.
All my mind was to do equite and ryghtwysnes / leave me not to my unjust
vexers. Delyght thy servant with good things / lest these ungodly make me
sorrowful with their injuries. My eyes daseled lokyng up for thy saving help /
and waytyng for the promyses of thy ryghtwysnes.

Deal with thy servant mercyably / and instruct me with thy ordynaunces.

I am thy servant / make me to understand and to know thy testymonies.

It is time / oh lord / to do judgment / for they have scatred abroad thy law.

And therefore I loved thy precepts / above gold and precious stones.

And for this I knowledge all thy commandments to be ryghtwyse / and I hate
every false pathe.

The.xvii. Octonary. Pe.
Marvelous are thy testymonies / wherefore my soul observes the^. To come but
to ye door of thy scripture lyghtneth / and gives understanding to ye
unlearned. I drew in my breath fayntly / for that I labored so sore to attain
unto thy precepts. Behold me and have mercy upon me / accordi^ge to thy
iugeme^tes / wherwt thou gouernest the laws of thy name. Rule my steps after
thy plesures / and suffer no iniquite to have dominion over me. Redeem me from
thiniuries of men / and I shall keep thy commandments.

Make thy cou^tynance to shine upon thy seruante / and instruct me in thy
ordinance. Stremes of wat gusshed out of my eyes because I se me^ not
obserui^ge thy law.

The.xviij. Octonary zadic.
Rightwyse art thou / lord / / and right are thy iugementes. Thou have
commanded in thy testimonies ryghtwysnesse / and faythfulnesse most chefely.

My zele to thy word killed me / because my pursuers forgotte it.

Thy words are purely tried like as with fire / and thy servant loves them.

I was a lytelon / and an abiecte / but yet forgotte I not thy commandments.
Thy rightwysnes is ever lasting right wysnes / and thy laws is ye very
troth. When afflyction and heaviness had taken me / than thy commandments
refresshed me.

The beleuynge of thy promyses is everlasting rightwysnes / give me the
understanding of this thing and I shall live.

The.xix Octonary. Kuph.
I called upon the with all my heart / grant me / lord / I shall observe thy
ordyna^ces. I called upon the / save thou me / and I shall keep thy testemonyes.

I preuente the dawning of the day / and cry unto the / I wait for thy
promises. My eyes prevented the watches / that I might be oc^upyed in thy
pleasures.

Here me lord for thy mercyes sake / quicken me after thy pleasures.

My pursuers laid their own fautes upon my neck / but they are gone far
back from thy law. Thou art present oh lord / and all thy precepts ar the
very self troth. I knew this before of thy testemonyes / for thou haste
stablysshed them to abide for ever.

The.xx. Octonary. Res.
Behold my afflyctyon and defend me / for I forgette not thy law.

Defend my cause and deliver me / quicken me according to thy promyses.
Health is far from the ungodly / for they regard not thy ordynaunces.

Bountuouse is thy gentelnes / oh lord / quycken me according to thy
pleasure. Many there are that persecute me and ar against me / and yet have I
not swarued from thy testimonies.

I se these malyciouse men and it irketh me because they observed not thy
sayenges. Thou see that I love thy commandments / lord for thy mercyes
sake quycken me. The beginning of thy words is truth / and the iugementes
of thy rightwysnesse stand for ever.

The.xxi. Octonary. Shin.
The ouermost in authority persecuted me fauteles / and my heart feared at thy
words. I am as glad of thy pleasures / as one that had found many proyes.

I hate and abhor lies / and I love thy law. Seven times in the day I
praise the / for thy rightwyse iugementes.

The lovers of thy law shall have much felycite and quietness and no hurt at
all. I trusted upon thy help o lord / and gave dilygence to thy precepts. My
soul observes thy testimonies / and loves the^ greatly. I observe thy
commandments and thy testimonies / for all my ways are open unto the.

The.xxij. Octonary. Tau.
Let my crye^ge ascend in to thy presens oh lord / make me rightly to
understand thy words. Let my deep desyer come into thy sight / deliver me
according to thy promyses. My lyppes shall power forth thy praise / thou
shalt instruct me in thy ordynances. My tongue shall speak of thy pleasures /
for all thy precepts are rightwysnesse. Let thy hand help me / for I have
chosen thy commandments. I desired thy saving help / oh lord / and thy
law is my delight.

My soul shall live and shall praise the / and thy iugementes shall be my
help. I am strayed like a lost sheep / seek thou thy servant / for thy
commandments have I not forgotte.

The argument in to the.C.xx. Psalm.
This Ps. is a co^plainte full of affectes / it is a complaint of an holy man
banished i^to among the ungodly doing althi^ge with disceyt and vyolence. The
title of these.xv. Psalm. following is only this. The song of Ma^hloth / which
word commonly is interpreted stayres or degrees / supposing these.xv. Psalms
to have be song in an higher tune.

Ad dominu^ cum. When I was in strayte anguisshe I called upon the lord and he
granted me.

Lord deliver my soul from lye^ge lyppes / and from a dysceytfull tongue.

What auauntageth it the / or what good brings it the / thou lyenge man / thy
deceytfull tongue? Oh / sharp arowes of ye strong archer / and hot consumyng
ienipe^ coals. Helas that I am thus long holden in exyle among these false
and cruel folk of Meshec / and must yet dwell still with the chorlysshe nation
of Kedar. All to long has my soul tarried among these vyolent men / which
hate pease. I study for pease / but when I speak of pease to them / by and
by are they styrred to battle.

The argument into the.C.xxi. Psalm.
This Psalm declares that of god only / help is looked and tarried for / of
the faythefull men* and that he only brings it presently.

LEuaui oculos. I lift up my eyes into the hills / from whence help might
come unto me. My help comes from the lord / the maker of heuens and earth. He
shall not suffer thy fete to slide / neither he being thy keeper shall sleep.

Lo / neither will he sleep / nor yet ones wynke that keeps Israhell.

The lord is thy keeper / the lord is thy defense / and is ever at thy right
hand. The son shall not smite the by day neither yet the moon by night.

For ye lord shall keep the from all evil ye / he shall keep thy soul.

The lord shall keep both thy outgoinge and thy incommynge / from this time
unto everlasting.

The argument in to the.C.xxii. Psalm.
Here under the figure of Jerusalem are descrybed the felycyte of Christ's
church / and the desyers of the saints thereof.

LEtatus su^. I was right glad wha^ me^ said unto me / let us go unto ye house
of the lord. Our fete shall stand fast in thy gates / O Jerusalem.

Jerusalem is builded goodly like a cite well framed to gyther in her self.

That thither might ascend the trybes eue^ the trybes of ye lord to magnifye
the name of the lord / for so was it commanded unto Israel by gods own
mouth. For there were ordained and holden the seats of judgment / even the
judgment seats of the house of Dauyd.

Pray ye for the felycitye of Jerusalem / the lovers of the might prospere.

They might prospere wtin thy walls / they might prospere within thy houses.
For thy brothers and thy neighbors sakes / shall I now pray for thy felycite.
For the houses sake of ye lord our god I shall pray for thy welthe.

The argument into the.C.xxiij. Psalm.
Here the saints laid in the mouths of the welthy ungodly doing all amysse
/ pray to god for their delyueraunce / committing them self to his cure.

ADte leuaui. Unto the lift I up my eyes / which rulest in heuyns Behold /
for as the servants eyes are ever upon their masters / and the maidens
waytinge upon her masters / even so are our eyes lokynge up unto the lord /
our god / until he have mercy upon us

Have mercy upon us lord / have mercy upon us / for we are out of measure
filled with ignominy. Our soul is filled out of measure with scorns and
derisyon of these welthy rich men / and with ignominy and shame of these
arrogaunt and proud men.

The argument into the.C.xxiiii. Psalm.
Here the saints of god give thanks and rejoice / that they are delivered by
gods help from so present peryls.

NIsi quia. Except the lord had been with us (let Israel now speak. Except
the lord had been with us / wha^ these men rose against us.

Without doubt (their wrath thus ki^dled against us / they had devoured us
quick. Waters had wrapped us in with their waves / the floude had gone over our
soul. The troublouse floude of these importune men / had ron over our souls.

But praised be the lord which has not given us i^ to their tethes for their
proy. Our soul is delivered like the bird from the snare of the fouler / the
snare is broken and we are escaped. Our help comes through the name of the
lord / which has made the heuens and earth.

The argument in to the.C.xxv. Ps.
Here is declared / the congregation of god to be sure / god defending them
and to prospere / the lord fauorynge / and weedyng the ungodly out of them.

QUi confidunt. They that stycke to the lord shall never stagger / but shall
stand fast for ever like the mou^te of Sio^. And like as Jerusalem is gyrte
about with hills / even so closes the lord his people from this time unto
everlasting. He will not suffer the power of the ungodly to oppress the land
of the rightwyse / lest the rightwyse put forth their hands unto any
wickedness.

Deal thou gentely with good me^ / and with men right in their hertes.

Them that swerve from the right way unto shrewdnes / the lord might lead a
way with men given unto wyckednes.

The argument in to the.C.xxvi. Psalm.
Here is declared the gladness of the people returned from Babylon: and under
this figure is it showed also the gladness of the faithful who^ / Christ has
verily delivered from the captiuyte of sin and death.

IN co^uertendo. Wha^ the lord shall bring again us of Syon from capt^uyte /
we shall be like me^ dremi^ge for joy Than shall our mouths be filled with
laughter / and our tongues with triumph than shall it be said among the
gentyles / that the lord has wrought mightily with these men.

The lord shall work mightily with us we shall be refresshed with great
gladness. Bring us again from captiuyte o lord for so shalt thou fill us
with joy: as if thou should give plentuouse floudes to the dwellers in the
thursty south deserte. They that sow with tears / shall reap with gladness.
When they went forth to sow / they went weeping / taking with them their
seed coddes.

But when they shall come again / they shall come with grette joy /
bringynge their hands full of corn.

The argument into the.C.xxvij. ps.
This Psalm teaches us: the house and family: the sure custody of the cite /
to have meat / rest / and children well dysposed and toward / all comes of
the grace of god.

NIsi du^s. Except the lord bylde ye house / the bilders thereof labor but in
vain. Except the lord keep ye cite / the keeper thereof watches but in vain.
It is all in vain that ye haste your selves to rise so erly / and again to
dyfferre your down syttinge to eat your careful bread (except god give it
all).

For it is he that thus shall give unto his well-beloved / quyete sleep and
plentuouse refection with good fode. Lo children ar the heritage / which the
lord gives / the fruit of ye womb is his reward As arowes ar in ye hands of
mighty me^ / even so shall be the children of thy youth. Blessed is the man which
has his quyuer filled with these arrows / for they shall not be shamed when
they shall have to do with their enemies in judgment.

The argument into the.C.xxviij. Ps.
This Psalm. techeth us that the worshyppers of god shall prospere both privately
and openly.

BEati omnes. Blessed is he who so ever worshippeth the lord / which also
walks in his ways.

For you shall eat ye labors of thyn own hands / and shall have prosperouse
encrase. Thy wife shall be fruytfull as the vine tree / within the walls of
thy house / thy children shall stand roundabout thy table like the plants of
the olyue trees. Lo / thus shall that man be blessed / which worshyppeth the
lord.

The lord shall do the good from Sion / and thou shalt delight / beholding the
prosperity of Jerusalem all days of thy life. And thou shalt se thy childers
children and the felycitie of Jerusalem.

The argument in to the.E.xxix. psa.
This Psalm shows us / that the ungodly although they vex long and sore
the people of god: yet shall they not prevail / but at the last to perisshe /
gods people being free and safe.

SEpe expugna. Grievously have they vexed me / even fro my youth / now let
Israel speak. Grievously have they vexed me even fro my youth / but yet they
preueyle not against me.

Upon my back these plowmen plowed and have cutforth their long vorowes. But
the rightwyse lord has cut away ye bonds of these ungodly. They shall be shamed
and put to flight / who so ever hates Syon They shall be as grass yt grows
upon ye house rygges / which is wethred before it be pulled up. With the which
neither the reaper fylleth his hands / nor yet the gatherer fylleth his arms.

Neither the goers forby so regarded the^ as to say ones god bless you / or we
well wysshe you in the name of the lord.

The argument into the.C.xxx. Psalm.
This Psalm is an ernest prayer full of affectes of a man here oppressed with
aduersytie for his si^nes / but yet promisynge him self with fast faith and
hope from god / to have both forgyuenes of his si^nes: and delyuerance from his
afflictions.

DE profundis. Fro my most depest painful troubles / called I upon ye lord.
Lord / here y^ me / let thy ears be attente unto my deep desire?

If thou should look narowly upon our wycdkenesses / o lord / o lord / who
might abide the? But there is mercy with the / and therefore art thou
worshypped.

I abide the lord / my soul abides him and I tarry loki^g up always for thy
promises. My soul wayteth for the lord / as desyrously as the watch men in
the morni^ge watch / desire the day spring.

Let Israel wait for ye lord / for with the lord is there mercy / and
plentuouse redemption. And it is he that shall redeem Israel / from all his
wyckednesses.

The argument in to the.C.xxxi. Psalm.
Here in this Psalm. the prophet shows him self to be without all pride / and
to have followed humilite: wherefore he trusted to be exalted of god

DOmine non. Lord / my heart is not proud / neither look I a lofte / I take
not stoutly upon me in great matters / neither presume I in meruelouse things
above my estate.

But verily I repressed and put my soul to silence like a wainlyng from his
mothers teate / even like a wainlynge was my soul in very deed.

Let Israhell wait and trust upon the / lord / from this time into
everlasting.

The argument into the.C.xxxij. Psalm.
This Ps. si^geth the perpetual felycite of christ's kingdom / and of the
presens of god in his congregation / and this all / is me^te under the figure
of Dautds kingdom and of the Arches set in Sion.

MEmento dn^e. O lord remember thou David / and his afflyction also. Which
swore to the lord / and made his vow to the mighty god of Jacob.

Saye^g / if I enter i^to ye tabernacle of my nowne house / if I asce^de into
my decked bed. If I suffer my sleep to come into mine eyes / or mine eye lyddes
ones to wi^ke. Uncyll I shall find a place for the lord / a mansyon for the
mighty god of Jacob. I pray god I dye.

Lo / we herd of this house in Ephrata and have found it in the busshye
field. We shall come into his ma^syon / and shall fall down before his footstool. Arise o lord / and come i^to the place of thy rest / come in thou with
the Arche of thy strength. Let thy sacrifycers be cled with rightwysnesse /
and thy saints triumph joyfully. For thy servant Dauides sake turn not a
way thy anointed.

The lord swore unto david of his troth and shall not revoke it / I shall
set upon thy feate regal one of the fruit of thy body. If thy children
observe my couuenaunte and my testymonyes / with which I shall instruct them
/ than even their children shall sytte upon the seat regal for a long space.

For the lord has chosen Syon / it is his pleasure there to have his seat.

This shall be the place of my rest into all worlds / here will I sytte / for
this seat have I desired. Her yearly fruit shall I favorably increase / her
poor nedyons will I satisfye with food.

Her sacrifycers shall I cloth with health and her saints shall rejoice even
from their very hertes.

Here shall I make Dauydes impery to florisshe prosperouslye / I have provided
a lantern for my anointed.

I shall wrappe his enemies in co^fusyon and shame: but in him shall I
florysshe the beautefull crown regal.

They are like that precyouse good oyntement which powered upon Aharons heed

Praise ye the lord.

LAudate nome^. Praise ye ye name of the lord / praise ye that are the
servants of the lord. Which appear continually i^ the house of the lord /

Praise ye God for he is a good Lord / praise his name for it is gloriouse.

For god has chosen unto him Jacob / eue^ Israel i^to his own proper people.
For I have known yt great is the lord and our god to be greater than all

Which smytte the first begotten in Egypt / both of man and beast.

He sent forth tokens and wonders in to the mids of Egypt / against Pharao

Which smytte the most grettest nations and slew right valyant kings.

As Syhon king of the Amorreons / and Og the king of Bashan / and all the
kingdoms of Chanaan.

And gave their land i^to an heritage / eue^ into heritage unto Israel his
people. Lord / thy name is setforth for ever / and thy memoryall into all ages.

For the lord shall avenge and deliver his people / which satisfied with their
punishment shall be pleased again with his people. The feigned images of the
gentyles are but gold and silver ^ the works of me^nes hands. They have
mouths and speak not / eyes and se not. They have cares and hear not /

COnfitebor. I shall magnifye the with all my heart / and shall praise the in
the presens of thy gods.

I shall fall down upon my knees at thy holy temple / and shall magnifye thy
name / for thy mercy and trouthes sake. For thou haste extolled thy name / and
thy word above all things.

In what time so ever I called upon the thou grauntedest me / thou encresedest
great strength in my soul.

All the kings of the earth shall magnifye thy o lord / for they have herd
the decrees and plesures of thy mouth.

And their song shall be of the ordynau^ces of the lord / for excellent is
the glory of the lord. For the high lord beholds humble and lowely things
/ and a proud man he knows a far.

If it chance me to be in the mids of afflyction / yet thou will restore me
/ thou wylt stretche forth thy hand against the wrath of my enemies / and
shall preserve me with thy right hand.

The lord will bring all things to pass for me / o lord thy mercy stands
forth for ever / thou shall not forsake the works of thy hands.

Here David expresses that al his deeds and thoughts are serched of god and
open unto him / for he has made him and all things in him / and that god is
every where p^sent with hi^ beholdi^ge all things that he does. The title of
the Psalm. The song of David committed to the chaunter to be song in the
temple.

DOmine probasti. Lord thou have serched me depely / and thou know full
well what I am.

Thou know wherefore I do sytte and wherefore I vpstande / even my thoughts
thou tryest and know before.

My ingoynge and downliynge to sleep thou compasest narowly / and all my
living thou foreseest clearly.

For my tongue is not about to speak a word / but anon (lord) lo / thou
know it all before.

What so ever is within me / behind and before thou have made it / and thou
haste put to thy hand to my shape.

The knowledge of this my shape is hyde fro me / and higher than I can atteyne
there unto. Whether shall I fly from thy spirit / and whether shall I fly from
thy face? If I clyme up into the heuens / there art thou / if I make my bed in
my grave lo / yet there art thou present.

If I take unto me the swyfte wings of the morning beams / and so in the twin
clynge of an eye be conuayed into the uttermost parts of the west see.

Even there yet shall thy hand take me / and thy right hand shall set hold
upon me. I thought than that I would be couerd and hyd with derkenesses / but
with the / even the night is all shynynge. The very derkenesses may hyde
nothing from the / ye the night shyneth like the day / and the derkenesses ar
to the even the very light.

For thou possessest my inward affectes and dydest facyone me in my mother
belly I shall magnifye the for thou have facioned me meruelously / to behold thy
works ar to be merueled above mesure / as knows my soul. My strength in my
bones and senowes were not unknown unto ye wha^ I should be made secretly in
my mothers womb / and knytte together in the low preuy earth. Where wha^ I was
yet without facyon thou see me with thy eyes all my lymmes facyoned by times
thou had drawn like as in a paper / when there was not one of the^ yet

they i^ nombre? If I would nombre the^ / they excede the sa^des of the sea /
but yet I labor busely to consider them / and I cleue ever unto the. O god / I

The argument in to the.C.xl. Psalm.
Here in this Psalm. David prays to be delivered from the deceytfull lies of
Doeg and of his fellows / and that they for their false deceit might be cast

psalm. The so^ge of David committed to the chaunter.

ERipe me. Deliver me / o lord / from this myscheuouse man / save me from
this vyolente man.

Which thinks mischef in their hertes / and contynually run to battle.

They have whetted their tongues like serpents / edders venom is under their

me from this cruel man / which thinks to suppla^t me. These proud men have
set a preuy snare for me / and have be^te their nets / even by my path have
they laid their gynnes for me. Selah.

I said / lord / thou art my god / hear lord / my deep desyers. O lord you

head / what time I shall take me to armor and wepen. Lord suffer not the
ungodly to take his pleasure on me / let not his myscheuous intent prospcre
with him lest these proud heddes be axalted. Selah.

I mean these heddes that thus besege me on every side / whose heavy labor of
their own lips might ouerwhelme the^. Let colles of fire fall upon them /
cast them down into the fire pyttes / out of the which they may never
arise.

Let nothing prospere in therth with this busye tonged and lyenge man / let his
own mischef hunte forth this vyolente man / until it has cast him down
hedlynge. I know that the lord will avenge the poor afflycte / and deliver
the nedyons. The rightwise verily shall magnify and sprede thy name / the pure

David chased away from the tabernacle of god / prays first to obtain the
spirit whereby he might prefer the frendlye sharp rebuke of the saints the

my lyppes. Bow you not my heart into any mischeuous thing / lest I be about to
commytte ungodly deeds with men given all to wickedness / and so eat their
daynties with them. Let the rightwyse smite me for my souls profit / for I
had lever he chastyned me than the soft ointment of thungodly should souple

Let their chief rulers be cast down head lynge in to stonnye places / that yet
other men might bear my sweet words.

As one that plougheth / slytteth / and deuydeth the earth / even so were we
shaken a sondre / and our bones were scattered about our graves.

Wherefore unto ye o lord / lord / my eyes are lift up / when in the put I my
trust power thou not out my soul.

they setted snares for me in the paths where I went. I looked on my righthande

knowledge to me / all refuge was taken fro me / there was not one yt would seek
to save my life I cried unto the / O lord / and I said / thou art my help /
thou art my porcio^ among the living men. Attend unto my cryenge / for I am
in a greuouse and wretched state / deliver me from my pursuers / for they have

man lyuenge is reputed rightwyse.

A cruel enemy verilye persecuted my soul / he has cast down my life in

My spirit is sore troubled within me / and my heart wexeth cold in my breast.

But at last I remembered the days past I consydred all thy works / and

Deliver me fro my enemies o lord my god / for at the do I hyde my self.

and has made him king / and his kingdom to florisshe with all manner
felycitye.

BEnedictus do. Praised be ye lord which fyghteth for me / which has
instruct my hands to battle / and learned my fyngers to fight.

Which is my mercy / my bulwark / my castle / and my delyuerer / my shield /
and he in whom I trust / which casts the people under me. O lord / what
thing is man / that thou thus much set by him? what is this mortal man
that thou thus regardest him?

Man is like a thing of naught / his days ar but a vain flyenge shadow. But
ye lord lettith down theuens and discendeth / he touches the hills and they
smoke. He casts forth lyghtenynges and scatters them / he sends forth
his arowes and distroubleth them.

Let down thy hand from above / and deliver me / deliver me from these
mighty waters and from the power of strange men. Whose mouth speaks vain
things / and their ritha^de is a ritha^de doing deceit. O god / I shall sing
a new dytie unto the / with kytte and ten stringed instruments shall I
sing unto the.

Which bryngest help unto kings / which haste delivered Dauyd thy servant
from the myscheuouse sword.

Take me up and deliver me from the hands of strange men / whose mouths
speak vanytes / and whose ryghthande is a right hand that does disceyte.

That our sons might grow like well thriui^g plants / and our daughters
gorgyously set forth like the cornerde houses might represe^t the beauty of
the temple. Let our garners be replenyshed with all manner of corn / and our
sheep with thousand fold encrese might fulfill every way. Let our oxen be
strong for draught and burden / no brekynge in / no ro^nynge out no out
criynge in our streets.

Great is the lord and worthy much praise / his greatness can not be serched.
From age to age thy works shall be praised / and they shall declare thy noble
acts. All my mind shall be ernestly set at all times to declare thy clear

forth the mighty power of thy miracles / and I shall put them in mind of thy
might.

Men shall show forth the memorial of thy plentuous mercy / and shall
joyfully tryumphe of thy ryghtwysnes.

The lord is favorable and bente unto mercy / slow unto wrath and of
plentuouse goodness. Gentle is the lord unto al me^ and his mercyable gentelnes
swimming over all his works. All thy works shall magnifye the / and thy mercy
shall declare thy self. Men shall preach the beautefull glory of thy kingdom

Present is the lord to as many as call upon him / to as many as call upon him
of true belefe. To them that fear him he makes all things acceptable / he

and also the cytisens of Jerusalem,

LAudare dn^m. Praise ye the lord for it is a plesaunt and a ioyefull thing
to praise our god / there is no thing so to be desired as the praise of him.
The lord shall restore Jerusalem / and shall gather to gyther the scattered
out laws of Israel. He heals the broken in heart / and caseth their heavy
labors. He nombreth the sterres / and gives names to them all. Grace is our
lord and grace is his power / his wit may no man co^prehe^de The lord lyfteth
up ye meke lowlyo^s / and ye proud ungodly he casts down to the ground.
Si^ge ye to the lord with thanks giuynge / sing ye unto our god with harp. Which
ouerledeth the heuens with clouds / and prepayreth rain for the earth / and
brings forth grass in the hills. Which gives cat all their food / and
meat also to the rauyns chekens calling for it. He delyteth not in strength and
strong stedes / neither has he pleasure in ye trumpets of men. But his
pleasure is in them that fear him / and trust upon his mercy. Praise you the
lord o Jerusalem / praise thy god o Sio^. For it is he yt shall stre^gthen the
bars of thy gates / and shall lade thy cytesens within the with ple^tuouse
gifts. He endueth thy costs about the with pease / and satisfyeth the with
the most purest flower of the wheat.

He sends forth his pleasures in to the earth / his commandments ro^ne
forth swiftly. He gives down snow like wulle / and the hoar froste he
scatreth like ashes. He casts forth his hayle like gobbetes of bred / who
may abide his cold? He sends forth his word and melts them away / he
ledeth back his wind / and the waters drop down.

It is he yt told his pleasurs to Jacob / and vis ordynance and decrees unto
Israhel. With no nation has he thus dealt / neither to any other did he
publyshe his decrees.

The argument into the.C.xlviii. Psalm.
In this Psalm. the Prophet exhorts all creatures both heavenly and erthly to
the praise of god. The title of the Psalm. Praise ye the lord.

LAudate dn^m. Praise the lord ye heavenly mi^des / praise ye hi^ all yt are
above. Praise him all angels / praise him all his host roundaboute him.
Praise him son and moan / praise him all bright and shynynge sterres.

Praise him the most highest heuens / and ye waters that are above the heuens.
Praise ye the name of ye lord / for he made all things with a word. And has
made them to stand fast into all worlds / he has given the^ a law which
they break not. Praise ye ye lord al creatures of therth / drago^s and all
deep waters. Fire / hayle / snow / yse / stormy wi^des / doing his
commandment. Mountayns and all high hills / fruitful trees / and all cedre
trees. All wild bestes and tame / all things yt crepe / and fethered fowls.
Kings of therth and all people / princes and all rulers of therthe. Syngle men
and mayde^s / old men and young praise the name of the lord for it is only
high and sprede over earth and heuens. He shall lift up ye power of his people
/ it becomes his saints to praise hi^ / which have professed him / even
Israhell his own people which comes unto him.

The argument into the.C.xlix. Psalm.
In this Psalm. the Prophet exhorts Israel to praise god. The title. Praise ye
the lord.

CAntate. Singe ye to the lord with a new dytie / his praise shall be in the
congregation of the saints.

Israhell shall rejoice of his maker / and the cytesens of Syon of their king.
They shall praise his name with tro^pet / sing ye unto him with taberet and
harp. For the lord well pleased with his people shall or nowrne lowlions with
his help. Sai^tes shall rejoice even from their hertes / and the nobles shall
triu^phe i^ their couches. The exaltyng of god is in their fhrotes / and in
their hands a twoedged sword. To take vengeance upon the gentyles / and to
correct the people. To bind their kings in chains / and their most noblest
rulers in feters of yerne* To execute judgment among them as it is written /
this glory shall be unto all that are his saints.

The argument into the.C.l. Psalm.
In this Ps. the prophet exhorts to the praise of god and that not only with
voice but with all manner of musical i^strume^^. the ti. praise ye the lord

LAudate do. in sane. Praise hi^ that keeps his resydence in his secret holy
place / praise hi^ that reigns in the firmamente / the seat of his power.
Praise hi^ for his strength / praise hi^ for his almightines. Praise him with
sown of trumpets / praise hi^ with lutes and harpes. Praise him with tympany
and taberet / praise him with orgayns and pypes. Praise him with soft
claricymbales / praise him with loud claricymbales. What so ever thing is
endued with breathe / let it praise the lord.

Love ye the lord. Finis.
