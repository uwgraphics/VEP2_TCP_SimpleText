M.D.LXXIIII.

The Preface. To the Christian readers / grace / mercy / and peace in Christ
Jesus our Lord.
SVche as do well observe the variety of me^nes Judgments abowte these
matters off controversy / and the supposed causes of the same / shall find it
a thing more the^ wonderful to behold / and passinge strange to hear. But
who so shall well way and consider / what extreme calamities and miseries
this broile has brought with it to many godly persons which unfeignedly
fear god: the same must off force / as I think (if he have but one drop off
humanity within him) draw forth deep and sorrowful sighs from the heart /
and tears from the eyes. To pass over sundry I will note but this one. where
as in times paste (both at Paul's cross and other places) the soundes which
were wont to be so sweet as might justly have moved the godly hearers to cry
owte with the Prophet Esaias O how beutifull are the feet off them which bring
glad tydinges off peace / etc. are now become (commonly so sour and unsavory
/ that in steed off sweetness / is found little or nothing but wormwood and
bitter gall. And yet I speak not off such / whose cruel scoffinge / and
unbridled natures / are to well known so far to exceed / as few /
(discreet and wise in deed) can be much moved with any thing almost they
either speak or write: but even off those I mean / whose wisdoms gravity /
and lerninge / as the same claims by good right / dew reverence to the
persons / because off those good gifts which God has bestowed upon them so
should it also put them in mind (especially in such places) to use (me semes)
some other vein. And for so much as some impute the cause off all these
troubles to the ambitious heads off certain special persons / By D. Young in
Noue^ber. Anno, 1573.
who should (as has been at Paul's cross both publicly and very furiously
declared) stir up this striffe in the church for that they could not attain
to Bishopprikes when as other enioned them: Some also imputinge it to the
strange churches as well beionde the seas as here among us remayninge / thereby
to provoke the displeasures of the Magistrates against them:

Such as D. Elbowrome.
And some supposinge / yea roaringe owte) that this has happened by such
fantastical heads as ca^ abide no platform but off their own deuisinge: I
have for these and such like considerations* thought good by a short and
brieff discourse to let your se the very original and beginning off all this
miserable contention / leauinge nevertheless to your discreet iudgme^ntes / who
(in these matters) are to be thought innocente / and who most to blame.

And as one both off credit / learned / M. Mullin^ in October. An. 1573.
and off authority / thought is not only meet and expedient openly at paul's
cross (in presence off the honorable and worshipful there) to signify unto
them that such a hot contention (abowte these matters had bin / but also /
noted the place where and the time when: So I in this discourse / Franckford the
place, in Q. Maryes time.
thought it needful / least happily that honorable audience might mistake
the matter) to set fourth by writing the very order / manner / and
proceadinge off the same: Platina, Paulus ^ouius. Slede in, Fox with many other.
followinge herein the steps off such / whom god off his goodness has raised
up at all times and among all nations / to commit things to memory / which
has passed in commonweales / who have with great fredom and liberty been
suffered to make manifest to the whole world the ill dealinges even off Popes /
Cardinals / Emperors / Kings and Princes / where as (in this discourse) the
highest that I touch (and that with great grieff off heart) are (to my
knowledge) but certain Bishopps / and therefore I hope the more to be borne
withal / besechinge almighty god that as by these my poor simple travails
/ my meaning was not (either in contempt or sekinge revenge) to provoke the
farther displeasures off the meanest: that so if it be his blessed will / the
same may find favor in in the eyes off our soueragine L. the queens most
excellent majesty / and the right honorable / whom it has pleased him to
place in high authority / for whose prosperity and welfare it becomes all
true and faithful subjects (as they are dutifully bound) most earnestly to
pray.

The history.
AFTer that yt had pleased the lord God to take away for our sins that
noble prince off famous memory / king Edward the sixthe / and had placed /
Queen Marie in his room: Sundry godly men as well strangers / as off the
English nation / fledd / for the liberty off their consciences / over the seas
/ some into France / some into Flanders / and some in to the high countries off
the Empire / and in the year of our lord. 1554. and the 27. off June came
Edmonde Sutton / William Williams / William Whittingham / and Thomas wood /
with their companies / to the city off Franckford in Germany the first
English men / that the re arrived to remain and abide. The same night came
one Master Valaren pullan Minister / unto their lodginge / and declared how
he had obtained a church there / in the name of all such as should come owte
off England for the Gospel / but Especially from Glassenbury which were all
french men. Answer was made him / that as god was to be praised / who had
moved the Magistrates hearts to show the french such favor: Euenso / for so
much as few off them understood the french tongue / it would be small
commodity to them / or to such as should come afterward to join themselves
to that church.

The next day they communed with Master Morellio another Minister of the
french church / and also with master Castalio a Senior off the same / (both
off them godly and learned me^) By their advise and counsel it was determined
/ that a Supplication should be drawn out / and offered to the Magigistrats /
to know / first whither they would be contented / that not only the parties
before named / but also all other English men that would repair thither for
the like cause / might through their favor be suffered saffely to remain
within their city. This supplication was subscribed as well by the said Sutton
/ whittingam / and the rest off the English men / as also by Morellio /
Castallio / and one Adrian a Citteze^ there / with whom they lodged. And within
three days after the offringe up off their Supplication / they obtained their
requests.

The 8. off July followinge / labor was made (by the counsel and advice off
Morellio and Castalio (who duringe their lives showed them selves fathers to
all English men) to Master John Glawberge one off the chiefest Senators / for
a place or church / wherein they and all their country men might have gods
word truly preached / and the Sacraments sincerely ministered in their natural
tongue / who ientlie promised his furtherance / and that he also would move the
whole Senate theroff / the which he did accordingly. And the 14. day off the
same monethe yt was granted that they should have liberty to preach and
minister the Sacraments / in that church which the french men had / the
french one day and the English an other day and upon the Sundaie / to choose
also the^ hours as they could agree among them selves / but yt was with this
commandment / that the English should not descent from the frenchmen in
doctrine / or ceremonies / least they should thereby minister occasion off
offense / and willed farther / that before they entered their church / they
should approve and subscribe the same confession off faith / that the french
men had then presented / and abowte to put in printe / to the which all the
before named (and others which were by this time come thither) did subscribe.

When the church was in this sort granted / they consulted among themselves
/ what order off service they should use (for they were not so stricly bownde /
as was told them / to the ceremonies off the french / by the Magistrates / but
that if the one allowed off the other it was sufficient.) At lenght / the
english order was perused / and this by general consent was concluded that
the answeringe alowde after the Minister should not be used / the letanye /
surplice / and many other things also omitted / for that in those reformed
churches / such things would seem more then strange. It was farther agreed
upon / that the Minister (in place off the English Confession should use an
other / both off more effect / and also framed according to the state and
time. And the same ended / the people to singe a psalm in meetre in a plain
tune as was / and is accustomed in the french / dutche / Italian / Spanishe /
and Skottishe churches / that don / the minister to pray for ^hassistance off
gods holy spirit and so to proceade to the sermon. After the sermon / a
general prayer for all estates and for our country of England was also
devised / at the end off which prayer / was joined the lords prayer and a
rehersall off thartic^es off our belieff / which ended the people to singe
and other psalm as before. Then the minister pronouncinge his blessinge The
peace off god / etc. or some other off like effect / the people to depart.

And as touching the ministration off the Sacraments sundry things were also
by common consent om^tted / as supersti^ious and superfluous. After that the
congregation had thus concluded and agreed / and had chosen their minister and
Deacons to serve for a time: they entered their church the 29. off the same
monethe. Then was it thought good among themselves that forthwith they should
advertise their country men and betheren dispersed off this singular benefit /
the like wheroff could nowhere else as yet be obtained / and to persuade hem
(all worldly respects put aparte) to repaier thither / that they might
altogether with one mouth and one heart both lame^te their foremer wickedness
and also be thankful to their merciful father that had given them such a
church in a strange land wherein they might hear gods word truly preached /
the Sacraments rightly ministered / and Discipline used / which in their own
country could never be obtained. And to this effect were letters directed to
Strausburgh / Zurick / Densbrugh / and Emden in the 2. off Auguste. And for
that it was thought the church could not long contynewe in good order
withowte discipline / there was also a brieff form devised / declaringe the
necessity / the causes / and the order theroff / whereunto all those that were
present subscribed / shewinge thereby that they were ready and willinge to
submitt themselves to the same / according to the rule prescribed in gods
holy word / at which time it was determined by the congregation that all
such as should come after / should do the like / before they were admitted as
members off that church.

Here followethe the general letter sent from the congregation off
Franckforde / to Strausbourge / Zurick / Wezeil / Emden / etc.
Grace mercy and peace in Christ our Lord: etc.
We dowte not (dearly beloved) but you have hard / as well by letter / as by
report / off the excellent graces and mercy which our good god and heavenly
father has showed unto our little congregation in this city off Franckford /
for that he has not only made the Magistrates and commons very favorable
toward us and louinge / but also / has given them hearts / with much
compassion to tender us / in so much that every man helpethe us / no man is
against us / much love / no grudge / glad to please / loathe to annoie us /
yea / and to declare this good will not to be off the mean sort / nor so
small as our brethern have felt otherwere / they have granted that thing /
which among others and in other cities / we could not obtain nor durst
allmoste hope for. For what greater treasure or sweeter comfort can a
Christian man desire / then to have a church wherein he may serve god in
purity off faith / and integrity off life / which thing yff we wish for /
let us not refuse it / saying where we would / we could not there obtain it.
And here yet it is granted in so ample wise / that being subject to no
blemishe / no / nor so much as the evil off suspicion (from the which few
churches are free) we may preach / minister / and use Discipline / to the
true settinge forth off gods glory and good ensample to others. And for our
parts / we have not been negligente as touching the execution off the said
benefit granted. For the 29. of July / we had (god be thanked) ^. sermons to
our singular comfort / and great joy off all godly men here. Wherefore
brethern / saying your have endured the pain off persecution with us / we
thought it likewise our duties to make your partakers off our consolation /
that altogether we may give thanks to our louinge father / Cor. 10. Phil. 2.
who is more tender over us / then the mother over her child / nether suffers
us to be temped above that we may bear / but even to the issue off the
tentation / geuethe prosperous success / trustinge by gods grace / that he
which has given you that gift / not only to believe in Christ / but also
to suffer for his sake: will so direct your hearts / that no respect off
commodity there / nor yet fear of burden here may once move you to shrink
from your vocation / which is / in one faith / one ministration / one tongue
and one consent / to serve god in his church.

What more manifest sign / what plainer declaration / what word more
express and lively can we have off dewtie and vocation / the^ when god
speakethe in our hearts by faith / guidethe us owte off perille through his
grace / and now last and of all offrethe us a restinge place of his exceading
mercy. You remember that before / we have reasoned together in hope to obtain
a church / and shall we now draw back as unmindful off gods providence /
which has procured us one free from all dreggs off superstitious ceremonies?

What / think you / Psalm. 4^.
if the Prophet David had had this offer who desired to be porter in the house
of God / and more esteemed one day so spente / then a thousand otherways.

Either what mente he when he said: one request I demand off the Lord /
Which I will seek after / that is / Psalm. 27.
that I may dwell in the house off the lord all the days off my life. Had
David no experience? or felt he not what grieff yt was to want the
congregation? And surely we must grant that he was far more perfect then we
be: For he being conversant in this world / set his delight wholly in
heavenly things. And many off us / (we speak it to our shame) as if we had
already forgotten the end of our creation / are plunged in earthlye affections
/ and worldly respects / so that through our infirmities / this excellent
benefit is like to be frustrate. For / some dowte who shall be preferred: others
seek increase off lerninge* Many follow the commodity off lyuinge certain /
look for a new vocation / so that it is a wonder to se the deformity off
man's affec^ions. God grante / Matthew. 22.
we may learn at their ensamples which being called to the marriage came not
/ what it is to esteem in time the worthenes off gods benefits / least / by
the loss off the same we after fall unto unprofitable repentance / seekinge
again our loss with tears as the reprobate Esau and yet never the near.
Mich. 3. Heb. 11.
We charge no one man (brethren) nor yet mean all / and on what considerations
these excuses were pretended / we suspende our Judgments / referringe the
same to our imperfection and infirmity / whereby the adversary ceasethe not to
batter daily the walls off Gods temple.

As touching the point off prefermente / we are persuaded thoroughly that it
has this meaning / that every man thought of himself modestly / humbly
submittinge himself to all me^ vnablinge no man / for so much as your know
that he which seeks ambition / glory / advantage or such like / is not moved
with gods spirit as witness the instructions that Christ^ ^ur Master gave
to his disciples / who laboring of like dis^^^e were admonished that he which
did excel among the^ / should abase himself to his inferior which malady S.
Paul perceauinge to infecte like a canker / most diligently framethe his style
/ Philip. 1. Col. 1.
that he might not seem to prefer hi^ selffe to others in the course of his
ministry. And as for lerni^ge / as we wish to all men most abu^dantly: so we
most ernestly require / that co^paringe the congregations necessity with your
own private commodity / your would rather for Christ's sake chose the better:
yea / and we assure your one good aduertisemente / that through / gods grace /
when we shall be assembled together / such order will be taken / that / besides
those things which our nation shall be able to furnishe / we have the city
most forward to procure others. Yff any would pretend the hardness off the
country and charges / our experience ma^e sufficiently satiffie them / who
having traveiled throwgh most places / where the gospel is preached / have
not found so many commodites nor less charges.

Restethe the time off calling / which we refer to your consciences /
besechinge your for Christ's sake to descend into your selves withowt all
parcialitie / wayinge the gravity off the matter which is gods / and the
selie excuse which the flesh ministrethe. Consider what god would say / I
have prepared a plentiful and ripe harueste which standethe in a redines and
waitethe for the mower and I have appointed thee thy tax. I have given
instruments / and all things fit for the labor / yff thou forslowe it / the
croppe is in danger: yff thou look for often warning thou declarest great
negligence.

This speech (Dearly beloved) or very like / god used to Noah. Abraham /
Jeremiah / etc. and they thought their vocation strong. But you through Gods
benefit / do not only hear god thus perswadinge in your hearts / but also
have been by externe calling confirmed / and according thereunto have walked
to the great glory off God and profit off the congregation. We trust therefore
(brethern) and in Jesus Christ require it / that your would hyde your talent
no longer but having new occasion to imploye it / your would put it forth
for your Master his advantage and your own discharge. For if your feel in
your hearts comfort as we do which are here assembled to hear the word of
god preached and the Sacrament ministered / we assure you / you should
sensibly perceive that which the Prophet speakethe in these terms: as the
heart chased pantethe for gredines off waters: Psalm. 42.
even so / (o lord) my soul seekethe after thee. My soul burnethe for
thirste in seekinge the Lord and says: Alas when shall I be able to appear
before the face off the lyuinge god? what thing then ought we to have in
greater recommendation / then the order and policy which god has
established in his church? that we may be taught by his word / tha^ we may
worship him and call upon his name with one accord / that we may have the
true use off his Sacraments to help us to the same? For these be the means
whereby we must be confirmed in the faith / in the fear off God / in holiness
off conversation / in the contempt of the world / and in the love off life
everlasting. And for this consideration S. Ephesians. 4.
Paul says not that this order which the Lord has set in his church
should only be for the rude and simple / but makethe it common to all /
exceptinge no man. For he has ordained (says he) some to be Apostles / some
/ prophets / some Evangelists / others / to be teachers and instructors / to
confirm the godly and to labor to finishe the buildinge off Christ's body till
we be all brought to one consent in faith to the knowledge off the son off
god / to a perfect man / and finally / to the just measure off a ripe
Christian age. Let us all mark / that he says not / that god has left the
scriptures only / that every one should read it / but also / that he has
erected a policy and order / that their should be some to teach / and not for
one day / but all the time off our lyffe even to the death for that is the
time off our perfection. Wherefore brethren / let us submit our selves / and
leave off farther to tempte God / saying / that yff we will be off the body off
Christ / we must obeie to this general rule. Let no respect off worldly
policy stay us. Let no persuasion blind us. But let us fulfill in our
selves that which Esaias forwarnethe that gods children shall be as pigions /
which flee by flocks in to their douehouse / which is the place where the
word of god is preached / the sacraments ministered / and prayer used.

To conclude therefore (dearly beloved) let every man call his conscience to
counsel / and besides these sweet allurements / let us learn to prevent our
adversaries / who sekinge ever to obscure gods glory / may easelie cauell
at this dissipation. And would to god the slander were not already to our
great grieff in sundry places scattered in so much / that in England / many
take occasion to remain in their filthe. And some think they may dissemble /
until a church o^ confirmed / perceauinge that this our scatteringe /
augmentethe the grief of persecution / and so through our negligence we leese
them for whom Christ died. Consider brethren / it is gods cause / he
requirethe you / it is your dewtie / necessity vrgethe / time willethe / your
father speakethe / children must obeie / our enemies are diligente and the
adversary is at hand.

Almighty god grant for his sons sake that we may rightly ponder the
ma^ter / follow our calling / serve ^he turn / hear the speaker / walk in
obedience and resist our enemies. We desire you all take this in good part /
saying we have written nothing but what charity did indite and that which we
trust / and wish you would have don to us in case like.

Shortly after / the learned men off Strausbrough answered to this general
letter before mentioned in this sort: That they had considered the contents
theroff and perceived that the effect was no other but to have one or two take
the chieff charge and governance off the congregation. And that in case they
might get. D. poinet. Master Scory. D. Bale or D. Cox / or two off them / they
should be well furnished / yff not / they would appointe one at Strausbrough
and an other should come from Zurick to serve the turn at which time master
Grindall wrote to master Scory at Emden perswadinge him to be Superintendent
off this church off Frankf. who (in 2. several letters to his private frinds
/ offered his seruise to the congregation / but before the receipte theroff the
congregation had written their letters to master Knox at Geneua to master
Haddon at Strausb. and master Lever at Zurick / whom they had elected for their
ministers and advertised master Scory by a general letter off the same.

Now / when the answer that came from Strausbrough was read / and compared
with the letter written unto them / it did not in any point answer it* For
the congregation wrote not particulerly for any certain number / but
generally wishinge all men's presence / nether did they require to have any
superintendent to take the chieff charge and government / for the choice and
election theroff (yff such a one had been necessary) ought to have been
reserved to the congregation / which fully determined at that time to have the
church governed by 2 or 3. grave / godly and learned Ministers off like
authority / as is accustomed in the best reformed churches.

The ^1. off October the Students off Zurick wrote also an answer to the
general letters before said in this wise.

The grace and peace off God the Father and off our Lord Jesus Christ be
with your all Amen.
AS God by his singular providence has wonderfully blessed us as well in
mouinge the hearts off the Senators and ministers here / to lament our state /
favor and aid us in our requests: as also in geuinge happy success for all
kind off provision to our use and behoufe: So he well knowethe / that we no
other wise esteem the same then may stand with his glory / our profession
/ and the comfort off his afflicted church / but daily labor in the
knowledge off his word to the intent that when god our merciful father shall
so think good / we may be both faithful and skillful dispensers theroff.

And as runninge in the sweet race off our vocation / ye have ernestly
written unto us for to repaier thither / burtheninge us so sore with your
necessity / that ye think our shrinking back in this behalff should argue want
off charity / keep many in England still which else would willingly come
forth / and show our selves careless off that congregation wwhose edefyinge
and winninge to Christ we only pretend to seek. These are great causes / but
touching us nether so truly objected / so firmly grounded / nor yet so aptly
applied / but that as sound reasons on our parts might fully answer the
same. Yet notwithstanding / in as much as you appeal to our consciences
which in the day off the Lord shall accuse or excuse us in this thing and
all other / we will not utterly deny your requests / but show our selves as
ready to seek gods glory and the increase off his kingdom other there or
elsewhere to the vttermoste off our powers / as ever we did pretend to do /
requiringe you all in the name and fear off god / that as we / all respects
set aparte and unfeignedly trauelinge in the necessary knowledge off Christ to
the profit off his church here after / refuse not for your nedie comfort to
accomplish your desires. So ye will not interrupte our studies / urge our
remouinge / and bring us thither / feelinge here a^lreadie the exceadinge
goodness off god toward us / unless ye think / and that before god / that
our absence on the one part should greatly hinder / and our presence one the
other side very much further your godly attemps already begone for the
furnishinge off that church so happily obtained to all our comfortes / for
the which in our daily prayers we give god most hearty and humble thanks.
Yff by this doing ye give occasion to break our godly feloshippe / to hurt
our studies / to dissolve our exercises / and utterly to euerte our godly
purposes / ye have to answer even unto him which is a faithful and a just
Judge / and will give to every man according to his deeds. Wherefore / dear
brethern / in consideration that we be all not only off one nation / but also
members off one mystical body in Jesus Christ our head / and ought therefore
especially in this time off exile and most worthily deserved cross by all
means possible / one to aid and comfort an other / besechinge god for his
mercies sake to assuage his wrath / to give us repentinge hearts and patient
continuance to our brethern at home with pity to behold his vineiarde there
miserably spoiled and trodden under foot / and to call us home after his
fatherly chastisemente eftsoon frutefully to work in the same: we briefly
make this answer. Yff upon the receipte here off / ye shall withowte cloak or
forged pretense / But only to seek Christ advertise us by your letters / that
our being there is so needful as ye have already signified / and that we
may altogether serve and praise god as freely and as uprightly / (wheroff
pryuate letters received lately from Franckf. make us much ^o dowte) as the
order last taken in the church of England permittethe and perscribethe (for
we are fully determined to admit and use no other) then / about easter next
(for before we cannot) god prosperinge us / and no just cause or occasion to
the contrary growinge in the mean time whereby our intent may be defeated
with one consent we agree to join our selves unto you and most willingly
to do such seruise there / as our poor condition and calling does permit.
In the mean space / we shall most entirely beseech almighty God so to
assiste you with his holy spirit / that your doings may help to confound
papistrie / set forth gods glory / and show such light in the face off the
world / that b^othe the wicked may be ashamed / having no just cause off
reproach / and also our weak brethern confirmed and woone to the truth.

Abowte this time Letters were received from master Haddon Wherein he desired
for diverse considerations to be excused / for coming to take the charge upon
him at Franckford.

The 24. off October came master Whithea^ to Franckford / and at the request
off the congregation / he took the charge for a time / and preached upon the
Epistle to the Romans.

Abowte the 4. off November came Master Ch^mbres to Franckford with letters
from Zurick which were partly an answer to an other letter written unto them
from Franckforde the 26. off September / which was as followithe.

Grace mercy and peace, etc.
AFter / long hope off Your answer to our letter / we thought it good to put
you once again in remembraunc. And as we in our former / so now in these also
in gods behalff most ernestly require you deeply to way this matter off gods
calling / and the necessity off this congregation We have thoroughly learned
your estate and also made you privy to ours* and eftsonnes / wish we might
be together to bewail our sins paste / to pray together for our poor
brethern that are under Antechristes captivity / to comfort / instruct / and
profit one an other. And finally to bestow the time off our persecution
together and redeem these days which are so evil. And if any desire off
knowledge stay you / certainly / it would not be so little increased here that
you should iust^y repent. For as touching the company off learned men (as you
cannot bear be withowte) so / that thing which chiefly your can require of
learned men's Judgments and knowledge owte off their works / your may suck
most plentifully whereof with us you can lake no store We need not / brethern /
to make long discouse in reasoninge* for we partly know that gods spirit /
which workethe in your hearts shall prevail with you more / the^ disputinge
/ not dowti^ge / but the same holy spirit knocks at the door off your
co^scie^ces not only to move you of our behalffs / but to admonish you / to
avoid the inco^ueniences of talks / and the offenses of our poor brethern
of England / whose marueilinge cannot otherwise be satisfied. Remember
therefore (dearly beloved) that we write as brethren / to our dear brethern /
who altogether seek our fathers honor / our own discharge and the comfort
off our afflicted country men.

The same sweet father grant for his Christ's sake that we may assemble
together / to the buildinge off this his Temple / to let the false workmen /
and underminers / and diligently in our vocation to help to the furnishinge
off the same till it rise to perfection. F^^ ye well in Christ.

From Franckford this 16. off September. 1^54. Your louinge frinds: as in the
letter before so under this subscribed.


The answer to them off Franckford was / as follows.

WE being placed here in quietness / with many and great commodities for our
studies tendinge all to edification off Christ's church / have / unto the
earneste requests off your letters unto us / answered in our letters unto you /
that to discharge all dewtie in conscience / and to increase and instruct your
congregation at Franckford with our presence and diligence wilt no^ deny to
remove from hence unto you / so that you charged off conscience do constantly
affirm / that ye have so great need off us as by letters was signified / and
certainly assure us that we with you may and shall use the same order off
service concerning religion which was in England last set forth by king
Edward. And now also for the better understanding off such requests and
charitable performance of dewt^e / upon both parts desired and procured
Ma^ster Richard Chambers our best frinde / a man most charitable and c^refull
for the Christian congregation / to take pains to travel unto you and wi^he
you for us: so that this matter as it is begone and moved in writing^ may be
fully debated and concluded by his faithful means and diligence. For we be all
agreed and do purpose to allow and perform what so ever he shall say and
promise in our names unto you. Wherefore / we beseech you in Gods name
conscionably to consider the estate and condition both off you and us / and
if there upon you conclude with the said master Chambers off our coming
unto you / then let him not lack your charitable help in necessary provision
for our continuance with you. And thus besechinge god that your doings may
tend to his glory / and the spedy comfort off his afflicted church we wish

From Zurick this ^7. off October. Anno 1554. Your lovinge frinds as in the
letters before


When Master Chambers had conferred with the congregation and saw that they
could not assure him the ^u^^ use off the English book withowte the
hazardinge o^f their church / he prepared to depart from whens he came / and
by this time was Master Knox come from Geneua / (and chosen minister) upon
the receipte off a letter sent him from the congregation / which letter was as
folowethe.

WE have received letters from our brethern off Strausbrough / but not in
such sort and ample wise as we looked for / wheruppon we assembled together
in the B. Goaste we hope / and have with one voice and consent chosen you so
part^culerly to be one off the Ministers off our congregation here / to preach
unto us the most lively word off God / according to the gift that God ha^he
given you for as much as we have here through the merciful goodness off God a
church to be congregated together in the name off Christ / and be all of one
body / and also being of one nation / tongue / and country. And at this
present / having need off such a one as you / Mark the calling off Knox to
the pastorshipp.
we do desire you and also require you in the name off God not to deny us / not
to refuse these our requests / but that you will aid / help and assiste us
with your presence in this our Good and godly entreprise / which we have take
in hand to the glory off god and the profit off his congregation and the poor
she^pe off Christ dispersed abroad / who with your and like presences / would
come hither and be of one fold where as now they wander abroad as lost
sheep withowte any gide. we mistruste not but that you will io^fully accept
this calling.

Fare ye well from Franckford this 24. off September. Your louinge brethern.

Now to ruturne to the tenor of the letter which the congregation off
Franckford wrate by Master Chambers to the students off Zurick.

WE have received your 2. several letters the one dated the 23. off October
sent us from Strausbrough and the other the 27. off the same by the hands off
your dear frinde Master Chambers and have conferred with him at large /
touching the contents theroff. And when as after diverse assemblyes and long
debatings the said Master Chambers perceived that we could not in all points
warrant the full use off the book off service (which semethe to be your full
scope and mark) and also waying in conscience the great benefit that God has
in this c^^e offered to our whole nation / he not only re^oised at the same /
but also promised to travel in perswadinge you to the futheraunce thereof. As
touching the effect off the book / we desire the execution theroff as much
as you / (so far as Gods word does commend it) but as for the unprofitable
ceremonies / as well by his consent as by ours / are not to be used. And
although they were tolerable (as some are not) yet being in a strange common
wealth / we could not be suffered to put them in ure / and better it were they
should never be practiced / then they should be the subversion off our church
/ which should fall in great hassard by vsinge them.

The matter is not ours more then yours / (except any excel others in godly
zeele / but both wish gods honor.

If a larger gate be opened there / to the same then to us / upon your
perswatione / ye shall not find us to draw back. for this is that necessity
/ brethern / that may not be neglected / yff we wish the comfort and
gatheringe together off our dispersed brethern. Yff any think that the not
vsinge off the book in all points should increase our godly fathers / and
bretherns bands / or else any thing deface the worthy ordinances and laws
off our Sovereign Lord off most famous memory. K. Edward the 6. he semethe
either little to way the matter / or else let through ignorance knowethe not
that even they themselves have upon considerations off circumstances / altered
heretofore many things as touching the same. And if god had not in these
wicked days otherwise determined / would here after have changed more / yea
and in our case we dowte not but that they would have don the like. These
few lines concerning both our co^munications we have accordingely written
unto you / referringe the rest to the discretion off our Good frinde Master
Chambers / who knows that we have showed our selves most conformable in all
things that standethe in our powers and most desirous off your companies
according to our former letters. The spirit off God move your hearts to do
that which shall be most to his glory and the comfort off your brethern.

At Franckford. this 15. off November. Your louinge frinds, etc.


The 28. off November Master Chambers came again to Franckford from
S^rousbrough / and with him Master Grindall with letters from the learned men
there / subscribed with 16. off their hands / which letter was as folowethe.

WHen we do consider what inward comfort it were for ^he faithful people off
England now dispersed for the gospel / and wandringe abroad in strange
countries as sheep withowte pastor / to be gathered together in to one
congregation / that with one mouth / one mind / and one spirit they might
glorify God: we have at all times and do presently think it our duties / not
only in heart to wish that thing / but also to labor by all means so much as
in us lyethe to bring the same to pass. And having now perfect intelligence
off the Good minds / which the magistrates off Franckford bear toward you
and others our scattered country men / and also understanding off the free
grant off a church unto us wherein we may together serve god / and not
dowtinge off their farther frindshipp in permittinge us franckly to use our
religion according to that godly order set forth and received in England: We
both give god thanks for so great a benefit / and also think it not fit to
refuse so frindly an offer / or to let slip so good an occasion. Therefore /
neither dowtinge off their good furtherance hereunto / not yet distrustinge
your good conformity and ready desiers in reducinge the English church now
begun there / to it former perfection off the last / had in England / so
far as possibly can be atteined / least by much alteringe off the same we
should seem to condemn the chieff authors theroff / who as they now suffer /
so ^re they most ready to confirm that fact with the price off their bloods
and should also both give occasion to our adversaries / to accuse our
doctrine of imperfection / and us of mutablitie / and the godly to dowte in
that truth wherein before they were persuaded / and to hinder their coming
hither which before they had purposed: For the auoidinge off these / and the
obtaininge off the other / moved hereunto in conscience and provoked by your
ientle letters / we have thought it expedient to send over unto you / our
beloved brethern the bringers hereoff to travel with the magistrates and you
concerning the premises / whose wisdoms lerninge and godly zeele / as they
be known unto you / so their doings in this shall fully take place with us.
And yff they obtain that which we trust will not be denied at no hands: Then
we intend (God willinge) to be with you the first off February next / there to
help to set in order and stablishe that church accordingly. And so long
altogether to remain with you as shall be necessary / or until just occasion
shall call some off us away. And we dowte not but that our brethern off Zurick
/ Emden Duesbrough etc. will do the same accordingly / as we have prayed them
by our letters trustinge that you by yours will make like request.

Fare ye well from Strasbrough this 23. off November. Your loving frinds, James
Haddon Edwin Sands Edmond Grindall. John Huntington Guido Eaten. John Geoffrye
John Pedder. Thomas Eaten. Mighell Reymuger Augustine Bradbridge. Arthur Saul.

THis letter was red to the congregation / at which time master Grindall
declared the occasion of there coming which (among other things) was
chiefly for thestablishinge of the book off England not that they mente / (as
he said) to have it so strictly observed but that such ceremonies / and
things which the country could not bear / might well be omitted / so that
they might have the substance and effect theroff. Ma^ster Knox and wh^ttingham
a^ked them what they mente by the substance off the book / It was answered by
the other that they had no commission to dispute those matters / but they
requested that the congregation would answer to certain interogatories /
which were thies First / that they might know wha^ parts off the book they
would admit. The second was for a several church / and the third what
assurance they might have for their quiet hab^tation. To ^he first / answer
was made that what they could prove off that Book to stand wi^he gods word
/ and the country permit / that should be granted them. To the 2. which was
for a church / it was told them / that they understood by the Magistrates /
the time served not to move any such matter till the counsel brake up at
Ausburge. To the third it was said that a general grant was made at their
first coming thither / to the whole nation / and the fredome off the city
offered to all such as were desirous off it in as large and ample manner as
they could require / which was to them assurance sufficient.

These 3. questions thus answered master Chambers and Master Grindall depart
back again with a letter from the congregation which was as followethe.

Grace mercy and peace, etc.
AS it was ever most true / so at this present we feel most sensibly / that
where so ever god lays the foundation to build his glory there he continues
till he bring the same to a present work. All thanks and praise be unto him
therefore / that has moved your hearts so as in no pointye seem to forslowe
your diligence to the furtheraunce off the same. And as the work is off most
excellency So the adversaries cease not most craftily to undermine it / or at
the least / through false reports and defacing off the work begone / to sta^e
the laborers / which should traueil in the finishinge theroff. But truth ever
clears itselff / and as the Son consumethe the clouds / so misreportes by
trial are confounded. Our brethern sent from you can certify you at lenght
touching the particulers off your letter / to whom we have in all things
agreed which seemed expedient for the state off this congation. As for certain
Ceremonies which the order off the country will not bear: we necessarily
omit with as little alteration as is possible (which in your letters ye require)
so that no adversary is so impudent that dare either blame our doctrine of
imperfection / or us of mutabilitie / except he be altogether wilful
ignorante / rather seekinge how to find faults / then to amend them. Nether
do we discente from them which lie at the ransom off their bloods for the
doctrine wheroff they have made a most worthy confession.

And yet we think not that any godly man will stand to the death in the
defense of ceremonies / which (as the book specify the) upon just causes
may be altered and changed.

And yff the not full vsinge off the book cause the godly to dowte in that
truth wherein before they were persuaded / and to stay their coming hither /
according as they purposed: either it signifies that they were very
slenderly taught which for breach off a Ceremony will refuse such a singular
benefit / or else that you have hard them misreported by some false brethern /
who / to hinder this worthy enterprise / spare not to sow in every place /
store off such poor reasons. Last off all it remainethe that ye write / that
the first off February next you will come to help to set in order and
establishe this church accordingly / which thing / as we most wish for
your companies sake and for that ye might se our godly orders already here
observed: So we put you owte of dowte that for to appointe a journey for the
establishing off Ceremonies should be more to your charges then any general
profit / except ye were determined to remain with us longer then 2 months /
as ye write to our countriemen at Densbrorow and Emden / which letters
notwithstanding are now staid and as apearethe we never the near.

We refer the rest to our brethern master Chambers and master Grindall /
who by their diligent inquisition have learned so far off our state as we
wrote unto you in our former letters that is / that we have a church freely
granted to preach gods word purely / to minister the Sacraments sincerely and
to execute discipline truly. And as touching our book we will practice it so
far as gods word does assure it and the state off this country permit.

Fare ye well. At Franckf: this 3. off December. Your louinge frinds. Gorge

The answer to this letter from S^rausbrough was as follows.

Grace, mercy and peace, etc.
WE have received your letters / and also your answer in wrytinge concerning
certain Articles / and do perceive as well by the same as by master Chambers
and Master Grindall your state. But for so much as your opinion is that the
time do^he not presently serve to move the magistrates in those requests the
obteininge wheroff was the principal cause of our sending unto you / we cannot
at this present condescend upon any general meetinge / at any certain time
/ either to remain with you or otherwise. And therefore / if you shall
certainly perceive a time convenient / that the Magistrates may be traueled
with all as well for the good and quiet habitation off the comers / and
especially Students / as also a several church / and to know whither the
exercise off the book shall be used / such we mean as no reasonable man
shall justly reprove / and that the certeintie off these matters may be known
at the magistrates hands:

then / (yff you can let us have intelligence) we will farther consu^te what is
to be done on our par^ye / trustinge / god shall direct us to do so as may
be most to his glory in the end / how so ever the present time shall judge
off it.

From Strausbrough this 13. off December. Your loving frinds, etc. as in the
letteers before.


WHen this letter was redd to the congregation / they requested that for so
much as the learned men / could not co^descend upon any general and certain
time off meetinge as now appeared by their letters / they might conclude upon
some certain order by common consent still to continewe and that wihowte
farther delay / and also to have the holy communion ministered / which the
most part earnestly desired. At lenght (it was agreed that the order of Geneua
which then was already printed in English and some copies there among them)
should take place as an order most godly and fardeste off from superstition.
But Master knox being spoken unto / as well to put that order in practice / as
to minister the communion / refused to do either the one or the other /
affirminge / that for many considerations he could not consent that the same
order should be practiced / till the learned men off Strausbrough / Zurik /
Emden / etc. were made privy. Neither yet would he minister the communion by
the book off England / for that there were things in it placed (as he said)
only by warrant of man's authority and no grownde in godds word for the same
/ and had also a long time very superstitiously in the mass been wickedly
abused. But yff he might not be suffered to minister the Sacraments according
to his conscience / he then requested that some other might minister the
Sacraments / and he would only preach. If nether could be admitted be
besought them that he might be discharged. But to that the congregation would
in no wise consent.

Whiles these things were thus in handlinge came master Lever (before elected)
who / assemblinge the congregation requested that he might with their
consentes appointe such an order / as should be both Godly withowt respect
off the Book off Geneua or any other / requestinge farther / that for so
much as that office was off so great importance / and that he had not been in
the like before / that he might between that and Easter have a trial off them
/ and they off him / and so at the end off that term either take or refuse /
which time off trial / as it was willingly granted him: so when they
understood that the order which he would place and use was not altogether
such as was fit for a right reformed church / they would in nowise yield to
the same.

Knox / whittingham / and others / perceyuinge that these beginnings would
grow to some what / yff it were not staid in time / drew forth a platt off
the whole book off England into the lattin tongue / sendinge the same to
master Calvin off Geneua and requestinge his judgment therein / and shewinge
him that some off their country men went abowte to force them to the same and
would admit no other / saying / that it was an order most absolute and that
yff ever they came in to their country they would do their best to
establishe it again. Now folowethe the description.

A description off the Liturgy / or book off service that is used in England.
First off all / morninge prayer offreth it selff. The minister having put on
a white garment (which they call a surplesse) beginning with some sentence
off holy scripture / as for example* yff we shall say that we have no sin
we deceive our selves / etc. or some such of like sort. Then he takethe in
hard the exhortat on / which stirs up to a confession off sins / which
the minister pronounces with a loud voice / the people sainge after him. To
this is added an absolution / and when these things are done / he rehersethe
the lords prayer / and afterward lord open thou my lyppes / and my mouth
shall show forth thy praise. O god be ready to be my help / etc. Then / come
and let us singe unto th Lord / etc. By and by also there follow 3. Psalms
together at the end off every one. Then follows the first lesson / which
conteinethe a whole chapi^er off the old Testament. After this lesson they
say or singe we praise ^he / lord / or Blessed be the Lord / etc. Then an
other lesson owte off the New testamente / unless peradventure the
solemnization off some high feast have other set and appointed lessons. Now in
cathedral churches they utter their lessons in plain song and the^
afterward is Benedictus added. This book warnethe that they keep this order
through owte the whole year. Afterward / the creed is pronounced by the
Minister / (all the people in the mean time standing up) Afterward fallinge
down upon their knees / the Minister says / The Lord be with you / The
answer / And with thy spirit.

Then / Lord have mercy upon us / Christ have mercy upon us / Lord have
mercy upon us / etc. our father / etc. pronounced owte alowde off all with all
boldness. Then the Minister / when he stands up says / o lord show us
thy mercy The answer / and give unto us thy sauinge health. O Lord save the
king In the day wherein we shall call upon thee. Iudu^ thy Ministers with
righteousness. And make thy chosen people joyful. O Lord save thy people. And
bless thine inheritance. Give peace in our time o Lord / etc. At lenght^.
Collects are had ^n place off a conclusion / the first / for the day / the
second for peace / the last is for the obteininge off Grace. Now / the
eueninge prayers are said (...) manner as the other are / sauinge / that after
the first lessen follows my soul does magnify the lord. After the 2.
lessen Now Lord / etc. and in steed off that collect / God which art the
Author off peace / is used o God from whom all holy desiers / etc. besides /
there is caution added that all Ministers shall exercise them selves
continually as well in morninge prayers as eueninge prayers / except perhapp by
study in dyuinitie or some other busynes / they be greatly and necessarely let
or hindred^ Besides / upon every Sabothe day / wensdaie and fridaie there is
yet in use certain suffrages devised off Pope Gregory which beginnethe after
this manner. O God the father off heaven have mercy upon us miserable sinners.
O God the son redemer off the world / etc. only leauinge owte the
invocation off saints / otherwise we use a certain coniuringe off God. By the
mystery off his incarnation / by his holy nativity and circumcision by his
haptisme / fasting and temptation / by his agony and bloody sweat / etc.
yea / it comprehendethe in plain words a prayer to be delivered from sudden
death / the people answeringe to the end off every clause / either spare us
good lord / or else / Good Lord deliver us / or we beseech thee to hear us
Good Lord. O Lamb off God that takes away the sins off the world is
thrice repeated. Then Lord have mercy upon us thrice / and then the Lords
prayer with this prayer also / o Lord deal not with us after our sins to the
same adioined / passinge over some things least we should seem to syfte all
those drosses which remain still among us.

Now the manner off the supper is thus. The number off three at the least is
counted a fit number to communicate / and yet it is permitted (the pestilence
or some other common siknes being among the people) the Minister alone may
communicate with the sick man in his house. First therefore / the Minister
must be prepared after this manner / in a whit lynnin garmente (as in saying
the other service he is appointed (and must stand at the Northeside off the
Table. Then is had the Lords prayer after the custom / then he recites the
collect / and after follow in order the ten commandments (but so
notwithstanding / that every one off the people may answer lord have mercy
upon us and inclyne our hearts to keep this law. After the rehersall off the
commandments / the collect off the day (as it is called) and an other for the
king is had. By and by the Epistle and Gospel folowethe / to wit / such as
the callender apointethe for that day. And there in this place there is a note
/ that every holy day has his collect Epistle and Gospel (which fill 73.
great leaves off the book ^ when the rest fill scarce fifty. For all holy
days are now in like use as were among the Papists / only very few
excepted.

Then he goethe forwards to the creed and after that to the sermon (if there
be any) Afterward the parish priest byddeth the holy days and fastes on
their eues / if there be any that week. And here the book warnethe that
none defraude the parish priest off his due or right specially on those feast
days / that are dedicated to offerings. Then follows a prayer for the state
off the church militaunte / and that not withowte a long heap and mixture
off matters until they come (after a certain confession off sins) to lift
up your hearts / the people answeringe / we give thanks to the lord. Let us
give thanks to our Lord God / the answer / It is meet and right so to do. It
is very meet / right and our bownden dewtie / etc. until they come to that
clause: O Lord holy father / etc. and so the preface according to the feast
is added. Afterward he says: Therefore with Angels and Archangells and so
endethe with holy holy holy / lord god / till he come to hosianna in the
highest. Now the priest bowethe his knee acknowledginge our unworthiness in
the name off all them that shall receiu^. And settinge owte gods mercy / he
beseech the God that our bodies may be made clean by his body and that our
souls may be washed through his blood. And then he again stands up and
takethe in hand a fresh an other prayer appointed for this purpos / in which
are contained the words off the institution / all which being done / he
first communicates / then / by and by he says to an other / knelinge / Take
/ and eat this in remembrance that Christ died for thee and feed on him in
thy heart by faith with thanksgeuinge.

Now abowte the end the Lords prayer it used again / the Minister saying it
alowde and all the people folowinge / to conclude / they have a geuinge off
thanks in the end / with Glory to god in the highest / as it was used among
the Papists / yff it happen that there be no sermon / only a few things are
omitted / but all other things are done in order aforesaid.

In baptism the Godfathers are demanded in the name off the child / wither
they renownce the deuell and all his works / the lusts off the world / etc.
and they answer I renownce them. Then / wither they believe the Artikles off
the faith / which being confessed / will thou (says he turninge himself to
both the witnesses / be baptized into this faith? and they say yea / I will.
After afewe thing rehearsed / he takethe the Child and dippeth it in / but
warely and discretly as it is in the book / upon whose forehead also he shall
make a cross in token forsoothe that when he is old he shall not be ashamed
to confess the faith off Christ Crucified. Afterward / sendinge away the
Godfathers and Godmothers / be charge them that they bring the child to be
confirmed off the Bishopp as soon as he can say the Articles off the faith /
the lords prayer / and the ten Co^maundeme^ts. And saying there be many causes
/ as the book says / which should move them to the Confirmation off
Children / this / forsoothe / off all others is the waightiest / that by
imposition off hands they may receive strenght and defense against all
temptations off sin / and the assaults off the world and the deuell / because
that when Children come to that age / partly / by the frailty off their own
flesh / partly / by the assaults off the world and the deuell they beginn to
be in danger: And leafte any should think any error to be in this
Confirmation / therefore they take a certain pamflett off a Catechism / which
consists off the Articles off the faith / the Lords prayer / and ten
commandments / and all this is dispatched in less then two leaves.

To these is joined their manner off Marriage off which that we may passover
many petty ceremonies these follies who can suffer? The husband laithe down a
ringe upon the book / which the minister taking / he geuethe it in his hand
and biddethe him to put it on the fourthfinger off his wives left hand / Then
he uses this form off words: with this ringe (says he) I thee wedd /
with my body I thee worship with all my worldly goods I thee endue. In the
name off the father / the son / and the holy ghost.

A little after the Minister says to the new married persons knelinge before
the lords table: Lord have mercy upon us Christ have mercy upon us / Lord
have mercy upon us. Our father which art / etc. Lord save thy servant and
thy handmaide / etc. and so a few things being rehearsed they must be brought
to the Lords supper. The visitation off the sick is after this manner. Peace
be to this house. The answer / and to all that dwell in the same. Lord have
mercy upon us / etc. our father / etc. Lord save thy servant. Answer /
which trustethe in thee. Send forth thy help from thy holy hill / and with
speed save him / etc. as in the other prefaces with questions and answers. Off
the Burial.

The Priest meetethe the Corse at the entrance off the churcheyarde either
singing or softly pronouncinge / I am the Resurrection and the liffe / etc. I
know that my redemer lyuethe Job. 19. being comme to the grave it is said.
Man borne off a woman Job. 9. When the earth is thrown in / we committ
(says he) earth to earth / duste to duste / etc. The Lord has given /
the Lord has taken / I hard a voice from heaven / saying / Blessed are the
^ead which die in the Lord. Lord have mercy upon us / etc.

The purification of women in childbed / which they call geuinge off thanks /
is not only in all things with us almost common with the Papists but also
with the Jews / because they are commanded instead off a lamb or dove to
offer money.

Knox and VVhittingham ashamed to open some things
Other things / not so much shame it selff / as a certain kind off pity
compels us to keep close / in the mean season nothing diminishinge the
honor due to those reverend men / who partly being hindered by those times /
and by the obstinacy and also multitude off adversaries (to whom nothing was
ever delightful besides their own corruptions) being as it were overflowed /
did always in their mind continually as much as they could strive to more
perfect things.

Note, that this description is very favorably put down, if ye confer it
with the Book off order in all points, and the usage off the book in many
churches of this realm you can confess no less. And hereoff ye may gather
what M. Calvin would have written, if they had noted all the abuses of the
same.

The answer and Judgment off that famous and excellent learned man Master
John Calvin the late Pastor off Geneua / touching the Book off England after
that he had perused the same faithfully translated owte off Latten by master
Whittingham.
To the godly and learned men Master John Knox / and Master William
Whittingham / his faithful brethern at Frankford etc.
THis thing truly greuethe me very much / and it is a great shame that
contention should arise among brethern banished and driven owte of their
country for one faith / and for that cause which only ought to have holden
you bound together as it were with an holy band in this your dispersion. For
what might you do better in this dolorous and miserable plage / then (being
pulled violently from your country) to procure your selves a church / which
should receive and nourishe you (being joined together in minds and
languadge) in her motherly lap. But now for some men to strive as touching
the form off prayer and for Ceremonies as though ye were at rest and
prosperity / and to suffer that to be an impedimente that ye cannot there
join in to one body off the church (as I think) it is to much owte off
season.

Yet notwithstanding / I allow their constancy which strive for a just
cause being forced against their wills unto contention. I do worthily
condemn frowardnes / which does hinder and stay the holy carefullnes of
reforminge the church.

And as I behave myselff gentle and tractable in mean things (as external
ceremonies) So do I not always judge it profitable / to give place to their
folishe stowtenes / which will forsake nothing off their oulde wonted
custom. In the liturgy off England / I se that there were many tolerable
foolish things / by these words I mean / that there was not that purity
which was to be desired. Many tolerable foolish things in the book by
Caluins judgment.
These vices / though they could not at the first day be amended / yet /
saying there was no manifest impetie / they were for a season to be
tolerated. Therefore / it was lawful to begin off such rudimentes or
absedaries / but so / that it behooved the learned / grave / and godly ministers
off Christ to enterprise farther / and to setfoorthe some thing more filed
from ruste / and purer. If godly Religion had flourished till this day in
England / there ought to have bin a thing better corrected and many things
clean taken away Now / when these principles be over thrown / a church
must be set up in an other place / where ye may freely make an order again /
which shall be apparent to be most commoditious to the use and edification
off the church. I cannot tell what they mean which so greatly delight in the
leauinges off Popish dregs. They love the things whereunto they are
accustomed. First off all / this is a thing both triflinge and Childishe.
The book trifling and Childishe by Caluins judgment.
furthermore / this new order far differs from a change.

Therefore / as I would not have you feirse over them whose infirmity will not

please not them selves to much in their foolishnes. Also / that by their
frowardnes / they do not let the course off the holy buildinge. Last off all
/ least that foolish vain glory steal them away. For what cause have they
to contend / except it be for that they are ashamed to give place to better
things. But I speak in vain to them which perchance esteem me not so well
/ as they will vouchsaffe to admit the consaile that commethe from such an

For there downfall shall more grievously wound them / when they perceive your

Fare ye well dearly beloved brethern / and faithful servants off Christ.

Your John Calvin


WHen this letter of Caluins was redd to them of the congregation / it so
wrought in the hearts off many / that they were not before so stowte to
maintain all the parts off the book off England as afterward they were bent
against it. But now to return. Whiles these things were in doyinge / the
congregation (as you have hard before) could not agree upon any certain
order / till after long debatinge to and fro / it was concluded / that master
Knox / master Whittingham / Master Gilby / Master Fox and Master T. Cole
should draw forth some order meet for their state and time: which thing
was by them accomplished and offered to the congregation (being the same order
off Geneua which is now in print) This order was very well liked off many /
but such as were bent to the book off England could not abide it / yea /
contention grew at lenght so hot / and the one party which sought sincerity
/ so sore charged / with newfanglednes and singularity and to be the stirrers
of contention and unquietness / The humblenes of Gilby and his godly zeele
that Master Gilby with a godly grieff (as well apeared) kneled down before
them and besought them (with tears) to reform their judgments / solemelie
protestinge / that (in this matter) they sought not themselves / but only the
glory off god / as he was verily persuaded / wishinge farther that that hand
which he then held up were stricken of if by that a godly peace and unity
might ensue and follow. In the end an otherwaie was taken by the congregation /
which was / that master Knox and master whittingham / Master parry and
Master leauer should devise some order yff it might be / to end all striff
and contention. The modesty of Knox


Thies 4. assembled for that purpos. And first / Master Knox spoke to the
rest in this wise. For so much / (says he) as I perceive / that no end of
contention is to be hoped for / unless the one part something relent / this
will I do for my part / that quietness may ensue. I will show my judgment
how (as I think) it may be best for the edification off this poor flock /
which if ye will not accept / nor follow (after that I have discharged my
conscience) I will cease and commit the whole matter to be ordered by you as
you will answer before Christ Jesus at the last day / and to this his
congregation in this liffe / etc. Whereupon after some conference / an order was
agreed upon: some part taken forth of the English book and other things put
to / as the state of that church required.

And this order by the consent of the congregation should continewe to the
last of April following. This order was taken the 6. off Feb.
yff any contention should arise in the mean time / the matter then to be
determined by these S. notable learned me^ / to wete / Calvin / Musculus Martyr
/ Bullinger / and Vyret. This agremente was put in wrytinge. To that all gave
their consentes. This day was joyful. Thanckes were given to God / brotherly
reconciliation followed / great familiarity used / the former grudges seemed to
be forgotten. Yea the holy communion was upon this happy agremente / also
ministered. And this frindshipp continued till the 13. D. Cox with others come
to Frankf.
off March folowinge / at which time. D. Coxe and others with him came to
Frankford owte off England / who began to break that order which was agreed
upon / first in answeringe alowde after the minister / contrary to the
churches determination / and being admonished theroff / by the Seniors off the
congregation / he / with the rest that came with him made answer / that they
would do as they had done in England / and that they would have the face off
an English church. And the sundaie folowinge / one off his company withowt the
consent and knowledge off the congregation gate up suddenly into the pulpit /
redd the lettany / and D. Cox with his company answered alowde / whereby the
determination off the church was broken. The same sundaie at after noone it
came to master Knox his turn to preach / who having passed so far in Genesis
that he was come to Noah as he lay open in his tente / he spoke these words
folowinge.

Theffecte of Knox sermon.
As diverse things (says he) ought to be kept secret / even so such things
as end to the dishonor off God and disquieting of his church ought to be
disclosed and openly reproved. And thereupon he showed / how that after long
trouble and contention among them / a godly agremente was made / and how that
the same / that day was ungodly broken / which thing / became not (as he
said) the prowdest off them all to have attempted / alleadginge furthermore
that like as by the word off God we must / seek our warrant for the
establishing off religion / and withowt that to thruste nothing into any
Christian congregation: so for as much as in the English book were things
both superstitious / vnpure / and imperfect (which he offered to prove before
all men) he would not consent that off that church it should be received / and
that in case men would go abowte to burden that free congregation therewith /
so often as he should come in that place (the text offringe occasion) he would
not fail to speak against it.

He farther affirmed that among many things which provoked godds anger
against England / slacknes to reform religion (when time and place was
granted) was one. And therefore it became them to be circu^specte / how they
laid their foundation. And where some men ashamed not to say / that there was
no let or stopp in England / but that Religion might be / and was already
brought to perfection / he proved the contrary / by the want off discipline.
Also by the troubles which master Hooper Sustained / for the Rochet and such
like / in the book commanded and allowed.

And for that one man was permitted to have 3.4. or 5. benefices to the great
slander off the gospel and defraudinge off the flock off Christ off their
lively food and sustenaunce. These were the chieff notes off his sermon /
which was so stomaked off some / especially off such as had many liuinges in
England / that he was very sharply charged / and reproved so soon as he
came owte off the pulpit / for the same.

The twesdaie folowinge / D. Cox sharply rebuked him.
was appointed to talk off thies things more at large. When all were
assembled earneste request was made that D. Coxe with his company might be
admitted to have voices in the congregation. Answer was made by others that
the matter yet in controversy among them / ought first to be determined /
Secondly / that they should subscribe to discipline as others had don before
them / But that they refused, and at lenght over threw yt.
and farther yt was greatly suspected that they had been (some off them) at
mass in England / and others had subscribed to wicked articles / as one off
them shortly after even in the pulpit sorowfully confessed. For these
considerations and such like / The congregation withstoode the admission off
D. Coxe and his company* Knox'at ^aste / began to make intretie that they
might have their ^o^ces among the rest / M. Jewel.
to whose request when certain had yielded / they then became the greater
part and so were by them admitted as members off the church. They thus
admitted / by the most part. D. Coxe forthwith forbad Knox to meddle any
more in that congregation.

The next day being wensdaie / whittingham went to Master John Glauburge
(who was the chieff mean in obtaininge the church) and brake the matter unto
him / Knox putowt by those which he brought in.
declaringe / how that certain / now come owte off England had forbidden
their minister appointed / to preach that day / and intended to set up an
other / which he dowted would not be well taken. And therefore / least any
inconuen^ence should hap / he thought good to make him privy thereto.
Whereupon the said Magistrate sent immediately and gave commandment that there
should be no sermon that day. Afterward he sent for Valeran the french
Minister / commaundinge him that 2. learned men should be appointed off either
part / and that he and they should consulte and agree upon some good order /
and to make report unto him accordingly. Then were appointed D. Cox and lever
off the one side and knox and wh^ttingham on the otherside To decide the
matter. Valeran was appointed to put down in writing what they should agree
upon. But when in this conference / they came to the order off Mattins and that
D. Coxe said / Ego volo habere, there could be no agreement among them / and
so brake off / whereupon the congregation drew up a supplication in latten and
presented it to the said master Glauburge requestinge him to be a mean that
the same might be considered off among the Senators. The English wheroff was
as folowethe.

The supplication to the Senate.
Let it not molest you (most grave and worthy Senators / that your affayers
are let with a few words. And least we should trouble you with prolixitie
/ you shall understand the matter briefly. When your great and unspeakable
humanity / through the providence of god had granted us a church / we
undertook forthwith (as became us) to consulte abowte the orders off the same
/ and to set ow^ ^ Liturgy. And because we saw that in the prolixe and
Ceremonious book of the liturgy of England / be many things (that we may
speak no worse off it) not most perfect / it seemed best to reduce it to
the perfect rule off the scriptures and to accommodate our selves to the
ensamples off that church where in we teach / and to whom we have subscribed
But when this enterprise offended some off our countriemen (although the
greatest number agreed unto us) for that we would decline from the decrees off
our elders / To weet, the french church.
here upon there grew to us for a few months no small trouble.

At the lenght / when there appeared no end / for peace and concordes sake we
gave place to their will / and suffered them at their pleasure to pike owte. off
their book the chiefest or best things upon this condition that the same
should continewe with owte alteration / at the least / unto the last day off
April / at the which day (if there should any new contention arise (that
then all the matter should be referred to these 5. notable men / Calvin /
Musculus / Martyr / Bullinger / vnd Viret. What nedethe many words. This
condition was willingly accepted / and the couenaunte rated on both parts. A
writing was also theroff to testify the promise made off the one to the
other. Moreover thanks were given to god with great joy / and common prayers
were made / for that men thought that day to be the end off discord. Besides
this / they received / the communion as the sure token / or seal off their
mutual agremente / which was omitted before / by the space off 3. months.
Valaran also the french Minister was partaker off this communion and a
furtherer off concord and a wittnes off these things. Now of late days /
certain of our country men / came to us who have endeavored by all means to
obtrude that huge volume off ceremonies upon us to break the couenaunte and to
ouerthrough the liberty off the Church granted by your benevolence. And no
dowte / this they enterprise and mind to do under the title and name off your
defense / Whereby they may abuse the authority off your name to satisfy their
^ust^. We are here compelled to omit many things which would make for
our cause / no less rightly then profitab^y / but we remit thies to our
brethern for concordes sake.

You have here / most honorable Sen. a brieff sum of our case / and
contention / whereby you may easily understand / what to judge off the whose
matter.

What manner off Book this ^s for the which they so cruel^ie contend / The
letter a little before.
ye may consider by the Epistle that Calvin lately wrote unto us / in the
which he has signified his mind / as well plainly off the book / as also
off the uprightness off our cause. We could have pointed owte unto you the
foolish and fond things off the book / but passinge over an infinite number
off things / this one will we bring for many the which shall be necessary
well to be ma^^ed. within these three years arose a great conflicte between
the the Bishopps off the realm and the Bishop off Gloucester Master Hooper /
This controversy has been si^hins king Edward his reign as ye se.
a man worthy off perpetual memory / whom we hear to be burned off late.
This man being made Bishopp By king Edward / there was obtruded by other B.
off the same order (according to this book) a roche^^ / and and a bishops
robe this man being well learned and a long time nourished and brought up in
Germany / as soon as he refused thies proud things that fools marve^l a^ /
he was cast into prison and at lenght by their importunity overcome / and
relentinge / he was compelled to his shame to give place to their impudency
with the common grieff and sorrow off all godly minds.

But wherefore speak you off these things will you say / that apperteneth
nothing to us? yes verily / we think it touchethe you very much / for yff
thies men armed by your authority shall do what they list / this evil shall be
in t^me established by you and never be redressed / nether shall there for ever
be any end off this controversy in England. But yff it would please your
honorable authority to decree this moderation between us / that this whole
matter may be referred to the judgments off the five above named not we alone
that are here present / but our whole posterity / yea our whole eng^ishe
nation ^ and all good men / ^o the perpetual memory off your names / shall be
bownde unto you for this great benefit We might have used moo words in this
narration / for we feared not / that we should lake reasons / but rather that
time should fa^^e you / let with more serious business. Therefore / we by
these things / leave the rest to the consideration off your wisdoms.


The 22, off March ma^ster Glauburge came to the English Church and showed
the congregation / that it was commanded them / by the magistrate^ (when by
his procurement the church was granted) that they should agree with the
french church both in Doctrine and ceremonies / and that they understood
how the fallinge from that order had bred much dissension among them.
Therefore / ^e strait^y charged and commanded that from thenc forth they
should not dissent from that order / yff they did / as he had opened the
church door unto them / so would he shut it again. And that such as
would not obey thereunto should not tarry within that city / willinge them to
consulte together owte off hand and to give him an answer before he departed.
D. Coxe / then spoke to the congregation in this wise / I have (says he) redd
the french order and do think it to be both good and godly in all points /
and therefore wished them to obaie the magistrates commandment whereupon the
whole congregation gave consent / so as before the Magistrate departed the
church / D. Coxe / lever / and whittingham made report unto him accordingly.
D. Coxe also at that present requested that it would please him /
notwithstanding their ill behavior) to show unto them his accustomed favor
and goodness / which he most iently and lovingly promised.

At the next meetinge off the congregation that order was put in practice / to
the comfort and reioycinge off the most part. Nevertheless / such as would
so feign have had the book of England / left not the matter thus. And for
that they saw Knox to be in such credit with many off the congregation /
they first off all assaied by a most cruel barbarous and bloody practice to
dispatche him owte off the way / to the end they might with more ease attain
the thing which they so gredely sought / which was the placinge of their
book. They had among them a book off his entitled an admonition to
Christians written in the English tongue / wherein by occasion he spoke off the
Emperor / off Philip his son / and off Marie then Queen off England. This
book cericine off them presented to the Magistrates / who (upon receipte off
the same) sent for whittingham and asked him off Knox their Minister / what
manner off man he was: whittingham answered that such a one their was among
them and to his knowledge both a learned / wise / grave and godly man. Knox
accused off treason.
Then one off the Magistrates said unto him / certain off your country men
have accused him unto us Laesae Maiestatis Imperatoriae, that is off high
treason against the Emperor / his son^e / The places in all were 8.
and the Queen off England / here is the book / and the places which they
have noted / the true and perfect sense wheroff we command you (sub pena
pacis) to bring unto us in the latten tongue at one off the clock in the after
noone / which thing he did accordingly / at which time (after certain
communication among themselves / they commanded that Knox should preach no
more till their pleasure were farther known. The words concerning the
Emperor were these / spoken in the pulpit in a Town off Buchingham sheere in
the beginning off Queen Mary's reign / as by the said book apearethe where
it is said O England England / yff thou will obstinately return into
Egipte / that is / yff thou co^tracte marriage / confederacy / or leage with
such princes as do maintain and advance ydolatrie / such as the Emperor
(who is no less enemy to Christ then was Nero) yff for the pleasure and
frindship (I say) of such princes thou return to thine oulde abominations
before used under P^pistery: then assuredly (O England) thou shall be plaged
and brought to desolation by the means off those whose favor thou sekeste /
and by whom thou art procured to fall from Christ and serve antechriste.
There were other 8. places / but this was most noted / in that it touched the
Emperor. But it seemed the magistrates abhorred this bloudly / cruel / and
outrageous attempt / for that when as certain off Knox his enemies followed
hardly the Magistrates to know what should be done with him / they did not
only show most evident signs of dislikinge their unnatural suite / but also
sent for master Williams and Whittingham / willinge them / that master Knox
should depart the City. The banishment off Knox.
For otherwise / (as they said) they should be forced to deliver him / yff the
Emperor his counsel (which then lay at Ausburge) should upon like
information send for him.

The 25 off march master Knox the night before his departure made a most
comfortable sermon at his lodginge to 50. persons or there abowte / then
present / which sermon was of the death and resurrection off Christ / and of
the unspeakable joys which were prepared for Gods elect / which in this
liffe suffer trouble and persecution for the testimony off his blessed name.
The next day he was brought 3. or 4. mile in his way by some off some off
those unto whom the night before / he had made that exhortation / who with
great heaviness off heart and plenty off tears committed him to the lord.

The very same day being the 26. Many off the learned men were now come from
al places.
off march one Adulphus Glauburge (A Doctor off law and nephew to Master
John Glauburge the Senator) whom D. Cox and the rest had won unto them / sent
for wittingham / and told him that there were presented to the Magistrates
three Docters / 13. batchelers off deuinitie besides others / and that the
magistrates at their suites had granted them the full use off the English
book commanding and charginge him therefore not to meddle any more to the
contrary. This Adulphus was before this time a great fartherrer off the church
and the orders off the same how so ever he was turned.
for (as he said) it was fully concluded that so it should be. And supposing
that Whittingha^ would let it what he might / the next day again he sent for
him home to his house where he gave the like charge (D. Coxe and other present
by whose procurement the same was done) Whittingham answered / that yff it
were so concluded / he would willingly obaie / not dowtinge / but that it
might be lawful for him and others to join themselves to some other church.
But D. Coxe besought the lawier that it might not so be suffered / whereto
whittingham answered that it would be to great cruelty to force men contrary
to their consciences to obate all their disorderly doings / offringe / that
if it would please the Magistrates to give him and others the hearing / they
would dispute the matter against all the contrary part and prove that the
order which they sought to establishe / ought not to take place in any
reformed church. The D. off law made a plain answer that disputation there
should be none / using his former words off charging and commaundinge not to
deal farther in that matter.

Marck the placing off the English book and off the rejecting the other.
When as the congregation hard off the cruel and more then tirannicall
dealinges off this Doctor / Master Gilby and others with him / were sent to
master John Glawburge (by whose commaundment as ye hard / they had received
the french order) puttinge him in remembrance off the same and shewinge him
that certain lately come among the^ had sought (as they were credibly
informed) to overthrow their church by placing the English book among
them. To this master Glauburg made answer / that he was informed how that
both parts were full agreed and contented / and that theruppon he had
committed the whole matter to the lawier his cosen. Marck this practice.
Then he asked for whittingham: it was answered that strait charge was given
him that he should meddle no more in that matter. The magistrate asked again off
whom he had that commandment / and when it was told him that the Doctor his
cosen had given him that charge / he then began / very gently to persuade
with master Gilby and the rest that they should be contented / and he would se
that nothing should be used but that which should be tolerable / and so
master Gilby with the rest departed.

The 28. off march D. Coxe assembled all such as had been Priests and
Ministers in England to his lodging and there declared how the Magistrates
had granted them the use off the English book / and that he thought
requisite that they should consulte together / At lenght they agreed upon the
name Pastor.
whom they thought most meet to be Bishop / Superintendent or Pastor with
the rest off the officers / as Seniors Ministers and Deacons. Whereunto master
Christopher Goodma^ answered that his opinion was / that they ought first to
agree upon some perfect an godly order for the church / and thereto to have the
consent of the congregation whereby it might appear / that they contemned not
the rest off their brethern: And farther / to proceade to the election which
he thought also ought not to be attempted withowte the consent off the whole
church. To this was answered that for the order / it was already determined /
and other order then the book off England they should no^ have / so that the
persuasions off Goodman nothing at all prevailed nether in one thing or other
/ yea / the proceadings off sundry persons (which I could name) were such
as if there had bin nether orders / officers / or church there / before their
coming / or any promise to be kept off their parts / after they came / as
may more plainly apeere to the reader by this let folowinge / written by
master Whittingham to a frinde off his in England / which letter is (off his
own hand) to be seen.

Grace, mercy and peace throught Christ our lord.
AS you require a brieff answer to your short letter / An answer to a letten
sent him owte off England.
so nether time permits / nor I intend to trouble you farther then the very
necessity off the matter askethe. And first / for that ye seem to hang in
such extreme perplexity / partly / because of sundry talks / and diverse
letters off men off good credit which cause the you not a little to merueile /
and partly / by reason off the Good opinion once conceived and yet retained off
certain persons both godly and learned / which makes you to dowte* I think
it best / briefly and simply to open a few chieff points upon the which
the rest off the matter dependethe After certain months that we had here
lived in great consolation and quietness it chanced that as our number did
increase / so some entered in / which busily undermined our liberty and
labored to overthrow our discipline / which troubles grew at lenght in so
great quantity / that by the greatest part it was concluded / that no man
should need here after to subscribe to any discipline for as much as they
presupposed that none wou^d come hither which should have need theroff. Which
done / they altered our orders in prayers and others things / thinkinge to
bring in place the full use off the great English book / which
notwithstanding / by reason off diverse imperfectio^s we could not admit / so
that to grow to a common concord it was agreed and the name off god inuocated
that the whole matter should be referred / to master Calvin Master Musculus
Master Martyr / Master Bullinger and Master Viret that both parts should
draw their orders and that to be received which by the judgments off these
5. excellent men should be thought most agreeable to a reformed church. In the
/ mean time every man to stand content with that order which was then
agreed upon and used. But within few days after / this determination was
broken* A stranger craftily brought in to preach / who had both been at mass
and also subscribed to blasphemous Articles* Many tauntinge bitter sermons were
made (as they thought) to our defacinge / in so much / as master Knox being
desired thereunto off diverse / was enforced to purge him self in sundry points
/ and spoke his mind freely in the pulpit / as well in reprouinge certain
parts off the English book / as declaringe the punishmente off God which
partly had light upon our country for slacknes in Religion / so as they
seemed to take the matter so to heart that by their false delation in accusinge
him before the Magistrates off treason against the Emperor and the Queen in
a certain book off his written to our country men off England he was
commanded to depart.

And the Magistrates understanding their fetches / and greedy cerchinge off
their own glory (who seemed to spare no kind off contention to purchase the
same) commanded that we should receive the french order (which is according
to the order off Geneua the pureste reformed church in Christendom (Whereupon
all agreed and D. Coxe with others commendinge the same to the congregation)
gave thanks to the Magistrate in all our names. Here you may note their
double faces / who / bearinge the Magistrate in hand that they received his
commandment joyfully / privily practiced / and so labored under hand / that
they made this Magistrate vnsaie / and so obtained their book / promisinge
notwithstanding / both to the Magistrate / and certain off the congregation
/ as well to prove by the word off God so much off the book as they would
use / as also to set forth the same in writtinge / that they (before the
forsaied order should be changed (might judge off the equity theroff. But
preferringe the joy off their unhoped victory before their promise / did
nether the one because they could not / nether the other because they durst
not. And yet have they not made an end off their triumph. For beginning in
march not only to neglecte all orders in the election off their Ministers and
other officers / but also to skoff and taunte others in their daily sermons /
do not yet cease as now appearethe by their slanderous and lyinge letters.

But to the end we might be delivered from this unsupportable yoke / God off his
mercy has provided better for us / and for this incommoditie has granted
us a double benefit in so much that contrary to their hope he has not only
at Basil moved the Magistrates hearts toward us in grauntinge us a church /
but also at Geneua / where as Gods word is truly preached manners best
reformed and in earth the chiefest place off true comfort. Thus in few lines
I have gone abowte to satisfy your request bearinge with time which hastes
and also folowinge mine own Judgment / which persuades me rather to give
you a taste off things (which I moved in conscience write as most true) then
to fill you with the whole discourse / which / if this may not suffice / you
may by continuance have at your commandment. Pray for us brother in this
our banishement / that the fruits off this incorruptible seed may spring
most abundantly / as we pray continually that our heavenly father would so
strengthen you with his spirit off boldenes / that you may not only resist
/ but also triumph over all your enymies to the glory off God and the
confusion off the adversaries. Know before you judge / and believe not all
fleinge tales / keep one ear open and report the the best.

Your William VVhittingham.


WHere as master whittingham in this his letter makethe mention off a church
granted them both at Basil and Geneua / it is to be noted that he himselff
was the man which the oppressed congregation required to travel therein and
through gods great mercy obtained it with great favor / who (in his journey)
passed by Zurik to know off Master Bullinger what he thought off the book
off England for that he (who had raported to master Williams / Whittingham.
Gilbie and others / that Cranmer Bishop off Canterbury had drawn up a book
off prayer an hundredth times more perfect then this that we now have / the
same could not take place / for that he was matched with such a wicked
clergy and convocation / with other enymies) Even he / I say / yet stood in
this that master Bullinger did like well off thinglishe order / and had it in
his study. But when Whittingham had demanded that question / Bullinger told
him / that indede Master H and Master C. asked his judgment concerning
certain points off that book / as Surples / private baptism. Churchinge off
women / the ring in marriage / with such like / which / (as he said) he
allowed not / and that he nether could yff he would / nether would yff he
might / use the same in his church / what so ever had been reported.

Whittingham passinge from thence to Geneua / master Calvin showed him a
letter sent from D. Coxe and from 14. more off Franck. in which letter / they
partly excused them selves that they put order in their church withowte his
counsel asked / and partly reioyci^ge for that they had (as they said)
brought the most part that had withstand their doings to their opinion /
which not withstandinge / was far otherwise.

They wrote also / that they had elected a pastor / 2. Ministers. 4. Seniors.
and 2. Deacons / etc. but how parciallie they proceaded in their elections
(those that were in office / nether discharged / nor yet their consents
required) I leave to the consciences off them which saw those disorders.

To this letter off there is the contents wheroff are above touched / master
Calvin answerethe in this wise.

To the worshippfull my louinge brethern in the lord master Richard Coxe and
the rest off the Englishemen which now remain at Frankford.
PAraduenture I answer your letter (worship. frinds and brethern) more slowly
then either ye hoped or looked for / but for so much as ye know the ways for
a time so to be beset with thenes that no messenger allmoste could pass from
hence to you the excuse of my long delay toward you shall be the easier.

I expressed my mind frankly to our beloved brother Thomas Sampson / off that
wheroff I was informed by the letters off certain men as touching the
contention vnluckelie stirred up among you. For certene off my frindes found
the^ selves grieved that you would so preciselie urge the ceremonies off
England / whereby it might appear that ye are more given and addicte to your
country then reason would. I confess that I hard certain reasons alledgod
on your behalff which would not suffer you to depart from the received order
/ but they might be soon and easily confuted Now / as I counseled mine own
frindes wh^che dissented from you / somewhat to y^lde / yff they might
conveniently / so^t offended me that there was nothing granted or relented on
your parts. Because there was no man named unto me / I durst not entr^prise
to meddle with the matter / least my credit should incur the suspecte off
ra^henes. Now that ye are more myleder and tractable in this controversy and
that ye have (as ye say) stilled the matter with quietness / I am very glad.

Verily no man well instructed or off a sound Judgment / will deny (as I
think that lights and crossings or such like trifles / sprange or issued owte
off superstition / whereupon I am persuaded that they which retain these
ceremonies in a fre^ choice / or when they may otherwise do / they are over
greedy and desirous to drink off the dregs nether do I se to what purpose it
is to but ^hen the church with tryfflinge and unprofitable ceremonies / or as
I ma^e term them with their propre name / hurtefull and offensible ceremonies
/ when as there is liberty to have a simple and pure order. But I keep in and
refrain my selff least I should seem to begin to move a new contention
off that ma^ter which as you report / is well ended.

All good men will allow the Pastors and other Ministers elections with
common voices / so that none complain that the other part off the church was
oppressed fraudulently and with craftye practices. For it standethe your
wisdoms in hand to consider / that how much commodity the goodness off
the Senate does deserve / so much envy shall you be guilty off / or charged
withal / if you have abused their lenity or gentleness / which were so well
affected toward your nation. Yet / I would not have this so taken / that I
go abowte to be prejudicial to any man but I had rather show plainly what
may be said / then to norishe an ill opinion by silence / or in holdinge my
peace. But certainly / this one thing I cannot keep secret / that Master Knox
was in my iudgemen nether godly nor brotherly dealt withal / if he were
accused by the subtle suggestion of certain / it had been better for them to
have ^aried still in their own land then unjustly to have brought in to far
countries the fierbrande off cruelty to set on fire those that would not be
kindled.

Notwistandinge / because it greueth me to speak slightly off these euells /
the remembrance wheroff I would wish to be buried in perpetual
forgetfullnes: therefore / I only counsel you (not withowt a cause) to be
wounded / that ye apply your selves to make them amends for the fault
committed.

When I hard that the one part was minded to depart from thens. They begin
pre^ely.
I earnestly admonished them (as it became me) that if they could not well
remain there / that the distance off place should not diss^pate / or rent in
sunder their brotherly agreement / for I feared much least that some privy
grudge off the former contention remained. And certainly / nothing could
more comfort my heart / then to be delivered from this fear. For if any
happily come to us / it would grieve me that there should be (as it were) but a
suspicion off any secret debate between you.

Therefore as touching that ye have written off your agreement I desire that it
may be firm and stable that if it chance the one part to go to an other
place / yet / that you being so sundred by distance off places may keep sure
the holy band off off amity / for the fault already committed is to much /
although thorowgh discord it creep no further. Wherefore it shall well be
seem your wisdoms (that ye may be frinds) to purge diligently what so ever
remainethe off this breach.

Fare ye well brethern / the lord succor you with his aid / and govern you
with his spirit / power his blessings upon you and mittigate the sorrow off
your exile From Geneua this last off may. Anno 1555. Your John Calvin.


Because that Master Calvin in his letter makes mention off lights / some
might gather that he was untruly informed / that in the English book lights
were prescribed (the contrary wheroff appears by the descr^ption before)
where it is manifest to such as be learned that he uses the figure auxesis /
and that this is his argument / a maiore ad minus / for so much as lights and
crossinges be 2. off the most auncienstest ceremonies / having continued in
the church above 13 hundredth year / are yet for such causes abolished. how
much more ought all other / that have no^ had the like continuance / and yet
abused / be utterly removed.

And for that master Calvin in this letter earnestly wished that all strife
should cease / and that yff any were minded to depart their departure might
be such / as all occasions off offense might be cut of and clean taken away:
it was thought good to such as were determined to go away with in 3. weeks
after / to follow his counsel. And the rather for that some which took them
selves / to be learned / had openly termed their departure a sisme / whereupon /
they wrote to the pastor Ministers / and whole congregation this letter
folowinge and delivered it in the open congregation.

For so much as through the benefit off God / we have obtained a church in an
other place / we thought it good to advertise you of the same. And to the
intent that not only slanderous reports may cease / but also / if any
offense be either taken or given / the same may come to trial / we desire
that you for your part would apointe 2^ Arbyters and we shall appointe other
2. Who hearing our matters thoroughly opened may witness where the fault
restethe / at which time / we will undertake / to defend our departure to be
lawful contrary to the slanderous reports off some which vnlernedly term it
a schism. Thus far brethern we thought good to signify unto you / thinkinge
this to be the only means of our mutual quietness wheroff how desirous we
are / our tedious and chargeable journey may be a sufficient proffe / being
thoroughly persuaded / that hereby strife may be ended charity revived /
frindshipe continued / Gods glory advanced / and our brethern edified.

WHen the Pastor had redd this letter openly to the congregation and was
desired to know when they should have an answer / he said unto them that so
far as he perceived / it required none but that which might presently be
made / which was / that they might depart saying they were so minded. It was
replied that for so much as it was manifest that they had been slaundered not
only by letters into diverse parts / but also / by some that then were present
/ who had affirmed their departure to be a schism / and farther / that they
could find no indifferency at their hands: it was thought necessary to
commit the hearing off that controversy to learned and indifferent judges / by
both parts to be chosen whereby the fault might appear where it was in deed /
and so they either excused or found guilty.

D. Cox / at lenght / told them that their letter should be considered off /
and an answer should be given them the fridaie after. On fridaie the 30, off
Auguste both parts met: The Pastor (accompanied with the Ministers and
elders) spoke this unto them. It seems very fond that arbytrers should be
appointed to take up strife that may come hereafter / as your letter
signifies. And furthermore / ye write / yff any offense be taken or given /
which semethe as strange / for this word (yff) importethe a dowte / so that
yff ye dowte it is but folly to apointe arbitres. finally / to excuse your
departure / you call them unlearned which judge it a schism but (says) he)
term it as you lift yet can you not let men to think. And yff arbitres should
pronounce it to be none / yet men's opinions will be di^^^s.

Now ^he^fore / your answer shall be / that if any man be offended either
with any private man / or publicly / let him or them complain to us / or yff
they refuse us / to the Magistrate.

As for Arbitres / we will appoint none. Then spoke whittingham and said that
it was to him no small wonder that men of such lerninge and wisdom should so
shrink in a most equal request / and so / withowte all reason to cavil
where no matter was offered. For / as concerning (says he) the first point
/ it was not unknown to them that at that time / thorough their occasion /
their was no small contention / and that saying they had given such offense it
could not be but that men's minds were moved.

And therefore / to the end that contention should grow no farther / Arbytres
were very necessary / who neded not to deliberate (as he said) off things to
come which were uncertain* but as the letter truly purporteth / off injuries
long agoo begone / yet continued / and here after not like to be ended
except some good mean were used to stay their slanderous letters and false
reports / to the utter perishinge and lose off men's Good names. VVittingha^
here interrupted.
And where ye seem to be ofended that the letter should call them unlearned /
which term our departure a schism (you omit said D. Coxe the 2. point /
which is off no small importance) to whom he answered that he thought he did
them a pleasure in omitting things of so small value / notwithstanding / he
would obaie his will but (says he) as touching this word vnlernedly / it
was not unadvisedly placed. For either they be withowte lerninge / and therefore
may be so called in deed / or yff they bear the name off lerninge / yet in
this they showed their unskillfulness for as much as every departure from a
congregation was not a schism / nether were any that departed for just
causes schismatikes as we (says he) will prove unto you / yff you will take
our reasonable and most equal offer. Naie / says the pastor / Arbitres in
this point can little avail for be it they judged it none / yet men's thoughts
are free / and we know that all men be not off one mind in sacraments and
predestination / should men therefore take arbitres? Also says he master
Calvin and Bullinger / are against you. To this was answered / that thoughts /
yff they were not grownded upon Gods word / were evil / neither was this
controversy off like force with the matter off the Sacraments and
predestination / notwithstanding / would to God that not only the difference
in those articles but also in all other which be off weight and importance
might be decided by the authority off Gods word and arbytrement off godly
learned men. But men may justly suspecte your cause to be naught which refuse
the judgments off the wise and godly.

And where you say that Calvin and Bullinger are against us / you abuse your
selff and there names / for we know both what they and other write as
touching this matter.

Then the Pastor asked what schisma was but a cuttinge off from the body / and
that it was Caluins definition. To this Whittingham answered that he would
undertake first / to prove that definition to be false / and secondly to be
nonone off Caluins definition for yff every cuttinge off from the body should
be a schism / then you and all other which once had sworn to the pope and
now have refused him are schismatiques. Then the pastor added / from a church
well reformed. Answer was made that a church well reformed must be builded
upon the doctrine off the Prophets and Apostles / the unity wheroff S. Paul
comprehends in these words: one god / one faith / one baptism / not
beggarly ceremomies and obscurations / although that sundry causes besides
moved them to depart. Then Master Treherren / asked whither the donatists
were not schismatiques.

Yes / says Whittingham and also heretics / but you are deceived yff you
think that they separated them selves for ceremonies. It is manifest said
Treherren / that the churches off Asia were excommunicate as schismatiques for
that they kept not Easter at the same time that the Roman church did. And
it is no less evident said Whitthingham that Ireneus and other godly men
as well off that time / as since have sharply reproved and condemned Pope
Victor for the same.

Here D. Coxe put Whittingham in remembrance that he had not answered to the
faults off the letter. Whittingham told him / that as touching that poor
word (yff) he marueled how it could Minister any cauillation / saying / the
text ioininge thereto was so plain / which declarethe both the offenses by
you given and by us taken. And also your consciences bear you witness / the
thing to be most true except a man will be wilfully blind / and find a
knot in a rushe / so that that word (if) mente not that we do / dowte who were
oppressed with infinite wrongs / but if they would dissemble so far that
they might seem to dowte theroff / yet / at the least / they would abide the
trial theroff before these Arbitres. But here the disputation brake up with
this plain and final answer that arbitres they should have none / and that
yff they found themselves grieved / they should seek remedy where they thought
Good and he the Pastor with the rest off the congregation would answer them.

The next day the Pastor / D. Coxe / master parry and master Asheley sent
for Whittingham / Thomas Cole John Fox / William Kethe / Roger heart / John
Hilton with certain other / demandinge off them what should be the cause off
their departure. Whittingham made answer that the day before they had
declared sufficiently / and yet would farther show reasons / yff they would
permit the controversy to Arbytrement. And to the intent they should not
counterfeit ignorance (among other) these were some causes first / their
breach off promise / established with invocation off gods name: 2. Their
ordreles thrustinge themselves in to the church. 3. Taking away the order
off discipline established before their coming and placinge no other. 4. The
accusasion off master Knox their godly Minister off Treason and seekinge his
blood 5. Their ouerthrowinge off the common order / taken and commanded by
the Magistrate 6. The displacinge off officers withowte any cause alleged.
7. The bringing in off Papisticall superstitions and unprofitable Ceremonies
which were burdens yokes and clogges / besides other things / which / yff
they would abide the trial they should hear at large. When he and some off
the rest had rendered their reasons for their departure to this effect /
certain warm words passed to and fro from the one to the other / and so in
some heat departed.

Not many days after the oppressed church departed from Franck. to Basil and
Geneua / some stayinge at Basil as master Fox with other. The rest came to
Geneua where they were received with great favor and mutche courtesy / both
off the magistrates Ministers and people. So soon as they entered their church
/ they chose Knox and Goodman for their Pastor / and Gilby requested to suplie
the rome till Knox returned owte off france.

The learned men which came from all places to Frank. abowte this matter (when
they had done that which they came for / they returned again from whens they
came / and some to other places / where they might save charges / and not to be
either burdened or bownde to the excercises of the congregation / so that /
the exile which was to many a poor man full bitter / grievous and painful /
was (to some off the greatest persecutours off their poor brethetn (as it were
/ a pleasant progress or recreation.

But now it shall be necessary to declare what order was taken in this new
erected congregation for the prosperous continuance off the same / which
thing to do / I cannot by a better mean then placinge here this letter
folowinge which master cole (late deane off Sarum) wrote to a frinde off his
/ whiles yet he stayed (behind his company) in Franck. among them, his letter
is yet to be seen.

The holy spirit off God that guides the children off God in truth and
godliness be your comfort thorough our mercies seat Jesus Christ / now and
for ever Amen.
THe tempeste off the swellinge seas which in times paste thretned shipwreck
to every vessel that sailed with a fair wind and full sails to the port
off blessed truth / which off her selffe is strong enough / with owte any
bar or wall off man's inventions / are somewhat (the lord be praised)
caulmed to me ward / so that withowt farther reasoninge they permit me to my
conscience as touching their ceremonies.

The cause I judge is not for that they bear less love to them then in times
past / but that they perceive the sturdy defendinge off them / to work them
that they look not for / or rather / that which they are loathe to se / namely
/ the decreasinge off their company* yet they labor with policy what they
may or can / to prevent this danger but yet that which they fear / I
suppose will fall upon them / unless god give them to repent their old
faults and humble them more to know them selves.

They have set up an university to repaier again their estimation by
mainteinance of lerninge (which surely is well done) that was fondly brought
in decaie by wilful ignorance / in defendinge off ceremonies / to the which
Master horn is chosen to be the reader off the Hebrew lecture / Master
Mullings off the Greek / and Master Treherren when he is strong / shall take
the divinity lecture in hand. Master Whitthead was appointed thereunto but
because he would escape the labor off the lecture (for just causes as he
said) he forsook the pastoral office also / stowtly (as you know) denyinge
to be in office any longer. Great hold there was abowte this matter in the
congregation / in so much as they hasted to a new election / and very few
(as it seemed) were off a contrary mind / no / not his own frindes sauinge
Master makebray and Master Sorby / who desired him to take respit / and the
congregation to give it. But some lookinge for the office themselves would not
in such a matter suffer delay / but again Demanded off Master Whithead
whither he would keep his office or no supposinge that he which had so
stowtely denied it in word / would not soon be flexible to the contrary. But
he perceauinge that some would have had him owte one the one side / and by
leauinge off it / his estimation was like to decaie on the other side / (for
many rough words were given him) when occasion off intretie was offered / non
respuit conditionem by that means bringinge to him self wittily / a triple
commodity / one / the preuentinge off them which looked for the office / an
other / the refusal off the divinity lecture / Thirdly / a faster growndinge
himselff in that office / which he left in mouth / but as it seemed / not in
heart. Thus ended that comedy.

But shortly after (notwithstanding a vehement sermon made for the purgation
from man's inventions) the seas begin again to swell (so fickle an element is
water) for Master Kent having a child to Christen purposinge to have it done
simply / withowte the bewtifinge off men's traditions / came with his child
according to the french order which we once received / and one to hold it
there to profess his faith yff it were required / but the pastor denied the
Christening / unless 2. Godmothers were had after the order off the book / as
concerning the Godfather / Master Makebray (who is now comme to that office)
supplied it. A lucky matter is attained at Wezell in Westphalia / an open
church for our English men / to which because off nighnesse) they fear
many will go from hence / but moo will come owte off England to yt. I pray you
commend me to M. Tell him that Master wisdom railed on them that were gone to
G. Calling them mad heads with many pretye names / I will not say unwisely /
But I may well say uncharitably / in which Sermon / he showed him selff an
Antagonist for the book off England / etc.

Your Thomas Cole.


SHortly after thies things to wete / the 6. off Ian. When as master Whithead
gave up off his own good will / as he said / the pastoral office / Master
horn was in the election to succeed him / who protested that he would not
meddle therewith / till he were cleared off certain suspicions which some had
bruted to the discredit off his ministry / and obtaininge his request / he
with the Seniors entered the church the first off march Anno Domini 1556.
were they received all such persons (as members off that church) which were
contented to subscribe and submit themselves to the orders off the same. From
which time forward the troubles and contious were so sore among them / that
who so shall well way it with due consideration / I ween / he shall think it
to be the just judgment off our righteous God that fell upon them / for
supplantinge a church there before them in great quietness and off much
sincerity.

The history of that stir and strife which was in in the English church at
Franckford from the 13. day off Ian. Anno Domini 1557. forward.
THere fell a certain controversy the xiij. day off Ian. at supper between
Master Horn the Pastor and Master Asheley which controversy was handled /
with somewhat more sharp words then was meet / but yet they so departed / by
the industry and labor off some certain persons / that they drank wine one
to an other / and all that strife and contention was thought to be wholly taken
away. Afterward / to wit / the 16. day off Ian. at one off the clock in the
after noone / three off thelders sent for Master Asheley in to an house off one
off the Elders and they began to debate the matter with him touching an
iniurye done / not to the pastor alone / but to all the Elders (as they
affirmed) and to their ministry which thing / Master Asheley denied that he
ever did at any time.

The next day being the 17. off Ian. After that public prayers were ended /
Master Asheley was by the Pastor and all the Elders called into the church /
and there / in the name off them all it was objected unto him / that he had
spoken upon the 13. day off Ian. in supper while / certain words tendinge to
the slander off them and their ministry.

Ashely answered that he perceived and understood that they all were offended
as in their own matter / and that therefore he wound not answer before them
as competent judges off the cause / but would refer the cause / that he had
against the Pastor and them (saying they showed them selves an adversary part
to him) to the whole church and Ecclesiastical discipline. Then the Pastor
exhorted him that he would not so proceade / for yff he so did / that then they
were minded to seek and demand help off the magistrate against him After
that the 24. off Ian. Asheley himselff handled his own cause in his own name
before the pastor and elders / and the^ in the afternoon / he sent 2. me^ of
the church who / in his name require the pastors and elders that they would
not proceed against him in that cause / wherein they themselves were a part /
and therefore not f^tt or competent judges / but to give over the whole ma^ter
to 8. or 10. men upright in conscience and inclininge to nether part / by
whose judgments / if he were found in fault / he would willing^y submit
himselff to all Ecclesiastical discipline. Answer was made him by the Pastor
in the name off them all / that they had received their authority from the
whole church and would retain and keep the same till such time as they from
whom they had received it vvoulde again demand it. And in the mean while
/ they purposed to proceed thereafter against all such as had offended and
so much the more severely and sharply against Master Asheley / by how much
it might be more profitable for the whole church / to make him being a
wors^hipfull man / an ensample to others to take heed and beware by asheley
(that answer being received the 26. off Ian. Which was a day off solemn
prayer) fearinge those things which Horn had said before / theateninge him
with the Magistrate / when common prayer was ended declared the whole ma^ter to
the church and desired that the church would understand off the whole matter
between the pastor and elders / as the one party and him selff as the other.

Whereupon certain men did in the name off the whole church demand off the
pastor and elders whither they were a part against Asheley. The pastor
answered in all their names that they were not a part against him / but that
Asheley had slandered them all. Again / it was demanded in the name off the
church who were his accusers / to which / when the pastor answered nothing
/ neither in his own name / nor in the name of the seniors: Asheley was
commanded by the church publicly and openly to read those things which he
had comprehended in vvrytinge concerning his cause. Afterward the pastor and
elders were asked wither those things which Asheley had redd were true. The
pastor answered in all their names that they would not answer either more
largely or any otherwise / to any questions then they had ervvhile ansvvered
and so the congregation was dismissed vvithowte answer / yet not with ovvte
contempt as was thought. The same day at afternoon / Master Hales / who
was absent when these things were done) understanding that this matter
tended to more grievous striffe and contention / did write his letters to some
certain persons that seemed desirous off the peace off the church / and
desired / that they would come together the next day after to the church /
to consulte / and deliberate what were the best way to pacify this trouble
and turmoile before it waxed more strong / or should be more published abroad
and made better known to the senate or magistrates.

The very dryfte and purpos off the letters / together with them that were
called / as them also which came to the place appointed / does appear by the
letters themselves / the copy whereoff insewethe.

I Hear brethern / that which is to me grievous to hear / to wit / that
striffes are arisen in our church / which tend either to the dissolution
off the church / or to the hurt and destruction of the poor / wherefore I
pray you whose names are in the subscription off the letters / that (if you
shall so think good) we may meet to morrow in the morninge in our church /
there to consulte and take advise what may be the best way to quiet this
stir / to the glory off God and our own quietness. god give us his peace.

This 26. of Ian. 1557. Your louinge brother John Hales.


I pray you / that so many off you as will met at the time and place appointed
to put down your names / lest some parhap may come in vain.

Now all those whose names are before rehearsed came except master warcope.

After consultation and advise taken / it seemed best to al them that were
called together and met there / that the next day after / one off them in
all their names should deal with the Pastor and elders / that since Ashley
complained that they were adversary part unto him / they would suffer the
church / or some such certain persons as the church should appoint / to
take knowledge off the cause / and to hear first whither they were an
adversary part to Ashley which if they were not found to be / then the
knowledge off the matter should be put back again to the^ and that with the
ignominy and shame off him that had appealed from them. But yff they were
found to be adversary part / that then it should seem unjust / that they
should sit in their own cause as judges / but more meet and upright it would
be / that then the church should know and understand off the whole matter /
whereupon the next day after / that is to say / the 18 off Ian. when prayers
were ended / the matter was proposed to the pastor and Elders / by one appointed
for that purpose. When this counsel was once known / the minister by the
consent off the Elders drew owte off his bosom a decree which the magistrate
off that city had made / and redd it with a loud voice before the whole
church. The decree being redd he added in grave words / that these our
assemblies and meetinges would be very dangerous no^ to us only but to all
the congregations off strangers. for it was greatly to be feared least the
magistrate being offended with such meetings / did not shut up the gates off
our church alone / but also off all the strange churches And therefore that he
(to thend he might in good season provide for such dangers) would surely by
Ecclesiastical discipline handle according to his deserte / master Halee (who
then by occasion of sickness was absente) the author of that assembly / and
that he would pronounce of us generally / that if it were not schismatic /
yet / that it did withowte dowte te^d to schism / how so ever we excused our
minds and purposes. moreover he affirmed / that we had don very ill / in that
we had excluded / and shut owte certain which came in to the church in the
time off our consultation and meeti^ge^ Answer was made in the names of the
church / that that decree off the magistrate was by them before both read
over thoroughly / vnd also very diligently waied / and that they judged that
decree to be most upright and justly to be feared off wicked and lewd men /
such as were sectaries and factious persons and that they did assuredly know
that the threats of that decree did nothing at all concern them who were met
together to make peace and unity / and that they for this deed did so little
fear the anger and displeasure of the magistrates that they trusted the
magistrate would praise the^ for this matter / yff parhappes he knew off the
thing it selff and that therefore they were assembled and comme together that
the whole matter might be quietly ended among themselves and not brought
before the magistrate. for where we (say they) were banished men / and had by
the means off a very good magistrate / received that singular and most
excellent benefit off rest and quietness / we should do that which should be
most unfit and unseemly for us / if we should by occasion of our striffes and
hurley burlies / trouble the magistrate / and to render unto that very good
Magistrate unquietness / troubles and stirrs which should be very evil
thanks / for so great a benefit off quietness and rest as we have received. And
we affirmed that we so much the more dililigentlie and wilingly labored in
pacifiynge and endinge this controversy because there were amongst us
certain / who rashly and with owte advise / brought unto the Magistrate all
light and small controversies / which might easily have bin determined and
ended among our selfs / herein deserving no favor at all either at the the
hands off so Good a Magistrate / whom they oftimes withowte cause troubled / or
of their country men whom they by thies their privy complaints and
accusations did among strangers slander as unquiet and troublesome men / and
that they had done no less displeasure to the gospel we profess / (which by
occasion off such accusations / is comonlie evil spoken off among the
adversaries) then to that so good a magistrate and to their own country men.
And that we therefore (to the end the Magistrate might not be troubled / nor our
nation slaundered as unquiet and troublesome / nor the word off God through us
evil spoken off) met together to take counsel and auise how all the matter
might be peaceably ended and for no other cause or purpose. And where it was
objected that in that decree off the Magistrate there was no mention at all made
/ either off the whole church / or off the authority off whole church: We
answer (say they) that we do not so interpret the Magistrates decree / as
though yt were the Magistrates mind and pleasure to take from the church the
right and authority due to the Church and make the whole Church subject to
some certain persons. For we both well inoughe know by the example off the
french church in a like controversy / and we have tried that so very good a
Magistrate has very great care off the church. And as concerning Ma^ster
Hales / yt was answered / that he was then absente / by reason off his
sickness / and not for fear / or that he was guilty to him selff off any ill.

And co^cerninge our whole purpose and business / because it was said though
our mynds parhaps were upright / yet the deed it selff was / yff not
schismatic / yet verelie tendinge to schism / answer was made in all our
names that we would render account as well off our minds and purpose before
God / as off our deed before the whole church / and that under peril and
pain off the last punishment that Ecclesiastical discipline can apointe /
or yff the matter so r^qui^e / before the ciuyll Magistrate in pain off our
lyffe. And as touching them that were not admitted in to the church / to our
consultation / it was answered that we were unjustly accused / for that it was
not a public and common assembly of the whole church. But a metinge of some
certain persons to consulte of that which might be profitable / and that
therefore they had no greater injury done the^ in not being at the
consultation to which they were not called or sent for / then if had not been
admitted in to some certain private stone or house. for as touching the
church / saying it was then empty and void off people / it was / as it were
/ a private house. Nether is every assembly met there to be counted the
church. For when the pastor or some other reads there a lecture / or
moderateth the disputations / it is not then a church but a scoole. And
therefore / not the place / but the company off men gathered together did make a
church or congregation. Afterward / it was skarcely by many words obtained
off the pastor and Seniors / that the church might withowt their favor and
good will meet together for the finishing and taking up off this controversy
/ and uprightly determine whether the said pastor and elders were an adversary
part to ashley yea or no which thing yet at the lenght the pastor and elders
granted to the church. And the pastor and Elders being required and desired
that they would together be present with us in the congregation / they answered
that there was no such need / nether that they would at any hand^ hinder us.
The next day after / to wit / the 29. off Ian. the pastor and Elders agreinge
thereto / as is said before / when the whole church was met together /
master hales / who then was somewhat better / and was present when they began
to take advise and counsel / rose up and spoke to this purpose. My brethern
(says he) saying I am accused of the pastor before the whole church / as the
author of schism or of a schismatic fact / or at the least rendinge to
schism / if you also judge of me in like sort I will depart out off this
company / as one being unmeet to tarry among you in this assembly. This
being said / he addressed himselff to depart / Afterward / he was called
back by all the men there assembled and entreated to abide amongst them.
Afterward he drew forth those letters by which he had called certain men
together to make peace and end the stir / as is before said / and preferred
them to the church to be openly redd. Which letter being redd / that / his
deed was judged off all them that were present / both honest and most meet
for a Christian man nether that any man that had called either others to make
peace by their meetinge / was for such a fact to be accounted a schismatic.
Then they were all desired / that saying they had so judged and determined /
they would appoint this their sentence to be registered and put down in
writing / that it might stand in steed off a record and testimonye / not for
Master Hales only but for all other in the like case / and with all / that
this new and present vpstartinge matter might by their judgments be decided
and ended least it might bring forth and stir vv new contentions among
them. Whereupon it was put down in wrytinge to this effect. If two / four /
eight / twelve or mo or less / meet in the church when it was void off
people / prayer and other exercises / or else in private howses to make peace
between some members off the church / or to consulte off any other thing
profitable for the church that that their deed and act should not in any case
be judged or esteemed vnorderlie / seditious / schismatic / or tendinge to
schism.

Neither that he which either by writing or word off mouth had so called
them together should be thought to be the author off any schism or a
schismatic fact or tendinge to schism and division. And because now no
place off speakinge in the congregation withowte offense did seem any more to
be left to any man / it was ordained the said 29. off Ian. that it should be
lawful for any man having before desired / off the pastor / elders / and
whole church license and liberty to speak / to show his judgment and
opinion in the church withowt any reproach off a disordered deed therefore / so
it be / that he did it godly quietly and soberlie* yff he should speak any
ungodly thing that the^ it was lawful for the pastor and Seniors / or any
off them forthwith to command him to hold his tongue. The last day off
Ian. being the Sabath day after morninge prayer was ended / pardon was offered
of all private offenses / by the pastor in his own name and the name off the
elders to all the people off the church and in like sort the people were
desired to pardon them yet in such sort this was done that the Pastor and
Elders would reserve to themselves such causes as concerned their Ministry
/ to be pursued and followed off them. It was answered again in our names off
the church that we in like sort did pardon all men / all private grudges /
yet / that the church did according to their example reserve unto it selff
public causes belonginge to the church and the liberty theroff quietly and
Christianly to be pursued and followed / which answer allthoughe it were
measured by the rule off that pardon and forgeuenes which the pastor had
before offered / yet / it did no white at al please him which thing also I
warra^te you he did not dissemble. Afterward / the pastor and elders suffered
that the same day in the afternoon / the church should again meet / and
should try owte and know the matter between them and Asheley / to wit /
vvhither they were an adversary part / to Ashley yea or no / But the Pastor
and Elders being desired that they also vvoulde be present / they vvoulde not
thereto agree. Wherefore the church being gathered together in the afternoon /
it was judged by the testimony off some meet me^ and by this also / that in
the whole church there could no other be found that would accuse Ashley
but the pastor and elders (for it was 3. times very diligently enquired of
and published among the people / that if their were any in the whole
church which either would or could accuse master Ashley / he should then
vter it) It was I say judged and determined that the Pastor and Elders /
were an adversary part to Master Ashley and that therefore they were not
fit and competent judges in that matter. Furthermore / it was fully decreed
that the Pastor and elders in such causes as in which they were an
adversary part were not fit arbitres or judges / but that such causes did
apperteine and belo^ge / either to the knowledge off the congregation or off
such as the congregation vvoulde appointe to that purpos. And because the
pastor and elders have been oftentimes desired to be present with us and yet
vvoulde not (notvvithstanding that they themselves suffered the congregation to
meet together) least parhapp some deceit might be among many of the
congregation as though it were not off it selff lawful / or to small purpose
to apointe any thing with owte the pastor and elders (which thing afterward
tried) it was decreed that if the pastor and elders were required to be
present at an assembly and would not come / that the assembly was laufull
notwithstanding their absence / and that those things which they decreed
should be had and esteemed as a lawful decree. These Ecclesiastical decrees
and ordinances / which even now we rehearsed were subscribed unto with the
names off 33. persons which is a great deal the bygger part off the church
/ and the 2. off February were offered up to the pastor and Elders in the name
off the whole church with this protestation folowinge. Master No well was the
mouth for the rest.
We present unto you these our decrees and ordinances agreing with right and
reason and not contrary to the holy scriptures / desyringe to have you know
them and further requiring that you would with us consent / yield and
subscribe to the same. Or yff ye will not so do / show we pray you upright
reasons and good causes why ye refuse. For we are ready to correct and amend
our faults yff they be showed us / at the monition off any private person /
but much more at yours the pastor and Elders. For as we desire their wisdoms
to come to perfect truth: so we will not thorough stubbernes defend any
error / being showed unto us to be an error in deed. Yet notwitstanding /
afterward upon in the aforesaie day off February / the Pastor did in his own
name and in the name off the Elders / openly read certain written letters to
which he and the Seniors had before in the presence off the church subscribed
their names. The sum theroff was this. Saying the church had left unto them
a vain shadow only off authority withowte any other matter / that
therefore they did in our presence shake off from themselves and utterly
forsake all Ecclesiastical ministry and service to the church.

Among other things they added this that we had given them a cause to
complain off us to the magistrates / but that for our sakes they world not do
it. Afterward some of them departed and sat down in private men's places /
neither would they suffer so much as to be called by the name off pastors and
Elders. Then one in the name off the whole / having fully showed before /
that there was no just cause given the^ by the church / so to forsake their
ministry / did afterward in the name of the whole church very earnestly
desire the^ that they would not in such manner forsake and leave the church
that had deserved no such thing at their hands.

This was with most e^rneste and effectual words required off them / three or
four times in the name off the whole church / but they remained wilful and
obstinate in their purpos / not so much as once suffringe themselves to be
called by the name off pastors and elders. Then at the lenght / it was showed
unto them in the name off the whole church / that the church would not admit
that their forsakinge of their ministry / but would still take and esteem them
for their pastor and Elders. And when one in the name off the church did
accuse the pastor and Chambers to be such as had abused the church / leauinge
it and forsakinge it in such manner withowte any cause or reason showed / and
did in the name off the church desire them to make answer unto him
concerning this their deed / they utterly refused the same. But horn who
then was Pastor / hastily taking a pen / wrote to this purpos in a piece of
paper in his own name and in the name off the elders. Where as we are urged
and pressed by one in the name off the church to make answer / we generally
answer / that when so ever we shall be ordinarily demanded before the church
or them which the church shall apointe / we will then answer / or if we
shall be called before the civil magistrate we will there answer. other
answer then this they would give none / to any off the questions which we
had proposed in all our names of the church. (and they assigned this writing
by puttinge to their names) where as in deed this was not only to answer
nothing at all / but also to pretend a cloaked cause of answeringe nothing at
all. Moreover / they were desired in the name of the church that they would
deliver to the church the letters signed with their own hands / by which
they had showed their renounsall and denyinge of the ministry: or if they
would not do that / that the^ against a certain day they would grant and
give to the church a coppie thereof. But neither would they give them the
letters which they had in their bosom neither would promise any copy to
the church / who most earnestly required the same off the^. At the last /
the pastor and elders departed / some certain few folowinge the^ / but the
multitude remained and so farrforthe as they could remember / committed to
writing the acts off that day and the sum off those letters (by which the
Pastor and Elders had willingly put them selves from the ministry) and for
witness subscribed thereto with thirty and there names. The next day after /
that is / the 3. off February the Pastor and Elders being called off the
church by the Deacon / to entreat off making peace / they came together and
met. But the Pastor and elders set them down in private places. Afterward /
the pastor (because one speakinge in the congregation did not by and by so
soon as he bad him hold his peace) feigned that he would depart. But when he
perceived that very few followed him / and by some consailed / he returned /
and suddanly placed himselff in the pastors place / and called the elders to
him / which thing / before he had refused to do although he were by the whole
church very instantly and earnestly required thereto. Then / he spoke to this
effect: we in deed (says he) did displace our selves from the ministry /
not withstandinge / absolutely and fully we did it not / but under this
condition only / yff you should proceade to deal in such sort as you have
done against the old and received discipline. Now then / yff ye goo forward
as you have appointed and purposed / then will we wholly and altogether
displace our selves from our Ministeries / but yff you will obaie the old
discipline then will we continue pastor and elders as we are. Answer was made
that there was nothing at all contained in the old discipline / whereby they
might meddle with / or proceed against the pastor and elders / if parhapps
they were found faulty and in some offense. Moreover / that there was
nothing put down concerning such causes / as in which the pastor and
elders were an adversary part / and therefore it was desired that they would
suffer the discipline in that behalff to be amended and to be made more
perfect. Now the pastor being offended as it should seem / with so free
speech would im^ediatlie again have bin gone / and rann even to the church
door / but yet saying but few folowinge him / by the counsel and advise off
certain persons he returned / and sat him selff down in the pastors place
with the seniors.

And in like sort / by and by again upon the sudden / he ran^ for the
third time / but within a little while after here turned and planted himselff
in the pastors accustomed place. Afterward intretie was made with the pastor
and elders in the name off the church / that they would suffer Ashleis cause
(in which matter they themselves were found at the lenght to be an adversary
part) and the hearing theroff to come before the church / And that the
church would (yff Ashley were found faulty) very sharply and severely
punish him / and in this behalff abundantly satisfy the pastor and Elders
and all good men. But the pastor and Elders would at no hand suffer that. And
as concerning the amendinge off the discipline / the pastor said that he and
the elders with certain others by the authority off the church being joined
unto them would (yff the church so thought good* amend the discipline. But
answer was made unto both / in the name off the church. First that it was
very unjust that / the church should not be suffered to have judgment and
determination. For thereby the authority and right off church was wholly as it
were / taken from the church. To the second it was answered that since such
ordinances and decrees were to be made / as by which the Pastor and Elders
should be hereafter detained in duty (some off them also being already
accused) it should be unjust dealing to admit them to the framinge and making
off such decrees. And when they affirmed they would answer no other thing /
and they were desired to suffer those things to be committed to writing which
were done already / they would not agree / but the pastor saying he was a
cold made himself ready to depart / and goinge his way a few folowinge him
/ he pronownced / that he dissolved the assembly. But the company that tarried
in the church and wrote the doings of that day by their decree / and
appointed 8. men to amend the discipline / and Afterward to offer it the
church to be seen of the^ / did also apointe other. 8. men (of which 8.
three / allwaies stuck the pastor) arbitres and judges to decide the cause
between the pastor and elders / and Ashley. These are their names. master
Railton / master Warcope / M. Kelke M. faulconer / M. Bentham M. Cockroft / M.
Carell and M. Wison. Three off these were addicted the to pastor but M. Bentham
and M. Kelke alwais showed themselves indifferent and equal to both sides.
From that time forward the pastor and elders and certain others being often
times called of the church / by the Deacons and certain other to entreat of
making peace and agreement / would never apeere or be present.

Morouer the pastor and the Deacons / and certain painful poor men / ceased
both from preachinge and also the Ecclesiastical lectures and other ordinary
functions and charges which they ought to have executed / neither would they
come to solemn and public prayers in the church. notwithstanding the church
yet thorough Gods favor observed both public prayers / sermons and
Ecclesiastical lectures / and all other things accustomed and minded to keep
them so long as the godly Magistrates should suffer and grant the same. And
no other matter did so much spread abroad throughowt the city as the fame and
report off our striffes and as the deed off master Horn and Master
Chambers. For when they off themselves had forsaken the church and had by
their example stirred up some other with their families to do the like / and
some off these now frequented and went / partly to the french church / and
partly to the Germany churches / the matter now could not any longer be hyd
and in secret saying it was published and known not through the city alone /
but the fame theroff ran^ to other strangers also* which matter and business
with their brethern / would to God they had chosen rather to have had it
ended quietly and peaceably in their own church / then in such troblesome
sort to have consulted so greatly / both to their own dishonestie and ours.
The fourth day off February which was Thursdaie and appointed for public
prayer / the pastor who that day should have preached / and all the Elders were
absent. Now the pastor being before by the Deacon desired in the name off the
church that either he himselff would preach or apoint some other in his place
/ made answer / that neither would he preach him selff nor apointe any
other. For that matter did nothing at all belong unto him. After prayers were
ended some there were that disputed and reasoned in the pastors behalff and
said / that that assembly which remained after the pastors departure (in as
much as he had authority to call together the church and to break up the
assembly and he goinge his way said / that he brake up that assembly) was
no lawful assembly. To whom it was (in the name off the church) answered /
that Master Horn had put owte himselff from his pastoral dewtie / and
therefore / both for that matter and many other recited before among the Act.
of the 2. day of Feb. he had not any authority / or any manner of right
either to gather together or to break up the assembly. And although it were
granted that he were their lawful pastor / yet / it was affirmed that the
church was above the pastor and not the pastor above the church and that
therefore thowghe the pastor departed / before the acts off that day were
confirmed / and pronounced that he brake up the assemblye yet was the assembly
which remained and tarried behind a lawful assembly / and had authority to
make effectual decrees / by which they might bind all and every member of
the church with owte exception. And that this question (whither the pope was
above the church or the church above the pope) was stirred up in the
councelles off constance and Basil / and was decided also by the authority
off the schole off parise joined thereto. Now they which reasoned in the
pastors behalff did seem by the space off certain days after / to approve
these 2. counsels / for they placed the pastor above the church. They brought
forth openly all the old store and howsholde stuff of Pighius and Eckius of
the primacie of the pope under the name off the Pastoral authority and for
the proffe theroff. The acts and disputations off that day were in testimony
/ signed and confirmed with two and thirty names. The 5. off Februa. Master
horn and the seniors being required off the congrega^ion by a deacon to come
and treat off reconciliation would not appear. After this there were 3.
Messengers sent from the congregation unto them / off whom / one was to be
specially reverenced off all that be off the congregation both for his age and
gravity / the other^ specially well learned / to the intent they should be moved
by these so honest a company off Messengers sent by the congregation. These men
/ when they had in the churches name instantly desired / and prayed them that
they would come to the congregation and there common brotherly among
themselves for a quyete agreement to be had / so as the matter might not come to
the magistrates ears / nor be bruted any farther abroad to the great infamy
of our nation / could do no good with them at all. for they said they would
not come unless they were ordinarily called. As for other answer at that
present they would make none. When this answer was declared to the
congregation / it was determined that for as much as R Horn had openly put
himself owte off his pastorshipp by writing subscribed with his own hand /
and confirmed the same by words and deeds in long absteining from preachinge
and other pastoral functions / and affirminge that such matters were no point
off his charge. In as much as now being called of the church / he will not
appear / and so absteinethe all together from public prayers and all
Ecclesiastical meeti^gs: And for as much also as the Seniors come not at the
meetings of the church / least the congregation thorough the forwardnes of
the said Robart Horn and absence off the Seniors / being void and destitute
off common prayer / preachinge / and readinge the scriptures should be utterly
dissolved / that certain men should take charge off the church and for all
things to be done in the congregation as it has by Gods goodness been yet
hitherto done.

other decrees also which are specified in the Acts off the ^. day off
Februa. they established: all which every one that was present confirmed by
his name subscribed with his own hand / as they were wont to do in other
acts and decrees. And to the decrees off that day subscribed 33. hands. But
in this beha^ff both master Horn and master Chambers and other in their
behalf did find very much fault with us / for that we had proceaded
vnordinarilie / that is (you must understand) contrary to the old discipline.
For where they could not iust^y find fault with those things that the
church had done / they made cauillation at the manner off doing off things as
an vnordinary man^er. And we answered as well many other things grew now by
occasion off that matter / as this chiefly: in case Master Chambers or any
other man / either would or could show any ordinary way in the old
discipline whereby the congregation / or any other might com^ mence matter /
and proceade against him or against a Senior or Seniors being accused: or
how we might proceade ordinarely according to the old discipline in causes /
wherein he and the seniors were the one part as they now were proved to be:
And yff Master Horn / or any other man either would or could show the
title or words in the old Discipline / wherein this ordinary way is set
forth and contained: Then we would confess thvt we had gone amiss out off the
ordynary way and old discipline. But yff neither he nor any other would or
could show in deed / that they would not be discontent at us that reduced
the congregation to their right authority and amended that old discipline as
athinge amiss / or filled it up as a thing imperfect and brought the matter
to the hearing off the church as it ought to be: And that they would at
lenght give over to vaunte them selves so off the order which they never had /
or to blame us hereafter for proceading vnordinarely. The sum off this
answer / we dyuyded in to certain Articles / and sent them pryuately to
Master Horn to peruse / requiring his answer to the same vnd also we sticked
them upon the pu^pit in the church where they remained a great many days. And
where it was required in that same writing that Master Horn / or the Seniors
or some other man should make answer unto these matters / there is no man yet
hitherto that hather made any answer / either by word or by writing /
sauinge that Master Horn fallinge to his old general answer / said / he
would make answer when he were ordinarely called or questioned with for by
this shift he thinkethe he undoes all dowtes at once / where as in deed / to
answer after that sort / is to answer nothing at all / but to pretend false
causes to hold his tongue when he is able to show no reason for himselff. For
this was his meaning that he is not ordinarely called nor questioned with all
/ nor accused ordinarely / sauinge only before him selff / and the Seniors as
Judges / Where as they both in their geuinge over off their ministry / and in
the principal cause against master Ashley were the adversary part so that by
his judgment there is no ordinary way to meddle against the pastor and Seniors
except they call themselves to be hearers of their own cause and their own
Judges themselves. For other ordinary way against the pastor and Seniors in
that old discipline off theirs / neither he nor any other shall be hable to
show.

After this / when those 8. Persons which were appointed by the Church to
hear the variance between Master Horn and Master Chambers one thoneside /
and Master Asley one the other side / should proceade in the hearing off that
matter / Master Horn and Master Chambers which had absented themselves now
11. days from the church were commanded by the Magistrate the 12. off
February (for that day / they and certain others were seen with the
Magistrate) that they should in no wise comme at our church. when we hard off
yt / we had marvel / first that the matter was comme to the Magistrates ear
(for Master Horn and the rest testified the 2. off February by their own
hand writing / that they would never open it to the Magistrate) and
secondarely / saying Master Horn and Master Chambers could by no means be
entreated to come to the church yt seemed awonder that yt was commanded by the
Magistrates that they should not come / as though they had byne desirous to come
/ which in deed neded not.

Therefore / the most part thought that that commandment was obtained by
their own suit / at the Magistrates hands / both that such persons as knew
not the matter / should be persuaded that yt was long off the Magistrates
commandment that they did not their offices in the Church. Where as before
this Commandment was given they had off a purposed frowardnes absented
themselves now already more then ten days from the congregation. And also
besides / that the congregation might not proceade against them saying the
Magistrate commanded them that they should not appear. And this was the very
let in deed why the congregation proceaded not in hearing and determining off
the varyance between Master Horn and Chambers off the one party and Ashley
on the other.

And in this they burden us maliciously with owte cause / As though we would
have Ashley ridd from Judgment off that matter / and as though that were the
only thing which was sought in our contention / where as in deed yt was
long off them that his cause was not determined. Wetherfore / having knowledge
off this matter / for fear least we should be falsely accused / as though we
had uttered yt to the Magistrate / and had seemed / first to have accused our
brethern unto the Magistrate / which we might not abide to do / assembled
together in the church the 13. off Februar. and there was openly recited in
writing this that folowith. Forasmuch as our contention is already bruted
abroad not only through this city but also come to the Magistrates ear (for
we hear say that master Horn and master Chamber were commanded by the
magistrate yester day that is the 12. off Febr. that they should in no wise
come at the congregation till the magistrate had fuller knowledge off the
ma^ter) we profess that neither Master Horn nor Master Chamber nor no man
else was complained upon to the magistrate by us or any off us / or by our
means / but that we sought rather by all diligent endeavor / that the matter
should not come abroad / but that all matters might have been secretly agreed
among our selves and that we would all men should understand by this our
writing. This done / those that knew themselves to be of an upright
conscience in this behalf were req^^red to set their hands to that writing /
and so there were 37 hands subscribed as appearethe in the acts off the 13.
off Febru. And were Master Horn and Master Chamber being so often desired
by all instant means off the congregation that they would be content to have
all ma^ters pacified among ^e by brotherly communication / did never suffer
them selves to be ^alked with all off any matter / least they should afterward
allege to such as knew not the matter / that they did it off force because
off the magistraies commandment / which forbad them to come to the
congregation. All the time wherein they absented them selves / and contemned so
many desires and intreties off the church to have met upon agreement making /
before any commandment was given them off the magistrate (which
commandment notwithstanding may seem that they at lenght for the causes
before mentioned procured themselves) was recorded among the Acts off that 13.
off Febru and confirmed by the testimonies off 37. names subscribed as in the
act app^arethe more at large.

The 14 off Febru. those 8. which were appointed the ^. off Febru: by the
congregation to amend the discipline / presented the book off the Discipline
to the congregation again and the congregation allowed it. And those matters
that were altered or augmented in the discipline were such as specially
perteined to those causes / wherein the pastor and seniors were the one part /
and how it must be proceaded against the pastor and seniors / in case any
off them were accused. For concerning these things there was never a word in
the old discipline. And where in the old discipline there was no certain
mention / how the church should be governed / and saying master Horn and
other had now utterly forsaken the congregation / who in leauinge there offices
had drauen away with them the most part off them that were appointed
preachers / and disposinge off the church money / were more largely and more
truly set forth and expressed.

For where master Chamber had authority to gather all godly men's almese for
the poor off the congregation confirmed unto him (as he him selff required) in
writing / signed by the pastor and seniors and certain other off the chieff
men off the church with their own hands / and had exercised the same
gathering now a year / and half / that he alone / should receive all / he
alone distribute / and be accomptable to no man and he alone to be privy to
the money / that matter) were he never so faithful a man) seems very
suspicious to him and ^urtefu^l to the church / yff he should dye suddanly as
the state off man is casual: And the example also should seem pernicious to
the church least parhapp an other man off small fidelity should by the same
reason draw all the church money in to his own only hands.

And for as much as the Deacons (unto whom the charge off the church money
seems to apperteine by the word of God / and by the example off all right^y
instituted churches) in our congregation had not a mite to bestow: for their
were made Deacons honest men in deed / but yet such as for their poueritie
seemed not fit men to whom the common money should be committed: and by that
color Master Chamber thought he might with owte controlinge receive all the
common monye in his own hands alone. The congregation thought good to have a
deaconshipp appointed more uprightly according to the rule described in the
Acts off the Apostles / and the example off other Godly instituted churches /
and to the intent the Church money might be meddled with all by the Deacons with
owte all suspicion it is provided in the amendinge off the discipline that
such men should be chosen Deacons / as be not only off a most aproued Good
fidelity / but also such as were able hansomly to live off their own
withowte any need off the Churches Alms. And in deed this seemed to be now
so much the more necessary / for that many complained: some that the alms
which they received before priuatlie off private frinds was taken up by the
way / sythens Master Chamber began to gather / as in deed Master Horn then
Pastor threatened openly owte off the pulpit in his Sermon saying that he
would stop all men's vents (as he termed it) and receiptes. Again / some
complain that they could have naught at Master Chambers hand / but after
beseching and unreasonable long delais / some that they could have nothing
with owte bitter vpbraid^ and some / that they could obtain nothing off gift
but only off loan / and other some that they could get naught at all. So
that now it seemed requisite off necessytie to seek some remedy for these
misheues. All which complaints we shall be constrained off extreme necessity
to put in to one several piece off work touching the whole matter and
communicatinge it to good men. And concerning the Discipline / saying there was
no certain express way in the old disciplyne how the congregation should be
governed / neither could any long quietness endure so long as Master Horn
had the government by that discipline. And seeing now Master Horn and
Master Chambers have utterly forsaken the Church / not only themselves /
but also have drawn away with them many other / and of them / the most part
such as were appointed preachers and readers off the Scriptures: so as they
might plainly appear to seek nothing else but that the congregation being
destitute off preaching and reading (as though it could not stand with out
those men) should be utterly broken up / the congregation was off necessity
enforced to devise and provide for some certain way for the governing off the
church / whereby the congregation might be set at a fyrme and a constant
quietness.

After this 14. off Februar. preachers off the french and Flemishe Churches
and Maist^r Valeran pullain came to the congregation with the Magistrates
Edicte. The meaning off the edicte was / that Ma^ster Horn / Master Chambers
/ Master Isaac and the rest off the Seniors should be restored into their
former full authority and that Master Horn should do the office off pastor /
and they off Seniors in our church till the Magistrates might have the hearing
and determining off the matter more at large. And yt was commanded / that all
such men as had any thing to say against Master Horn and the rest should
exhibit the same to the Magistrate in writing. Master Horn / the decre being
red consulting first with some off his accomplices / as in a new matter that he
never knew before / said to this effect: that he was ready to obeie the
honorable Magistrate / as con^cerninge other functions belonginge to the Pastor
/ that is to say consultations with the Seniors and administration off
discipline / but he would not meddle with preaching / because his ministry
was infamed by some men / he could not do yt with out the offense off himselff
and off many. Answer was made in the Churches name for that the honorable
Magistrate had sent the Seniors again to the Church / the church was glad
off it. For they were all sorry for their departure and now were very joyous
off their coming again. Concerning Master Horn for so much as he refused
the chiefeste part off the Pastors office wherein he has behaved himselff
well (yff in any thing well) that is / in the office off preachinge. Again /
where he would take upon him that part wherein he is justly reprehended / as
wantinge discretion / and sobernes therein / that is / the administration off
Ecclesiastical discipline with the Seniors / he over shoteth him selff in
both these points.

Therefore in as much as he exempteth himself from that office wherein he might
profit the congregation: the congregagatio^ in like case will not admit him to
that office wherein he both ill behaved him selff before / as the congregation
(yff need be) shall declare unto the Magistrates: wherein likewise the
congregation cannot admit Master Chambers to the office off Senior for certe^n
Causes. And for the rest off the Seniors / We (say they) give unto the
Magistrates right humble thanks.

This done / those 3. men which came unto them with the Magistrates edicte /
did earnestly exhort / first in the magistrates name and ef^sones in their
own / to fall to a quiet agremente among them selves / for that were more
honesty then to accuse one an other unto the congregation: Which thing / as
it is most vnworthly off Christen men / so is it unto us specially that
profess our selves banished for the gospel sake. Answer was made in the name
off the church as follows. We wish for a brotherly peace from the bottom
off our hearts praing Master Horn and Master Chambers instantly to bend
their minds unto quietness / and most heartily besechinge these 3 men our
brethere^ / and banished for the same gospel that we are / that they will
help with their authority to set a quietness among us / so as the matter
should come no more to the Magistrates ear. These 3. answered that they would
hear what answer Master Horn and Master Chambers would make / hereto
Master Horn answered / seeing the matter is already before the M the
magistrate shall have the hearing and determining off it. If any had ought
against him let them put it up in writing before the magistrate / for he was
ready to answer all men and either he would try his innocence or (being
found faulty) suffer punishment for the same. Master Chambers made like
answer for himselff.

Then / for as much as there could be no other end the congregation requested
those 3. grave and learned preacher^^ to make report to the magistrate off
their desire And readiness to have agreement. And so they (as soon as these
things were put in writing) departed. And the church also made an act off
that day subscribing with their hands to the same. The same day at after
noone the Magistrates having more plain intelligence off the matter /
commanded by their edicte / subscribed with their hands / that Master Horn
and Master Chambers should meddle no more the one with the pastorshipp and the
other with the Seniorshipp till all the controversies were thoroughly hard and
decided. And commandment was given / that the eight day after (which was
the 3. off march / such as had to say off any part should be present This
matter was grievous to the church (as ma^e be thought) that things should grow
to such extremity.

When they had gathered certain matter / they exhibited it to the Magistrates
when as they came to the English church where all the company were assembled
before them which was the last off February. Where the Magistrates made an
end (by their own authority) off the controversy as shall be said here
after.

The last off Feb. the Magistrate came to our Temple a little before ten off
the clock and there off his authority reconcilied certain off the
congregation that were at variaunce among them selves / and took order that
all former offenses should be utterly extincte and buried in the grave off
forgetfulness. Wheruppon at the commandment / and in the presence off this
Magistrate / the parties joined hands together in token that they were
reconcilied and were Good frinds and lovers. Afterward / the pastor / Elders
and Deacons / were put from their Ecclesiastical functions by an Edict signed
and subscribed with three off the Magistrates hands and were all made private
men / as the rest off the congregation: And by the same edicte off the
Magistrates it was decreed that that congregation might freely / when they
would choose either them or other ministers. likewise / it was permitted and
granted / that according to the ability off the congregation they might
choose one / or many ministers off the word or doctors. Moreover / order was
taken by the same Edicte / that the treasure or common money off the
congregation should be kept and distributed by the Deacons. And that the
Deacons should at certain appointed times give up an accounte off it before
the Ministers off the word and Seniors.

We were licenced by the same Edicte off the magistrates. to draw owte an
Ecclesiastical Discipline whereby the congregation should be governed. Afterward
/ there was thanks given to the magistrate in the name off the whole
congregation for his singular good will and affection to the congregation. And
the magistrate depar^^^ / wisshinge well in like sort to the company. But by
wh^^e means the magistrate came thus unto us and took such order / or whither
the Magistrate off himselff wrought this devise we cannot certainly say. But
that we off the church were not the cause / that any such thing was done /
we take God and our consciences / and the magistrate to witness / who knows
the whole matter.

The morrow after / which was the first off march the Magistrate gave us
Counsel by a few lines that he wrate unto us to draw forth the
Ecclesiastical Discipline owte of hand / whiles we were as yet all private
men and therefore might best take counsel / for that that should be most
behouable for the whole company: lest / that yff we differred the doing off
it until the Ministers were chosen and appointed / our co^sultation should be
more troublesome / whiles the ministers on the one side and the congregation on
the other / might pluck and force more unto them selves then off right they
ought. This most wholesome and profitable counsel off the Magistrate was the
next day after / which was the 2. off march proposed in the congregation /
and it liked and ple^sed the whole company, notwithstanding because Master
Horn made some matter / for that some were absent the matter was differred
unto the next day.

The third off march / by the advice off that Good and godly magistrate /
eight and thirty off the congregation chose by voices 15. men to write
Ecclesiastical laws. Master Horn and Master Chambers and almost to the
number off 14 moo sa^ by and would geve no voices / notwithstanstandinge that
we requested and entreated them: But they required they might have leave to put
down there minds in writing. So then being requested to write down their
minds Master Horn rose up and wrate in the paper in these words folowinge.
My mind is that the old discipline be kep^e still and not mended. Master
Chambers and Master Isaac and other to the number off 14. wrote down their
mynds to the selff same purpose. Now when we saw far^ beyounde our
expectation and otherwise then we looked for that there was a new dissension
ar^singe between us / being set at one and reconciled one to the other / not
scarce 3. days before and in witness thereof had given hands each to other
(we could not otherwise do but be grieved and sorrow greatly / to se the
growndworke of mo troubles and dissentions laid.

And because those. 14. gave to understand by their hands put down unto it in
writing that they thought it no^ Good to alter their old discipline / to the
end that it might evidently appear / how many we were that had consented
upon the choice off 1^. men which should set down in writing a form off
discipline according as the magistrate had commanded / we on the otherside
trusted / that we thought it for the behouff and profit off the congregation
that a form of discipline should be made and put down as the magistrate had
commanded. And to this determination and sentence being put in writing / we
in number eighte and thirty subscribe doure names / with protestation that we
did nothing but that was Good and lawful and according to the magistrates
will and mind requestinge them to give their consent and to agree with us.

But they / after much debatinge and many words to and fro for their old
discipline / that it neded not to be displaced or altered / The simple
sutteltie off ^. factious head.
came to this pass at the lenght / that they said (we had to consulte off
correctinge but not off making a discipline and very instantly vnd earnestlye
urged the same upon the words off that advice and council which the
magistrate had given touching the spedie dispatche off the discipline of the
church before the election of the ministers. we therefore which thought it not
much material whither it were termed a new made / or a corrected discipline
to have no occasion of dissentio^ / changed / our copy and put in in stead
of the is words / discipline should be made / should be corrected. And so those
14. which made ashewe before as though they would not suffer any one jot of
the old discipline to be altered / and changed / calling to mind (I suppose
/ either their fewness off their number or the odds off the matter because
that old discipline was utterly taken away by the Magistrates edicte / the
last off Februa. as the chiefest cause off our controversies: or else
foreseinge / that the magistrate would be offended with that their dissension:
they all jointly together Master Horn and Master Chambers beginning the
dance put their hands to ours / for the correction off the discipline.

Horn and his company subscribs to the other part.
Then did Master Horn request that saying now they had consented unto us /
for the wrytinge down off the discipline / he and the residewe for that
fourtene might freely give their voices for the chosinge of those fourtene
which they had already appointed or some such other as they would. But we
because we had before requested them to give their voices and three refused /
considering that those fourtene drew all one line and were fullye bent in all
points to do one as the other / being all like affected and by that means /
might off purpos wholly bestow their voices upon some certain / and so
overthrow our election which they knew already / denied to grant and suffer
them and yet we said / that yff they would we would not refuse to appointe an
other day / to choose the said 14. men or other. yet geuinge Master Horn in
the mean while to wit / that that matter which might have bin quietly
dispatched in three hours / would scarsly by his means be fynished in three
days.

At the lenght Master Horn / after consultation had with certain / spoke
alowde in the name off the fourtene in this wise.

Although (said he) it were meet that we all severally give our voices / yet
that we may be no longer an hinderance / I pronounce in all their names / that
we all do by our voices choose those 14. men Whom you have already appointed.
When the residew were asked whither they consented to this or no* Master Isaac
/ answered that all agreed: otherwise / yff any were contrary minded he
would speak. And thus by a general consent off all not one man except
fiuetene men were chosen to write Ecclesiastical laws the third off march.

The 15. M. Horn came not til two.
Elected agreed between themselves to assemble and come together the fourth of
march at one of the cloak at afternoon. When they came together there was
much a do a great while whither the old discipline should be corrected or a
new made. We (of the church) alleged that all occasions off old
controversies (wheroff the old disciplie but imperfect and naught was one)
were utterly taken away by the magistrates Edicte. some urged this word
corrected / or amended which was in the advice and counsel that the Magistrate
gave us for the spedie dispatche off discipline. For / said they / that is not
corrected which is clean taken way. The book of discipline brought forth
and read.
At lenght / the book off the old discipline and an other off the new
discipline / which was corrected in the absence off master Horn and others
were read / and so they departed for that day appoynting to meet again the
8. off march the same hour.

The 8. off march the 15. men assembled again and there agreed upon articles
for making off discipline / M. Horn came at 3.
which were set down in a paper and subscribed all unto them / sauinge that
master Horn / Master Chambers and Master Isaac and Master Bentham would
not subscribe to that Article concerning the having off two ministers off the
word / and yet notwithstanding they all agreed upon this that is was a matter
indifferent whither there should be one or many ministers off the word. for it
is not defined in the scriptures but left free. Afterward Master Hales gave to
Master Chambers a book off discipline (which was written in the absence off
master Horn and others / and was off the same Articles as the congregation
had made and agreed upon) that master Horn / and he / and master Isaac might
read it over / and if they allowed ought therein that it might be annexed to
the discipline that was in hand. But afterward / when master Horn through
occasion off talk abowte the correctinge off the discipline / said that there
had been no other discipline in the church / but that old discipline / and
that therefore the magistrate / spoke off correctinge off that no^ off the v^ter
abolishinge theroff and that it was answered / that that same other book off
discipline being written when he was absent might as well be understood to be
meant / as that same old discipline* both for that there was more equity in
it and also was suscribed unto off so many as well as that old discipline
which he so extolled: Then master Horn brake owte in to most spiteful
words against all his country men that had agreed to that discipline which
were at the least 36. persons / affirminge that all they that had thus
conspired together for the establishing off those articles (according to the
shortness off the time wherein they met) that they were in a certain degree /
guilty off treason against the magistrate / against the Senate / and (to be
short) against the whole city.

Then master Hales understanding by master Horns words that nothing was
sought but new trouble / and being put in mind also aff master Bentham)
reherseth again that book off discipline which a little before was offered to
master Chambers affirminge that he understood / they went abowte to seek
rather an occasion off chalinginge at the book by readinge off it / then a way
off making a new discipline.

The eleventh off march the fiftene men meet again upon certain Articles to
which (except one which master Horn and M. Chambers would not subscribe)
they al subscribed.

A little before our departure it was thought profitable that those things
which we had collected and agreed upon should be brought in to a certain
form of a book / adding either owte off the old discipline / or by occasion
/ as we were gatheringe these things together such things as might seem
profitable. Master horn / and master Chambers being entreated / that they
would gather those things in such sort / or else be present to confer with
other that read: Master Horn answerethe that he would not / neither that
there was any such need. The 16. day of march they met again in the
church and there a certain bill (in which were written certain articles
tendinge to discipline) is exhibited unto them that among the fiften it might
be deliberated upon and debated. master Isaac spoke many things very sharply
against one Article as very dangerous and perilous against those good men
through whose liberality the poor off the church were sustained / and making
wise as though he would know the matter better / he requested the bil /
which / being reached unto him / he puts it up in his bosom / neither
would he give it again. And so by this means / he took away the matter for
us to work upon since that we had no other copy.

Afterward / the book in which those things were written that were agreed
upon among the 15. and certain things owte off the old discipline / and
other also were gathered in to some order was brought owte among them to be
consulted upon / and being redd / master Horn and Master Chambers first
off all complained / that book was gathered they not wittinge theroff / and
had been long beatten upon among certain of them / and therefore that it was
reason that a copy should be given to them / and to master Isaac and a farther
time also to delyberate / master Isaac affirmed that he neded 2. months / or
one at the least to consider off that book. It was answered that although
Master Horn and Chambers complained that they were not admitted to the
collectinge off the book) in that they did us wrong / for being of us
thereunto required they refused it and left it to others. In that they required
a copy / it seemed unjust / (saying that the church had decreed / that we the
15. should debate together as concerning the writing off the discipline) for
that thing tended again to a new dissension. Again / that they required so
long a time to deliberate / and especially Master Isaac / it was most
unjust. For saying the mart was now at hand / it was profitable or rather
necessary that our church should with speed be established and our
ministers elected least / to our great infamy / men coming h^ther owte off
all Europe / they might also se the broils off our church and so spread them
far abroad amoge all nations: more over: that it would fall owte to the great
hurt off the poor / yff godly men being offended / with our dissentions /
(being before beneficial to the poor) withdraw now their liberality / and
that ^herforee there was need off spedie help in pacifiynge and quietinge the
church before the mar^e being now at hand. Master Horn answers / that
he requires not to much time 2. or 3. days should be enough for him to
del^berate / notwithstanding that the copy ought to be granted for no less
time / saying many things were contained in that book / and some also dark
and dowtefull things and to him before that time vnharde off / or / at the
least / unknown: and that therefore he requested that all should be asked man
by man whither they thought not this reasonable and just that he required. For
if to the most it should seem reasonable he would at any hand hauie a copy
off that book Every man therefore was asked / beginning at Master Bentham: he
/ as well forth causes before alleged as also that no occasion off wranglinge
might arise off the book / and least the book should come to the hands off
any other before it were brought to the congregation / and for certain other
causes / thought it not meet that any copy should be given to any / but
that the book should be brought forth among them / and all they hearing it
that were appointed off the congregation / it should be after read and that
time enoughe should be given to stand upon every decree and sentence and more
exactly to examine them: and that this seemed to him very just and reasonable.
And this iu^gement is condescended to off all the rest / and so Master Horn
leaves off from requestinge the copy. Afterward / the book is begone to
be redd / from the beginnige / and in examininge off every off the decrees
long time is spente / and off some articles in the beginning mutche
disputation and debatinge is had. But Master Horn / Master Chambers and
Isaac being asked their judgments would not answer / no / not in the most
plaines^e matters / and known of all men / either to allow or disalowe / as
for example: There was one article: we profess the selfsame doctrine which is
contained in the Canonical books off all the holy scripture / to wit / Yff
master Horn took such deliberatto^ before he would subscribe to that
article: what meanethe this that poor ignorant men and women must thus
subscribe upon the sudden or else to newgate.
in the books off the old and new Testamente / in which is contained fully
all doctrine necessary for our salvation. To this and such other being most
plain and manifest master Horn answered as to all the other that he would
answer nothing with owte great deliberation. By which his doings / he gave
occasion to all men to wonder. And so / some other decrees off that book
being examined a meetinge off the 15. was appointed against the next day /
and so they departed. The next day being the 17. off march and again the
day folowinge being 18. twelve off the 15. met. For Master Isaac / Master
Horn and Chambers came not. Upon both days the discipline was more
diligently read and examined / and off eleven off them which were appointed /
allowed and subscribed unto. Upon the 20. day off march the discipline was
offered to the whole congregation / that it might of them either in the whole or
in part be allowed or disalowed / and the same day was it twice read over.

After the readinge Master Horn and Master Chambers require a copy off the
discipline / that at their leisure they might farther deliberate upon it. It
was answered that it was to be openly read and read again / both to them and
others / as often as they would / with time enough given to every man more
diligently to examine every Artikle / but saying the Magistrate had commanded
that we should exhibit to them a copy off the discipline turned in to laten /
so soon as possible might be / Therefore we durst not scatter any copice
before the Magistrate had seen it. Besides that we feared least Master Horn
and Master Chambers (Who were among the 15. (appointed) off the church for
the writing off the discipline who might also when they would not only he
are the discipline but also examine the same diligently / and yet would not
meet with the others at the appointed time) would request a copy not so
much to know the discipline as to stir up new broiles. Nevertheless when
the Magistrate had once seen it / leave to be given to any man that would to
se it. With this answer they and some others being offended / at the second
readinge off the discipline they departed a way and abstained again with
their whole howsoldes from the church / from public prayers and sermons
which thing blewe up and increased the report off our disagrements and
striffes. Neither would they from that time forward unless they were
commanded by the magistrate come to the church when as notwithstanding they
could not show us any just cause to be given them why they should so
depart from the church and refrain the public prayers and godly sermons /
as yff we had been Ethnickes or publicannes.

The 25. day our discipline was read the 3. time / and the 26. day it was
read the forth time by the commandment off the Magistrate at the reading
wheroff all English men that were off the church were commanded to be
present. The 30. off march it was read the fyfte time and so at diverse times
there subscribed 42. in the good allowance theroff which was the greater part
by a great deal off the church. For the whole church at that present had
not above: 62. And because now the mart was at hand / that there might be
some better form off a well ordered church: five were appointed off the
church the 20. off march to nominate certain from among whom / according
to the Magistrates decree should be chosen / the Ministers off the word /
Seniors and Deacons. The 21. off march the names off twenty men or there
abowte were proponed to those five appointed off the church and therwithall
declared that yff any would or could reprove any off them that were named /
either in doctrine or manners / they should show it the 23. day after. Upon
the 2^. day / none fyndinge any fault in any of those whose names were
propounded / it was again decreed that yet / yff they had any thing to say
against any man they should declare that the 21. day following.

The 25 off march Master Chambers / master Binkes Master Ade / Master
Brikbek master Ben^ham / who were among them that were named / told the
church / that if peradventure they should be chosen / for certain causes they
could not serve the church / and that they signified this to the church in
time least the election were frustrat. But when no man could obiecte any
fault in these or other that were named: the election off the Ministers was
made the 29. off march / and the ordeininge off them that were chosen was
appointed of the church the day folowinge. In the mean season Master Horn
and Master Chambers and certain other left not off to sue to the Magistrates
that both our election might be hindered / and also that it might be lawful
for them to be off our church / and yet not to subscribe to our Dysciplyne /
the thing that they them selves notwithstanding would never grant to any
others.

The 2^. off March after dmner it began to be muttred off certain that the
Magistrate had forbidden that we should go forward in the election / the
which thing surely grieved us: for by that means we saw that we should have
no form of a Church before the mart and that therefore we should become a
reproach to all men / which seemed should be spread among all nations. But this
rumor was altogether vain / for the 29. of march which was the day before
the election should be / after the sermon / the decree of the Magistrate was
openly read in the church / wherein it was commanded that we should take in
hand and perform the election off the Ministers in the same order and upon the
same day that we had appointed / and that all English men that were off our
church should be present the same day / at the election / and give their
voices.

The 29. day off March after prayers / the sermon and public fast / a
little before twelve / the election off the Ministers began to be made and when
we were in the middeste off the election* Master Horn Master Chambers / and
others to the number off 18. men / (who before were neither with us at the
sermon / nor at prayers / but had kept themselves in some howses not far
from the church / being warned of their side that had watched us in the
church) came in suddanlie on a troop together in to the church and there
each one striuethe who shall cast in his bill first / upon the table
standinge in the middeste off the church / all which bylles contained one
matter and written almost with like words / to wit / that they could not give
their voices in the same election / because they could not off their
consciences allow that discipline by which the election was made. And that
they might enlarge their number / they brought with them 2. bills off those
that were absent and off some others which never were accounted off the
church. And so after they had troubled our election / and after Master Horn
also / walking with an other a little while ouerwhart in the midst off the
church / all in a manner departed again.

Afterward the election was fully ended / at one off the clock at afternoon /
there were chosen 2. Ministers off the word.6. Seniors and 4. Deacons. Now
the Deacons were (besides the wonted custom off our church) off the number
off those that could live of their own / for that the common treasure might
seem withowte all suspicion to be committed to such rather then to the poorer
sort* Now / in that master Horn neither any off the other that were before
in the Ministry (except only master Willforde) were chosen again to the
Ministry / was specially through their own fault. For Master Horn never
almost ceased for certain days to profess openly that he would never
exercise again any Ecclesiastical ministry in that church / and being
before appointed by the magistrate to preach in our church he would never so
much as once preach. And master Chambers / when his name among the rest to
be chosen / was propounded / the 25. off march he professed openly in the
church / (all men hearing it) before the election / that though he were
chosen off us to some Ministry / yet that he would never use it: And
therefore that we should not in any case choose him unless we would have our
election to be frustrate.

Wherefore / it is no marvel / yff they were not chosen / who / least they
should be chosen did them selves openly denounce it. And therefore / in this
they do us great wrong / that would seem to bear men in hand / that they
were at the first thruste owte off their ministry by us / or long off us
they were not chosen in again.

Master Isaac in like manner / Master Binks Master Brickbek and Master
Escote openly professed that they would in nowise use any public ministry
in our church. And here upon it came specially to pass that only Master
willford / (who had not made any such exception) was from among the^ / which
were before in the ministry chosen again.

The third off April the Magistrate / who desired that these church
dissentions off ours might be pacified and quietted / and he now because off
the mart had no leisure to do the same / writes his letters to D. Cox / D:
Sands and master Bartue in which he exhorteh them / that they / yff they
could by any conueniente means / as arbitres off some estimation end this
striffe among us.

Now when either side was come before them and all we in the name off the
church (for all had granted our controversies to be hard and determined
with owte any exception at all to them and to other arbytres / what so ever /
whom they should call unto them) and had offered this thing to the arbytres
written and all our names subscribed unto it: Master Horn / Master Chambers
and others first requested that master Horn might be restored to his office
off pastorshippe / Master Isaac Master Chambers and others / into their
offices off Seniors and the old discipline into his former place and authority
/ so as they were in the beginning off these controversies. For then (said
they) will we leave all controversies to the arbitres. When we had refused this
as most unjust and unreasonable / then they requested that saying we would
not restore the old discipline / and them to their former authority / that
then we would suffer our discipline and Mynisters to be none otherwise then
their old withowte all authority and no minister at all nor discipline to be
in our church but that the matter should remain in that state and condition
that it was in the last off February / when the Magistrate having put all the
ministers from their offices departed from us / and so should the matter be left
to arbitres

When we remembered what and how great trauelles that discipline election off
Ministers had cost us and saw that by this means our church should be made
destitute off Ministers and a large window to be opened for new contentions /
and had also denied that thing / Master Horn requested that it might be
lawful for him to goo a little a side and to consulte with some off his side
abowte the whole matter. A little after returninge again and sainge / that they
would leave no way unsought after / whereby peace might be gotton / although
they yielded much from their right. Then he reads a certain bill to those 3.
(appointed off the magistrate) and to us written in his own name and the names
off others which I have added under here written word for word / least any
man should think that any thing off purpose were altered by us.

The Bill off master Horn and Others.
WE offer and permit with most willinge minds (having the license of the
magistrate as it may well be for this purpose) that all our controversies and
contentions / what so ever / which have been sow and brought in among us
sithe^s the beginnige of this breach / and since the first day we began to
strive / until this present time and hour: to be debated decided and
determined by Arbytres / being none off this our congregation / and yet from
among the brethern / our country men / equally and indifferently / by the
parties disagreinge / to be chosen upon this condition / that not only the
election off Mynisters and besides all others things don by the order off the
said discipline / stand in suspense / to be allowed or dissalowed by the
determination and judgment off the arbytres to be chosen as is aforesaid
written the 5. off April. Anno 1557.


And that the indifferent reader / may / by comparinge their offer and ours /
se which is most reasonable / we have added ours also / written owte word for
word as we offered it up before the forsaied Master Bartue / D. Coxe and D.
Sands and to the dissentinge brethern.

The copy wheroff is this.

WE submit our selves and are contented to commit all manner off controversies
that have here tofore risen amongst us in the church / to such Arbitres as
the magistrate has appointed and to all such as they call unto them to the
hearing and determininge thereof / according to gods word and godd reason. And
thus symplie and plainly withowte any manner off excep^ion or condition.

In witness wheroff we have subscribed our names the 5. off April / Anno 1557.

Thou maiste se here / gentle reader / that albeit we had our Discipline
written and allowed off a 11. off the 15. men whom the congregation by the
Magistrates authority had appointed / to wit / the Dyscipline / and thereupon
confirmed with the hands off 42. men which was the greateste part off our
church by a great deal: Albeit we had also / all eccleasticall ministers / by
the magistrates decree / and the authority of the congregation lawfully elected
/ yet for quietness sake / we put all to the Arbitres wholly / either to be
allowed or disalowed with owte any manner off exception. But master Horn and
master Chambers / and others / sekinge more their own will then any quiet
agremente / would not at the first admit those three Arbitres appointed off
the magistrates. For Master Horn made exception against some off them. And
afterward would abide no order or offer / unless we would with our
subscriptions suffer and commit our discipline / the election off ministers /
and all other matters off our church to stand in suspense (as they call it)
so that by their dryfte we should have had no discipline / no certain ministry
/ no order and so consequently no church They would that thies Arbiters should
be chosen indifferenly from among such as were our country men / But not of
our congregation / so that it should be lawful for them to choose where they
list and whom they list. These three arbytres had their being owte from the
English churches.
Now consider with me / who so ever thou art (indiffent reader) yff we /
first having given and sealed our writing in the name off the whole church
had granted our discipline / ministers / and all other orders off our church
to stand in suspense / until they should either be allowed or disalowed of
the arbitres chosen in such sort / and till master Horn and Master
Chambers according to their canuasinge craftines / now enough and more then
enough known unto us / had chosen Arbitres for their part owte off far
places / who either could not or else would not meet together abowte this
matter / or (which was most certain to come to pass) yff Master Horn /
and Master Chambers whersoeuer at lenght they had choosen arbitres / had not
for all that chosen such for their side / who unless things were don
according to their own mind / would decree nothing at all. But the
Arbitres disagreinge on both sides / the matter should be left undone; what
then should have become off our church / with thies their suspensyue
ministers / and vvitherhe discipline and all other things? For the condition
offered up off Master Horn and Master Chambers was declared to be this /
that so long all should remain in suspense till they should be allowed or
disalowed by the arbytres: so that yff the arbyters should have bin divided
equally (as many times it comethe to pass) the Ministers off the church might
determine nothing / but the Discipline and all other things must continually
hang in suspense. Again / the church (though it were in great peril and
danger / yet / least it should leave any way unproven for the obtayninge off
peace (because they thought that some off those three were not meet whom the
magistrates had appointed for Arbitres / offered up an other bill containing
altogether the selff same matter / and write with the same words / that they
would stand to the Judgment off any other Arbitres who so ever being chosen
indifferently by the other party from among our country men / and leave all
things to them plainly and symplie withowte any exception or condition to be
determined and decided. But they would allow no condition offered off us
unless we would first / by the subscribinge off our names allow that most
unjust and unreasonable condition off there is / and by our prejudice condemn
our Mynisters / our Discipline and all other things that we had done. And
so by this means had opened a gapp to them to ouerthowe our church. And when
they had thus behaved them selves before Master Bartue D. Cox and D. Sands /
yet certain off them (when now the mart was in the chieff flower) reported
through owte the whole city that we had rejected their most just and
paeceable requests and that we were altogether troublesome men / and plainly
bent to suffer no peace nor quietness / howbeit / we had rather that they should
show these things that are false off us to others / then that they together
with others should openly deride our folly (yff we had yielded to such
requests) as they that with our great ^oile and travel had (to the quiet off
the church) establyshed some church / and now upon a sudden by the
subscribinge off one bill thorough headiness and foolish facility should
have overthrown the whole. But they / when they could not obtain this / went
abowte this very buselie / that the whole church might then be dissolved and
broken up. For Master Chambers for halff a monethe space and more would give
nothing to any man that remained in the church / and followed not master
Horn and him departinge from the church.

To certain other also he would give nothing at all which were in the
public Ministry / to preach the word and read lectures / and also in the
exercise of disputinge by his own appoyntemente and the order taken by Master
Horn alwais from the time since they came to our church / when now they
were for their bourde in debte to their hostesses for 4. months / neither had
don any other fault / unless it were because they remained in their
functions off preachinge and readinge lectures in which they were placed by
Master Horn and Master Chambers / least the church should altogether be
destitute both off sermons and lectures: Only because in this dissension they
agreed not with them and took their parts / and had with them withdrawn them
selves from the church that it might be utterly scattered / when as
notwithstanding (which is most dishonest) they had promised to give 3.
months warninge before they would forsake them: which / notwithstanding
Master Chambers affirmed they would never do unless it were that they were
constained by extreme necessity. Abowte the midst off the mart or a little
after there began^e a rumor to be spread off the departure of master Horn and
master Chambers from this city / but whither they would go / or whither they
would at all depart / it was yet uncertain. For neither was it likely that
master Chambers having gathered so much common money / and that by the
authority and in the name off the church saying he had bin here so long with
owte making off any accoumpte to the church / would go away in such
sor^e. Neither was it credible that M. Horn / who had governed in his
pastoral office and charge so long (no reconciliation nor pacification being
made for so great offenses) would so depart / yea / not so much as have
taken his leave of the church. In the mean time it is incredible to be spoken
/ but more shameful to be heard / what reports certain had spread that mart
time secretly and especially among the rycher sort that were able to help
the poor off our church / forsoothe / that there were certain traitors
among us. That we desired to know the names off those persons that were
liberal toward the poor off our church / to the end to betraie them and
undo them: That we had cast our Pastor and Ministers owte headlonge from there
ministeries and offices. In all which things / they went about nothing else
but to stir up new braules and contentions. And that they may alienate the
hearts off the welthie sort from us / and so bring the poor of our church
/ first to famine and then us into deadly hatred off them / as though they
were by us thrown in to these miseries / But for as much as all these things
are vain and untrue / and fained by the secret sleightes off those privy
whisperers / who dare speak nothing openly: we have thought them rather to be
contemned the^ to be answered: hopinge that at last when they are weary off
lyinge / they will be quiet. But if they go forward still to belie us so
impudently and outragiously / surely we will not neglec^e our fame and honest
estimation: but we will diligently wipe away all their slanders with one sponge
/ and there with all will open to the world / their wicked endeavors against
our church. In the mean time nothing distrustinge the lords mercy (how
soever the deceites off men would let it) hopinge / that neither living nor
food shall ever want to our poor congregation / who also feeds the ravens
/ and that he will allwaies be present by his spirit to us and to our whole
church continually which thing that it may please him to bring to pass /
we beseech the good reader (who so ever thou art) pray unto god together with
us / and farewell.

Here folowithe the exhortation off the Magistrate for the amendinge and
establishinge off the Discipline.
The English Thus.

WE think it Good and profitable for the establishinge off peace and
tranquillity off your church / that you altogether consulte and determine / as
concerning the amendinge off discipline / now / whiles ye all be yet private
men and withowte any Ecclesiast^call ministry. For whiles none off you does
yet know / wither he shall be a private person or else shall have any
authority Ecclesiastical / every man man will apply his mind / and study
to that which shall seem most reasonable and profitable as well for the
congregation as for the Mynisters. But after that the Mynisters be once elected
/ it is to be feared least they will draw some what more then reason to
themselves / and in likewise the congregation to it selff. And so / your
consulation may chance to be somewhat troublous which we would not should
happen. Wherefore that all things may proceed as well as may be to to the
establishing off sure peace we exhort you that with all speed ye take in hand
this consultation abowte the amendinge off your Discipline with minds and
means most aplyable to tranquillity / which Almighty God grant / ye may
happily bring to pass.

The first off march. 1^57. John Glauburg.


Now / folowith the discipline both the old / and that which was by the
Magistrates appointement / corrected.
The order off the old discipline in the City off Franckford.
THere be 2. The old Discip^ine*
parts off the order off Discipline in the church. The one perteininge to the
whole church. The other perteininge to the ministers and Elders alone.

Off the first part.
In the Discipline perteininge to the whole church / is first to be appointed
the order off receiuinge men in to the congregation which is this.

The manner off receiuinge off all sorts off persons into the said
congregation.
First / every one as well man as woman which desires ^o be received shall
make a declaration or Confession off their faith / before the pastor and
Seniors shewinge himselff fully to consent and agree with doctrine of the
church and submittinge themselves to the discipline off the same.

If any person / so desirous to be received into the congregation / be
notoriously defamed or noted off any corrupt or evil opinion in doctrine or
slanderous behauior in liffe / the same may not by the pastor and Elders be
admitted till he have either purged himselff theroff / or else have declared
him selff ^o the pastor and Elders penitent for the same.

The good behavior and godly conversation required off such as are received.
Secondarely all the members off the church so admitted and received shall
diligently observe and keep all such godly discipline and orders apoointed
with in the church which tend to the increase off knowledge and godliness
off liffe / as the appointed times off prayer / preachinge / and hearing
gods word / the administration off the Sacraments / with submission to all
godly discipline off the church.

This article I find rased in the copy, what they me^t by it* I know not.
Thirdly / such also as being in England after knowledge received / have
communicated with the popish mass contrary to their consciences by reason of
fear / weakness / or otherwise / may not be received till they have confessed
their fall before the pastor and seniors / and have showed themselves penitent
for the same.

How the youth shall be Catechized.
Also for the increase off godly knowledge and virtue / all the youth shall
resort to the church every satterdaie at 2. off the clock at afternoon /
and when we have a several church / at one off the clock on the sundaie at
afternoon / there / to be instructed in the Catechism / and not to be
admitted to the communion till they be able to make profession off their faith
before the whole congregation. And also to have an honest testimony off
towardnes in godly conversation / and that every member off the church do not
refuse to read a declaration off their faith before the pastor and Elders
when so ever they shall be thereto required

Thorder off correction / for private and privy offenses.
Fourthly / for as much as no charge is so perfect but offenses may arise /
for godly charitable redressinge and reforminge off such / this order is to be
observed.

First / yff any off the congregation be offensive in manners or doctrine to
any off the brethern / so that offense be private and not publicly known /
there can be no better order devised then that which Christ himselff has
appointed / which is / first brotherly to admonish him alone / yff that do no
prevail / call / one or 2. Witnesses / yff that also do not profit / then to
declare it to the pastor and elders / to who^ the church has given authority
to take order in such cases according to the quality and greuousnes off the
offense and crime.

Off the order off correction for public and open crimes.
But yff any person shall be a notorious known offender so as he is offensive
to the whole church / then shall the pastor and elders immediatlye call the
offender before them and travel with him to reduce him to true repentance and
satisfyinge off the congregation which / if ^e obstinately refuse to do:
then* the pastor shall signify his offense and contempt to the whole
congregation desiring them to pray for him / and further to assign him a day
to be denownced excommunicate before the church / except in the mean time the
offender submit himself before the pastor and seniors to the order of discipline

Finally / in case any person of this congregation be known to be an hinderer
or a defacer of any of the godly vsages now excercised in the same
congregation / either privily or apertly by word / letter / or deed: the same
shall acknowledge his offense with satisfaction to the church / according to
the true order off Discipline.

The 2. part off discipline toncerninge the ministers and elders / and their
elections.
First for the election of ministers and Elders / the qualities of the same
are to be examined and considered according to the rule off S. Paul 1. Tim. 3.
Wheroff this is the sum That no man be elected whose doctrine or liffe can
justly be reproved and condemned. As concerning the order and form off
Electing / the same is to be observed which has already bin practiced and is
here unto anexed.

Off there offices and functions.
The pastor / according to the commandment off the holy ghost in the
scriptures / ought with all pastoral care diligently to attend to his flock /
in preaching gods word / in ministering the Sacraments / in example off Good
lyffe / in exhortinge / admonishinge / rebukinge / and as the chieff mouth off
the church / to open and declare all orders taken by him and the elders which
are to be opened and published: to whom no man may in the face off the
congregation replye. But yff any think himselff to have cause to speak let him
come before the elders in the place appointed for their meetinge and thereto
open his mind and to be hard with all charity indifferently.

The office off preachers and such as are learned in the congregation.
The office off preachers and such as are learned in the church is to assiste
the pastor in preachinge the word / ministringe the Sacraments and in all
consultations and meetinges off him and the Elders especially in causes off
Doctrine / and also at other times when they shall be required.

The office off Elders.
The office off Elders is to be (as it were) censors / overseers off manners
and disorders. And to be with the pastor in all consultations / for the public
order off the church / and that all corrections and exercises off discipline
be done with their common consaile.

Deacons.
Consideringe also the present state off the church / it is thaught requisite
that the Deacons besides the special office appointed in the Acts off the
Apostells in caringe and providinge for the poor / do also visit the sick and
be assistant in Catechisinge the youth yff they shall be thereunto required.

The same order and form is to be used for reformation off offenses and crimes
in ministers and Elders which is described for other offenders / and to be
done toward them rather with more severity.

Now folowith the Discipline reformed and confirmed by the authority off the
church and magistrate.
IT is most cumlie and godly / that Christian people resort The new
discipline.
thereunto by common consent appointed (yff the persecution off the ungodly will
suffer the same and they themselves have no urgent cause to the contrary) there
to hear the pure doctrine off Gods word taught / and them selves openly with
their presence and voice to declare the consent off their hearts to the same /
and to confess with their mouth agreablely their belieff and faith upon god
and his holy word according to the scriptures.

The congregation thus assembled is a particular visible church such as may
be in diverse places off the world very

Now that you have hard both the old discipline / and that which was by the
authority off the magistrate devised order requires that I place here the
reasons which Master Horn and the rest off his side brought against the new
discipline established.

And to the end this volume should not excede measure in greatness / I think it
expedient to do here / as I have done already / and mind to do through out
the whole story / which is / off a leaf^ / to take / (as I might say) a ly^e
or two / as one loathe too weary you since a taste may suffice.

The Reasons.
First / the scripture speakinge or treatinge of the office of

The answer off the church / touching this 7. Article. to the reasons off the
dissenting brethern.
To ^he 1.
We se not by the scriptures / that any authority is given to any one above
others / but rather to the contrary.

As concerning old writers / To the 2^ 3.4. Hales. VVhithead Nowell Mullins.
VVattes Crowley Boetley Pedder. Parry Wilson* Sorby. Bedell. Fauconer. Railton
Crawley Ashley Sutton Raulings Best and diverse others. To the 5.
we know that Jerome expressly declarethe that in the beginning the church
was ruled equally by many. But after when schisms began to spring the chief
authority was given to one for authorities sake / and by man's ordinance
rather then by divine authority / wherefore we conclude that as for schisms
the first order of many was left and one chief appointed: So now for the
auoidinge of tyra^nie a worse evil in the church then schisms / which / as
apearethe by the Bishop of Rome is grownded upon one / we think it good to
return to the first order off two or moo equal ministers according to the
institution off the Apostells as Saint Jerome teaches. And that those learned
men who do most earnestly maintain the government off one / confess that
until the time off Dionysius / who was after Christ 300. years and more / the
Regimente was equally committed to many. And as for the new / there be
examples off the best church to the contrary. And Master Calvin in the 8.
Chap. off his Institutions the 42. and 52. dyuisions Declarethe expressly that
there were From the beginning more Ministers off the word and that it is but
off man's ordinance that one was afterward made chieff.

That is alleged off the reformed churches in Germany the multitude ought to
serve no more for one / then the best reformed churches / for two ministers off
the word.

As concerning Nicene council it is before answered / To the 6.
and in that they decreed there should be but one / it consequenquently
folowithe that before the said decree there were many.

And if those godly fathers were now lyuinge and did se how Antechriste is
established upon one / they would more gladly return to the first order off
many equal for the auoidinge off that most horrible mischieff. As they then
did for the auoidinge off Schisms appointe every city one.

Negligence is no more in two then one. ability off welldoinge things is
more in two then in one. To the 7. Yea, but though he did so then he will not
do so now I warrant you.
And sickness being so riffe in this city / it is as much as 2. can well do
/ and one may be sick. And one may will fully and suddenly leave his flock

Wherefore / two be necessary / else / in the sudden sickness off one only
Minister / when many other be sike also / dew visitation off the sike is not
well seen to and preachinge omitted / as it has chanced in our church /
yea / and although we have many. And therefore reason tellethe us that it is
expedient to have two rather then one.

Horn / etc. Upon the 8. Artic.
Item / where it is provided that the Ministers shall by themselves or their
deputies disharge the sermons and other their duties when necessary case
shall so require: we say it is superfluous. for a necessary cause nedethe not
to be provided for by law: besides that the alowinge off deputies by law made
for that purpose openethe a window off negligence to the ministers in the
executinge off their office.

Whitthead / etc.
A law does well provide that such may be in a redynes which shall serve
in necessity / It is provided in many cities / by a law that in dread off
fire every man have a bucket off water at his door / which is a thing
necessary. And universally the multitude off good laws be grownded upon
causes necessary. Wherefore / we think that position / that necessary causes
need not to be provided for by a law / ought to be taken for no law: and
where it is alleged that it openethe a window off negligence to the
Ministers / it is not so / for the appointemente off those deputies
apperteinethe more to the Seniors them to the Ministers by our discipline.

Horn etc. Artic. 10.
Item / in the Article of Catechism / we think it is superfluous and tedious
to have 2. Catechismes in one after noone And also think that Master Caluins
Catechism ought to be used no otherwise with us then it is in Caluins church
that allows and uses the same.

Whithead etc.
The first Catechism is only ordered for the children and is but an
examination and apposinge off them. The other is not only for children but for
all the congregation / etc.

Now / for so much as the reasons and answers are very long and yet some off
them repeated / in Master Horns objections to the discipline which he offered
up to the Magistrate / I will here pass them over and come to the said
objections / and the answers off the church to the same.

Horn and the rest off his side to the Magistrate.
WE come to that now (right honorable S.) which we were charged to do by
your commaundment and appointement: that for as much as for the apeasinge and
final puttinge away off the contention between us and our brethern / we
should show why we dissente from them / and cannot proceade in the same
passage and way that they do: We shall so open unto you our defense and
cause even as we desire to be justified both in our consciences and before
god. Howbeit / we are very sorry that your H. Has lym^ted us so short time /
so as in a cause which (for the waightines and difficulty off it) ought to be
debated upon with more leisure / and very many things to be wayed to and
fro / we must off force in a manner hold our peace and say nothing.

But our trust is that your. H. will heareafter / remedy this displeasure /
in grauntinge us longer time that we may more amply hereafter confirm our
cause / which we are forced to set forth naked and with owte any defense at
all which we will most gladly do and desire that we may freely be permitted
to do. This is the thing that we often sought for when we consulted among
our brethern for the correctinge and amendinge off our discipline / that / as
long as the matter and cause was in consultation / we might so long polishe
and finishe more at large that was alleged / to add unto all our sentences
/ before the sentences brought in / and to strike owte and take away from them
yff ought seemed worthy to be taken away / albeit any thing were put in / as
firm and established by our subscription: Which thing we now eftsonnes
desire most earnestly at your H. Hands. that for as much as nothing is yet
concluded and determined by your H. there be no such prejudice objected unto
our cause / but that we may confirm all our allegations with firm and
available arguments.

And in deed / saying we must now entreat in order off those things which
we reprehende and condemn in our bretherns made Discipline: This we first
reprehend universally / that any other alteration or innovation off things
should be in our affaiers then such as serve only to the correctinge and
amendinge off that Discipline which has been heretofore received and used in
our church. Wherein / we will seem also somewhat to satisfy our bretherns
curious minds. This we say / because there is almost nothing that we think
is to be innouated with such post haste and in deed / there are many and
weighty causes which do altogether pull us back from these innouations /
and bid us stick still to our old discipline / and not for the pleasure off
some men / and contrary also to your commandment (given for the amendinge and
not for the making off any new Discipline) to contemn and cast away that
which so many have allowed.

Whithead and the rest off that side anwere in this wise.
We had purposed (right honorable ad righteous Magistrates) as we also
signified unto your honors) to have made no answer at all unto these
unbrotherly reproaches off Master Horn and Master Chambers (for they are the
only Authors theroff) in as much as they be unworthy to be answered unto /
saying they have no sure grownds / but ba^e assertions only / which are as
easily denied as affirmed. And besides that Master Horn said openly in the
hearing off all his complyces / before Master Bartue D. Cox and D. Sands /
arbytres appointed by your authority / that he was not desirous that we should
answer / wherein indede / he was not altogether a fool. For he knew well
enough how fond gear he had written / and would bear away this bragg the
while / not as though we would not / but could not answer so light
accusations. Which petit bragg (Wherein he so much deliteth) we would have
been content to have spared him / had not your authority (who thought it meet
for us in any wise to make answer) come between: And in case Master Horn
and Master Chambers shall read some things here in our answer that they
would not / let them remember that they have driven us to it / in that they
have blustred owte in wrytinge so unworthy matters (and that so falsely) off
such a multitude off their banished country men. for they (Forgettinge all
humanity and Good manner) / obiecte before the Magistrate (and that often)
prouertie to a great many off ours now in exile as a most high reproach.
What then? Are they banished and poor willingly or parforce? Were they not and
might they not (yff they set more by goods then godliness / be richer? And
whens have they this poverty which ye Master Horn and master Cha^bers
cast so tauntingly in their teeth? And whence have ye this plentye whereby ye
look so high against your brethern? Surely you ought to have advised your
selff / saying ye carry the common purse / before ye had so rashly and so
indiscreetly published these words unto the right honorable Magistrate / with
the reproach off your selff and off your country men. In deed we would have
suffered these (as common reproaches) to be buried in perpetual silence if it
seemed not otherwise meet to the right honorable magistrate / (whose authority
we obeyinge as if becomethe us) shall answer particulerly unto all the
particular chapters off your assertions.

To the preface.
WHere Master Horn and Master Chambers desire license to say and vnsaie /
to put too and take fro / to subscribe / and revoke / to d^o / and undo all /
as they think good them selves* they seem to require their own right: for
they desire no other then that they have been used hitherto to do / as it is
most euident^y known almost to all the whole congr^gation* notwithstanding
this (albeit) it is against S Paul's rule / who denies it to be his property
to say yea and nay / nether have we any more merueil / that the same Master
Horn and Master Chambers think the old Discipline is to be retained still as
a thing that both has permitted them free liberty to do ye^ hitherto what
they would at their own pleasure / and shewethe no way how to amend those
matters that they have don a m^sse a great while. And yet because we have
provided by the author^tie both off the magistrate and off the congregation
that the like shall not happen hereafter / they accuse us off innovation
forsoothe. Where they make cauillation about disc^pline to be amended and not
to be new made / and accuse us as though we have done against the magistrates
commandment: We answer that all occasions off our old controversies were
taken away by the magistrates commandment the last off February* but the
old Discipline / as a thing not perfect nor indifferent has been the special
cause off our controversies in deed: Therefore we affirm that it was taken
away by that commandment / and power given to the congregation to make an
other / as it is declared in the plain words off the same commandment:
Furthermore / for as much as we have kept still the greateste part off the
old discipline which seemed indifferent as it apeareth evidently in the book
off our discipline / let them call it (saying it so pleases them) the
amendinge off the old discipline / in as much as to amend / is nothing else
than to correct that which is amiss / to put owte that is evil and to put in
that is wantinge.

Therefore / whither they call it our new made discipline or the old amended
/ we will not strive with them abowte that matter / saying / we give them leave
to speak at their pleasure. Only we decla^e that we have done nothing against
the magistrates commandment in that behalff.

Objection to the title off the Discipline.
IN the title and entrance unto their Discipline we reprove this as plain
false in tha^ they say the book off their discipline was collected by 15.
Horn.
Yet old blind father lidford being an alms man, was forced by the B. off L.
to s^bscribe to the book off prayer, among others, more blind then he.
men appointed do do the same by the congregation and the authority off the
Magistrate / and so exhibited afterward unto our congregation by the same ^5.
men. For it was both collected before the matter was committed unto them and
confirmed before hand by many men's hands subscribed.

Touching the 42. Which approved this discipline and confirmed it by
subscribinge / this we may allege there are 24. off the^ which live off
other men's liberality and alms / so as they may seem rather to follow
other men's wills / and to be inclined to their pleasures: specially / saying
so large and ample promises as well to live at liberty as to have their slender
living releued / have been made to this intent.

Master Horn and Master Chambers deny the book off discipline to be
collected by the 15 men / because they being VVhithead.
appointed off the 15. have labored by all means that nothing should be done
for the settinge off the congregation at a quiet stay. And when they perceived
that they could not hinder it / they came not with the rest / the 2. last
days according to appointment so as by that means / some of the just number
off 15. men should be wantinge. was not the book therefore both Lawfully
collected and lawfully exhibited to the congregation because 2. or 3. off the
appointed men withdrew themselves against right and equity? What should be
determined in any affairs / yff the matter should tarry / till altogether
(not one except) should agree thoroughly in all points? Where they say the
book was collected before this matter was committed to the 15. men is it a
plain slander. Master Horn and Master Chambers might be justly ashamed to
cast poverty in our bretherns teeth now in exile (and that before the
Magistrate) and to lie so openly / that 24. off our company that subscribed
live off other men's alms. And yff so many poor men have forsaken Master
purse bearer Chambers is it not a plain matter that they have been evil
entreated at Chambers hand before time? But where they gather that the poor
men seem to have followed other men's minds in subscribinge to the Discipline
/ rather then their own: it is fondly gathered: in as much as on the contrary
part it is most true that they which (were they poor men) folowid not
Chambers when he ran a Way with the bag / regarded their conscience more
then the lyuinge forsomuche as both they and all other might be certainly
assured that they should most grievously offend not only the purse bearer
Chambers but also two or there other off the richer sort off our
congregation. But how much more justly might we return this accusation
(which they falsely bend against ours) upon M. Horn and M. Chamb. and many
other off their number which have followed Chamb. in runninge away from the
congregation / because he carried and showed them a well stuffed powche / as it
were a standard to follow* for neither Master Chambers nor Master Horn
durst ever have departed from the congregation as they have done but upon
trust off the powche / which the one has always borne / and the other has
been ever an inseperable waiter upon / where so ever it were carried: and and
yet in the mean while / this gaye fellow Horn / from alofte contemns so
great a company off his country men / as beggars and caitiues in comparison
off himselff.

But in case there be so many among us that live off other men's alms / as
Master Horn and Master Chambers do reason. And saying Master Chambers took
upon him especially at the entreaty off Master Horn / the charge off
gathering godly men's alms publickely in the name of the church / for the
relieff the off poor off our congregation as it is already known unto many
and shall hereafter by the whole matter severally setforth / be most evidently
known to moo: what mercy and pitye is this off there is toward their brethern
to leave so many miserable people behind them / contrary to their promise
made to the congregation / and to run away not only from the congregation /
but also owte off the city snappinge away the bag with them (which
conteinethe many men's alms gathered for the poor in the name off the
congregation / and to leave them all destitute / and also to leave certain
preachers appointed by them (which have served the church a year and moore /
and to whom they promised that they should lack nothing) in a great deal off
de^t to other men for their necessary bourde*

And where they play such prankes / they cast o^^^ brethern in the teeth
still with poverty / by the way off reproach / before the Magistrate. Let
them go too therefore / saying their pleasure is such and number their own
company and leave owte their servants / their boys / and such as depend
upon Chambers purse (for he has made it his own / and dedicated it to his
own property) and let them tell us then / how many there be left on their
part / yff they be not ashamed to tell how many they be: Where we did
comfort our poor brethern to our power whom Chambers running away with the
bag Had made astonished / and would have had them utterly discouraged / they
lay it to our charge as evil done: what is there manifest declaration else
but that the poor of our congregation should be utterly destitute not only of
relieff but also off all hope of relief which has ever bin the vttermoste
comfort off such as be in myserie.

In the Discipline it selff an objection.
Horn.
The next thing now where in we agree not / is / that which is spoken off the
2. new Ministers. This they treat upon in the 7. Article. Th^s we defend /
that the scripture does lean and inclyne rather unto one / than unto 2. which
one / as he must not be above the rest by lordeshipp / so yet ought he to be
above other in charge and in burden / in as much as he must needs give a
greater accoumpte / then the rest for the flock committed unto him and to his
charge. These we are able to prove. First / by the circumstances off the
places off scriptures considered / secondly / by the interpretacions off
ancient fathers / and the best learned men off our time or latter days.
Thirdly / in the examples of the churches instituted by the Apostells / and
most holy men after their time / foorthly / this new order off 2. Ministers or
moo / has been (as all the wyseste men have always reasoned) the seeds and
fountains of all dissentions and co^tentions. And like as for order sake and
for conservation off the churches in peace / our elders thought / that one
should necessarely be above the rest: so also in this our remembrance / the
greatest learned men as Calvin / Brentius / and many other do think. Off these
matters the best instituted and reformed churches in Germany can also be the
best witnesses. These / we profess that we both can and will more largely
show as farther occasion shall hereafter serve / which we cannot do now for
that we be lymited to so short a time.

The answer.
VVhithead.
As concerning the two Ministers off the word. We affirm that it is lawful
by the word off God to have either 2. or moo.

Where these men say the scriptures do lean rather to one that is to affirm
only / and to prove nothing / where as Paul almost in all his Epistles
writes allwaies as unto moo off equal authority in every church and not as
unto one principal. Where they allege the ancient Doctors / Jerome which is
the most diligent in H^storie matters / reports most plainly that in the
beginning there were many / and afterward for the auoidinge of dissentions /
the chieff authority was committed unto one as the chieff. But yet says he /
that was done rather by the statute off men then by the authority off God.
Where they speak so much off the misch^ffe off contention in the church / we
confess it is a great evil / But that tyranny ^s a more pestiferous
destruction to the church / and that tyranny crept into the church by one /
the Bishopp off Rome / may teach us at large. Therefore / for as much as
both ways / either by one or by moo / euells may happen / we thought good to
beware more diligently of the greater evil. Where they bring in Calvin for
one / we marvel with what face they can do that saying it is owte off all
dowte / that he upon one day and in one hour instituted two Ministers off
equal authority in all things in the English congregation which is at
Geneua. And also saying that in the 8. chapter and 42. and 52. divisions off
his Christian Institution / he declares openly that there were from the
beginning moo ministers off the word off equal authority in the church off
Christ. Where they allege the examples off the churches off Germany we also
want not examples off the dutche church at Emden wherein their be 3. Ministers
off the word off equal authority. And off the french church off this City
/ and off the English church off Geneua / yea and Calvin himselff is counted
superior to his fellows not by authority off office / but in respect off his
lerninge and me rites. Therefore in as much as it is also permitted unto us by
the magistrates app^intement / to choose one or moo: let them leave their
wranglinge for a thing indifferent / as though i^ it were for lyffe and land.
Where they profess that they will make large proffe off this matter at leisure
/ let them profess these gaye glorious promyses so long as they will / so
they know the longer they labor in this matter / so much less shall they
both show and bring to pass

The objection to the 8. Article.
Horn.
In the 8. Article Ministers committ and assign the burden and cure (wherewith
they are charged) unto others with over much facility: We demand also this /
which appears not plainly enough in their Discipline / to whom pertains it
to allow their allegations and excuses / when they will leave their charges
unto others.

The answer.
VVhithead.
What inhumanitie is it / not to be content / that the ministers off the word
(upon weighty causes / as sickness or urgent business off importance) should be
eased off their burdens? as though they that find fault at this now /
permitted not the same to themselves before / rough against other / and over
favorable to themselves.

And where they demand unto whom it perteinethe to allow their lawful
causes / we wonder / that they / another read jointly in the same place the
name off Seniors / to whom the matter is committed / nor remember that general
point in the 36. article / that the government off the whole church is
committed to the ministers and Seniors.

The objection to the 13. Article.
Horn.
We allow the translatinge off books. But that so open a law should be made
for that matter / that is the thing we find fault with. For it both
contains that which is a pestilent matter to our congregation / by means
off danger off such as are wont to traueile as strangers up hither unto us out
of England / as also it may be reprehended in that it seems to smell and
tend openly to the private commodity off some men.

The answer.
Where it is signified that certain books godly and fit either to instruct
/ VVhithead.
or comfort our country men in this calamity off ours and off our country
/ should be translated in to our tongue then the which there can be nothing
more profitable or necessary / they say it is a pestilente matter forsoothe /
because it is so openly mentioned: as though by speaking nothing / it might be
persuaded that we do nothing here but sleep for where they add towching the
private commodity off some in so common a profit / we cannot guess what that
meanethe in as much as all men that have in these miserable days / yet
hitherto caused books to be set forth in our tongue have rather lost then
won by them.

The objection to the 16. Article.
In the 16. Horn.
Article the custody off the treasure off the church pertains not
necessarily to the Deacons by the word off God. And at this day many reformed
churches do not observe it and moreover it semethe more profitable unto our
congregation to have it otherwise. Fowrthly the most part off the auntientest
churches keep a plain other custom.

The answer.
If they be able to show so plain a place in all the whole Scripture for
any other that ought to have the custody off the treasure off the church as
is in the 6. VVhithead.
off the Acts off the Apostells / for the Deacones / we yield unto them. Yea /
and Calvin shall yield also (whose name they oftentimes wondrous confidently
and falsely allege) who / in the ^. Chapter off the Institution off a
Christen man in the 55. division / thinks plainly as we do / as well
concerning the custody / as the distribution off all church money and
vtterethe the same in plain words. In the primative church / says he / the
Deacons received (even as it was under the apostells) faithful peoples daily
oblations and the yearly revenues off the church / to thentent they should
bestow them upon true uses. We desire them now to show us more plainly /
unto what other men that charge does rather belong then to the deacons / etc.
But they say many reformed churches observe not this / and that it will be
more profitable for our congregation to have it otherwise And that the most
part of the auncie^test churches keep still an other custom This (as we
said before) is only to affirm / and prove nothing. But thus they do
a^moste allwaies. But where they speak off the auntientest churches / we
believe / they mean the popish churches / but would not for shame utter it: or
else let them show us what ancient churches those be / yet this we may not
ouerpasse how that they affirm that it will be profitable for our church to
have it otherwise: that is / that one / as it is now / have the custody alone
/ know alone / and distribute the church money alone and make accoumpt alone /
and to himselff alone. But we are ready to prove either to the magistrate / or
to the world (in case the Magistrate so permit it) both by testimonies /
reasons / and matters in deed / that this is not only not profitable / but
also it has and is utterly pernicious / and to the plain vndooinge off our
church.

The objection to the 17. Article.
Horn.
We find fault / that the election off the Deacons is not free enough. For the
rich men must be allwaies taken. Also in that they ought to depend upon the
will and council off the elders / where now agreat part off the elders both
live and depend upon the Deacons purce. There mouth therefore semethe to be
stopped / so as they dare never reprove and ouersore correct the Deacons when
they offend.

The answer.
There was never man that was in his right wit which denied i^ to be most
profitable for the church / VVhithead
to have such men chosen to be Deacons / as the least suspicion can be had in.
Where Horn and Chambers affirm that a great part off the Elders live and
depend upon the Deacons purce / it is a plain slanderous report.

But admit there be one or two among them off the poorer sort that shall
perhapps have need now and then off some relieff off the church money. Do not
you (Horn and Chambers) know that they have been richer in times paste / and
except they preferred Religion to riches) may be richer when they will? And
now as they are become willingly banished men / so are they willinglye poor
men for the same Religions sake that ye will seem to profess? Wherefore then
had ye rather enuiously to reprehend poverty in such a one then gently to
commend so great a virtue / but that ye are driven hereto by grief of your
stomakes through malice. What? Does Paul require welthe in Elders (as ye do)
or virtue? Go too / and show us owte off Paul that this your purce welthe /
is so necessary in an elder: We dare affirm that such a one should have been
off more authority with Paul as also with all men that be godly / and more
worthy to be an elder by reason off his poverty / for the which he is so
contemned at your hand. But poor elders dare not (ye must understand)
reprove offendinge Deacons: Do not you Horn and Chambers know that in the
primative church / Bishopps them selves / had their appointed living owte off
the treasure off the church / which was in the Deacons hands: and yet the
Deacons (in case they did amiss) were never the less sharply corrected off
them? And yet these men that requier such ruffling rich elders / would have
Deacons off the poorer sort. But by what example / and by what reason? why
cannot ye being Christians be content in exile as well with poor Elders as
with poor Deacons? we remember that one off you said openly in our hearing /
and in the hearing of many other that you could not with your conscience be
under such ministers and such Seniors as our church has now chosen. If ye
can find no other fault in them then wilful poverty / the congregation
also can not repent them yet off the ministers and Seniors whom they have
chosen: and as for this pure conscience off yours we pass not for it. But we
think / yff welthe be to respected in any that is in Ecclesiastical Ministry
it is to be be respected chieffly in Deacons / that they meddle with the church
money with owte sinistre suspicion. In deed abowte 4. months paste / ye had
Deacons / surely honest men we say not nay / but yet such as for their
slender ability ye made such underlings / that ye brought not only the
honest Good men but also the ministry off Deacons (to the great injury off
the apostells ordinance) into very much contempt. And in case we have
thought Good to be ware (by all means) off that evil / ye ought not to have
been grieved at it / but rather to have reioised in the churches behalff. But
herein there is one great sin / that this is not done by you / but rather
against your minds saying ye think nothing to be right / nor any thing to
stand in force unless it proceed off you.

The Objection against the 18. Article.
Horn.
The ministers shall be privy how much money there is / but not how it is
bestowed. This is agai^ste the custom of the auncientest and best instituted
churches / Yff Calvin be so in your judgment I hope you will allow his 2.
letters before.
and contrary to the Judgment and mind off the greatest learned men that be
in these days as Calvin and others / which as they permit the distribution
unto the Deacons / even so / will they have it done at the arbitrament and
apoointment off the Elders.

The answer.
VVhithead.
The Ministers (say they) shall be privy how much money there is / but not
how it is bestowed. Where find you in our book these words: (but not how it
is bestowed?) And yet when he has added it / off his own / lord / how he
triumphs here off the custom off the most auncientest churches / off the
minds off the greatest learned men / namely Master Calvin / etc. In this
matter the man truly semethe not to have wanted space and time wheroff he had
to much to write so fond vanities / but that he lacked his eye sight and some
what else besides.

The objection against the 19. Article.
Albeit they would cover the matter / Horn.
yet by making off laws / they make al openly known: For they disclose thus
much / that we send owte our gatherers to bring other men's liberality
unto us: which thing shall bring great danger to many in as much as the
enemies off our religion will easily conjecture from whom this so great
libiralitie comes.

The answer.
There is a great fore sight in these men that they can reprehende that thing
in us which they themselves have done now already these 3. VVhithead.
years but it is well known that they send owte their gatherers / no more then
it is / that we be at Franckford. And then be adds that the ennemies may
easily conjecture from whom this so great liberality commethe. We wonder what
he means or how much it is that he calls so great. Does Chambers at
vnwarres mean the greatness off his purce? for as for us we have yet hitherto
sent owte no body to gather / much less have we received any thing by any
gatherer.

The objection against the 21. Article.
We w^^e not what they mean by the scoole. Horn.
but how so ever the matter is / it shall annoye us very much / yff they
build up so many things with so solemn a profession / and shall bring our
adversaries into such a suspicion / that we receive much more off other men
then comes to our hands in deed. And this shall comme off it that very
many shall for our sakes be most straightly handled and examined.

The answer.
What yff 2 or 3 Papists list to lie / that we receive many thousands /
VVhithead
shall this breed great danger to us and others / and shall many be most
straightly handled and examined therefore? They may feign dangers owte off
every thing if they will. But he thinks it would not be known that here
are students / lectures / and Disputations / yff we had spoken nothing off
the scoole in our discipline. For it was not known that there was a college
off students at Zurick before. It is a world to se how circumspecte these men
be in words / when they are minded to speak any thing against this our
foolish symplicitie. For what madness is it / to think that those things
which be every day open before men's eyes are the more known / by one
sentence written in a book which very few shall look in.

The objection to the 22.23. and 24. Article.
Horn.
The shamefastnes off many / is unshamefast enough / and to be often
diligently examined. And we think it necessary that nothing be done in this
behalff withowte consent off the elders / who as they best know the state off
every man so they can and ought to make an exhortation at the distributing
apt and fit for every man's disposition.

The answer.
VVhithead
The shamefastnes off some is almost so far attempted off some shameless men
that their heart is clean cast down. For these discreet disposers off other
men's alms / have by passing to much on monye utterly cast away men / yea
/ both together the money and men. And yet in the mean while / these that
withowte all shame / reason of shamfastnes forsooth / whom rather then those
that have any spark off honest shamefastnes left / would go unto / they had
rather almost die / yea / these ge^^le and shamfaste disposers have with their
odious behaui^^^ d^^^en many men off notable good wits and towardness / some
to the printinge house / some to be seruinge men / and to run into England
again / with the peril both off body and soul. But off this case off evil
handlinge / we shall commence matter against thies men (yff god will) and the
magistrate give us leave / to thentent that good men may be the more ware
hensfoorthe that they committ not their liberal alms so easily to any one
man's fidelity hereafter.

The objection against the 26. Article.
The law ordained for those that travel by the way shall call unto us all
such as be the most idle persons and the veriest unthrifts / Horn.
and also Papists which will fame themselves to be Religious that they may be
helped as we have learned by experience.

The answer.
The trauelour off our nation having need by the way to be helped on his
journey (yff the treasure off the church will bear it) please not these men.
They say / VVhithead.
they have learned by experience that idle persons and unthrifts and also
papists are called hither by this means. By what experience / we beseech you?
before this law was made or since? yff they were called hither before this
law was made / they were no^ called by occasion off this law. Let them cease
therefore to impute unto a law / that provides only for those that be godly
and needy / those things that naugtie packes have ever hitherto done and
will do still hereafter.

The objection to the 27. Article.
Horn.
It is not an alms / but a compulsion. Besides this / off these that are found
to be the setters forth off these laws their are not paste 17. or 18. Which
have competent enough to live upon and to sustain themselves. And off them
there would not only five give heretofore / when collections were made / and
the sum off all their distributions came never to 1^. Dallers / they gave so
sparingly and so slenderly. And parhappes their is some what herein to keep
back and and fray away all such as be off the richer sort from us that they
came not hither / when they shall se so few rich dwell among so many poor
/ which nevertheless shall be compelled to sustain and bear very great charges
at sundry contributions.

The answer.
VVhithead.
It is not a compulsion / but an alms. For no man is constrained otherwise then
his own good will and ability is / and that that is off good will / is no
compulsion. And there shall no man off the richer sort (that is godly) be
fraide away from us by this mean / in as much as such as be godly seek
off there own accord / whom they may do good unto. And where they obiecte
unto us again the small number off ours / which have competent enough to
live upon themselves / these should be some men off mighty ability that
would have the magistrate persuaded / that other are but beggars in comparison
off them. paraduenture Horn / which is the deviser here off / is admitted
under hand into the felowshipp off the purce with Chambers and theroff it
commethe his so great swellinge / such loftynesse and contempt off others: And
where he addethe that there were but fine that gave at the collections before
time / and the sum off that they gave / came scarce to 13. Dallers / it is a
matter worthy to be known For abowte an halff year paste and more when Horn
and Chambers had given warninge openly for certain things that they were
offended at / we wot not what / that they would give over their
Ecclesiastical ministeries / which is no novelty for them to do now /
afterward they went abowte to gather every man's alms to the intent they
might seem at their departure from their ministeries like good husbands of
other me^nes liberality to have left something unto the church. But saying
they gathered to this end / and it was perfectly known to all men that their
gatheringe was for this cause / certainly / we marvel that there was so much
as one that would gave any thing / or that the sum which they gave /
growed to so much as 13. not Dalers but hallers or phe^ninges. But Chambers
and Horn were not so evil known at that time: now yff they list to assaie /
they shall proceiue / that there is not one / that will pu^ them in trust with
so much as a myte. And yet sins they departed from the congregation / there
has bin more given (by the grace off god) unto the poor / then Horn and
Chambers have given off their own / all the days off their liffe.

The objection against the 29. Article.
This law has these disco^modities: that first / Horn.
it discloseth the thing ouermuche / that those which were wont to be
liberal unto us / are most desirous to keep close / secondly / it is
preiuditiall to private men which have felt many men's private beneficence.
Thirdly it nippeth and thwitethe away a great deal off that liberality /
which might come to us / in that we so appointe a strange collectour / and
unknown to the geuers. Fourthelie it does wondrous suspiciously importe the
infamy off certain that have used these labors. Fiftlie / it shall strike a
fear and a terror unto the geuer when he must se so many hands subscribed
to public letters and by this reason they shall be eloigned from us that would
gladly succor the poor.

Sixthly / it shall be exceeding hurtefull to other congregations / and a loss
to all other banished men / whersoeuer they are dispersed. Finally / these so
openly ordained laws shall signify unto our Queen that we norishe and
sustain our congregation by her subjects. And that shall off necessity
cause / that they which were wont to give us some what shall be most diligently
sought owte to their vndooinge and our most pestilente plage.

The answer.
VVhithead
Here is maniefolde fyndinge off fault as in a matter off most weighty
importance / and wherewith Master Horn and Master Chambers are wonderfully
rubbed on the gall. But passinge over the first member as vain / and mingled
with others / we will first speak of the second. Yff this be to the
prejudice off private men / what have you Master Horn and Master Chambers
done / which now a great while have by your messengers and letters stopped
all the private almoses off all men / and drawn them into your own hands?
And that you / Master Horn / threatened owte off the pulpit that you would do
/ and that you would make poor miserable men to eat hay. Where they speak
off an unknown collectour / we answer / that the less he shall be commonly
known / the less danger shall he cause to them / that he shall have to do
with all. For those collectors off yours / are now by this your diligence in
gathering (would to god ye were as liberal in distributinge) and by these your
close and most discreet means / so known / that no man dare bydd them god
speed / much less talk with them.

Therefore it is wondrous fine / that Master Horn has forged here
co^cerninge an unknown colectour* where he says that a fear and a terror
shall be stricken into such as shall see many names subscribed / we
understand not how that ca^ be. It seems he would say / that our
messagers will show not our names but the messagers names subscribed.
Furthermore / we demanded off Chambers and Horn / why they have done the same
now these 3 years / and compelled men ^o subscribe against their wills. A
small fault in these days.
In them this is a godly matter in us an horrible abomination.

Where he says / that this will be exceedinge Hurtefu^l to her congregatio^s /
certeinlie / it has bin a most an vndooinge both to our congregation and
others tha^ M Horn and M. Chambers have in this behalff done yet hithertoo /
For one while they say / they have gathered alonely for this congregation:
When any body off an other church (ye must understand) crave ought off them
An other while they boaste that they have a great deal for other congregations
/ that is when they be offended with us as they are now most grievously. For
now (we believe) they will say plainly they have nothing for our poor /
therefore though they speak it not / yet / they show openly by their deeds
that they have all to themselves / and keep all to themselves. Where he says
/ the Queen shall understand by this means that our congregations are
norished by her subjects* how so? Do we name English men? or universally all
good men by whose liberallitie the poor off our congregation be norished? But
the Queen will suspecte some thing off her subjects. O fine witt^e men: She
suspected nothing forsoothe before we wrote this discipline. That / that he
has in the fourth place set as i^ were / in the middle rank in saftie / we
saw not* therefore / we will speak off it last But this is the greuouse
matter off all / and that which alone tormenteth these men in deed. for other
causes are pretended / but this is the very thing whence (as the man says)
comethe all this anguishe and anger too / forsoothe it will be suspected (says
he) if some other collecte in the name off the congregation / that we like not
Chambers collection / nor Horns and his distribution. Hereoff will all these
weighty discommodities grow / that they two (ye must understand) may not
be in so great authority with all men / nor be such buggarddes to the poor
yff they may not bear the bag alone. O grievous and intolerable euilles
that will grow off these suspicions. In deed they make an end off all this
place with plain tragical terms: this gear (says he) shall cause
vndooinge and a most pestilent plage unto the congregation.

We wonder that he cried not owte also* o heaven / o earth / o neptunes seas /
but where they fear them selves so much off suspicions / we believe / they
may be owte off paraduenture in a while. For all men will with in a short
time (as far as we see) give over to suspect what manner off men Horn and
Cha^bers be. Finally what fault so ever they find with us in all this adoo
touching the messager to be sent / they themselves have utterly forced us by
extreamitie and violence to attempt it. For saying Chambers wou^d give
nothing being present / but unto certain off his own / and is now run
away with the purce / we are utterly constrained to take this way / that
our poor perish not for famine.

The objection against the 30. Article.
Horn.
This is amiss / that the Deacons are bownden to visit the poor only / to
know if they need: saying it is chieflye required that they may exhort /
that they may comfort / that they may relieve such consciences as be sick
and burdened with sins. A man may ask them where it apeareth by plain
words off the scriptures / that it is the Deacons office to receive and keep
the treasures off the church / and that they alone ought to excecute and
accomplish this office.

The Answer.
VVhithead.
Let the Deacons visit all sick folk vn^uersallie yff they will and exhort
them and comfort them / we forbid the^ not. Only we show that they are
bownden by reason off their office peculiary to have charge off the poor.
VVhithead
Where they say it is chiefly required that deacons should exhort and comfort
the sick consciences off them that are diseased: If they say they be bownde
to do that by reason off their office / let them prove it / that they do not
only say all things. But yff they respect Christian pity toward their
brethern / neither do we exempte from the Deacons / that which is the common
dewtie off all Christians. But for as much as they have burdened the Deacons
before / with unnecessary charges as concerning the office off Deacons / by
reason wheroff they fraied many from that right godly office off Deacons / we
have thought good to declare what things they be which properly appertain to
the Deaconshipp / and what be the common duties off all Christians. And least
these men might justly complain as touching the lake off exhortinge and
comforting the sick / that matter is sufficiently provided for by the
ministers off the word unto whom that charge does chiefly appertain and by
other learned men also. And to that question that they harp upon again / it is
thoroughly answered in the 4. Article In that they require plain words off
scripture off us we cannot marvel enough / saying they neither prove or
show any thing / either by plain words or obscure words: but as though
we were scollere and they scoolemasters off Pithagoras rule / they only say
and affirm all things and confirm nothing. But they promise they will do
it at leisure and god before. And that is enough we trow.

The objection against the 38. Article.
The time is ill appointed. Horn.
it were a great deal better after the mart / for the auoidinge off rumor and
blowinge off dissentions which may arise as it is now in example.

The answer.
The time is appointed well enough. VVhithead
For these dissentions are not to be imputed to times / but to men. And we
trust that we shall by the grace off God have hensfoorthe goodmen that shall
quietly geuerne the church in the tru^ fear off god and love to their
brethern.

The objection against the 44. Article.
Horn.
The 44. Article speaks manifestly against the edicte off the Senate. For
there it is specified by these clear and manifest words. Furthermore the
Senate off this honorable city has decreed / that if their arise any
dissension or contentions among the strangers / concerning Religion or their
Discipline / they be set at one with all diligence by the ministers and
Seniors specially for this cause / least those which profess themselves to
be banished me^ owte of their country for true Religions sake / utter an evil
token what their mind is by reason off such controversies and debates. And in
case the matter cannot be apeased before the ministers and elders let them
know that the Senate off this city will take order therein / who as reason is
/ will look most sharply upon the Authors off such troubles.

The answer.
VVhithead.
It is not against the meaning off the edicte / as it was declared by the
Magistrates themselves in our church before all the congregation the last
off February / by the mouth off Master Valeran polaine / and the said
Magistrates / (saying the sentence pronounced by the said Master Valeran and
written owte by us / allowed it / according whereunto / this decree is all
together set forth.

The objection against the 46. Article.
This law does not sufficiently forsee and provide for the quietness off the
congregation / Horn.
vnle^ in this greater part / the pastor and seniors be included / whose
authority men ought not to bring into such co^tempte that we would so
easily reiecte them. The multitude is off their own disposition / ouermuche
licentious and grudginge at every superior power and this law is also
against the edicte off the Senate.

The answer.
If the ministers and Elders will be present no man warns them: if they will
not / VVhithead.
who will force them against their wills? It is impertinent that he says /
they be easily reiecte / which will not come when they be desired / or when
they be present depart upon their own will. Where he says / that this
decree is also contrary to the edicte off the Senate / it is not enough /
except he prove it.

The objection against the 49. Article.
The subscribinge is over hardly and constrainedly done specially in so often
alteration and innovation off laws as as they speak off. Horn.


The answere^
The subscribinge is not over hadly nor constrainedly done but so much the
less hardly and co^stainedly / VVhithead.
in that there is an easy way showed to redress If any thing be done
amiss: Where these men would have their decrees to be reputed for holy sacred
ca^nons which may not be moved. And as for this subscribinge / which they
say is so constrained and hard / besides that it is provided for by the edicte
off the Senate / it is required also in their oulde discipline and institution.

The objection against the 54. Article.
The authority off the pastor and Seniors is all wiped away. Horn.
For every thing is referred to the confused multitude of the congregation.

The answer.
VVhithead.
Except the matter be used as we have provided in the Discipline / both the
authority and liberty off the congregation is wyped away / and a mere
tyranny estblished. Where he says all thing is referred to the confused
multitude / it is manifestly false. For it is allwaies added by such as the
congregation shall appointe thereto: as it is also in the 54. article added / in
plain words.

The objection against the 57. Article.
Horn.
This Law is also contrary to edicte off the Senate.

The answer.
VVhithead.
This should not be said but showed.

The objection against the 58. Article.
Horn.
The assembly off 4. 6. 8. or 10. is troublously done and withowte order / and
will stir up new tumultes daily in the congregation. Such laws as this
condemn the authority and counsel off the Elders.

The answer.
Horn and Chambers condemn the assembly off 4. 6. 8. VVhithead.
or ^^. men for peace mak^nge: Where they have almost every day these 3.
months gathered corner creepinge assemblies to disturb the peace of the
church.

The objection against the 59. Article.
Horn.
The 59. article is manifestly repugnant against the 56. Article.

The answer.
The 59. is not repugnant against the 56. article for there is entreated off
civil controversies and here off others. VVhithead


The objection against the 63. Article.
This law also is against the edicte off the Senate. Horn.


The answer.
It is not against the meaning off the edicte / VVhithead.
as it is declared in the answer to the 15. Article. For it was declared by
the right honorable and godly Magistrates openly in our church / that they
thought nothing less then to impeche the lawful authority off the
congregation. And except the congregation which gives authority to ministers
be superior to the ministers / they are not now ministers / but lords off the
congregation / as to add no further.

The objection to the 68. article.
In this place we desire that our old discipline may be looked upon / that
we may se whither it be / Horn.
to be so lightly cast away / saying it proceeded off so learned men / and
shall with a mean amendinge be far perfecter then this new Discipline.

The answer.
Where they desire that the old Discipline may be looked upon / we answer /
the more they shall look upon it / VVhithead.
the more euedently shall the naughtynes and imperfection off it appear / And
it shall also more plainly appear how much the congregation has bin
beholdinge to them that have retained such an imperfect discipline so long in
the church / only / by cause it permits all to the pastor. Where they say
that the Discipline proceeded off so learned men / yet / the same that wrote it /
(were they never so well learned) confess themselves both that it was gathered
in haste / and given to the congregation as imperfit / only for a time. Where
^hey speak off the amending off that Discipline / we marueille that it never
came into their mind before.

The objection against the 72. Article.
Horn.
That concerning testamentes in this dangerous world is a pernicious Law.

The answer.
VVhithead.
We cannot tell what serpente the law concerning Testamentes has lurkinge
under the herb. They say it is a pernicious law / and they only say so /
But we say it is very wholesome / and profitable against the fraud off
falsaries and to the succors of the fatherles and widows.

The objection the 73. Article.
Horn.
Quietness is not sufficiently provided for by this means / in as much as it is
commanded (as it were) that every one should look and study for an innovation.

The answer.
VVhithead.
Quietness / is provided for sufficiently / in as much as the matter must pass
quietlye and peaceably / and also by writings men's consciences / are also
necessarely provided for / that in case any thing be found in the
Ecclesiastical ordinances ungodly or disagreinge / or else unprofitable for
the church it may be changed straight ways / so as men's pleasures be not
holden for holy / sacred / and immovable as the papists would.

The obiectours conclusion.
In all this a do / we say this for a conclusion / Horn.
that there be three things / which they only seek / the innovation off
ministers / a purse and treasure / I wot not what / and the purginge off their
own offenses before committed

Now have we alleged as much as we handsomely could bring / consideringe
the time. We would also have alleged very many other things / so as it
should plainly appear / that our brethern have in ordeininge their Discipline
respected neither so great weighty reasons / nor so great commodities off our
congregation But have in the mean while given that / that shall be offensive
and slanderous to all good men / and to our adversaries and gods enemies the
papists high reioycinge and pleasure. The book off the olde-discipline with a
very little and small correction and amending would cause many more plentiful
fruits off Christian hearts to be brought forth / and would settle a great
deal more constant and more durable quietness among us.

The answer to the conclusion.
In all this adoo / Master Horn and Master Chambers go abowte nothing else
but to disquiete the congregation / VVhithead
that Horn might rule the roste over all: Chambers bear the bag alone / and
they 2. together exercise a most unworthy lordshipp over the poor / and by
them all other / and that they might have no certain discipline / but that
their pleasures might be holden for laws / and that nothing should be thought
right or stand in force but what they do / yet hithertoo / and the same they
go abowte now: And it semethe they have utterly determined either to
establishe a tyranny / or to leave no common wealth at all in the
congregation. Where Horn and Chambers make rehersall here off the purginge off
offenses committed by us / they ought justly to have been ashamed to make mention
off offenses saying they have never left for these 3. or 4. Months to lade
themselves with wicked doings And as for occasion of offense and slander given
to good and godly men and to our adversaries and gods enemies the papists
high reioicinge and pleasure / they accuse us theroff so falsely / as they
themselves have given the occasion in deed.

For they could never abide to have any thing amended nor themselves to be
admonished off any thing / or to be co^moned withal in any wise. But for the
most light / yea / no causes in deed / they forsook their ministry straight
ways / the pastor forsook the flock / the Treasorer the poor and both
forsook the church and moved others by their example to do the same.

Neither was it enough for them to give over their own functions but they must
draw other preachers and readers with them also / to the intent the
congregation should by this means be destitute off Gods word / and utterly
scattered as though it cold not possibly stand withowte them. And when they
had forsaken their own church / they haunted / partly the french church and
partly / the dewtche churches and so raised rumors abroad and spread our
dissentions / first / though this city and then thorough other cities off
Germany. And last off all / when they would not come to the church in the
mart time / but by the Magistrates commandment / neither could they then be
quiet they spreed the like rumors almost throughowt all Europe.

Then I hope, it may be now spread again withowt offense, all things well waied.
And when they have played these prancks themselves / they charge us with their
own faults and go abowte to lay the infamy upon us which they themselves
have stirred up. If you shall cry owte that old matters are rehearsed by this
means / you ought to have abstained from prouokinge us hereunto: neither to
have mentioned offenses committed / old subscriptions / ne yet to have called
us us back thus to the old discipline the fountain off all contentions.

The rest off our consentinge brethern we could not call together unto this
subscribinge / Horn.
by reason off shortness of time / whose names shall be put afterward having
your H. licenses thereto.

The answer to the postscripte.
Where they complain off shortness of time in the end as they did in the
beginning / VVhithead
and that they could not by reasen thereof call their co^sentinge brethern
together to the subscribinge: What means that? For where they have set to the
names off them which dwell most far asunder and have left owte almost none
but the names off their own servants whom they have allwaies at a beck / yet
they could not call the rest off their brethern together forsoothe / to the
intent they might by this shift make a show to such as know not the matter /
off some multitude off men off some estimation which are lest owte. And they
desire also as in a matter off weight that they may set too the names off the
others afterward. And as here in the end / they vaunte a certain show of
some great multitude that will subscribe: Even so / in the beginning and in
many other places of their book they make a great brag as though they would
exhibit some notable matter to the magistrate / so they may have time enough
given them to bethink themselves. But master Horn and master Chambers shall
with these their mighty and great promises both off subscriptions
declarations and confirmations bring^ to pass as good as nothing. But yet
this they are desirous to bring to pass in the mean time / that whiles these
gaye glorious promises off there is be looked for / they may a long time hinder
the peace and quietness off the church which their only desire is to have
disquieted. And if it be possible that they may recover a most intolerable
lordeshipp over the congregation or in case they cannot obtain the chief state
in the congregation / that they may leave the church in worste / or in no
state at all / but that they may rende^ it and all to scatter it. These be the
devises off Horn and Chambers. These be therfetches / right honorable and most
righteous Magistrates. And yet we have no distruste but almighty god for his
mercies sake toward our most afflicted church / and that your authority
for your equities sake and singular benevolence toward us / will withstand
the same.

And for as much as we have proved that one off these things which they have
reprehended in our discipline / be other against gods word / or against good
reason: and for as much also as we are ready to prove / that all things
contained in our Discipline / are taken owte either off Goods word or off
the edicte off the Senate and Magistrate / either owte off their own old
discipline which they stick so fast unto / either else off the judgment off
good reason / we humbly beseech the right honorable and righteous magistrates
that they will vouchsaffe to confirm it with their authority.

Where as both parts gave consent that certain others / very worshippfull /
should also deal in this controversy between them / to appease (yff it might
be) the same I have here folowinge placed the order which they took for their
quietness.

To the ministry and body off the congregation off the English Church off
Franckford.
FOr as much as at the request off all our brethern and country men off this
church off Franckford / we have vndertake^ to endeavor our selves to make an
end of this sorrowful controversy which so grievously / so long time has
vexed this congregation / slaundered Religion / and infamed the name off all
Englishemen we thought we could neither satisfy the duty off Christian
charity / nor the office off louinge country men / if we did omit any
thing / which / by any probable conjecture might seem to bring to effect
our honest entreprise in this behalf. whereupon we have thought good to offer
unto you our brethern on both parties such a form off agremente touching
certain points off your discipline as had seemed unto us upon conference
between certain chosen persons / on both sides before us most convenient / so
to satisfy all men / that every man might willingly and cheerfully submitt him
selff unto the the obedience theroff. Desiring you all as ye hope to have
favor at gods hands in the blood off Jesus Christ / so to apply your
favorable minds each to other that all striff and contention se^ aparte / you
may join together in a blessed Christian and happy society / peace and
concord / and the thing whereunto we wish both the parties should agree is
as folowithe.

The form off reconciliation.

First / where as in this whole treaty off reconciliation and alteration of
discipline / some things might happen to seem to re^de to the comdemnation of
some party or parson: we do all frelie pronounce and testify each part off
other / that neither off us do condemn either party / or any person as those
which have don any thing contrary to gods word / or probalitie off reason in
this matter off discipline / but frindly and lovingly every man does embrace
all men omitting all rehersall and disputation off things paste with common
and hearty prayer unto god / that from hens forth we may remain / and live
together in brotherly love to the glory off god and comfort off us all.

Concerning the article for exercise off lerninge / that there be no mention
made off the same in the book off discipline but that for so much as learned
men remain in the congregation / that the ministry shall for the
furtheraunce off lerninge / labor to put in ure such exercise off lerninge as
the learned can perform and the ability off the church bear.

Concerning the receiuinge and distributinge off the treasure off the churche^
The receauinge and distributinge theroff does apperteine to the Deacons / yet
not so that they do it withowt the knowledge and consent off the Ministers and
Seniors. concerning the kepinge off the said treasure / it may very well
apperteine to the Deacons / yet is it not off such necessity out that the
rest off the ministry may otherwise set order for the custody theroff / as
time and occasion shall serve.

And now in case it shall seem good unto all your wisdoms as well off the
Ministry and body off the congregation off the one part as off the
dissentinge brethern off the other part That we shall by our mediation
proceed any further according unto this form off reconciliation / which is
here described: We do heartily require you / that signifinge your minds unto
us with as conueniente speed as ye may / ye will also appoint owte on either
part / 2. Discreet and sober persons / lovers off peace and concord / which
by conference with other two off us / whom we shall appointe / may draw these
Articles before written into such a form as they may be conveniently anexed to
the rest off your Discipline.

The answer off the church to this offer / or the effect off the same.

We cannot allow this way off reconciliation offered to our church by our
country men for as much as we should condemn our selves as evil doers /
and our doings ungodly and unreasonable / but we are assured we have not done
in our discipline any thing contrary to gods word and good reason.

The copy off the letters off request sentfoorth for relieff off the poor by
Master Sutton
25. July 1557. To all them that bear an unfeigned Reverence and zeele unto the
eternal Testament off Jesus Christ / joined with the charitable and sincere
bowels off mercy toward the poor. Grace / Mercy and Peace from God the
Father by the same our Lord Jesus Christ his son the common and only
Savior off the world.
IT is not like that the brute of the controversy / which has now at the
end off six months continued in this Enshe church at Franckford / is
unknown to strangers: it is more like that so many being privy thereto / it
is carried and spread to far abroad: and most like by the fruits springinge
theroff / that it has been untruly reported by the wilful authors and
stubburne mainteiners off it / not only to the infamy / reproach / and
discredit off the body off this church and to the intent to stopp all relieff
from the poor members off the same / but also / that their uncharitable and
leude behauiours should not come to light. For it is well known that diverse
charitable men (albeit their persons and names be neither known nor desired to
be known) were / before the beginning off this controversy very liberal in
sendinge their charity to the use off this whole congregation universally /
and some were beneficial to sundry members off the same particulerlie /
which sith that time to our knowledge they have left undone utterly. We the
Ministers off the church / hopinge that these men the authors and mainteners
off this controversy would in time have known their faults and made
satisfaction to the church as it becomethe christen men to do / did not
only with patience suffer their slanderous talk and unquiet demenour / but
also bear with their unjust dealinge / and as much as in us lay studied to
cover their faulty doings. Nevertheless / saying no likelihood off their
amendment / but most manifest proffes off their malice / this poor
congregation / rather daily encreasinge then in any part abatinge / and
thereby the poverty theroff continually augmentinge / we thought it our
bownden dewtie in conscience / no longer to hide the matter / but thus off
necessity constrained / to disclose it / so as saying they will not be as they
ought to be / they may at least be known as they be. And thus we do not for
any malice that we bear to any man's person (as god the sercher off all
hearts knows) but that the truth being known / such good people as through
untrue report / have been persuaded to withdraw their good minds and favor
from this poor congregation might understand that withowte just cause they
have so long done it / and hereafter be the more willinge to renew their
charity in the relieuinge off this poor church off Christ. And to come to
the matter / ye shall understand that after master Horn late pastor / and the
Seniors that were joined in the ministry with him had by a writing
subscribed with their own hands / openly before the congregation surrendered
and given over their offices / reteininge nevertheless the writing off their
surrender in their own hands / and yet being desired by the congregation not
to leave their ministeries / but still to exercise the same: they in no wise
would do it / whereby the church was diverse days destitute off the
preachinge off gods word. Wheruppon / the more part off the congregation /
mindinge to have the church kept in good order and to redress those things
that were a great occasion off the former contention / so that after there
might be a perpetual quietness and concord among us / went earnestly abowte
the ^ame. But it hapened contrary to our expectation / the former grudges
continuinge / and new business daily increasinge / which at lenght came to the
Magistrates ear / contrary to our minds and determination. For when we
thought that it should withowte any further brute / amongst our selves have
bin pacified and ended as we would to god it had bin. Wheruppon the godly
magistrates lamentinge much our dissension / ad desiringe our quietness came
into our church and there / first made us to promise one to an other / that
from thens forth no mention should be made off any former grudge or
contention between us but that all things paste should be clean forgotten.
Afterward / for the better continuance off love among us and good order in
the church / with the consent off Master Horn the pastor and the Seniors
discharged him and them off their offices and willed the church to choose new
ministers and to make a new discipline (for by reason off the imperfectness off
the old Discipline a great part off the former controversy was) as if there
had bin never any church here before. Wheruppon the church diverse times
assemblinge / at lenght / the most part of the church thought most
reasonable that among other an order should be in this church like as it was
in the primative church and is now in all well reformed churches / that the
treasure should be in the custody off all the Deacons and not off any one man
alone. Master Horn with certain off the Seniors and a few others would in
no wise agree unto it / but to their vttermoste resist it / which gave us
occasion off farther just suspicion / that the treasure off the church in
time paste had not bin Christianly used.

And where as also we had devised an other order / that for so much as the
magistrate does permit us to use the customs and manners off making off
wills that be used in England / that for the more surety off our frindes
that were here or else where / yff we were disposed by our wills to give unto
them any off that little substance that god has lest us / (yff we should die
here) owre wills should be seen and exemplyfied by the Seniors / and so to be
owte of all danger off country faitinge at any time: Horn / and chambers
only upon fond will withowte any just consideration / or good reason
cauilled against the same order / only affirminge it to be pernicious. These
things we find manifestly at lenght / not to proceed off any good mind or
purpose but off contentious frowardnes grownded upon selff love and gain that
under a color of the church they might gather good men's devotions / and
never distribute any penny theroff or at the least / to none (had they never
so great need) unless they would / either faune / and hang on them / or else
sustain uncharitable tauntes and reproaches at their hands.

For where Chambers above 13. months paste had off master Whithead then
Pastor and the Seniors then a letter to receive of one special man 20. powndes
and besides / through Horns procurement / a general proxy to Chambers / and
his deputy / to gather the devotion off good men for the relieff off this
poor congregation / which by their own proceedings here before the
Magistrates (their own hands wrytinge testifinge the same) and otherwise by
our knowledge we are certain / they did put in practice / and received much
thereby / yet Chambers upon the accoumpt here left behind him / neither
confesses that he received the said 20. powndes nor yet any other sum /
neither has he distributed (duringe all the time he was in office yet to this
day) in this congregation / to any one person (saving to 3. scollers that
came with him) one penny / that he did not receive here in this congregation
and city.

And yet / at his departure hence / he left 2. off the said scollers (unto
whom nevertheless he promised sufficient provision and findinge / and never
warned them to the contrary) in debt for their boorde and for other
necessaries almost 20. guilderns which this poor congregation was forced to
pay. Finally / where good Mistres Wilkinson off blessed memory / put Horn
and Chambers in trust with the deuisinge and making of her will / whereby she
gave to this and other poor congregations of the poor banished English men a
Christian liberal relief: Albeit they have caused some off the said
congregations to be paid of the same bequeste / yet hithertoo would they not
make this poor congregation privy to the sum bequethed unto it / much
less pay it / nor yet (according to the order of our churches discipline
aforesaid) let the will be seen / so as the frindles young ientle woman her
daughter should not be defrauded off her right nor her mothers will altered to
her loss. Furthermore / Master Chambers understanding that we were minded
(according to our duties) to require an accoumpte of him / for the use off
his proxy / gets him suddenly hence (accompanied with Master Horn)
early in a morninge / withowte the consent or leave taking off the
congregation or the Ministry theroff / and contrary to his one openly made
promise / that he would not depart / till he had answered all that any man
could charge him with.

And at his goinge away / he left behind him an accoumpt / which by cuttinge
owte the leaves / and new written / se^^ethe not to be now at the last as it
was at the first / albeit it was never so perfect as Christian fidelity
would have required it to be. And moreover / albeit we have twice written unto
him charitably exhortinge and requiringe him to come hither / and discharge
himselff of those things that shall be said unto him in the behalff off this
congregation / and to the inthent he should restore unto it the proxy he
received / and no longer by himselff or his deputy exercise it in the name off
this poor church / as we are informed he does: he neither comes nor yet
makes answer to our letters / whereby we cannot but think that he means not
only craft and subtlety (much unworthy the integrity and fidelity that he
pretends) but also / to hinder / and as much as in him lies / to undo this
poor congregation / not only off that he has already received and carried
away / (as he has heretofore dealt with the company off poor students at
Zurick) but also / through untrue reports off all good men's devotions and
liberality that hereafter would else be bestowed. Their reports (which
among many other untruths to hinder this poor congregation they slanderously
brute abroad) are chiefly these: first / that the poor off this church be so
well provided for / that the worste has after the rate of 2. shillinges by
the week. Secondly / that some of the poor here / be so stowte tha^ they
disdain t^ ask relieff in their need / so that our poor seem either not to
need or not to be worthy off help. And thirdly / that men here seek to know
the names off the geuers to this congregation to their great peril and utter
vndooinge / which reports be all utterly untrue / but the truth is that for
lack / many poor men have been driven both to depart hence / to seek their
living in other places and some forced to go for relieff into England. These
speciallties (besides much more that we have thought good and very necessary
/ that good godly men should know / both that they should not conceive any
evil opinion off this congregation by false report / and also / that mindinge
to relieff the poor and miserably afflicted members off Christ their brethern
in this church / they should when god shall move them to depart with any
thing to that use / so deliver it / as it may sauffly come / and justly be
distributed / where they would have it bestowed. And therefore we / (considering
the state off our fellow exiles living here with us in need and poverty /
and fed by the only good providence off god) desire all Christian men for
the love off our savior Jesus Christ to consider / how pleasant a sacrifice
how sweet a savor the relieuinge off the poor for his sake is before the
face off our heavenly father. A good man's liffe / is almost nothing else
then a continual exercise off mercy. All the day long he has mercy and
pity / says the prophet David.

Give alms off thy goods (says the holy man Tobiah) and turn never thy
face from the poor: and so shall it come to pass / that the face off the
lord shall not be turned away from the. Be merciful after they power yff
thou hast^ much / give plenteouslie: if thou haste little / do thy diligence
gladlye to give of that little / for so gatherest thou thy selff a good reward
in the day off necessity. for alms delivers from death and suffers not
the soul to come in darkness. A great comfort is alms before the high God /
unto all them that do it.

Blessed is he that consideth the poor (says the Prophet David (the lord
shall deliver him in the time off trouble / etc. The good man (says David)
has distributed abroad and given to the poor / his righteousness remains for
ever: his horn shall be exalted with honor / he that gives to the poor shall
not lack / says the Wise man in the proverbs. As water / quenches burninge
fire / so does mercy reconcile sins: which god shall reward and not
forget / and the dooer shall find a stay to keep him up when he falls /
says Jesus the son off Sirach. Break unto the Hungry thy bread says the
Prophet Esaie and bring the poor fatherles into they house / when thou seeste
the naked / cover him / and hide not they face from thine own flesh. Then
shall thy light break forth / as the morninge / and thy health flourishe
right shortly / thy righteousness shall go before thee / and the glory of the
lord shall embrace thee. The^ if thou call / the lord shall answer the: if
thou criest / he shall faye / here I am. Lay ye not up treasures in earth /
where the rust and the moth may destroy it / and thieves may dig it owte and
steal it / says Christ / but lay up your treasures in heaven.

Give alms off that ye have and behold / (says Christ) all is clean unto
you. What ye give to one off these little ones (says he) ye give it unto me.
And also he says: blessed are the merciful for they shall find mercy* when
the ydolatrus King Nabuca^nezer should be converted unto god what said the
Prophet Daniell unto him? redeem they sins with alms / and thy wikednesse
with mercy on the poor / so perhaps god will pardon they sins. Think ye
that god forgate abdias that preserved the hundredth Prophets in caves and fedd
them there? Paul and the other apostells diligently both with words and
writing did labor for the relieff of the poor brethern that were at Jerusalem
and else where /

And we hope that god will open your hearts and minds to consider our state
and by these saynges and examples move you to have pity on your poor brethern
/ which yff it shall please his mercy to grant you cheerfully to do / it
is not to be dowted / but albeit he suffer you to slide and fall for a time /
yet will he heave you up (when it shall be his good pleasure) and preserve you /
so as at the lenght ye may be partakers off the joyful kingdom off god
which our savior Ie-Christ has purchased for his elect with the price off
hi^ blood The holy spirit off god be always with you amen.


This controversy which you have now hard from the ^3. off January hitherto.
I find written by the hands off such as are both learned and off credit / but
yet / I must needs say / by those that were parties in this broyle. And for so
much as Master Chambers in this controversy is very sore charged among the
rest: who yet / was thought off many wise and godlymen / to be very godly /
upright / and honest / and so no dowte he took his leave of this lyffe: I have
therefore here thought good to place a letter which is yet off his own hand
to be seen / wrytinge the same in his own defense touching these matters so
as the reader wayinge both the one and the other / may use his judgment
with discretion*

The copy off the letter.
To the worship. Master John Hales / M. Thomas Crawley. Master John Willford
/ and to Master Whitthead / Tho / mas Sorsby / William Master and John old
at Franckford.
Immanuell.

I wish unto you the peace off god with my commendations. The tenor of your
demand has caused me to differr answeringe to your letters until this time
not off purpos / to give no answer / but that I then upon the sudden wanted
sure knowledge in that thing whereby you chiefly charge me. At my coming from
Zurick to Frankford I was entreated by certain men to continewe my traueiles /
in gatheringe the Alms and liberalities off godly me^ / to relieve therewith
such poor dispersed English brethern / As I should think most meet to be
relieved even as before time I had done. This request put in writing /
subscribed by certain / was delivered unto me / not as letters testimonial
off authority / which as I neded not / or I required them not / neither yet
that I should by force off them gather for the church off Franckford only / or
specially / which I purposed not / but that I might be the rather moved to do
as before I had done. And they then required (which was after promise made
to further my doings with all faithful secrecy / in such sort as I should
from time to time devise an requier) to bestow such sums off money as
should hereafter come to my hands to such uses and purposes as I thought
good. Therefore / as by force off those letters I gathered not: So the
gatheringe for Franckford church has not been nor is in my hands / nor off
any other at my appointmente as ye do write.

Wherefore as I might / so I did / and that by the advice off many honest /
grave / and godly men / depart from thense withowte making that accoumpte / to
which I am not bownde / nor leauinge for the relieff off the poor / off whom
such have had their portion in this blessinge for the time as I thought meet
to be relieved. Unto the Students whom I never placed there / I have performed
whar so ever I promised. The accoumpt off receiptes / paiments and remains
which ye require / I intend not to make unto you. But I shall be ready at all
times and in all places to make a just accoumpte off my whole dealinges in
this behalff unto them which have authority to demand it off me. In the
mean time / as I shall by gods help truly do my endeavor / to relieve the
poor as I shall have wherwithe and find them meet to receive it: So shall I
keep the names and sums secret as I am bownde / till by them which have
just authority to louse me I be otherwise appointed.

Thus I committ you to the grace off almighty god from Strasbrough this 20.
off June / Anno. 1557. Richard Chambers.


AFter I had written this answer to your first letters reteining them in my
hands until I might have a convenient Carior: I received your Second letters
the principal matters therein are answered before. To the rest that be any
thing material / thus I say. As touching the delay off mine answer you
call contempt more uncharitably then truly as unto godly wise men is well
known. As my departure was not / so my return to Franckfurt may not be at
your appointement. Your general accusations off misbehauiors and contemptes in
the which you say I am faulty / I admit no^ If you can justly charge me
with particulers / I shall make answer to the contentation off all godly
minds.

Where the discipline off Christ is used in just causes / it is to be
regarded but your unorderly abusinge off it / and against me that am not off
your church / I esteem not. Yff you use civil proffes against me / I sha^be
as ready to answer the cause as you to enter the suit. As for your displayinge
off me to our dispersed brethern to my undeserved dispraise in this matter
cannot be such but that I shall easily purge my self. As god knowethe who with
his holy spirit molifie your hearts and give you the unfeigned true sight off
your selves amen.

From Strasbrough the 30. off June 1557. Richard Chambers.

Delivered the 20. off July to M. John Hales by John Escot.

Now / Whiles these sharp and grievous contentions grew more and more at
Franckf. (as ye have hard) many things happened in other places which may
in this place be shortly touched / to the glory off god (I hope) and also / to
the great comfort off the godly / who may by the same / behold most
evidently the marvelous providence off God toward his poor afflicted and
dispersed church.

After that M. Bartue and the duchess of Sulff. were saffely arrived at Wezell
in Westphalia / the brute theroff was the cause that moo English people in
short time resorted thither. M. couerdale sent by the duke of bipont.
It pleased god also / that M Couerdale (after that he had bin with the king
of Denmark) should come to the same Town / who preached there no long time /
till he was sent for by woulgange duke off bypont / to take the pastoral
charge off Bargzaber / one off his Towns off Germany at whose coming to the
duke / he made it known / both to himselff and to other noble me^ abowte him
off M.B. and the duchess being in the low countries. They understanding /
the danger that might come unto them in those parts / as also calling to
remembrance / what great curteisie strangers had found in England at the
duchess hands: made offer that if they were forced to remove or otherwise if
it pleased them / The courtesy off the noble men off Germany to M. Bartuc and
the D. o^ Sulff.
they should have the Castle of Winchaim by Hedleberge within the liberties of
Otto Henricus the^ Palsgraue and a godly Prince / who most gladly (as well
appeared) gave consent to the same. M. Bartuc and the Duchess acceptinge this
offer / left Wezeli and came up to the said Castle / and there continued /
til leauinge Germany they traueled toward the land off Pole. The
congregation that was at Wezell wantinge among them / partly the comfort
which many off them had / by M. B. and my L. being there / and partly also
other reasonable considerations mouinge them they left Wezel and followed after:
But passinge by Franckf. and perceauinge the contention to be among them so
boilinge hott / that it ran over on both sides / and yet no fire quenched:
many had small pleasure to tarry there / but went to Basil and other places /
whiles M. Leauer made suit to the lords of Berna for a church with in their
dominions / whose letters he obtained with great favor to all their subjects
for the frindly entertainment off the English nation. These letters obtained
/ M. Leauer / M. Boys / M. Wilforde / M. Pownall and T. Vpchaier / came to
Geneua to have the advice off that church what was best to be done touching
the erection off a new church. They of Geneua / gave god thanks for that it
had pleased him so to incline the hearts off the lords off Berna toward them
and gave incourageme^t that they should not let slyppe so good an occasion. M.
I. Bodliegh (who was no small stay as well to that church as to others) and
W. Ke. he traueiled with them. And passinge thorough many parts of the L. of
B. dominion in Sauoy and Switzerland / they found such favor in all places
where they came / as verelie may be to the great condemnation off all such
English men as use the godly stranger (I mean those who come for religion) so
discourteously.

M. Leauer and the company at lenght chose Arrow for their restinge place /
English men placed at Arrow.
where the congregation lived together in godly quietness among themselves
with great favor of the people among whom for a time they were planted.

Horn and Chambers come to geneua.
Not long after this / Master Horn and master Chambers came by Arrowe to
Geneua / seminge at that time to like very well off those congregations / (as
the church of Frank. also then did as apearethe by their letters before) in so
much as the said Master Horn and Chambers / did distribute larglie to the
necessity of those churches. So that it appeared that the old grudge which
had bin between the church off Franck. and Geneua had bin clean forgotten.

It came to pass not many days after / that the lord began to show mercy
unto England in remouinge Queen Mary be death / and placinge the queens
majesty that now is (whom god long preserve) in the seat / the news whereof
/ as it was joyful to all such as were in exile / So it appeared that the
church off Geneua was not behind the rest / who / (after that they had given
to god hearty thanks for his great goodness) consulted among themselves and
concluded / that (for so much as there had been iarres between them and other
churches / about the Book off common prayer and ceremonies) it was now
expedient and necessary not only that unfeigned reconciliation should be
between them but also that they might so join together in matters off religion
and Ceremonies / that no Papist or other enemy should take hold or advantage
by a farther dissension in their own country / Kethe sent into Germany and
Hel^^ia.
which might arise in time to come / yff it were not in time foreseen and
prevented. To this end was William kethe / one off the congregation chosen to
do this message / to them off Arrowe / Basil / Strasbrough / Worms /
Franckford etc. And to them off Arrowe and Francford this letter was written
which folowith and subscribed by the ministry in the name off the whole
congregation.

The Copy off the letter written the 15. off December.
The Father of mercies and god of all consolation confirm and increase you in
the love off his son Jesus Christ / that being in the conduite off the lion
off the tribe off Judah / ye may be victorious / against Satan and Antechriste
to the ouerthrowinge off Papistrie and error / and establishinge of Christ's
glorious kingdom.
AFter that we heard (dearly beloved) of the ioiful tiding^ off Gods favor
and grace restored unto us by the preferment off the most verteous and
gracious Queen Elizabethe: We lyfted up our hearts and voices to our heavenly
father / who has not only by his dew providence norished us in our
banishement / preserved us / and as it were / carried us in his wings / but
also hard our prayers granted our requests / pitied our country and
restored his word. So that the greatness off this marvelous benefit ouercomethe
our Judgments and thoughts how to be able worthily to receive it and to give
thanks for the same. And when we had with great comfort wayed the matter /
to the intent that we might at the least show our selves mindful off this
most wonderful and undeserved grace / we thought among other things how we
might best serve to gods glory in this work and Vocation off fartheringe the
gospel off our savior Jesus Christ. And because / all impedimentes and
cauillacions off adversaries might be removed / it seemed good to have your
godly counsel and brotherly conference herein / which we desire to learn by
this bearer our louinge brother kethe / that we might all join hearts and
hands together in this great work / wherein no dowte we shall find many
adversaries and stays. Yet / if we (whose suffraunce and persecutions are
certain signs off our sound doctrine) hold fast together it is most
certain / that the enemies shall have less power / offenses shall sooner be
taken away / and religion best proceade and florishe.

For what can the papiste wish more then that we should dissent one from an
other / and in steed off preachinge Jesus Christ and profitable doctrine / to
contend one against an other / either for superfluous Ceremonies or other
like trifles from the which god off his mercy has delivered us. Therefore /
bear brethern / we beseech you (as we dowt^ not but your godly judgments will
think it so best) that what so ever offense has been heretofore either taken
or given: it may so cease and be forgotten that hereafter god lay it not to
our charges yff thereby his blessed word should be any thing hindered. And as
we for our parts freely remitt all offenses and most entirely embrace you
our dear brethern / So we beseech you in the lord that unfeignedly you will
do the like on your behalff wheroff albeit / we assure our selves / as both
by* good experience we have proved / and also have received by your letters:
yet ^ to cut off all occasions from Papists and other cauillors / we thought
it best to renew the same amity / and to confirm it by these our letters.
Most earnestly desiringe you that we may altogether teach and practice that
true knowledge off Gods word / which we have learned in this our banishment
and by gods merciful providence / seen in the best reformed churches: That
consideringe our negligence in times paste and gods punishemente for the
same / we may with zeele and diligence endeavor to recompense it / that god
in all our doings may be glorified / our consciences discharged and the
members off Jesus Christ releued and comforted. The which thing the lord god
who has mercifully visited and restored us grant and perform. To whom be
all honor / praise / and glory for ever and ever.

The Answer returned from Franck. by W. Kethe.
The grace off god and the assistaunce off the holy ghost lighten and
strengthen you to the understanding and constant reteining of his truth / to
the fartheraunce off his honor and glory and to the edifinge and maintenance
off his church in Christ Jesus our lord.
Dearly beloved / as your letters were most welcome unto us / both for that
ye rejoice at the preferme^t off our godly queen / and al^o tha^ y^ study
how to promote the glory off god: So are w^ right sorry that they came not
before the departure off such as ye seek a charitable reconciliatio^ with all.
For where as ye require that all such offenses as have been given and taken
between you and us may be forgotten hereafter: there be not here paste four
left / which were then present when ye dwelt here and not one off the learned ^
sort sauinge M. Beesley. Yet / we dowte not / but as they promised in their
former letters / to forget all displeasures before conceived / so they will
perform the same and esteem you as their brethern. And for our parts / as
we have had no contention with you at all before time: so we purpos not (as we
trust there shall be no cause) to enter into contention with you hereafter. For
ceremonies to co^tende (where it shall lie neither in your hands or ours to
appoint what they shall be but in such men's wisdoms as shall be appointed
to the d^uising off the same and which shall be received by common consent off
the parliament) it shall be to small purpos. But we trust that both true
religion shall be restored / and that we shall not be burdened with
unprofitable ceremonies. And therefore / as we purpos to submit our selves to
such orders as shall be established by authority / being not of themselves
wicked / so we would wish you willingly to do the same. For where as all the
reformed churches differ among them selves in diverse ceremonies / and yet
agree in the unity of doctrine: we se no in conuenience if we use some
ceremonies diverse from them / so that we agree in the chief points of our
religion* notwithstanding / if any shall be intruded / that shall be offensive /
we / upon just conference and deliberation upon the same at our meetinge with
you in England (which we trust by gods grace will be shortly) will brotherly
join with you to be sewters for the reformation and abolishinge of the same.
In the mean season / let us with one heart and mind call to the almighty god
that off his infinite mercy / he will finishe and establishe that work that he
has begone in our country / and that we may all lovingly consent together
in the earnest settinge forth off his truth / that god may be known and
exalted / and his church perfectly builded up throwgh Christ our lord.

An Answer brought from the congregation off Arrow by W. Kethe.
The Father off mercies and God off all consolation confirm increase and
continewe you allwaie in the love off his son Jesus Christ our lord.
PRaised be God through our lord Jesus Christ which pulled down marie that
did persecute / and has set up the godly lady Elizabeth Queen off England
/ to restore and maintain there / the pure preachinge off his word. And for
that it has pleased god to move your good hearts / for the furtherance off
the same / with godly zeele and charitable desire by your letters / to show
unto us your advise and purpos and also to require ours to be returned and
sent unto you by our brother Kethe: We do with most hearty thanks unfeignedly
before god certify you / that to your counsel and conference with us / we do
consent willingly concerning your most godly request / for that we
acknowledge / that the same shall be to the advancement off his glory and
quietness off his church. Also / we desire you that as often as we may find
hereafter any occasion to consulte and confer by word or writing / that
then both you and we so take and seek the same as may be most to our unity
in minds / and diligence to do good in the lords work. And farthermore for
the forgettinge and puttinge away all occasions off offenses we do likewise
consent unto your good ensample and request / And so finallye for the
preachinge or professinge off sincere doctrine so as we have seen and learned
in the best reformed churches we do gladly hear your advise to be so agreeable
to our purpos that we beseech you to pray with us / that you and all we
together that be faithful may continewe / proceade / and prosper in godly
zeele / charitable concord and earnest diligence to honor and serve god and to
comfort and edify his elect all times and in every place and especially now
in England. O lord not unto us but unto they name be honor and praise for ever.

Now when as W. Kethe was returned to Geneua with answer from the
congregations and companies / that were dispersed in sundry places off Germany
and Heluetia / the congregation (after that they had rendered their humble
thanks to the magistrates for their great goodness toward them prepared
themselves to depart sauinge certain which remained behind the rest / to
wit to finishe the bible / and the psalms both in meeter and prose / which
were already begone / at the charges off such as were off most ability in
that congregation. And with what success those works were finished /
(especially the Bible) I must leave it to the Judgments off the godly learned
/ who should best Judge off the same.

But yff that Bible be such / as no enemy off god could justly find fault
with: then may men marvel that such a work / (being so profitable) should
find so small favor / as not to be printed again. Yff it be not faithfully
translated / then let it still find as little favor as it does because off
the inconveniences that a false translation bringes with it. The Ministers off
Geneua in an Epliste which they wrote / before the new Testament have these
words.

There is nothing more requisite to attain the right and absolute knowledge
off the doctrine off salvation / whereby to resist all herisie and falshod /
then to have the text off the Scriptures faithfully and truly translated / the
consideration wheroff moved them with one assent (as they say in that Epistle
to request 2. off their brethern / to wit / Calvin and Beza / efsonnes to
peruse the same notwithstanding their former trauells. Beza also in his
Epistle to the prince off condy and nobles of France has these words. Saying
then all these controversies must be discussed by Gods word / I suppose
that this thing ought chiefly to be provided for / that saying all cannot have
the knowledge to understand the word off God in these peculiar languages / the
Hebrew and the greek (which were to be wished) that there should be some true
and apt translation of the old and new testame^te made the which diverse
have already labored to bring to pass / but yet no man has hitherto
sufficiently performed it. For the old translation (whose so ever it is)
although it ought not to be condemned / yet is it found both obscure
imperfect and superfluous and also false in many places / to speak nothing
off an infinite variety off the copies. The which text therefore many learned
and godly men have labored to amend / but not with like success. And yet how
necessary a thing this is / who so ever shall read those most learned writers
off the gretians / and shall compare their interpretations (which are many
times far from the purpos) with the Hebrew verity / he shall confess it with
great sorrow.

And the same evil was not only hurtefull among the latten wri^^rs / but
also the ignorance off the greek tongue wherwit^ many off them were troubled /
whiles they did depend off the common translation / they oftimes seek a knott
in a rushe (according to the old proverb) and fell into most foul errors.
This cause therefore has moved me to compare most diligently the diversity
off copies / and to way the sentences and Judgments off the most part off
the learned men specially off them that this age has brought forth /
skillfull in the languages / who are moo in number dowteles and better learned
then the church has had since the time of the Apostles / and so ease them
some what that desire a more pure interpretation.

And that it might be done with more profit I have also added annotations / in
the which I have also compared together the diversity off interpetations and
as much as I could I have labored to make plain and evident the sense and
meaning off all the dark places / etc.

Thus far Beza / by whose Judgment and the rest ye se / that to have the holy
Scriptures truly and faithfully translated is a matter off no small
importance. Here might I touch a thing parhapp worth the hearing yff hope
were off redress / which is / that yff the learned were but one halff so
earneste zealous / and careful / to se that the holy Scriptures in this Realm
might be faithfully translated and truly corrected / as they are many times
abowte matters nothing so necessary: I would not dowte to say that they
should do unto god an excellent piece off service. For the most part off our
English Bibles are so ill translated (as the learned report) and so falsely
printed (as the simple may find) that such had need to be very well
acquainted with scripture / as in many places should get owte the true meaning
and sense. And it is high time to look unto this / consideringe / that in
most parts off this Realm preachers ye have none / nor any that can or will
preach (very few excepted) sauinge certain wanderers / amongst whom (and
specially in some sheers) are such ruffenly ^ak^helles / and common co^sen^ers
permitted and suffered / by whose preachings ^ the word off truth is become
odious / in the eyes off the people. Saying then (I say) that in most places
/ the ministry does stand and consiste of old popish preistes / tolerated
readers and many new made ministers / whose readinges are such / that the
people cannot be edified / especially / where one is tolerated to serve 2. or
3. churches and turninge their backs to the people. I leave to the
considera^ion off such (who have to deal in this matter) what great and
intolerable mischeiues may come more and more / (by suffringe such corrupted
Bibles in churches and else where) to the poor simple flock off Christ. But
now to draw to an end. ye se (brethern) by this brieff and short discourse /
that the grudge whereupon this dissension hangethe is paste the age off a child
/ and therefore may (withowte offense I hope) be called an old grudge / which
/ as it seems / was never yet thoroughly healed / as will more and more
appear / as this discourse shall be from time to time continued / till it be
brought even to this present time / which time verily / is so extreme as the
like has rarely bin hard off. For it is come to pass / that if any should
but with a godly grief bewail the imperfections that remain and crave for
redress: yea / but suspected / or should but by malice off an Atheist / a
Papist / or Epicure be presented: such are not only reviled and taunted /
skoffed at and termed by these odious names off precisian / puritain /
contentious / seditious / rebel / traitor and what not: but also yff he come
once in presence off the Bishopps / and subscribe not to what so ever they will
/ then / (if he have living) to be deprived / or whither he have living or
not / be he learned or unlearned / be he man or woman / halt or blind / to
prison he must / withowte all redemption.

I will not say that (in the mean time) such as are turn coats and can
change with all seasons / subscribinge to what so ever / and can cap it can
cope it an curry for advantage / that such / I say / how ignorant / how
vicious / and ungodly so ever they be / live at their ease in all pleasure and
in some place are thought to be most meet men for the ministry. But this I
may be bold to affirm / that / (although in very deed I neither do nor dare
condemn certain godly persons / who off infirmity / but yet with most
sorrowful and heavy hearts (as has well appeared by their most lamentable
protestations with plenty off tears to their congregations) have yielded to
more then expedient it were they should / (prayinge the lord to let them se it
in time) yet / it may not only be said / but proved too I trust / that
neither is subscribinge allwaies a sure note off good subject nor yet the
refusal dew proffes off a rebel.

The greatest Traitors and rebels that godly King Edward had in the weste
parts / were priests / and such as had subscribed to the book or what so ever
by law was then in force / but for all their subscribings / there was no
skirmishe / where some off those subscribers left nor their karkaises in the
filde against god and their prince. Plumtree and his fellow priests off the
north / I dowte not but they were conformable and applyable to all orders and
never staggered at subscriptions. But for all that / time tried their
traitorous hearts.

But in all the sturres which have happened either since the Queens
majesty came to the crown or before I have not hard off so m^che as one
(minister or other) that has lifted up his hand against her majesty or state
/ whom it pleases the envious and malicious man / to term precision / and
puritain in great despite and contempt. In deed / this have I found out and
learned / that even such as must be co^tente and patiently bear those odious
names of puritan precisian / traitor / and rebel / have yet bin the men / who
most faithfully (in their calling) have served the queens majesty and their
country both with in the realm and with owte the realm in Garnison and in
filde / hazardinge their bodies against hargabuze and cannon / when as those
who now so furiously charge them both owte off pulpits and other places durst
not or at least would not in any such service off the prince and country be
seen. For proffe hereoff / yff you call to remembrance / who hazardid his
liffe with that old / Honorable Earl off Bedford when as he was sent to subdue
the popish rebels off the weste / you shall find that none off the clergy
were hasty to take that service in hand / but only old father Couerdale.
When most likelode was off danger between the Sko^^s and us / the preacher
to the souldiars was first Master Sampson / and afterward Master Greshopp
when as the right honorable Earl off Bedford that now is had there the charge.
The Earl off warwick at his being in Newhauen / had in deed with him certain
Ministers for a time / but after that the Cannon came and began to roar / and
the plage off pestilence so terriblie to rage / then (I ween) not a Minister
there left / but Master Kethe alone. And when as means were made to have mo
Ministers over / to aid the said Kethe (who had so much to do / what with
preaching / and visitinge the poor sick Souldiars which were in no small
nombers) there could not be found (as that right noble Earl can upon his
honor testify so much as one which could be brought to somuche comformitie
/ as to subscribe to any such service off the Queens Majesty.

When S* Henry Sidney had to do with the Popish rebels pff Ireland. Master
Christop. Goodman showed his faithful diligence in that service. When the Earl
off warwick was sent to subdue the popish rebels in the north-partes / the
preachers off the Queens majesty's Army were Kethe / Temes / and standon who
offered themselves in that service voluntarily with owte all constraynte. And
thus it is euidente / that these with a number moo who are now so ill thought
off / as if they were traitors and rebels / have yet been so far off from
bring sedicious / that they have at all times adventured their lives against
seditious persons and rebels / when as such as now so hardly charge them
both by word and writing / have been right heartily well content / to take
their ease and rest at home.

Consideringe then / how many ways we are unjustly burdened and brought into
hatred withowte just cause / I supposed / that no godly man would be offended
/ yff by such lawful means as I might / I sought both to purge my selff and
the rest off my brethern / from such heinous and odious crimes as some would
seem to charge us. And that could I not do so well any way / as by the
gatheringe together off this discourse / wherein the indifferent reader shall
find / that the religion which we hold and profess / is not only the true
and sincere religion of Christ / and the self same with all the reformed
churches in Christendom / but also that which this Realm has established /
touching the true doctrine commonly taught therein. By this discourse also / yt
may be seen / both when / where / how / and by whom this controversy first
began / who continued it / who was on the suffering side and who readieste to
forget and forgive / that godly peace and concord might be had. Now / if any
shall seem to be offended with this that I had don / I do most humbly
beseech them / to way well and expende with themselves / first / whither I
have given them any such cause / yff it be for that I have in this discourse
brought to light some thing that might have bin keept secret / (the contention
being among brethern) to the end the common enemy should not have cause to
triumph; let this satisfy them: first / that the wicked and common enemy
cannot (for his heart) more tryumphe over the Godly then he does already and
that through owte this whole realm. Again / the cruelty off Cain to Abell /
off Ismaell to Isaac / off Esau to Jacob / off the Patriarchs to their brother
Joseph / the hot contention between Paul and Barnabas and Paul and Peter
etc. all these being known / to the world has turned notwithstanding to
the great glory off God / as my assured hope is that even this will also in
the end.

And therefore / as the lord off heaven knows that the keepinge off these
things almost by the space off these twenty years in secret / might suffice
to witness with me that I had now no great pleasure to utter it / so I wot not
how it commethe to pass that even in the midst off great striving / and
struglinge with my selff what to do / I could not be by any means resolved
/ or se just cause / why I should any longer conceal it.

Yff any should think that I have not with indifferency / penned the story:
I refer me (to satisfy such) to the judgments and consciences off those
persons / who were the plaiers off this tragedy / (off both parts many yet
living) assuringe my selff that neither part shall be able justly to charge
me / except it be for that in very deed I have sought rather how to cover
many things / then to lay them wide open to the world / as I nothing dowte
to prove if I might be but hard indifferently / in so much as in this
discourse I have (as much as I could) passed over the names off all where
credit might seem to have bin impaired thereby (saving only off such as were
off very necessity to be noted for the better understanding off the history.

To conclude: against the offenses which some may take at these my trauells
/ I have set the great profit that this may bring to gods church and to
the posterity / who being taught by other men's harms (yff they be happy)
will learn to beware the hope wheroff had greater force to pushe my pen
forward to the finishinge off this work / then the displeasures off certain
(arisinge so far as I se off no grownd) could be to withdraw me from the
same. besechinge almighty god so strenghe^ me with his holy spirit / that
what troubles or trialls so ever shall by the lords good providence happen to
me hereby / he will vouchsaffe to give me a contented mind quietly and with
patience to bear it / before whom I proteste / that in wrytinge this discourse
I have had respect to his glory / the defense off his sacred truth / the
cleeringe / so far as I might / off so many excellent learned men (on whose
necks this stir is laid as authors off the same) and not that I have
willingly sought the hurt / hinderance / or discredit off any man.

And this I / Phi^
pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all
Judgment that ye may discern things that differ one from another / that ye
may be pure and withowte offense until the day off Christ Keep the true
pattern off the wholesome words which thou haste hard of me in faith and
love which is in Christ Jesus. ^. Tim. ^.
Study to show thy selff approved unto god a workman that nedethe not to be

The answer off the ministers off Geneua to certain brethern off the church
off England concerning some controversy in the Ecclesiastical policy.
Being right earnestly and often required by certain dear brethern off the
church off England that we would in their miserable state give them some
kind off counsel whereon their consciences might be stayed / the Judgment
off many being therein diverse: we did long differ the satisfinge off their
requests upon weighty causes. And we assure the reader that eue^ now also
we most gladly would houlde our peace / were it not a matter of conscience
to reiecte the suit of the brethern so often enforced and with most grievous
groninges reneued. Off which stifned silence off ours these were the causes /
first / as on the one part we dowte not off the credit off the brethern / as
though they had not sincerely described the state off the cause unto us / so
on the other side it is most hard for to suspecte such things / so clean
besides all office off Bishopps much less persuade our selves the same by
such personages done.

And farther / what men are we that we should determine upon such causes.
Also / if it were lawful for us either by authority / or else by consent or
request of either parties / to give sentence here upon / yet were yt a matter
most wrongefull either party not hard or not present to determine. Last off
all fear mistrusted least so great a mischieff should by this our counsel
(how simple so ever it is) rather become raw the^ skin^ed: it being a sore
of so desperate a nature / as that it seems to be / that prayers and patience
can only salve the same.

Saying then / that by the sundry requests off the brethern / we are so hardly
persuaded / that off force we ought to give them some kind off advise: We do
openly proteste / that we so give to same herein as those that will not in any
wise prejudice the other party / much less chalinge to us a iusticiers room
over any. And all those men (into whose hands these do come) we do in the
lord desire / that they be not herewith offended / but do persuade themselves
that these contents are both simply and faithfully written off us as upon a
questioned cause granted / that the consciences off the brethern which desire
it / might some way be better apeased / which to set altogether at naught
were a deed wholi^ void off charity.

Therefore / the cause standinge as we ar^ informed / we profess plainly and
in Good faith that our Judgments over these questions are thus.

It is demanded / whither we can approve this disorder in calling off men to
the function off the Ministry / which is / that the multitude off those
which sue for order shall be enrolled in the ministry both withowte the
voices off elders and also no certain cure appointed them but lightly examined
off their lives and behavior / to whom also / at the lust of the Bishop
shall liberty be given afterward to preach the word off god for a time
prescribed / otherwise to rehearse only the church service.

We answer / that such callinges off Ministers / whither we answer them by
the rule off Gods express word^ or else by force off Cannons that are best
tried and allowed are holden and esteemed of us / altogether unlawful / abeit
we know that it is better to have half a loffe then no bread. But we beseech
god with our whole hearts that it also will please him to bestow upon the
kingdom off England also the same (that is) a lawful and ordinary calling
off men to the ministry of the word and Sacraments. For it being either
kept owte or hindered / the benefit of the doctrine of truth must of force by
and by vanishe away or else be hold up by some means that is strange / yea /
altogether ghostly and supernatural.

Furthermore / we do in Gods most holy name most humbly sue to the princes
sovereign majesty / that with the whole force off her mind / she endeavor
the correction off this point wherein the whole ground and stay of the church
off England and therefore of the Realm also / does stand and persiste.

And thirdly we do with tears beseech both those high personages that are of
her majesty's honorable counsel / and those which have succeeded in the place
off the popish Bishopps / (undoubtedly through the special mercy off the high
and Good god) that they owte off the selff same place where overthrow and
destruction did issue / they should utterly destroy that tyra^nye which has
thus cast down headlonge the very Christian church and we crave of them in
the dreadful name of god before whose redouted throne of judgment we all shall
be arested that with all consideration and mindfullnes of the years paste and
conscience of their dewtie and charge / they will not slack to vow and
be^^othe the^r whole diligence / as well in orderinge the means that may
acco^p^^^he this thing as in perswadinge the Queens majesty thereto / and that
they cease not at all this thing being vnacheued / cheflie / saying god has
bestowed upon them / the princely majesty off so singular a Mistress as from
whose hands they can not but hope for all princely and excellent things /
unless they list in their own case to fail themselves. But some will ask /
how shall we do in this point / until then: verily if the case were ours
we would not receive this ministry upon these conditions if it were
proffered: a great deal less would we sue for it. Notwithstanding / we
exhort these men to whom god has by this way made entrance to the enlarging
off the glory off his kingdom that in the fear off god they do courageously
abide therein / yet with the condition that it may be lawful for them holily
and regiliously to exercise all their whole ministry. And therefore may also
propounde / and urge those things in their cures which do allwaies apperteine
to the advancement off the better estate therein. For otherwise / if they be
forced of this liberty and so willed to wink at manifest abuses / that they
should also approve these things which dowtlesse ought to be redressed: what
thing else can we persuade them then that they should retire from this / to
their private lyffe rather then without conscience to norishe that mischief
which does off force draw whith it the whole wastinge and decaie of all the
congregation? Yet we hope that the Queens highness and so many honorable and
good men will in such sort plant their diligence that rather privilege off
liberty may be granted to the consciences of so many godly and learned
brethern then that these horrible eue^^s should follow: To were / that the
pastors off the flocks should be constrained either against the soundnes off
their consciences to do that which is evil (and so to be chained in other
men's sins / or else to resign their ministry / for that third necessity
that will ensue this which is / that against the princes and Bishops wills
they shou^^ exercise their office) we do so much the more tremble at /
because of those reasons which off themselves are plain enoughe / albe^t we
do not utter them.

It is also desired off us to answer plainly and truly whither we do allow
the distinction ordained in the wearinge off copes and garments as well for the
common use / as for the ministry.

We therefore do flattlie answer the cause standinge as we do understand /
that those men that are authors hereoff do deserve most evil off the church
and shall answer at the dreadful bar off Christ his Judgment For although
that we think that that politic order whereby not citezins alone / but also
the degrees off functions are marked and noted is not to be discommended wholly
at all: yet we are off opinion that not every mark and note is straight way
to be used. For put the case that the ministers were commanded to wear the
pied coat off a fool or the garmente off a vice in a play / were it not
manifest skorninge off the ministry so to do? And those that use these other
garments and aparrell commanded / do seem verily to us to trespass somewhat
worse then so / because that the lord has not only reared and set us this
priestlike apparel as a toie to be laughe at even off many off the Papists
themselves: But it is also certain / that the same is poluted and defiled with
infinite superstition. But some men will plead the antiquity theroff. Surely
they are old / and yet the Apostolic symplicitie wherein the church did
florishe / is a great deal more ancient then this. Also / yff it please him
to wade yet further to search abowte these matters / it shall be easy enough
to show that these things / which after that / did serve for the note and
mark off the ministry were first usual among the people and common. And
therefore whence commethe it / things being altered after so long a season /
that this foreign and strange guise should be retained.

Does it not come off a zeele both evil and unprofitable* But some man will
say: These things for all that are things off the middle sort and
indifferent. We grant in deed that they are such yff your will consider them
simply and in their own nature / and aparte from all circumstances* but who
are they that will so way and consider them For these m^n that are yet
Papists / what purpos so ever this civil law does pretend / are surely by
these means established deeper in this superstition which has so ouergrowen
them. And these men that began so earnestly to abhor superstition / that
they now did deteste monime^tes and relics theroff: How much are they
offended and wounded herein. As for those which are further / and better
learned / what fruit reap they theroff. And farther is this difference and
mark off the functions of such importance / that therefore the consciences
off so many should be troubled* especially saying the reason and purpos thereof
newly set a broche is but drawn even from those that are themselves the
manifest sworn enemies to sound doctrine? What means it also / that off
those also that are termed to be Ecclesiastically brought up and are in the
ministry not the smalleste part / are said to have their papistrie in their
breasts abowte with them? Is this the good hour wherein they shall better
profit by restoringe off this attire? or shall they not rather vaunte their
crestes as in hope to have popery restored again? If any shall obiecte the
circumsinge off Timothy and other like examples: we right earnestly pray him
to consider what Paul would have said yff any man should have made this law
/ that every man that is in the ministry off the gospel shall be constrained
to wear the garments off the Pharisees / or that they in the apparel off
profane priests should preach the gospel and administer the Sacraments /
and not only circumcise their children / nowithstandinge that under some
color of reason / this civil commandment might setfoorthe the same. yea to
what end are these things brought in. for how so ever they might at the first
be tolerated till that by little and little they might be taken away / yet
being once removed owte off the churches / we se not with what commodity
they can be restored to their possession again. Therefore we do eftsonnes
repeat that we before said / that we can not allow this devise nor yet hope
for any good to ensue theroff Notwithstanding / we will gladly give over this
opinion yff we shall learn better reason therefore. What then (will the brethern
say on whom these things are so thrown (judge you what we ought to do
herein? we answer / that there nedethe in this answer a distinction. For the
case off the ministers and the case of the people are not all one herein.
Furthermore: Many things may / yea / and ought to be borne and tolerated
which are notwithstanding not justly commanded. first therefore / we answer
/ that albeit these things (as we judge) are not rightly restored to their
possession in the congregations / yet / saying that they are not off those
kind of things which are of their own nature impious and ungodly / they
seem to us not to be off such weight that the shepardes should rather give
over their functions then receive the apparel / or that the flock should refuse
the public food of the soul rather then to receive the same from the
shepardes / that is appareled herein: only / that as well the sheaphardes as
their flocks may not sin against there consciences (so that the purity
off doctrine it selff remain untouched) we do persuade the ministers / after
they have both before the queens highness and also before the Bishopps. set
their consciences at liberty by modeste protestation (as does apperteine to
such Christians as seek not sedition and tumulte) and yet grave according to
the importance of the cause / that they do in deed openly in their parish /
still beat upon those things / that may serve to the utter taking away off
the stumblinge block. And that as God shall give occasion they will wholly
give them selves both wisely and meekely to correct all those abuses / but
yet to bear those things which they cannot straight way change / rather
then forsakinge their congregation they should give occasion to Satan / that
sekethe nothing else to stir up greater and more perilous mischiefs then
these. As for the people (the doctrine remaining unhurt) we do exhort them
that for all these things they will diligently hear the same / to use the
Sacraments Religiously / and so long to groan to God with earnest amendment
off liffe until they obtain off them that which does appertain to the full
redress and amendment off the church.

But again yff that the Ministers be commanded not only to tolerate these
things / but also that they shall with their subscriptions allow them as
lawful / or else by their stillnes foster them: what can we else persuade them
to do but that having witnessed their innocence and in the fear off the
lord tried all means / they should give over their functions to open wrong.
But our hearts betide us off England much better things then these
extremities.

Y^ is demanded off us what we do Judge off the trollinge and descantinge off
the Psalms / crossinge off those babes that shall be baptized / and off the
demaundes in baptism / also off the rownd unleavened waffercake and knelinge
in the lords supper.

We answer / that kind off singinge semethe to be the corruption off the pure
ancient church service and glorifinge of God therein. And as for crossinge off
babes / whatsoever practice there has been theroff in time of old / yet is it
most certain that it is truly in these dais through so late greenesse off
the superstition so most abominable / as that we judge those men to have done
assuredly well that have once driven this rite owte off the congregation whereof
also we se not what the profit is. And we dowte not but the demau^ds in
baptism have creapt into the church upon this occasion / because that through
the negligence of the bishops the same form of baptizinge of children was
retained which at the first rearing of the primative church / was to be used
at the baptizinge off those that being off years did enter the profession off
Christ. This thing also we may perceive by many the like yet in use in the
popish baptism. Wherefore even as the cream and charm used in baptism are
by gods law abolished although they were ancient / so wish we also these
demaundinges / being not only vain but folishe should be also passed over
albeit that S. Augustine himselff does seem in an Epistle off his to sustein
it by certain devised construction.

The bread whither it ought to be made with leven or withowte we think it not
greatly to be striuen for / although we Judge it more fit and consonant with
Christ's institution to have the bread at the commmunion / which is used at
the common table: for why did the lord use unleavened bread / because that in
that hour wherein he thought good to institute his holy supper / not one man
in all Iewrie used any other. Therefore / it behooves us to restore the Iewishe
feast off unleavened bread or else must it be granted that is better to use
the common and accustomed bread off all tables according to the example off
Christ / notwithstanding that the bread that he then took was unleavened: For
off the practice off the primative church which the Greek church does yet
in this behalff retain we over pass to write off.

Furthermore knelinge at the very receypt off the sacrament has in it a
show off Oodly and Christian reverence and might therefore in times paste be
used with profit / yet for all that because owte off this fountain the
detestable use off bread worship did follow / and does yet in these days
stick in many minds / it semethe to us that it was justly abolished owte from
the congregations. Therefore / we do beseech the most Good and great God that it
would please him to instruct both the Queens majesty's highness and also
the Bishopps with such devise as shall be most needful for the perfect doing
owte off these filthes / and that at once. In the mean time / because these
things / also are not such as are in their own nature Idolatrous we do Judge
that they ought so to be dealte with / as we have advised in the things goinge
next before.

It is demanded off us whether we allow that baptism which is administered
by midwiues.

We answer that not only we dissalowe that baptism as the rest off things
before spoken off / but that we do judge it also intolerable. For it is a
thing that has risen as well of ignorance of the very use of baptism / as
the public ministry of the church. We Judge therefore that the ministers
are bownde sharply to rebuke this abuse / much less ought they to hold this
false baptism / for good and firm. The reason why / the leened on our side
have often declared. And we are also ready when it shall be needful to declare.

It is also reported unto us that the kaies off bindinge and losinge are
practiced in certain courts off the Bishops / neither by the sentences and
judgments off elders / which office that church has not yet received / nor
according to the word off God: but the authority off certain lawiers and
other like / which is more / often times by the authority off some one man /
and that also for such kind off actions as are pure money matters even as the
misuse off the same was in popery.

Whereto we answer that it semethe to us almost incredible that any such
customs and examples (being most perverse) should be used in that kingdom /
where as purity and soundnes off doctrine is. For the right off
excommunication and byndinge off the offender shall be found never to have bin
before the time of the Papists in the power and hand off on^ sole person /
but did apperteine to all the whole eldershipp / from which also the people
themselves were not rashly shut owte. Because this also the lawierlike
hearing off suites that appertain to liuinges did fall to the Bishops charge
altogether through abuse. For that place wherein the Apostle talks off days
men vmpires at Corinth is to no purpose where as the magistrate is a Christian:
nor did the Apostell ever think to burden the Eldershipp with the hearing off
such mere civil causes. And it is most certain / that the Bishopps off the
elder age off the church / have had the determining off such controversies not
for any authority that they had therein but through the importunity off
suitors / and that as howsolders vmpires and days men Also / notwithstanding
among those men where this were showed unto / those did most wisely govern
themselves which chose rather to follow the example off Christ our Savior /
who refused to be the vmpire in deuidinge off the patrimony / or else Judge in
the matter off adultery / when both the same were preferred unto him.

Therefore / yff in England any thing be done contrary to this / surely we
ought to think that by such sentences and Judgments / there is not any man
before god any more bownde then by the popish excommunications. And we wische
that this torment house off consciences and loathsome profanation off the
Ecclesiastical and mere spiritual jurisdiction might by the authority off
the Queens Majesty owte off hand be abolished no otherwise then the marringe
off the very doctrine it selff. And that Eldershippe and Deacons may be
restored and set up according to the word off God and cannons off the pure
church / which thing / yff it be not done / verelie / we are sore afraid
that this only thing will be the begin^inge off many calamities / which we
would god / would turn away from us. For it is most certain that the son
off god will one day from heaven roughly revenge these manifest abuses /
wherewith the consciences off our brethern are troubled / except spedely /
redress be had therein.

In the mean whiles / the things which are not well done by the one party /
may be well enoughe tolerated (as we think) by those men which bear the
thing which they can not change. Yet thus far: as that they allow not the
thing it selff for good / but do only redeem their unjust disquieting by
patience. But yff so be that they shall be forced / not only to tolerate this
facion but also to approve this excommunication as lawful and be constrained
to ask unlawful absolution to assent to this manifest abuse / we then exhort
them that they will rather suffer any kind off trouble then to do herin
against their consciences. But to what end is all this: For verily / we do
promise our selves much better things then these / yea / off all things the
best even at this pinche / especially off that Realm in which / the
restoringe off Christian Religion has been sealed and confirmed with the blood
of so many excellent martirs also. Only / we fear this / least that which
has befallen so many countries should happ^n to England / to wit / least /
because the due fruits off repentance are not brought forth / the angry god
should dooble our darkness / the light of his gospel being first taken from
us. Off this content are our daily preachings in our congregations / and
verily / we think the same ought to be done off a^^ Ministers off Gods word
especially in these our days. That they chiesty set forwards this principle
off the gospel which does apperteine to earnest amendment off lyffe. For
this point achiued / undoubtedly the lord shall give both counsel and zeal
and all things else which do necessarely apperteine to the accompishement off
the reparation off the church / already begone. And before all we do require
and with tears humbly crave that our good and right worshipful in the lord
the brethern off the English churches / all bitterness off mind set aparte /
which we surely fear / after what sort it has on either side forced this
evil / would patiently bear and suffer each other / so long as purity off
Christian doctrine it selff and soundnes off conscience does remain:
Willingly to obaye the Queens Majesty who is full off compassion: And all
other prelates. And finally / that with all concord minds in the lord / of
they manly set against Satan / who sekethe all occasion of tumulte and
infinite calamities: yea / although they have not like judgment of all sort
off prealaets at the first. for this our writing / god is our witness /
does not te^de to this purpos / that either part should use it against other as
that we should send it to you as an apple of contention: Although we have
concerning these matters declared our Judgments / even symplie / as upon a
supposed case / (god is our witness) being euercome with the continual suit
off our brethern. And we join our daily prayers to the groninges off all
the godly on that side the seas / that it may please the most merciful god
having compassion on man's frailty / to direct the Queens highenes / and
all the nobles off the realm off England. Also every prelate / and finally /
each workman off this spiritual buildinge with his holy spirit most
effectuously / so as the work off the lord so often begone and so often
stayed may luckely be set forward to the great quietness and concord off all
men not only the old stains in the docrine it self and Ecclesiastical
discipline also / being at lenght utterly done owte / but also all
monstrousnes off errors and which Satan newly sekethe to bring into the
church again driven away. Which vouchesaffe to bring to pass through his
holy spirit / the most kind father in Jesus Christ / his very son
eternal and consubstantiall with him / in which persons / we profess one
god / and not diverse / ought to he worshipped for ever.

A Copy off the letter sent to the Bishopps and Pastors off England / who
haith renunced the Roman Antichriste and profess the lord Jesus in
sincerity.
The Superintendent Ministers / and commissionars off charges within the Realm
off Skotland:
To their brethern the Bishopps and Pastors off England / who haith renunced
the Roman Antechriste / and do profess with them the lord Jesus in
sincerity / desire the parpetuall increase off the holy spirit.
BY word and writ it is come to our knowl^dge (reverend Pastors that diverse
off our dearest brethern) amongst whom are some off the best learned within
that Realm / are depriu^^ from Ecclesiastical function and forbidden to
preach / and so by you that they are staie^ to promote the kingdom off Jesus
Christ / bicaus their consciences will not suffer to take upon them (at the
commandment off the authority) such garments as Idolatres in time off
blindes have vse^ in their Idolatry / which brute cannot be but most
dolorous to our hearts / mindful off that sentence off the Apostel / sainge /
yff ye byt and devour one an other / take head least ye be consumit one off
an other. We purpose not at this present to enter into the grownd off that
question whil^e we hear off / ^ither part to be ag^tate with gre^^er
vehemency then well likes us to wit. Whidder that such apparel is to be
coumpted amongs things that are simply indifferint or not / but in the
bowels off lord Jesus we crave the Christian charity may so prevail in you
/ in you we say / the pastoris and leaders off the flock within that Realm.

That ye do not to others that / which you would not others should do to
you. Ye cannot be ignorant how ^ende^ a thing the conscience off man is. All
that have knowledge are not a like perswadet. your consciences reclames not a^
wearinge off such garments / but many thousants both godly and lernet are
otherwise perswadet whose consciences are continually stricken with these
sentences: what haith Christ Jesus to do with beliall? what feloshipp is
their betw^xt darkness and lic^t? yff surplese / corner capp / and tippet have
been badges off ydolatres in the very act off their ydolatrie / what haht the
preachers off Christian liberty and the open rebuker off all superstition to
do with the dregs off the romish beast? Our brothern that off conscience
refusse that unprofitable apparel / do neither damn your nor molest you that
use such vain tryfles. if ye shall do the like to thaim / we dowte not but
thairin ye ^all pleese god and conforte the hearts of many whilke are wonded
with extremity / which is used against those godly and our beloved brethern.
Color off rethorik or manly persuasion will we use none / but charitab^^^ we
desire you to call that sentence off pity to mind: feed the flock off God
which which is committed to your charge caringe for them not by constranit but
willingly not as though ye were lords over goddis heritage / but that ye may
be examples to ye flock. And farther also / we desire you ^o meditate that
sentence off the Apostle / saing: give none offense / neither to the Jews nor
to the Grecians nor to the church off God? In what condition off time ye and
we both trauiel^ in the promoting off Christ's kingdomm we suppose you not to
be ignorant. And therefore / we are more bold to exhort you to walk more
circumspectly / then that for such vanities / the godly should be troubled.
For all things that may seem lawful / edify not. Yff the commandment off
authority urge the conscience off yours and our brethern more then they can
beer: we vnfenedlye crave off you / that ye remember that ye are callit the
licht off the world and the earth.

All civil authority has not the licht off God allwaies schin^^ge before
their eyes in the statutes and commandments / but their affections of times
savor to much off the earth and off wordly wisdom.

And therefore / we think that ye should baldlie oppone your selff to all pouer
that will or dare extol the selff not only against / God but also against all
such as do burden the consciences off the faithful farther then god hes
burthenit them / by his own word. But here in / we confess our offense in
that we have entered farther in reasoninge then we we purposet / an promiset at
the beginning. And therefore / we shortly return to our former humble
supplication / which is / that our brethern who amongs you refuse the Romish
rags / may find off you the prelatis such favors as our heid and master
commandis every one off his members to show one to an other / whilke we luck
to resaue of your gentleness / not only for that ye seer to offend Gods
majesty / in troubling off your brethern for such vane triffles. But also /
because ye will not refuse the humble requests off us your brethern and fellow
preachers off Christ's Jesus / in whom / albeit their appear no great wordly
pomp / yet we suppose you will not so far despise us / but that ye will
esteem us to be off the number off those that fight against that Romain
Antechriste / and traueil that the kingdomme off Christ Jesus universally may
be mainteened and auanced. The days are evil. Iniquity abownds. Christian
charity (alas) is waxin cold. And therefore we ought the more diligently to
watch. For the hour is uncertain when the lord Jesus shall appear / before
whom we your brethern and ye may give an accoumpt off our administration.

And thus in conclusion / we once again crave favor to our brothern which
granted / ye in the lord shall command us in things off dooble more
importance. The lord Jesus rewle your hearts in his true fear to the end.
And give unto you and unto us victory over that coniured enemy off all true
Religion* To wit / over that Roman Antechriste / whose wonded he^d Satan by
all man's lab^ris to cure again / but to destruction shall he and his
mainteiners go / by the power off the lord Jesus. To whose mighty power and
protection we heartily committ you.

Subscribet by the hands off Superintendentes one part off Ministers / and
scribet in our general assemblies and fourth session theroff.

THus have yon hard in these.2. letters / the Judgments off those excellent
churches of the french and the Skottishe touching the things in controversy.
Now / yff to these I should add all other which are off the same Judgment
and of their opinion: the number off churches would be so many / that the
adversaries should evidently se and perceive what small cause they have to
charge us thus with singularity / as though we were post alone / and none to
be off our opinion. And it may here also be noted / that the most
auncientest fathers of this our own country / as master Couerdale / master
D. Turner / master Whithead / and many others some dead some yet living from
whose mouths and pens / the vrgers of these received first the light off the
gospel (could never be brought to yield or consent unto such things as are
now forced with so great extremity.
