To the Right worshipful true professor, follower of Arms, and marshall
discipline, the Renowned Captain, Thomas Lea, Esquire, H. R. your worships
faithful wel-willer, wishes abundance of all worldly happiness, with h^rts
desire, in all your attemptes, and after death, the joys eternal.
MAny Poettes, Right worshipful Captain, have written the honors of such
Noble and bewtifull Ladies as they adore, applauding in heroical verse and
most eloquent prose, their worthiness, some under one title, some another,
each one in his several humor as their Patronize does merit: to those whose
quaint conceits, and witty inventions are such, I leave those amorous
Subjects; singing in my harsh Tunes, the honors of a Soldier, a Prince borne,
and a Noble professor of Arms, which I boldly offer unto your worship, that
is a Patron to all, professing marshall discipline: and woorthily is so called,
in all places where your forward service has been approved, but especially
registered for a mirror of gentilitie, and honorable Soldier of our time,
amongst the Irish Nation, and inhabitants of that land, where your name is both
feared and beloved, the one for your resolution, the other, for your virtues,
bounty, and clemency, whereof daily they reap the benefit. The due
consideration of all which, has halled me on thus far to adventure, hoping
your accustomed favor shall be a protection to this stranger, whose honors,
if you vouchsafe at such times as your serious affairs shall permit leisure to
peruse, I hope something therein may move your delight, which I heartily wish. If
happily it so prove, I shall hereafter be imboldned to show my slender skill,
in explaining the honors and virtues of our home-born adventurers, whose
honorable actions, are not the least in account, nor ought to rest in
oblivion. Till when and ever, amongst those which your worships favors have
tied in true love unto you, I will offer my unfeigned and dutiful service.

Your worships in all dutiful affection, ever ready to be commanded: Henry
Robarts.

To my beloved Country men, the courteous Readers.
GEntlemen, after many bloody bickerings and dangerous hazards in great
perils on the seas, I have recovered the haven of my desire, and have brought
for your delighte, this strannger Knight, a Prince borne, endued with much
honor, who being a man famous, as his actions imports. Albeit my skill is
not such as is required, yet have taken upon me a Pilots charge, and in safety
have set him a shore, where his desire led him, unto whom Gentiles (my hope
is) your accustomed favor to all strangers shall not be denied, being a
Cauilere of fame: how plainly so ever you see him attired, yet accept him, and
as a Traveler coming of good will, bid him welcome, and with favor, peruse
his honors in Arms gained, which I hope may in some sort delight you, if
happily it prove as I desire, he has his wish. But (how so ever)
discountenance him not altogether, whose will is to deserve well. Abrupt
faults, he may unwillingly commit many, which if according to your accustomed
courtesies you vouchsafe to pardon, and after his long travail, with careful
trouble, to delight you, receive but the least show of good liking, it is all
he exspecteth: your courtesy is more then the cost, from which as you are
English men and Gentiles allianate, so shall he endeavor to deserve better,
and shall in his travail hereafter, report of you as you are, and bind me his
careful Pylot, your Country man, through whose procurement he is come hither,
to your humble service.

Yours ever. H. R.

Pheander, The Maiden Knight: describing his honorable Travels and haughty
attempts in Arms, wtih his success in love.
WHat time Manpelious reigned king in Numedia, as their ancient annuals record,
Thelarchus likewise swayed the Diadem in Thrace, a Prince so highly renowned
for all honorable actions, as few such in his time lived. This Thelarchus, in
the blooming of his Princely years, desirous to leave issue to his Noble
house, joined in marriage with Alinda, daughter and sole heir to Constantius,
Emperor of Germany, by whom in short time after their Nuptials, he had issue
one daughter, who was named Nutania, (This princess) as in comeliness of
person she exceeded, so for her beauty, wisdom and other good graces, there
lived none her equal: the report of whose excellence, as Fame aduanceth with
her loudest trump the honorable (especially) such peerless creatures, as this
Princess (yea) so highly stood-shee graced in the Gods favor, that none but
Nutanias beauty was remembered in most Princes Courts, both Christian and
heathen.

The renown of whose peerless beauty, so often blazed, came to the hearing
of Dionicus, son and heir apparent of the Numidian King, who upon the
surpassing praises by every one given of this Lady, begun more and more upon
hearing such several reports, to conceive an inward joy of her, diligently
hearkening to each stranger which should recount her virtues, and honor by
virtue gained. Long had not this humor followed the lovely Prince Dionicus,
but love the soueraign guide of men's thoughts, had so enthralled him, that all
his delight was in contemplating of this Princess beauty, yea so was he
overtaken in loves snare, that nothing was pleasing unto him, but the sweet
remembrance of Nutania: so much was his delight in her* that oftentimes, in the
midst of his pastimes, calling the Princess to mind, he would as one past
himself, altogether overcome with melancholy, abandon the company of his most
familiars, seeking from their pleasing pastimes some solitary place, where he
might unheard or seen recount with large amplificatio^s the Princess beauty,
whose servant in mind he was wholly vowed. Thus dallied Dionicus so long with
beauties flame, that overtaken with the vehemence thereof, he fell into an
extreme fever, which in such strange manner assailed him, as the learned
Physicians could not find any reason of the disease, much less procure his
health, who la^quished in love, not daring to disclose his grief to any, or
acquaint his trustiest companion with his love. This sudden alteration of the
Prince, in whose welfare the comfort not only of his companions in Court, but
generally of the commons consisted, moved them al to such exceeding grief,
that in short time their lovely countenances were so much altered, that neither
pleasing look, nor cheerful word, was to be obtained from them.

The King, whose aged life depended on the happiness of his son, as fathers
how base soever, delight in virtuous offsprings, much more the Noble, whose
honors are to be maintained by their progeny: the aged king, whose greatest
felicity was in the prince, was with such infinite griefs oppressed, that in
short time his body was so weakened, that rather he desired to accompany the
dead, then live in such discontent, the mother Queen, with over much care and
watching near pined, and few which felt not some part of the Princes grief,
such was their faithful loves unto him whereof the father gloried not a little,
and the mother (if women may be proud) was not a little spiced with y^ disease.
But neither the heaviness of the father, the extreme grief of the mother, the
daily lamenting of the Courtiers, nor the complaints of the Commons might any
way auail the Prince, who smothering his own sorrow, could not by all art
(Physic allowed for men's relief) be any way comforted. The over grieved
burden of whose miseries the Queen with his kingly father seeking to ease,
and could not as he desired accomplish, such extremity likewise assailed them,
that the learned could not judge the difference between them, (so that by
their ill) suppose the subjects grief, which reverently honored them, and
could willingly have offered their own lives for their relief and ease.

But in vain strive they, that seek help for him whom none but the
beautiful Nutania could release, who was the Load-starre of his life: and the
love of her, the special Physic which must restore him, or dye he would
past all recovery, but by Nutania, that Paragone of fame, Dianaes glory,
Natures only darling, and delight.

Weak and feeble, past recure of Physic, became the King and Queen, void of
hope ever to see their Princely sons recouerye: wherefore, forgetting all
worldly pleasure and Princely delights, such as become Princes ofso high
esteem, quyte abolishing all the vanities of the world, they mind wholly the
everlasting comfort, and joy in nothing, but his death, that from death, by
his blood redeemed them.

In this extremity, when all hopes were past help of men, behold the mercy of
him that preserves and destroys at his pleasure, who moved no doubt, at the
intercession of some their virtuous subjects, or taking pity of their
distress, as we read in holy writ, testimony of our souls comfort, how
Abraham beloved of God, moved his divine Deity for those Cities for sin by
his just judgment consumed, if five godly people* had been found within their
walls, they had been preserved: so either for the virtues of the King, or the
intercession of those sorrowing subjects, the giver of all comfort sent them
comfort, as you shall hear.

The Numedian King, whose prime of youth was spent in many honorable actions,
holding in great regard the love of his neighbor Princes, lived in such
tranquillity, that he was honored of all that heard of his government. The
report of whose long sickness and weak estate, moved the Kings of diverse
regions, by their embassage, to comfort them, and to be aduertized of the
truth of their estates. Amongst which those honorable Princes that held his
health in such regard, Thelarchus King of Thrace dispatched his Ambassador.
Who for the more honor of their King, was accompanied with diverse Gentlemen,
both of honor and great worship.

These Ambassadors ariuing at the Court of Numedia, their cause of coming
unknown, many matters were of the commons supposed (who will entermeddle with
Princes affairs) so that amongst them diverse things were imagined, and sundry
dangers suspected, but no assurance of any, until their day of hearing, which
the king appointed to be as sudden as they could require.

Against which time royal preparation was made, with all the pomp could be
devised, where for feasting there wanted no dainty, how rare soever, nor
diversity of Vyandes to please the appetite, with many pleasing shows, and
pastimes, the better to give them occasion of welcome: all which,
notwithstanding the Kings weakness, was so exquisitlie performed, that it was
admirable.

The day of hearing come (as time stays not) Manpelious having summoned his
council and chiefest Nobility, against that time to attend his pleasure:
these several Ambassadors were brought to his presence, where with more show
of hearty welcome, then his weak body could deliver, he gave them such
honorable entertainment, as beseemed the messengers of such Princes, and
highly contented them, whose courtesy the strangers Nobles applauded, and
grieved the more at his extremity, by how much the more they saw his debilitie.

After some talk passed between the King and these Nobles, and that he had
enquired with all kindness of the health of their Princes, and welfare of
their countries, and received their Letters with diverse Princely presents,
they were dismissed, but yet not suffered to depart, without gracious thanks to
their kings, and kind show of good acceptance of their pains, leaving them to
their repose, with great charge to his Nobles and those in authority, to see
their entertainment such, as if their sovereign Lords were present: which
charge was not forgotten of those which prized their Princes honors as dear as
their lives, but with such pomp and cost accomplished each several command
of his Highness: as the Strangers might well admire to behold it. Their diets
so diverse and so abundant, as they had never seen the like, furnished with
so much sundry music, and so cunningy used, as might well delight the
Gods. To acquaint you with other pastimes, for recreation, as Plays, Maskes,
Tilting, Turneying, Barriours, and other Courtly pastimes, besides, their
hunting of Tigers, wild Bores, and Lions, which moved such delight, as other
sportes pleasure unto them. Thus in using daily those pleasures, when the
Nobles had spent some time in the Court, every one content with his royal
entertainment, hearing amongst the Nobles of the country such general honor
of the Prince Dionicus, whom they had not yet seen, an especial desire
moved them to visit the Prince, bewayling greatly that moved such adverse
chances, should nip so brave and honorable a Prince, in the blooming time of
his princely years.

The Prince Dionicus, albeit the imbecility of his body denied those nobles his
presence at their pastimes, in which several sport he much delighted, yet that
they might not depart of him unseen, he commanded a sumptuous banquet in his
lodging to be ordained: ^o which he invited the stranger Nobles and their
companies: who wishing to see the Prince, were as glad to accompany him, as he
desirous of their company, and graciously with many humble thanks, accepted
the Princes good will. The youthful Nobles attendant on the Prince, careful to
see each thing ordered, for the honor of his Majesty, wanted nothing that
might be desired, only exspected the coming of their guestes, who not
unmindful of their promise, as dinner time drew nigh, prepared themselves
toward the Prince, unto whom by his Nobility in most gorgious manner, they
were conducted: no sooner entered they his presence, but Dionicus, whose
courtesy was such as gained the love of his subjects, and all strangers that
had seen his demeanor, yet at this time had better knowledge how to entertain
them, then ability to perform what he would, stretching himself in his bed,
as his weak limbs would suffer him, he gave them such hearty welcoms, as
highly contented them, and beseemed their estates. These Nobles when they had
made their eyes witnesses, of what report had so often bruted, rather accused
report of great wrong, in not giving him such due as he deserved, then of over
much praise: for that the fame bruted of him, was not to be valued with his
worthiness. The time of dinner passed they, with many glaunces on the Prince,
noting his courtesy, but ever lamenting his grief, and wishing his health,
framing them selves to pleasant discourses, to put him from those melancholy
thoughts, wherewith he was over much burdened. Thus with much diversity of
table talk, consumed the time, the grauer sort, of matters for benefit of the
state: the greener heads whose years required no other cares of their
pleasing pastimes and pleasure, the managing their horses, commending the
stateliness of their bodies, their sinenesse in careyring their bravery in
their Coruet, and excellent swiftness in their gallop, their readiness in hand,
and their courage in the face of the enemy: not omitting the gallant cries of
their hounds, nor forgetting, by which and which, such a bucke was slain, and
such a Stag pulled down, passing not, without high commending the soring of their
hawks, nor forgetting their stateliness in flight, with their fearce seazing
on their game. And then for variety, as occasion is ministered, Carowse a health
to their Mistress and Loves, in their country.

The Prince as lovely as the best, and in his health as well able to perform
whatsoever, had his greatest comfort in listening to the talk of Cariolus and
Octauius, two noble men of Thrace, which accompanied of pleasure Atlautus, the
chief in commission for their king. Dionicus earnestly noting these two
Nobles of Thrace, as most delighted with their persons and pleasant parlie,
heard Cariolus carowse a health to the Princess Nutania: whose name the
distressed Prince no sooner heard uttered, but the remembrance of that sweet
object, his lives sole health, and mistress of his fancies, so revived his
dying spirits, that suddenly the beholders might well perceive his wan color,
which argued a troubled shirit, to vanish, and those vermilion died roses, the
woonted badges, and ornaments of his sweet face, challenge their former
intrest, and for a time possess them, restoring unto Nature her due, making
his lovely countenance as cheerful to the beholders, as the glorious Sun to
the captiued, whose liberty being deprived, have long bin debarred of al
worldly delights, and seldom received comfort from that heavenly essence. This
cheerful alteration in the Prince was noted of diverse, whose ears, albeit
busied in listening to the discourses of these strangers; yet the eyes of his
own attendants, with dutiful care, gave heed unto the Prince.

Amongst those unto whose government the care of ye princes health was
committed, Barnardine, a man for his art famous, and learned in his profession
(which was physic) who sometime was tutor unto him, noting this sudden change
in the Prince, supposing verily by his countenance, that some of their speeches
did move him to content, coming suddenly to him, and grasping his arm, felt
his pulses beat so fiercely, as in long time they had not done the like; which
made him more consideratly search, to find the cause of this motion, enquire it
he durst not, doubting to move him to melancholy, having so often been
denied, but resting by him a while, continuing with his arm grasped, he felt
the pulse more and more to work, which gave him the more cause, to find if
he might, the original from whence it came, and noting diligently unto which
of the company he most inclined his eyes, he might perceive Cariolus and his
Octauius earnestly bufied in their former talk, which was, I dare say,
neither of religion, nor of government of the State, yet was it such as
Barnardine perceived, hightie contented the Prince, and desired it might long
continue, so it were for his Lords good. Many pretty questions passed between
them, and much variety, in whose prattle many a fair Lady was commended by
one, and for argument as highly of the other discommended, in which humor were
diverse of the Nobility of the country, and Ladies of worth by name
questioned of, and many a youthful pra^ke by themselves committed, yet all in
friendship, and kindly taken, though harsh frumpes passed sometimes between
them, which moved them to much mirth. But when in earnest Octauius forgetting
himself, falling from one matter to another, and that there should be a
judgment given, who for beauty was the only paragon, Octauius for affection
commended Brionella, daughter and sole heir of Constantine, king of Boheme, in
whose fathers court, he had long been trained up, giving the prize from their
own country Ladies: Whereat Cariolus, as if he had been the sworn Champion
of their Land, moved at his rash censure, forgetting the reverence of the
place, told him flatly his judgment was false, and that he would auow:
offering his glove in combat, to maintain that the Princess Nutania, and
none but she, deserved ye name of beautiful: whose wisdom, and other good
graces, in any one, was not to be found in the circuit of the earth: and
therefore Octauius, (quoth he,) thou have done over much wrong, to derogate the
honor due to Thracian Dames, especially our peerlesse Nutania, whose face it
beauteous Helena lived, for whom so many thousands lost their lives, she
might well resign that title of the only fair, to her, and none but she:
whose like lives not.

Octauius, who was wise and well demeaned, perceiving this parlie begun in
jest, likely to end in quarrel, noting likewise, how the rest of the company
ceased their serious talk, to attend them, with a smiling countenance, as one
not possessed with choler, brake off his talk thus.

Why (my Lord) shall matter of so small moment cause friends to jar? What is
beauty, whereof we have so long disputed, and so highly of us regarded? nothing
but a fading pleasure, an ornament of the face which makes the heart proud,
and draws the mind from every good motion, to many odious offenses, whereby
the honorable in committing dishonorable actions, are so blemished, that they
become a common byword to the veriest drudge that Nature has framed. Helena
was fair, and accounted the only of her time, yet who so much scorned?
Cressida beautiful, yet who more false? If beauty be attended on with such
shame as these two famous women gained, why should we care who is beautiful?
My sweet Cariolus mistake me not, if I have passed my judgment rashly, for
neither care I whose fame in that case is esteemed or defamed, but pass them
by as things of no regard; only for argument I have spoken more then either I
regard or account of: therefore let not this be any breach of our friendship,
for I protest, if thou should say, the white Swanne were as black as the
raven, the Ocean dry, and ships floting on the maine, I would affirm it,
rather than our friendship should be for such a matter discontinued.

Well Octauius (quoth Cariolus) I find your kindness great, and will thank you
for it, but trust me, this gloze may not serve your turn, for as you have
spoken heresy against Beauty, and maintained a stranger before your home-born
Ladies, you shall either recant your Judgment, before our sovereign Princesie
Nutania, or receive such penance, by your quest assigned, which I promise thee
shall be all honorable Ladies. Oh my Lord (answered Octauius) I hope I shall
find your H. more kind, then for so small an offense to deliver your friend
prisoner at the bar, where the parties shall be Judges, and my Jury such, as
all laws allow me to appeal from, if you should, and my fault such, as if my
life were in their trial depending, I might well make my testament, and dispose
of what I possess, heartily desiring God to receive my soul, for sure I am, my
body should not long enjoy breath; for no greater corrasiue can be offered that
Ser, then to attribute the honor of such a prize to any one particular, they
all standing on terms of beauty, as the Crow which thinks her own birds
fairest: so women how ill-faced and wrinkled soever they be, may not endure to
hear any commended, if happily they should hear it spoken by such as they dare
not in speech displease, yet will their countenance show their hearts
discontent, by scrowling of ye brows, hanging the lip, or setting a sweet
face, as sugared as the galle, or by some such outward action or other, shall you
find where that nipt her, for which offense looked she never so highly, with
Bell, Book and Candle, you shall be curssed, and never more come in
Paternoster, how deep soever you have been in her Creed.

Hold, hold, Octauius, quoth Cariolus, too much of one thing is good for
nothing: Thou have played the excellent Orator. Who had thought your Lordships
experience had bin such, for thereon I know you ground all your authority:
Author I am sure in schools you never read any, which have so highly abused
that sacred Sex, sacred I may well call them my Octauius, who are not honored of
mortal creatures, but of the gods, and therefore in the higher account, and
the more in regard, the greater thy offense, and the more grievous thy
punishment.

To this pleasant discourse the whole assembly gave ear, and were greatly
therewith delighted, yet to put them from it, and to end as pleasantly, Atlantus
said:

My Lord Cariolus; what, is your honor become Beauties Champion? Far was it
from my thought, that ever you would with such earnestness have defended our
fair Ladies, but since I see you are so great an Advocate, I will cause you to
have thanks for it at our return, other reward I dare promise none. And you my
Lord Octauius, that so clarkly have depraved them, would I might be your
scholar, whose experience is so great, Tully, Ovid, or Marcus Aurelius, that
wrote most in their disgrace, never writ so largely, I must needs say, as my
Lord Cariolus, our ladies are little beholding unto you, for the danger
committed in the same, the least is heresy, and how heresy is to be punished
your honor knows: yet my Lord, as I would gladly become a peacemaker, and
that friends may not grow at ods, whereby any danger might happen to your
person, albeit the offense be not pardonable, yet the fault made in a foreign
country ought there to have his trial. If it shall stand with your good
liking, no ladies present to hear your hard censure, your favor may be the
more: and since I have by patience of this honorable company, intruded my self
to speak in our ladies cause, not being a feed Counceller for them, I will
entreat these noble Gentlemen to give me leave, and let me censure of y^ same,
so it stand with your L. good pleasure.

Now truly quoth Octauius, I find your L. kind, and more kind then I can either
desire or deserve, when I shall need your favor in matter of more importe, I
will make bold: til when, I put you down with Cariolus for one of my small
friends, for this matter I shall need small friendship, unless to bring your
cause to better effect, you do as many crafty people now a days use, to make
small conscience, in selling men's souls to the devil for money, to swear what
he shall command them, how false soever, to the impouerishing of many, whose
good hospitality, and other good neighborhood, was more then ever such base
villains could reach unto, if such a companion you mate me with, or search
out some subtle lawyer that can by his querkes and quidities in law, make a
bad matter good, and anointing the Judge with vnguentum aurum, cause him to
incline to the same, my cake is dough, if by such subornation, forswearing and
false judgment, my speech be wrested to your advantage.

Cease my Octauius, this dread, heavens forfend, for this offense thy
punishment should be as thou deseruest, much less that any sinister means
should be used to bring thee to open penance, yet good Octauius let me entreat
thee, as in this assembly thou have unjustly given the prize of beauty to
Brionella, and therein have wronged highly the only of the world, by thy
partial judgment, in derogating from her the title of most excellent, which
is most honorable, and no more than her worth requires: confess but thy
fault and error in the same, and an end, if thou love thy own good, refuse
not this offer, least worse befall thee then Acteon, or to Paris for his rash
judgment. Thou have learned us in thine own Exordium, that women are inspired
with minds of revenge. Be therefore by thy friends entreated before the
punishment come upon thee, so may thou keep thee from much sorrow, for if
no greater mischief fall upon thee, thou shall be sure of more curses, then thy
weak carcass can bear: for my Octauius, in friendship I say this, and warn
thee as one that loves thee, knowing their inclinations, which as thy self
confesses, is bent to revenge: if so, as many as shall hear of this
blasphemy, if they do thee no other ill, their cursing thou shall be sure of,
and women's curses, are as bad as the curse of holy saint Gillian: which is said
to be ten times worse then the devils.

Treason, treason, my Lords, quoth Octauius, if I have spoken heresy, this
questionless is no better then treason, and the comparison so odious as may
not be endured, (the devil and a woman joined in one) as fit a match as may be
made. Well my Lord, since in my error I have found you kind in favoring my
fault, let us do as all bribing Officers use, bear with me, and i will hold with
thee: so by consealing my fault, the less dangers shall happen unto you; if
you refuse my kind offer, I come upon you with an old proverb (ka me) (ka
thee) or as children play, (tell of me, I Will tell of thee). Well watched my Lord
Octauius, quoth the whole company, but my Lords, let the further hearing of
this matter rest, till better opportunity, least your tediousness, breed
trouble to my Lord the Prince, whose quiet, I would not willingly offend.

My honorable Lords answered the Prince, if these discourses of those noble men
be pleasing to your honors, assure you, they are no way offensive unto me, I
have troubled you from your better cheer, to accept of a sick man's pittance,
whereunto you are all so heartily welcome as to your own Palaces, (and
welcome) says our Country householders, is the best dish, at their feasts: if
therefore my Lords you accept my welcome, I am the more honored by you, which
have so graciously vouchsafed me your companies.

Then turning to the Lord Cariolus, he said, for you my good Lord, how much I
acknowledge my self indebted to you, I omit, and yield you as many thousands
thanks for your pleasing speech, as there were sillibles in your words* you
have like your self defended the weaker sex, for the which, were I the
Princes Nutania, your challendge made in my cause, should be bountifully
rewarded: I am sorry my good Lord, my bad hap was such, that I knew you no
sooner. But if it shall stand with your Lordships pleasure, that during the
time of your abode here, to vouchsafe me your company, so it may be no
disparagement to your serious affairs: persuade your self, your welcome* shall
be no better in anyplace, then unto me, for which kindness, you should hind
me unto your friendship.

Gracious Prince answered the Noble Cariolus, thanks for your Princely favor,
and gracing me thus, which am not any way to do your majesty service, but
wherein your highness shall command, I shall be ready with all dutifulness
to accomplish.

Leave these speeches good my Lord, quoth the Prince, and offering duty where
friendship is requested, and granting my suit, let me enjoy thy company, so
shall thou command Dionicus, for ever as a friend.

The grauer sort of those Noble strangers, whom matters of more importance
called away, after humble thanks given for their royal entertainment, wishing
health and all happiness unto his excellence, they commit him to his rest.

Barnardine, which had endured the end of all these prattles; and perceiving
that this talk was altogether friuelous; and not worthy the hearing, moved
him to delight: he began diligently to enter into each particular discourse of
Cariolus and Octauius, and considerately to note each several passion of the
Prince* so far searched this skillful physician into every particular, that
ca^^asing it thoroughly, he noted his special iesture, and how his color came
(and vanished) yea how much his heart was possessed with joy, when he heard the
Princess Nutania named* the working of his p^^ces, made Barnardine imagine*
the cause of his disease, yet had no assurance thereof, and to enquire it of
the Prince was in vain, for that he had so often denied the same: wherefore he
consealing his thoughts, in hope to work means for his recovery, And finding
those cynders which were like to com(...)e him, (and the rather) if he could
procure Cariolus to accompany him. Thus leaving the Prince to his quiit, and
Barnardine to his care, for recovering his health, return we so the aged weak
King.

The King whose long sickness, and care of his wife and sons health, whom
he loved most zealously, being extreemly vexed, and greatly weakened of his
(...), when Physic had done what was possible, and small hope to recover him,
in the midst* of his passions when all hopes was past, but only the comfort of
him who by his word rayseth the dead from the grave, so this (Manpelius)
received comfort by his kingly neighbors friends, whose letters when he had by
his Council perused, and with regard and advise, noted each kind offer, with
their persuading reasons, (albeit) he could hardly ^^g^st the ^ame: yet
considering how frail men are, and that our cares of Terraine joys, are to be
fa(...)d to that Celestial commander, which releeueth all those that seek
him, he revived himself, and like a faithful soldier, taking hold of the
promise in holy writ so often repeated, he cast care of w^^^^ child, and
kingdom, upon him, that first gave it him, and by whole providence he so long
enjoyed the^* ^aking his chiefest care to gra(...) those his friends, by who^^^
^^^sell he was urged to the heavenly comfort. And those honorable Nobles for
their pains, who wishing to be with their friends in their own Countries,
attend his highness pleasure for answer* which he took order* should with
such speed be dispatched, as possibly might (...) way be used.

Dionicus, whose heart was on his halfpennie, vowing his love wholly to the
Princess Nutania, was so delighted in recounting he praise, as nothing could
be so pleasing, but as all sorts of men infected with that ag^^^e (i^ their
love be faithful) are inclined to some jealousy, so this monstrous Basalicke,
whose poison infecteth the vai^es, and consumes the heart, without wisdom
govern the mind, as by this Prince notably appeared: who in his idle
thoughts, calling to mind the praises of Cariolus, and the challenge made in
defense of the Princess Nutania, as love endures no arriual, so Dionicus
stricken wtih the sting of jealousy, began to conceive many dishonorable
thoughts of Cariolus, supposing Nutania was was his Love, and that by Cariolus
his joys in her love, and hope of favor, should be frustrate and of no
account: with much matter more, then ever was by Cariolus imagined* how largely
so ever his speech was used in the Princes behalf, to procure their delights,
and move Octauius to chollor: notwithstanding no reason might persuade, where
jealousy had given judgment, for the Prince in this jealousy, fought no
mean, but revenge of him that never committed the least thought of evil
against him. When revenge in this Princes heart was thus imprinted, and rage
and jealousy set down his death, an honorable motion, more befitting his
grace then rigor, moved by the inspiration of the eternal God, withdrew him
from this base attempt, he called to mind, the honor of his house, the love of
those Princes their bordering neighbors, by whose command, Cariolus came into
his Country, the Scandal so bloody a fact deserved, and what continual
ignomy would redownd unto him and his progeny for ever: accusing himself of
great impiety, he exclaimed on his follies in this manner.

Blush Dionicus, at thy base thoughts, and so much sorrow for thy pretended
mischief, against this noble stranger, as if thou had shed the blood of a
thousand innocents: have thou from thy Cradle disdained to offer wrong to the
most inferior, and wilt now begin with murder of a noble man? Know thou
not, that to add to his head one hair, is more then the greatest Prince can
do? And will thou seek his life that never had thought of il against thee?
Has thy father lived so many years honorably reputed amongst them, ever in
tranquillity, and by thy cruel slaughtering thy friend, shall their peace be
broken? Was it not for his comfort and thy good, these strangers came into this
country? and for their kindness, can thou reward them with such despite?
Thou enuiest the happiness of a toward gentleman, for thou know not what,
(say he loved the Princess) what is that to thee, intrest have thou none, to
debar him from it. Nutania thou know not but by hearesay, he a Noble man
of her country, a toward Gentleman, and woorthily may obtain her. Nature has
made him of the mould of the earth, whereof thou art framed, the beggar is as
subject to amorous passions as the prince. Nutania is beautiful, wise, fair,
and in the principal time of her flourishing estate, lovely as the dew on the
sweet Roses. Cariolus valiant, well featured, wise and toward, in all
honorable actions; all which are load-starres to draw ladies to love: and
Nutania is but a woman though a princess. If then thou have neither fear of
God, or law of humanity to persuade thee from so great a mischief, yet let
his kindness offered thee, which has been as much as ever thou requiredst, be
of some regard. The fiercest beast seldom harmeth those whose society they
use, and will thou be found more cruel then vnnreasonable creatures: No, no,
Dionicus, let die thy malice to Cariolus, who is innocent, and far from any
thought of pretended evil against thee, for so much the more shall his blood
with extremity be revenged, by how much the more, thou unjustly iniuriest
him, yea rather choose to die a thousand deaths, if every life were a legion
of lives, then hold so base a mind. Thou have long (though to thy great
grief) and much sorrow concealed thy love to Nutania, and now will thou
murder him that wishes thee well: for her love.

No, no, Dionicus, let honor be the mark whereat thou aimest, account death
more precious then life with ignominy, honor by murder blemished, is such a
stain as can never be raced out, but the continual ignomine thereof, will
remain while there is any being: Yea, and what is more to be regarded, the
welfare of thy subjects on whom the blood of so noble a man will be with great
effusion revenged, and thy country like those ruinous monuments of Troy laid
waste and desolate, which was spoiled for a fact nothing so odious.

Sithence thou have all these reasons to reduce thee from this vile thought,
dally no longer with thy shadow, as in the tale of Esope thou may read, of
y^ dog; who moved with envy, of another welfare, not only hazarded his life,
but what else he had in possession. Though the comparison be ridiculous, yet
the example may move thee to fear thine own fall. For if the gods be so
just in punishing such offenses in unreasonable creatures, how much more shall
thou be plagued, whom God has not onley endued with reason, but invested with
titles of majesty and honor; whose life should shine on the earth, as the
glorious Sun, and by thy virtues draw such as live under thy government, from
their desire to commit evil; for such as is the Pastor, such will be the
flock: if the Prince be virtuous, the Subject will fear to offend, if he
be vicious, who will care to live in obedience of him, or his laws. Thou
see Dionicus, the peril, surcease therefore thy base thoughts (and as Cariolus
is Noble,) where thou have without desert been jealous, become zealous from
envying him, that no way wished thee evil; admit him to thy friendship, to him
thy kindness may be acceptable, and in using such favors, may thou in time
learn the truth of what thou now supposest. If Cariolus love Nutania, he
cannot be so secret, but in some sort or other, thou shall attain to the
knowledge thereof: and as thou shall in conuersing with him, find his
Honorable dealinges, so may thou either trust him or refuse him: If Nutania
have vowed her love unto him, seek to master thy affection, and wish them joy,
if not, his friendship may the sooner bring thee to thy desires, by
acquainting the Princess with thy love, in explaining the passions for her
thou have endured.

Nutania (says the wrolds report) is beautiful, wise, and honorably
demeaned, and therefore cannot be cruel: her father a king beloved of all y^
have heard of him, whose kindness has bin such to thy father and thee, as thou
can not deserve: if such love remain in the parents, the children should not
hate: then fondling, if thou have wronged thy self in concealing thy grief,
accuse thy own follies; and condemn not thy friends of evil, nor let thy
iealosie blame Cariolus, who never had thought of pretended evil against thee;
if thou fail in thy love, blame none but thy self, spare to speak, spare to
speed; Cowards never were Loves champions, nor faint-hearted swad obtained
Ladies love: women though never so base, will be sued, sought, and courted, with
many devises allured to win them, and their loves obtained, as sundry means
sought to continue it.

A Nouice art thou Dionicus, and never came to know what many a hardy man at
arms has endured, histories are diverse, which show the extremes of Princes
and famous Conquerors, that they endured through love, yet have thou never read
of any that ever wooed by silence, courted their mistresses with imaginations,
or obtained their love being mute: Longer may thou smother thy grief, which
may cureles, consume thee: fire suppressed, burns with more vehemency, and
love concealed, consumes the intrals, and slays remediless. How long may
thy shoo wring thy foot, before any that look thee in the face can tell where
it pincheth thee. Many of mean birth have obtained the love of Princes, and
ladies of great worth, and by daring to attempt wedded and bedded them. If the
ignoble have had such success in love, Rouse thee dastard from this loathsome
cabinet, arm thee with hopes of thy Mistress favor, and with courage seek to
obtain it: let grief no longer oppress thee, but like the son of thy
renowned father, show thy self; let not daring love, which by many good motions
may be vanquished, overthrow thee by subiecting thy self overmuch unto it,
but in the face of the enemy show thy self, and there by prowess purchase
such renown, as the report of thy valor may gain thee the love of her thou
most desire. Women's loves for the most are settled on the valiant and such as
adventure, holding in rgarde such as by their valor, can and will maintain
their honors, bearing in triumph their favors in the field, and gaining
honor in their titles. I, thus Dionicus should be thy thoughts, hold thee
there, and no doubt of good success: Nutania is but a woman though a
Princess, thou son to a King, and no way her inferior. Then continue this
resolution and Nutania may in time, as well seek thy favor, as the noble
Amozonia, Alexanders love.

Scantly had he ended this his tedious premeditation, when word was brought
unto him by one of his Pages, that the Lord Cariolus was come to visit him,
which did put him from all further imaginations at that time.

Cariolus no sooner come to his presence, but Dionicus with a blushing
countenance bad him welcome, ashamed of his rash suspicion; yet concealing the
same as he might, framed such kind speech as he best could, the better to
assure his welcome, not sparing oftentimes to render great and hearty thanks
for his kindness in coming to visit him: and more to show how glad he was
of his company, he called to rise, which he had not done long before, but for
necessity making his bed. Thus when long time was spent between them,
discoursing of many matters, to both their contents, Dionicus called for
meat; where to accompany Cariolus, he received more sustenance than he had in
many days before, to the great joy of his attendant Barnardine, who by
messengers certified the King and Queen thereof, who ioyed, and were not a
little comforted at this report.

Dinner ended, and Cariolus with the Prince devising to beguild ye time, loath
suddenly to leave him, called for a Chesse board, wherewith they sported a
while, Dionicus, who^ grief of mind procured soon to melancholy, loosing two
or three fair games, became very impacient, to agrauate whose chollor, and
make his fury the more, Cariolus playing for cunning, to make game, took his
queen, and gave check to his king, whereat the Prince forgetting both
himself and other those motions so lately by him minded, first violently
striking him with the board, ran fiercely on him: and taking him by the
throat, cried mainly out thus; Villain quoth he, shamest thou not to rob me
of my Lady, my Love, my life, and souls comfort, but to my teeth must check
me therewith in my own Country, (base fugitive) thou shall beard me no more
therewith, for by thy miserable death, will I recover to mine own possession,
my love, my Lady, my Queen, yea in despite of thy head, Nutania shall be my
mistress, sweet Princess, the only soueraign of my thoughts.

Barnardine, and his Noble attendants, seeing this friendship lately professed,
so suddeinly forgotten, taking him with much adoo from Cariolus, were not a
little perplexed, but as men past themselves, having never seen the like,
could imagine no cause, greatly doubting that suddeinly he was grown lunaticke.

Cariolus vexed at this hard usage of the Prince, was no sooner freed from him,
but in great chollor would have departed; Protesting to be revenged for this
discurtesie offered him. Affrming, that his entising speeches, in color of
kindness, was to no end, but to draw him from his honorable friends to murder
him.

Barnardine careful what might ensue hereof, weighing each occasion which
might hereat be taken, besought Cariolus, of that love he bear the King his
master, which had used them honorably, of his love to his own King, and all
that might be imagined, to conceive of this wrong offered, as of no such
pretended matter, as he supposed: but rather with patience to consider the long
extreme sickness of the Prince, and how subject by reason of his infirmity he
was unto melancholy, undertaking on his faith and honest reputation, how ever
the occasion grew, it was not in malice: assuring him, the Prince when he
should call to mind this unkind action, would with grief lament it, and
sorrowing for the same, submit himself, craving hearty forgiveness for his
rashness.

Barnardine vexed at the heart, for this unkind dealings of the Prince,
entreating his associates, to persuade Cariolus, went himself to the prince,
and after dutiful speech to his grace, recounted unto him, in what evil part
Cariolus took this abuse by him offered: humbly beseeching him, as he esteemed
the love of his Princely father, and the honor and reputation of his country,
to acknowledge in some courteous manner the wrong committed, and so reconcile
himself.

Dionicus, whose passion had not it left him, albeit in his health none might
more persuade him then Barnardine, yet hearing him preach repentance, being in
this humor, forgate their passed friendship, and moved with his talk, albeit
it was used for his good, with a look as ghastly, as a ghoast risen from the
grave, drew near Barnardine, and laying hands on him, had like to have
mischieued him, had he not made the more speed away.

Cariolus understanding what had been offered the aged man, and hearing in what
regard the Prince held his love, passing by his chollor, began with great
heaviness to lament the Prince his agony, and sorrowing for him, besought the
heavens creature so to comfort the Prince as himself would wish in the like
extreme. And so leaving Barnardine and the Nobles to their charge, departed.

The Nobles whose grief was not little, with hearts over charged with sorrow,
thinking it not convenient to leave him alone, doubting some worse matter should
happen unto him, went to visit the Prince cheerfully, enquiring of his welfare,
which with so good countenances as he could use, was kindly answered of the
Prince: who having past the extremity of his fury, calling to mind those
notable abuses offered his friends, greatly lamenting his folly therein, he said:

Where, where, my honorable friends, may I hide my head, to shelter me from
the worlds reproach, who void of all reason, more brutish then the savage
beast, have sought to murder my dearest friends. Oh, how might (I blush with
shame,) and ashamed of my evil committed, never behold the faces of those whom
I have so evil entreated: what fury bewitched me to this mischief? Or what
devilish sorcery enchanted my spirits, and captiuated my senses, so to offend
thee Lord Cariolus? who of thy zealous affection and courtesy, came to visit
me, delighting so greatly in thy company as I did. And thou the father of
gravity, my greatest hope in the world, Barnardine, thou whose honest care and
love to me, has been ever shown from my Cradle. Oh Barnardine, how
ungrateful have I been, rewarding thy good, with the hazard of thy blood. Woe
is me unhappy, and thrice unhappy, that I have lived to behold the light of
this day, wherein past my self, I have so highly offended. Pardon, pardon, my
Lord Cariolus, as thou art honorable, and thou Barnardine, whose aged years I
have so highly offended: Forgive my miss, and remit that evil I have
committed against thee, or let me never behold the days light again. Why
should I live, whom mine own conscience so highly accuses of such impiety?
Will not the fowls of the air, soaring over thy head as thou walk, cry
out, (ungrateful Dionicus) that would have murdered thy friends: each creature
that God has made, will exclaim against thee, for this evil, following thee
with cries of horror, to thy everlasting reproach. Therefore unhappy Dionius,
since by thy own doings this reproach is happened upon thee, whereby for ever
thou art dishonored, and no man hereafter will dare to use any familiarity
with thee, no not one, from the Prince to the beggar, (live not, live not thou
Dionicus,) but let that hand that committed the evil, finish thy life, which
living, can never be unremembered. In this fury, resolving to have mischiefed
himself, his Nobles taking him in their Arms, with such comfortable speeches
as they could, pacified him, who seeing his sorowfulnesse, were partakers of
his grief, and much lamented his extremity, as men might for their Soueraign.
Yet casting of care, seeking the best for their quiet they could, they laid him
in his bed, where, with solemn music they procured him to sleep. Where for
a time I leave him.

Time that finisheth all things, has now wrought an end of the Kings affairs,
for the dispatch of the Ambassadors, whom the King with great entertainment
and Jewels of high esteem, so rewarded, as they all had cause to speak of his
royal bounty. The Ambassadors receiving their Letters, and the time appointed
for their departure, their ships with victuals at the Kings cost replenished,
and all other necessaries, Cariolus who had been often solicited by Barnardine,
to visit the Prince, and by his report whose word was of account with all that
had knowledge of his simple dealings, was persuaded of the Princes sorrow, for
the wrong offered him. Wherefore that it might appear unto Dionicus, he
departed not in displeasure, but that he had forgotten all wrongs offered,
kindly, before his departure, came to take his leave. Where, upon the courteous
demeanor of the Prince, who manifested his grief by the abundance of sighs
which he powered forth, they were reconciled, and an inuiolably league of
friendship vowed between them: which with solemn oaths they protested,
should never quail in either of them.

The have of the noble Ambassadors who desired to be with their Loves at home,
is more now then Cariolus wished: But what must be, shall be, how loath soever.
Wherefore after many friendly gratulations between them, and great gifts of
the Prince, on his new (Amico) bestowed, they take leave each of other,
Cariolus solemnly praying for the Princes health, and Dionicus wishing him all
happiness.

Thus all things fitted by the King command, they were honorably conducted
unto the Port, where their ships ready furnished, attended their coming:
where they had not long stayed, but a fair wind to serve their turns, God
sent them; and they embarked themselves, each one for his several country,
and the Nobles returned to the Court; where to their careful regard of their
king, Countries benefit, we leave them, to let you know further of the
Prince; whose is troubled, as you shall hear.

The Prince, whom Nature had formed so exquisite in lineaments of body, as
could be required, having wisdom and valor enferiour to none, when he had
considered with great wisdom from point to point, the extremity of his
estate, and found that his disease was grievous, and so great, that he rather
desired death, than life, in that agony to be continued; weying all dangers
which might befall him, in seeking secretly for such help, as by his own
industry he could procure: with the pleasures and hearts content, the
obtaining of his loves delight, would bring him; resolutelie determined, as
much as he might, to cherish himself: and disguising himself in habit of a
traveler, unknown of any man, so soon as his strength would permit him, he
departed his Country toward Thrace, and either gain his Lady, or try in
short time the fickleness of fortune: hazarding all on this rest, he
secretly procures all his Jewels, and such sums of money as he could: and
by little and little recovering himself, used his woonted familiarity amongst
the Nobles, and Courtiours; which did cause no small content and hearts joy
in the King, Queen and Commons; yea, such was the general rejoicing of the
whole people in the Realm, for his recovery, that there* was not one, which
showed not some sign of gladness by his outward appearance.

As there is not the clearest day which is not overwhelmed with some cloud, so
lasted this joy amongst these loving subjects not long: for Dionicus continuing
his determination, conveyed his sums of money and Jewels into a grove within
the Park near the Court, at such several times as he would choose to be
solitary, wrought so close, and with such discretion, that he was altogether
unperceived of any man.

Each thing wrought to his content, secretly in the evening, his companions by
him appointed to keep the Courtiers from idleness, by such pastimes as he had
devised, as Masking, Barriors, Dycing, and other recreations, whom he refused
to accompany, alleging that he might not be long absent from the King, and
that his sport determined, was to recreate the Queen, who since her sickness
was very melancholy, which coined excuse passed for current, as what was it
they would not credit which he should report.

Having thus politikely fitted all things, supper ended, and every one
attending the beginning of the sportes and pastimes, Dionicus who had more
stringes to his Harp then one, had no care but how to convey himself from
their presence, which he took opportunity to do, telling the Queen mother
he had given his word to be one of the Maskers, which she being glad of, as
rejoicing to remove his melancholy by any means, suffered him to depart.

But too soon alas, gave she credit to his feined speeches, which turned
them all to great sorrow and heaviness: for Dionicus minding least what they
supposed he most ioyed in, conveyed himself with all the have he possibly
could into the Park, where his footeman attended his coming with his horse,
on which he was no sooner mounted, to drive suspicion or jealous thoughts of
his late travail from his man, he commanded him presently, to speed him
with all the haste he might, unto the house of a Knight dwelling not far off,
with a devised message, pretending the business to be of great weight and
importance, and straightly charging him not to depart from thence before his
coming, which should be the next night. With this commandment the servant
departed, least suspecting the loss of so bountiful a master was so near.
But the Prince whose chiefest content was in beholding the Idia of that Paragon
whom Fame had so extolled, had his heart fired with desire, that he thought
every day a year, and every minute a month, until he beheld the
excellency of Natures work, the only performed work of Beauty, and the
sovereign goddess of his thoughts: of which Dionicus having no small regard,
doubting to be missed of the King, and loath to lose that opportunity, poasteth
with all speed unto the grove where his coin and Jewels lay, where the better
to escape the suspicion of Officers in his passage, crossing the seas, he
attired himself in the habit of a merchant, which he had ready provided for
that purpose: and so making small stay, he cease not his coriours pace, nor
spares any horse flesh, until he came to the port where he pretended to imbarke
him self. No sooner arrived he at that so long desired place, but Fortune who
had bent his thoughts to travail, entending after her many crosses to sauce
his sour with some sweets, and like a comfortable Physician, after many bitter
Pills ministered for cloying the stomach of his Patient, comfort him with
some consarue or other more pleasing his appetite, so the Prince now in the
beginning of his fortunes, found this favor, to arm him with the better hope
of ensuing good: for at his first coming to the City, after enquiry made for
some ship bound for Thrace, he had intelligence of a Bark already haled out
of the harbourgh into the road, her yardes crossed, and her Mariners
exspecting the coming a board of the master and her marchaunts, and so to
depart. Which news how pleasing it was to the prince, suppose you gentiles,
that have your hearts so full fraught with desire as this noble Dionicus, who no
sooner was informed hereof, but diligently went himself to search the master
and merchants of this ship, who^ he found in an Ostria, carowsing healthes to
their good voyage, and taking leave of their friends in the city: to whose
company the Prince being come; albeit nothing acquainted with the conditions of
those people, yet he so framed his behavior to his habit, that it might have
been admired amongst the Courtiers, his quaint behavior, had they been
beholders thereof; pleasing so well these humorous companions with his
carowsing, courtesy, and bountiful expenses, that nothing he could require was
denied him. A wonder it were to tell you, when he required passage, with what
willingness they granted it, and what large proffers were made him of their
cabbins, and other sea courtesies: all which he accepted with such kindness,
and none more welcome than Dionicus; who standing on thorns to be clear of
his land, who^ love enforced without regard of father, crown, or subjects, to
leave, he hasteneth the rest aboard: of whose company the Mariners were not a
little joyful, for y^ the wind served the^ in such pleasing manner, to bring
the^ to their desired haven, whither (following the Masters direction for their
course, sailing with a fair gale, we leave them for a time, to tell you of the
grief of Manpelius, the Numedian king, for the loss of his son, of whom no
manner of news might be heard.

You have heard Gentles, with what policy the prince wrought, the better to
bring his purposed intent to pass, and what several pastimes, were by him
devised: in which several actions, it was supposed by the Courtiers, himself
would have been a chief, or at least, a beholder of their sportes. But he
which had more hammers working in his brains than one; taking that time as
fittest for his opportunity, gave them a cause of great sorrow, as you shall
hear. Whose sportes ended, and every thing with great credit to the actors,
and pleasure to the beholders finished, the King and Queen, whom age now
called to rest, after kind countenances, and many thanks to the Noble men and
Gentiles, bad the^ good night, who were in all humblenes and hearty love
commended to their rests, where let the^ rest, until the news of their sons
departure be brought them, by the woeful Barnardine, whose hearts surcharged
with sorrow, could hardly be comforted, but that through the extremity of his
grief, he had resigned his latest gasp to him who first gave him breath.

This woeful news was two whole days and more kept from the king, by that
mirror of fidelity Barnardine, who by all means either Art or travel could
imagine, enquired after the Prince, but of him could hear no tidings, whereby
many supposed he was slain: some coniectured one thing, some another. But
most of all the King and Queen, their happiness was such as may not without
great effusion of tears be remembered, which caused a general grief
throughout the whole Regiment. But neither sorrow of the subjects, nor
lamentation of their King, might recall him who they all so much desired to
see, which caused the King ouercharged with melancholy, rather desiring death
then life, breathe out these speeches.

Unhappy (Manpelius) and more unhappy, in being father to so graceless a
child, (oh Dionicus) why have I lived to see thee grown a man? tenderly
caring to bring thee to that estate? and now my chiefest hope was in thee to
have comfort, thus by thy unkind demeanor, to cause my grief: how happy be
those parents whose children live in obedience; but thrice accursed those
fathers which gives ye bridle of youth into their hands, who ought to be held
in, as the Colt untamed, with the hardest bit. Though wisdom presageth laws
of government to fathers, and experience of the Ancient which have lived in
elder times gives advise, crying out of such as gives liberty to yonglings,
yet law of nature whereunto we unhappy parents are too much tied, forgetting
all counsels, are so besotted on those careless yonglings, that if they desire
any thing, whether it be profitable for their instruction, or haleth them to
destruction, it may not be denied them: how many of high estate by the
careless regard of their untoward children, have been brought to great
heaviness? Or who taking pleasure in his offspring, can see him restrained, (I
but unhappy man) have thou not heard the learned Surgion often tell his tender
Patient, that it is better to smart once, then endure grief ever. And thou
that might have kept thy dear son under his Tutors custody, wherein he
lived in obedience, might so have had him still, if thy owns foolishness had
not been so careless of him. Then since thou have been the cause of thine own
sorrow, blame thy self, and sigh to think on thy follies: and as thou have
been the original of this mischief, not only robbing thy country of a
toward branch to succeed thee, but have lost to thy self the joy of a
father, in wanting thy son, thy life's sole happiness. Persuade thee, that as
many Countries have been punished for the Princes offenses, so this plague is
laid upon thy subjects for thy miss. Wherefore in sorrowing for thy sins,
and that God may show his mercy upon thy kind Country men, sorrow for thy
foppery, and abiuring thy* self from kingdom, wife, and Country, betake thee
to some unknown place, where thou may spend the remainder of thy over
worn years, in contemplation for thy sins, so may that God of all mercy,
which never turns his face from the penitent, receive thee to his grace, and
restore thy son, calling him from his youthful desires, to become a comfort
unto those which with many fault tears, and hearts full gorged with sorrow,
bewail his absence. Thus pouring forth his grief with sighs and many
brinish tears, uttering his sorrow, he resolved to leave all his earthly
possessions, and altogether forsaking the company of all mankind, live
sollitarie in some unfrequented place, until it would please God some tidings
should be sent him of his son, or else by death call him to those joys which
never shall have end. Thus for this time he ended his sorrowful speech,
uttered in great grief of mind, whom careful for to epsy time and
opportunity fit for his departure, we leave for a time. And shall tell you
further of the Prince Dionicus, who long before this time, is arrived in Thrace.

The Prince whom desire led to gain the love of Nutania, not otherwise
known but for a merchant, landed now in safety, after a friendly welcome
given to his fellow passengers, the Master and Owners, with bountiful
rewards bestowed on the Mariners, was lodged by the Master in a Merchants
house of great reputation, where unknown to be any other then he seemed, he
employed his stock by Brokers, to great benefit, which bountifully he
spent, whereby he gained the love of all men that ever had any acquaintance
with him, so that in short time his fame was so bruted throughout the City,
that none of any account, but took great pleasure in his company, and ioyed
to recount his many virtues. This amorous Prince whose heart was on his
halfepenny, loath to acquaint any man with his secret love to the Princes,
doubting some further peril to his person then he was willing to hazard,
would oftentimes intrude himself into the company of young Courtiers, amongst
whom he so demeaned himself, and so Courtly in all things, that all men
might judge from what tree such branches sprung. By this often frequenting of
the Court, in the company of those to whom he was most welcome, he atteined
the sight of his Lady, whose beauty, when he had seen, so amazed him, that
if he were before passionate, he was now more perplexed, judging her excellent
perfection to be without compare, yet not knowing how to make known his love
unto her, smothering in silence his affection, he daily desired some occasion
might be offered, wherein for her safety, and honor of his beloved, he might
show some act worthy honor, and to deserve her liking, which by Fortunes
assistaunce thus happily came to pass.

Mustopha Corienia, youngest son to Sutton Corienia, Emperor of
Constantinople, burning in love of this Princess, only by the rare report of
her singular perfections, had by Ambassadors from his father, craved the
Princess in marriage, who disdaining his love being a Pagan, although
honorable, might not be won by any entreatie to fancy him, how great soever
his offers and protestations of love were; which refusal, the Prince brooked
so ill, being of such might, that determining to gain her by force for his
concubine, which in friendship he had so often required to marry, he levied a
power of one hundred thousand, both on horse and foot, and shipping them in
warlike manner, in Galleys, Frigattes, Foystes, and Brigandioces, he arrived by
the hard labor and painful bowging of his slaves, before the City of
Lemonia, where Philarchus kept his Court, landing the greatest part of his men
and horse suddeinly, and beleagared the same, both by land and sea: unto which
he gave many fierce and hot assaults, and were as valiantly resisted, by the
courage of those gallant Citizens, who fighting in right of their Country,
feared not the hugeness of their Armies, nor their force of shipping, yet as
the extremes of foreign force causes many troubles, so did the Army of
Mustapha, drive these brave Thracians to many wants, whose courage through the
lack of victuals began to quail: that having no mean of relief neither by
sea nor land, loath to famish, came daily to the court, humbly beseeching the
King to take pity of them, and not with famine to suffer them die. But
considering that the Princess was the mark whereat he aimed, would rather
deliver her, who should be honorably entreated, then suffer so many thousands
to perish.

Philarchus, vexed in mind, was driven to a non plus, so diversely perplexed, he
could not suddeinly answer, his child who was his only comfort and heir,
either to be delivered him, whose name was odious unto him, or his subjects who
loved him no less then their own souls, must perish in this extreme. Thus
doubtful what to answer, he craved respite for two days, which they
willingly yielded unto, albeit their want of victualles was so great they might
hardly endure.

The report of this doleful suit of the commons coming to the ears of
Dionicus, who with his attire, we change to Pheander, who was not a little
moved there, and the greater was his heaviness by how much the more his love
was increased toward the Princess, for whose releef he sought many devises,
eftsoons determining one thing, then another presents it self, which seems
better: at length resolving least delays should breed danger, he determined
in that action which was honorable, to show him self, and either by his
prowess free the King and his beloved from the tyranny of the usurping
Infidel, or yield his latest gasp in their defense.

In this resolution he came to the kings presence, unto whom doing his humble
duty, prrostrating himself, he says.

Most gracious Sovereign, and liege Lord, pardon the bold attempt of a rude
stranger, whom dutiful zeal has bound to your service, and of your gracious
favor to all men, vouchsafe me that honor in this extreme, wherein your
worthy citizens stand, distressed by this faithless infidel, who does seek
your subversion and their utter decay: whose presumption, if it please your
Excellence to give me leave, shall by me, and such as I can by love and money
draw unto me, be chastened, and made to know your Highness can expel at
your pleasure, the power of a more strong and mightier enemy, who though you
have of courtesy suffered, it has not been of cowardice, as he shall well
understand. In this request, most gracious and renowned Sovereign, if it
shall please you to honor me, I doubt not (by the aid of the highest) of a
happy victory.

The King, which during his long tale, had earnestly noted the countenance,
and his grace in uttering the same, assured himself, that the honor of his
house, which showed in his courage, or the power of the eternal Deity wrought
this motion in him, and therefore without any longer pause, taking him
courteously from his knees, determining to try the fortunes of this supposed
Merchant, he says.

What ever thou be that honor urges to this attempt, thanks for thy love,
wishing my good, and forwardness in venturing thy life, yet before I accept
thee for my Champion, say (gentle friend) of what country art thou? what name
and parentage? to the end that I may give thee honor as thy deserts and
blood do require: and answering me truly to these demaundes, tell me what
moved thee likewise, being so brave a man, and in thy flourishing estate, to
hazard thy self in an action, wherein so many men of honor and great valor
have lost their lives.

Know renowned Lord (quoth the Prince) Numedia is my country, my father a
Gentleman professing martial Discipline, my name Pheander, the youngest of
many of my fathers sons, unto whom my minority denied such revenues and
liuinges as might sufficiently maintain my estate, which caused me to employ
my stock in trade of merchandise, by which in time of peace I gained in your
country wealth sufficient, which with my body I offer in your highness
service, and doubt not but to free thy princely daughter from this usurper,
whose virtue the world so much renowneth for, by that faith which I received
at the Font-stone, so long as I may breath life, never shall unhallowed Cur,
triumph in your Graces overthrow, nor in her dishonor.

The king over ioyed at these frank affairs of his champion, expressing by his
outward signs, the inward delight of his heart, and the desire he had to
accept this yonglings offer, taking great pleasure in his countenance, which
was lovely, and no way inferior to the best in his court for person,
wisdom, and other good graces, which with advise considered, he says.

Pheander, well do thou show thy self a Gentleman, for under the habit of a
Merchant Gentilitie cannot be hid, no poor estate can blemish the Noble, nor
adverse fortune whatsoever; but as gold is soon brought from the baser
mettels to his form by the skillful finer, so are the Noble known by their
virtues. Pheander, I have cause to honor thee for thy love and forwardness, as
also for thy country; which (without slattering thee, or any there abiding) I
love for your Kings sake. But to our matter, thou see (my deer Pheander) the
millions of cares heaped upon my gray head, through the oppression of this
heathen Prince, whereby I am made more miserable than the meanest subject in my
dominions; and the more is my misery, by recounting the wretched estate of my
loving subjects, whom I hold as dear as my life, and with that by resigning my
life and crown, I might free them from bondage, were it nothing else the tyrant
required. But toward Gentleman, whose love (wretch that I am,) I cannot
requite, my daughter (oh sorrow worse tha^ death to recount) Nutania, the only
solace of my life, and lines sole good, in whose weal consists my good, and
by violence offered her, what good can be tide me, she: she, my dear Pheander,
it is that drencheth my soul into so deep a hell, that almost forgetting my
self, living, I daily die; only recounting the miseries ^he should endure, if y^
tyrant triumphed in our overthrow: but he that in extremes sends comfort, has
revived me, and relieved my ouercharged heart by thy kind offer; whose courage
and hope of victory being such, as thou will hazard thy dearest blood for my
daughters freedom. Thanks (my good Pheander) is all that I can yet yield thee;
yet t^ad more courage to thy noble mind, fighting for us and our honor, my
daughter, for whose good thou aduenturest, shall inuest thee with the order of
Knighthoode, the first honor that ever she gave to man of Arms, and shall pray
for thy good success: so calling for the Princess, who was so discontent that
nothing could be pleasing unto her, who being come before him, after her humble
duty done, desirous to know her kingly Fathers will, he recounted the zeal
of the merchant unto her, who had not only offered his goods, but also his
proper life, to try in battle his fortunes against their enemy: wherefore
Nutania, quoth the king, for that he has so voluntarily offered the same for
thy sake, and I relying on my God, and in his prowes have accepted him for my
Champion, by thy hand he shall receive the honor of knighthood, his title, The
maiden Knight, and so prosper he in his honorable action, and in all others as
we wish, and himself desires.

The Princess, which diverse times had noted the courtly behavior of
Dionicus, was not a little pleased at her fathers motion, as one that in hearty
good will, wished him better then modesty would suffer her to utter; yet
harkening to her fathers speeches, she beheld him with more gracious
countenance, and vewing the lineamentes of his person, each grace well
regarded, she inwardly bewailed his hard hap, that the gods had framed him of
no better reputation than a merchant, who might well deserve the title of a
king, put from her memento, by recounting her fathers words, pausing thereon
sometime, with modest blushing countenance she said.

Kind sir, whose honorable service offered for my fathers good, and all our
weals, his subjects; if I yield you not such recompense as your deserts do
merit, blame me not of discourtesie, which have no better knowledge of you, but
accept the hearty thanks of a Virgin, unto whom I hold my self so far
indebted, as I can no other way recompense, then wishing your good; yet in
earnest of better good, refuse not at my hand to receive the honor of
Knighthood, seeing my Lords pleasure is such: and drawing his rapier, the
Prince kneeling, she invested him with the order, by name of the Maiden
Knight, and pulling a jewel of rich price from her gown, she tied the same in
a most beautiful scarffe, beseeching him to wear it for her sake, wishing all
happy fortune in his attempts.

The new adopted Knight, whose heart over ioyed for so great a favor received
from the saint his heart wholly honored, with many thanks dutifully rendered,
kissed the Princess hand, vowing himself her humble servant, and in all
places to maintain her modest beauty and Princely honor, with his dearest
blood.

The time thus passed, word was brought the King, that dinner was ready,
whereby they were interrupted, whom for a time we leave to their repast,
discoursing diversely at table, of the valor of the Maiden Knight, whose
towardness the King admired; which made his hopes the greater: not doubting
but his Champion would prove no less valiant in Arms then they exspected. At
which the Princess gloried not a little, and the Nobles pleased at both their
comforts, passed the time with more content then many days before, whom we
leave to their mirth, and the Maiden Knight, to the ordering of his affairs.

The Numedian King, exiling himself from his Court, in habit of a Pilgrim,
traveled many uncouth places in search for his son, of whom he could hear no
tidings, neither could Barnardine for all the industry he could use, attain
to any knowledge of him his heart so much desired: through which the heaviness
both of the Peers and Commons, were daily increased. And no marvel, when their
soueraign the mirror of all princely courtesy, had thus unknown, in the
declining of his age, when his years required rest, banished himself his
country, loving subjects, and what else he enjoyed: the grief of which so
oppressed the heart of the Queen, that nothing might yield her any comfort.
But pining in continual sorrow, utterly abandoning the worlds comfort, to
seek her comforter, whose dwellings are in the highest heavens, she yielded
her due to death, whose funerals, with the effusion of many brinish tears of
the Nobles, and sorrowful lamentations of her subjects, was performed with
such honor as to her estate required: whose obseques finished, Barnardine
regarding the benefit of the Commonweal, and the Princes good, of whom their
hope was to learn knowledge, used so kind persuasions to the whole estate, in
a parliament holden of purpose, that the regiment was delivered by consent, unto
six of the chiefest nobles, who were solemnly sworn to maintain the
dignities of the Crown, in absence of the king and his son, unto whom, being
lawful heirs to the same, they should resign their titles, whenever they
should challenge ye same. Now Gentiles leave we these distressed people,
lamenting their kings absence and the queens death, to tell you of the Maiden
Knight.

This gallant Prince, the hope of Thrace, careful of his honor, and not
unmindful of his new mistres, whose love was the mark he aimed at, hoping by
accomplishing this victory against the Souldane, to gain that place of
reputation with her that he desired: for the better accomplishing of which, he
proclaimed by sound of Trumpet, that all such as would in y^ action adventure
their lives with him, should bountifully be considered, all estates from the
Cauileare, to the Mercenary, caused many to offer him their sons, so that in
short time, he had gathered more able men the^ ever in so small warning were
seen; such was the love his bounty had gained among all estates, that of
their kindness many repaired, more then for of money, although the thought
thereof is able to draw ye coward to fight, so highly was this stranger honored.
The diligence was such of this Prince, that in short time he had his companies,
which were so furnished, as he lived not in those territories that ever saw the
like. Al things furnished for the field, he became an earnest suitor to the
Princess his mistress, to procure the king to view his army, which with small
suit she obtained for him, gracing him with all the favors she might, more
delighting in him then in all the men that ever she saw. The time appointed for
his muster, after he had given directions to all such Leaders and other
Officers, what course to take with their several charge, they were conducted
to the place appointed by himself, who mounted on a stately Courser, passed on
through the City, his Captains attired in Gascoin coats of watchet velvet,
having on the breast and back embossed with goldsmiths work, a Maiden head,
according to his devise on his arms, with the color of his mistress scarf:
every under officer in like suits of satin, his mercinary men in Iackets, hose
and hats colored alike, which caused the beholders, to admire the stranger
more then their princes. When the king beheld this mirror of honor, least
thinking he was son to his loving friend the Numedian king, and had with great
delight viewed each several officer and their charge, with their order of
march, and ranging in battle, all accomplished in such warlike manner, as
sildome he had seen: and withal noted his person, with his bravery in armor,
his gallant sitting a horse, and manuring the same, his charging, running, and
other signs of ensuing good, giving him great thanks, he caused him to
dismiss his companies for that time, to attend his pleasure at the Court,
which he caused suddeinly to be done, attending the kings pleasure at the
Court, as he was commanded: the news of his arrival being brought to the
Princess, who had seen with what cost and rare devises, each thing by her
servant was performed, judging likewise his love to her was some cause, by his
colors and devises, willing to let him know how graciously the same was
accepted, she came into the Presence, where finding her Knight, after she had
with a kind and loving Conge saluted him, calling him to a baye Window, with
a modest and comely grace she said:

Sir, how much I find my self indebted unto you, for your preffered service,
and forewardnesse in performing the same, I will not say, that in time what
wants in me to accomplish, my kingly father will recompense, who has seen and
well noted your diligence used for his safety, with your cost and great
charge, which he will not forget. In the mean time good servant, for so I will
henceforth call you, so you will vouchsafe to accept of the title; I will pray
for your good success and happy victory, whereby your renown may pass the
farthest parts of the earth, and our Country by your prowess delivered from
heathen thraldom.

Virtuous Princess answered the Maiden Knight, might it please your exellence
to conceive of my well meaning, as my desire is to deserve, my fortune might be
compared with the happiest that lives. For on the faith of a Soldier, and by
the Majesty of that saint my heart most adoreth, there is none breathing life
under the celestial globe, that shall command the simple service of Pheander,
but your Majesty, bound thereunto by your Princely favors. Enough my good
servant, quoth the Princess, I take your word, having great cause to believe
you, seeing your forwardness: But good servant, if I might under Benedicitie,
know the saint unto whom your devotions are bent, I would be so bold to offer
a virgins prayer at her shrine for your good success. The King over hearing
their talk, brake them off thus.

How now Madame, what have you that Gentleman at shrift, (if so) and that his
confection deserve a sharp penance, yet be good to him, he may in time amend.

Your grace (quoth the Princess) mistakes your self, your highness knows I
never took orders, therefore my authority is not to absolve, and if by
presumption I offend therein, I doubt the Fathers of our Church would reward me
thereafter. But to let your majesty know the truth, perceiving the desire he
has to do you service, I was bold to give him thanks: further recompense, I
leave to your exellence, who at your pleasure may better reward him.

Thou have well said daughter, quoth the King, putting me in mind what I
should do, least forgetting my honor to such as well deserve, I be reckoned
amongst the number of those Princes who with fair words and kind looks feed
their subjects, so long as they have either Patrimony or other to do them
service, to the utter overthrow of their posterities for ever, and they so
far in debt they dare not show their heads, then shall they get (perhaps)
some suite worth a hundred pounds a year, that have consumed many thousands,
maintaining a brave port, for his Princes honors. What said I? a hundred pounds
a year, nay, not that, without the favor of such as be cheifest in authority,
and are near the prince, whose good will if they can procure (it may be) they
shall obtain some small thing, scarce able to maintain the port of a good
yoman: for I tell thee, such must be pleased, or else let the princes mind be
forward to reward them, and by their bounty relieve their wantes, their good
natures by persuasion of such as think all too much which goes from
themselves, and such as they please to bestow it upon, shall be abused. Thus
have I heard gentle Knight, and grieve, that honor should so unkindly be
rewarded; or that any subject, should forget his duty* so much, as for his
own lucre, cause those that spend their blood in their countries defense,
their lands and possessions, with empty purses and heavy hearts, like men
forlorn to walk the streets: exclaiming on them that should see their service
better rewarded to the dishonor of the state they live in. This my Pheander, I
often recount, least in forgetting it, I fall to infamy by committing the
like; but he that gave me reason to know good, and to follow it, will never
suffer me to fall into so great folly, nor let me live, to forget those maimed
brave men, that venture for my good and my countries weal: for while I may
breath, the soldier shall be honored in Thrace, and shall reap the reward of
his merits, neither shall these Drones, which in such times of perils, hide
their heads, suck the honey off my garland. Like minds I wish all princes, with
careful eyes to look into the doings of such, who as the moth deuoureth the
fine cloth, consumes their princely reputation, and drawthe commons, who by
duty are bound to love, from their allegiance. While the king was in this
speech, word was brought him, that a Heralde from the camp attended his
pleasure at the gate, requiring parlie, which he suddenly granted, commanding
him to be brought to his presence: this unhallowed pagan, who never feared God,
nor was endued with any humanity, come unto the kings presence, with a shameless
countenance, used this peremptory speech.

King of Thrace, Mustaffa Cela, great commander of the empire, and general of
those royal armies, sends thee by me, thy choice either of wars or peace
(peace) if thou deliver thy daughter unto him whom he has so often required,
yet whereas his love unto her has been such, to make her his wife, his noble
mind dispiseth her so much, as his highness will never so much honor her, but in
despite of thee, and to abate the pride of that disdainful dame, he will use her
as his concubine; and when he shall have taken the flower of her virginity, give
her to the basest villain in his camp. Thou know my embassage: deliver her,
and live; or by me return thy resolute answer, for it shall not be many days
ere thy city shall flame with fire about thine ears.

The king vexed at this unexpected message, could not answer him, so moved
was his choler, yet with as much patience as nature would permit, he said:
Pagan, I have heard, and with great pain endured thy Lords peremptory
message: and that thou, and that Cur, from whom thou come, shall know the
great difference between a Christian and him, and that he understand how
honorable we hold the law of arms, I pardon thee thy life, which thy
presumption does require sharply to be punished. For answer to thy Lord, this
briefly say, his threats I regard not: for my daughter, as God has given her
me, and for she is the only joy of my aged life, I will shield her, and in
despite of the Pagan and his greatest power, defend her chastity: therefore
depart and say to thy Lord from me, his threats Iwey no more than the words of
a child: it is not his multitudes can dant me, were they ten times more then
they are, my daughter I will hold in despite of his beard, proud usurper that
he is. Thou know my will, make no stay.

The Herald noting the stern countenance of y^ king, and hearing his
resolution, thought it not good to stay a reply, least his tongue swelling in
his mouth, might not be eased without loss of his head; but glad to escape his
fury, conveyed him from his presence with all speed he could, posting to the
pauilion of the prince, unto whom he delivered the kings resolute answer,
which he no sooner heard, but like one besides himself, he vowed in three
days to be revenged of y^ old churl, who should fast the bitterness of his
youthful fury. Little knows this proud enemy, the preparation made to bid
him welcome, or that his own destruction was so near as after it proved. The
Maiden Knight, which with no small grief had endured this proud demand of the
herald, whose whole request was for dishonor of her, he so much honored, awaked
from melancholy, as out of a sound sleep, prostrating himself before the king,
he says: renowned Sovereign, with what grief I have endured the presumption
of this usurper, my heart denies my tongue to utter, neither shall I have joy
of any thing, til I revenge the wrongs offered your M. and your princely
daughter, upon that dog. Wherefore dread Lord, grant me license to issue out of
the city with my companies, in the silent of y^ night, and I hope ere long to
return his proud challenge, with my sword in his throat. Thanks good knight,
quoth the King, I accept thy offer as much as if thou had given me the whole
world in possession, yet would I not so forward a man should adventure himself
without my company, whose cause it is, my self will accompany thee in the
fight, and by my herald bid him battle, in which I doubt not of success.

The Knight was not a little moved, to hear his suit take no better success,
yet not willing to endure any competitor in the honor he hoped of, humbly
besought his Majesty of the honor he bare to Arms, in this attempt to give
him leave, and the rather for the reputation of the Princess, which had given
him his first honor.

The king which saw by his countenance how malecontent, he rested at this
denial, how loath so ever he were to grant the same, yet yielded to his
desire: and taking him from his knee, lovingly embracing him, he says. Brave
man at arms, take not in ill part, that I have denied, neither think that it
was in any sort to disparage you, or the hope I have of your forwardnes, but
for maintaining my own honor; yet seeing your will is to adventure for me,
go in Gods name, and he be your defense, that ever comfort his distressed:
and so pulling his signet from his finger, he gave it him, willing that it be
delivered to the Governor of the city, and let him understand, his Highness
pleasure was, that he with his army pass at his pleasure: and so taking his
humble leave of the king and gracious mistress, which affects him more then
he could conceive, he departs, more joyful of this honor, then to be richly
endowed.

No sooner parted he the kings presence, but slacking as little time as was
possible, he summoned his captains, and officers, straightly charging the^ with all the diligence he could use, to gather their companies, and to attend him in
the market place: in which charge, no negligence was used, so that by shutting
in of the evening, each captain with his charge both horse and foot, attending
the coming of their general; who was not unmindful of his business, and after
thanks given to their leaders, he marched with them to the gate that led them
to the camp of the Souldane, and was upon sight of the kings signet let out.
Thus marched the noble Prince, until he came half way between the camp and
the city, where he called his principal men together, and said.

Friends, and coparteners in arms, you are now to consider what we have taken
in hand, for that on our weal depends y^ whole estate of this common weal; if
we preuail, what good it is to be freed from such an enemy, there is not the
simplest but can conceive, having tasted the extremity which is incident to
wars, and the pleasure of peace. Contrary, the slauerye and servile lives
which these are compeld to endure that fall into their hands, you may imagine
by their opprobious usage of your gracious Prince, and example of other
Christians which have fallen into their hands. Wherefore now is the time to
show your selves in this battle, if you show your force, no doubt of happy
success, to your eternal commendations, and to the benefit of your Country,
and freedom of your wives, children, and families: with these and other such
speeches he so encouraged the hearts of his followers, as they vowed to follow
him with the hazard of their dearest blood.

When the Knight saw the willingness of his men, and that there resolution by
outward motions, were as he expected, after he had given them many thanks, he
made choice of five hundredth to bear him company. And after he had given
directions for the Army to follow, he with his elected company marched on as
closely as they might, for descrying of the enemy, who kept a Court of guard
not far from thence, upon whom in the dead of the night they entered, and
finding them at advantage, which little doubted any assault, having never before
bin assailed, were some sleeping, some gaiming, and others as ill employed,
surprised, and not one left to bear tidings of their ill fortune. This first
attempt well performed, he passed on with all speed toward the Camp, where
the Prince lay, suddeinly entered the same, where like a resolute and noble
Gentleman, he so behaved himself, that it filled the hearts of his followers
with great courage, who behaved themselves in such manner, that few escaped
with life, but such as were grievously maimed, so that they rather desired
death, then longer to live. The Prince, who was by one of his Bashawes
counseled to fly, as the least evil, for avoiding of death, was bravely
mounted on a swift running G^nnef, of which the Maiden Knight being informed,
leaving the fight, he poasteth after with so good speed, as the harmles Hare,
from the cruel jaws of the Greyhounds, such haste made this worthy
CConquerour, that in evil time for the Prince, he ouertooke him, accompanied
with twelve of his principal Bashawes, whom he with courage so assailed, that
in a moment he had vanquished them all, leaving some breathless, some without
arms, others without legs, no one escaped his fury. In which conflict the
Prince escaped, but all in vain, the Destenies had determined there to finish
the honor of that journey by the hands of the Maiden Knight.

Who ouertaking him, gave him so grievous a blow with his Curtler between the
neck and shoulders, as made him forget his way, saying, stay proud usurper,
and take my Lady the Princess with thee: And pulling him vehemently by all
the force he could by the helmet, unhorsed him, that the Knight verily
supposed, he had been slain: wherefore dismounting himself, he revived him
again, unto whom he said, My Lord, this is not for your honor to brave a
King in his own Dominions and in his Court, by your Heralde, and then to have
so small care of your word. In faith Pagane, for thy sake i will never credit
any Heathen on his word hereafter. Pity is it a Prince of your exteeme,
should after so many Lectures read, play the Trewant, (trust me) were I
your father, I should twigge the youth well, to learn him hereafter to be more
careful of his business. The Prince hearing himself so frumped, was more
grieved there at then all the loss he had received* Wherefore with a heart
full of careful heaviness* he says:

Brave man at Arms, what ere thou be to whom fortune has made me thrall, ill
beseems such words of disgrace to any one whom the Fates have overthrown,
but cursed my self which gave thee this opportunity, cursed that negligence,
which makes my foe thus to triumph in my fall. Thou Mahomet, suffer me not as
thou art a Prophet, to live thus disgraced, to behold the face of any man
surprised by so cowardly a curre, who daring not to thrust his head out of the
cennell but by stealth, has wrought my utter ruin and overthrow, taking his
advantage. But glory not in this victory, for it may be, thou shall have so
great cause to repent thee thereof, as pleasure to behold me now thy prisoner.

Your Lordship is disposed to be pleasant quoth the Knight, but it is the use
of Christians, to give losers leave to speak, if it so happen, my fortune
shall be the worse: In the mean time, your Grace shall be my guest, I have an
hosts provided, will bid you welcome, who by this time I doubt not does hear
of your coming, that you need not fear of your dinner.

The Prince full of heaviness, could not tell what to answer, wherefore
Arming himself with all the patience he could to endure it, he was by this
Conqueror, commanded to horse.

Long had they not ridden toward his Army, but he was encountered by diverse
his Captains, who missing their General, at haphazard put themselves in
search for him, and happily well they met him, who rejoicing for his good
fortune, taking the Prince prisoner, they recount unto him, the ruin and
spoil of the whole Army; for which their diligent courage and valor showed,
he yields them most great and hearty thanks, beseeching them to take
charge of his Army, and divide the spoil amongst them: which done, repair at
their pleasures to the City, while he with his prisoner, made haste to the
Kings presence.

The tidings of the Knights success, was by some such as honored him, with
speed reported at the Court, in which no part of his honors was left
vnrecounted, whose policy and valiantness in Arms, the King with all y^
Courtiers admired: Imagining him by these worthy deeds of Chivalry, to be
the only man at Arms, deserving honor, in all that Region: of whom there was
no small joy, and such fame and renown of his actions, as both in City and
Court there was no talk but tended to the honor of the Maiden Knight, which
liked not the Princess Nutania a little, to hear her servant in these his
first attempts, venturing for her to have such fortunate success, so that
where she had but begun to like him before, (Cupid) that commands the
mightiest, began most furiously to assail her, that her tender heart
vanquished therewith, was enforced to yield her self a slave to his deity:
and giving over other courtlike delights, bend her whole study in seeking
which way to win her best beloved to her liking, for the accomplishing of
which, many ways were devised, but none thought sufficient; so that resting in
a laborinth of confused thoughts, commanding her attendants from her, she said:

Nutania, what wretch that lives, enjoys not more sweet content then thy
self, who yielding to follow the follies of thy youthful mind, have planted
thy love thou know not on whom, a stranger, and of no more reputation then
a Merchant, a base Trade, and most frawdulent, as I have heard many Nobles
discuss, whereby they obtain to great wealth: and by their extraordinary
means, wring such young Gentlemen as are forced to have to do with them, from
their ancient Patrimonies, making of Noble men and Gentiles of great worship,
beggars, and their own base-born brats, to become young masters, which in
time, and small time, consumes that in riot, which their miserable fathers, by
extortion, false reckonings, insatiable vsery, and other loose dealings, sold
their souls, the precious Image of our Savior, to the devil. But wretched
wretch* whither wandrest thou: these be no points for thee to stand upon, thou
have now vied the game, and art bound by such a band as there is no remedy but
see it thou must: therefore leave to discourse what he was, or has been. Thou
hear by general report of all men, he is honorable, in wars valiant,
bountiful, and endued with all manner of Gentilmanlike conditions, which
argues him descended of better parentage, then he will acknowledge: And
therefore cease not to love him, who by all conjectures, if outward shows
proceed of the motion of the heart, regards thy honor; then requite his
service Nutania, and seek in time to quench that flame, which begins but yet
to warm, lest increasing by little and little, it consume thee. In extremes the
Noble mind is best known, happy are they accounted, which forewarned can
eschew a mischief; If thou can win thy Love, what creature may be compared
with thee for happy content? Be resolute Nutania, fear no colors, thy love
is planted on such a one, who for his virtues may be mated with the greatest
Princess on the earth: then stand not on terms of his being, but determine to
love him, faint hearted soldier never gained conquest, if he be base, thou
may advance him. Thou art heir to the Crown of Thrace, and thy fathers sole
delight, who then should gainsay thy will herein, (fathers sole delight said I)
yea there Nutania lies a block which thou can hardly remove. Thy father,
what will he aged King say? when he shall hear of thy love so basely planted,
which have refused to be wife to two famous Kings, requiring thee with great
suit in marriage: Refrain fondling from this rash determination, let thy
fathers love be a rain to hold thy unbridled will, fear his displeasure
which gave thee life, and seek not by thy folly to bring his head with sorrow
to his grave, which if thou persist, will be such a corasiue to his heart, and
such a stain to thine honor, as the memory of Nutanias disobedience will
never be raced out. With these and such like motions of good, she sought to
withdraw her love from him, that for birth and other noble actions deserved her
better, albeit unknown to her: but what ever he be, the more she sought to
suppress the flame of her love, the more it increased, that without regard of
fathers good, or her own honor, she determined to love him, yea the Maiden
Knight with his Prize, was arrived at the Court, whom the King and Nobles
welcomed with all courtesy they could show, as joyful of his safe return,
who had so honorably borne himself in that action, as if he had conquered
Europe, which kindness to the knight, was recompense sufficient for all his
charge and hard adventure.

The Princess, who was awaked from her studies by report of the knights
coming, sumptuously attired as she could, as beseemed her estate, accompanied
with all her troop of Ladies and maids of honor, came unto the Presence, who
no sooner approached the place where the knight was, but beholding the
exquisite perfection of her beauty which he so much delighted in, was sodeinly
bereaved of his senses, so that he stood as a man which had lost himself, yet
reuyuing, loath to make manifest what with great grief he had consealed so
long: humbly on his knees, presented the glory of his enterprise unto her,
saying, Most gracious Princess, as by your most excellent hands I received my
first step to honor, and fighting for your Graces and Kingly fathers sakes,
it has pleased God to prosper me with a happy victory, for which good, having
nothing worthy to present your Grace as I desire, yet in knowledge of my duty
to your Exellence, to whom my life and service is devoted, I humbly beseech
you, accept this Gentleman my prisoner, and your Noble fathers mortal enemy.
The Princess to whom nothing could be more pleasing, the^ the sight of the
beloved knight, graciously accepted the prisoner, rendering great thanks for
the same, as also for his valor showed in their defense. And then turning to
the captiued Prince, she said:

My Lord, you see the chance of Fortune, and how mutable she is in all
actions, sometimes fawning, sometimes frowning, but whether by your fortune, or
cowardice, or both, you are now at their mercy, whose overthrow you assured
your self of, and which you more desired then all territories of the earth,
but our God which never suffers his servants to perish, has mightily
defended us, it is not your mighty powers can daunt the hearts of Christians,
whose God is their guide: neither regard we them at all as a matter of any
trust, your eyes can witness, who having an Army able as you thought to have
vanquished all Christendom, is by a handful to your multitudes surprised. Yet
dismay not my Lord, a Maiden is your Iaylor who will use you more honorably
then you can imagine, or your hard threats deserves. The Prince which saw the
beauty of the Princess, whom he so earnestly upon reports had desired, was
astonished greatly, holding the fame that was bruted, to be nothing to her
worthiness, therefore accusing himself of great impiety, that had borne Arms
against the only Paragon of the earth, and not by courtesy have continued his
love begun, ashamed of himself, he says.

Renowned Lady, Fortunes darling, and Bewties chief pride, though mishap has
made me of a Prince and heir to the mightiest Potentate of the earth, a
captive, and that by thy champion I am dishonored, and my power vanquished,
crosses which may cause the stoutest that ever lived, to cry out on Fortune,
and to curse the Destinies, yet am I comforted in y^ sweetness of your words,
which disdaineth to use the utmost cruelty you might, or take his life that had
vowed to use you with more extremes, then if by the greatest torments I could
have afflicted you withal, I had caused you die many thousand deaths, if it
were possible so many could ^e incident to one body. Had I prevailed of thy
courtesy famous Princess, I cannot say what I would, but vow unto thee by the
honor of my fathers Crown, while I breath to remain a true liegeman unto
thee virtuous Nutania, whose courtesy has subdued my chollor, and put my
oppressed heart from a million of cares wherewith it was oppressed. My Lord quoth
the Princess, your Lordship is merrily disposed, indeed women are gods
children, won with a toy, such fools they are, yet my Lord, I would you did
know, how little I esteem the flattery of men, of what estate soever, they would
spend their frivolous speech elsewhere: for your Lordship, though you please to
jest, I thank God you have such cause so to do, whom I praise for the victory
received, and next his duty, my servant for his pains employed for our
safety. And with these words, she gave him so gracious a look, as well might
the standers by see it was not feined, but that her speech spoken in his
praise, proceeded of the inward motions of the heart, which of the captive
Prince was not unperceived, which caused him to reply thus.

Madame, for avoiding of that odious sin of flattery, which my heart has
ever contemned, I dare not say what I would, yet seeing the destinies are so
pleased to yield me a prisoner to my enemy, I reckon my unhappiness the
less, which have so gracious a Lady for my keeper, of whom, expecting no
better then death, I am by your comfort quite deprived of that fear. And for
this noble Gentleman, how Fortune and the Fates has favored him in this
victory, wherein I am so dishonored, every man cannot conceive. But were the
honor thereof a million more, yet not to be weighed in the balance where your
Grace does counterpease the same, which is more to be esteemed then the worlds
good: how you hold him in regard I know not, but if an enemies praise may any
way honor him, I say; and with my blood will avouch, that for his valor, none
lives on the confines of the earth his equal; wherefore madame, boast you of
his worthiness which is peerlesse, and worthy for all perfections, to be
honored of the mightiest Monarke that lives.

Thanks my Lord, quoth the Princess, for your good opinion of my servant, I
doubt not but he will say as much for you, when opportunity shall serve, who I
assure you, is as courteous, as otherwise honorably endued. While they were
thus pleasantly discoursing, word was brought the King, that Theophilus Prince
of Thessaly, who by the outrage of a cruel storm, had suffered shipwreck,
was found on a raft, driven a shore upon the farthest parts of his confines:
where being unknown to any his subjects, but by his own report, was by the
Gentlemen of his country entreated, as beseemed his estate: and accompanied
with a princely train, was within half a days journey of the Court. The
sudden report whereof, brake their talk, the King commanding his train
presently to be ready horssed to accompany him, who with diligence failed not
to obey his command: and so orderly marching through the City, they ride
easily paced, until they meet the stranger King, between whom great
courtesy was used. The King gave thanks and loving countenance to the
Gentlemen, who had to their great cost so honored him, by enterteining this
stranger, whereby his country was made famous. Thus with diverse discourses
they passed the time till they came to the Court, where a stately lodging was
puruayed for him, and Officers appointed to attend his person, as royally as if
he had been in his own Palace, where solacing with the King and his Nobles,
we leave him, to return unto Pheander the Maiden Knight, whose entrails frying
with the scorching flames of his mistress beauty, had so much changed his
color, and impaired his strength, that enforced by great grief and extremity
of his love, he withdrew him to his chamber, where casting himself on his bed
with a million of careful thoughts, eftsoons, determining to seek the
Princes favor. And then by contrary motions, fearing the success of his
suit, carrying the report of no better then a Merchant, which might give cause
of great dislike, and disparage his suit, he says, miserable Dionicus, whom
the Fates continually causes by their hard hap daily to complain, cursing the
time of thy nativity, and the stars which governed thine aspects, which
neither time or place can remedy, faint hearted wretch, that seeking thy own
overthrow, increases thy grief by consealing the cause. Leftes not thou thy
Princely father, to come hither, where thou might enjoy the presence of thy
beloved mistress, and in doing her service, to acquaint her with thy love? and
coward like shamest thou to let her know thy zeal, whose courtesy is without
compare, and every way shows in what regard she holds thee, that has
procured her liberty in aduenturing thy life? a pleasure that of a thankful
mind can never be forgotten. What know thou whether her love be as much to
thee, whom womanly modesty denies to reveal, else might thou happily know
it? No, no, fondling, thy fortune is not so happy, which ever has lived in
unhappiness, yet despair not, nor like a wretch die in thy Cabenet, Rowse
thee, and consider what thou art, give not over thy desires to miserable death,
without acquainting her with thy love: spare to speak, and spare to speed, A
Proverb not so old as true, which if thou follow, will either give thee
comfort by her courteous grant, or by denial, hasten thy death, by which thou
shall be freed from these torments; enjoying life, and living, enjoy thy sweet
delight, or by death, end^ these torments. In this resolution, having banished
despair, arming himself with hope of good success, stretching his weak
limbs, he hasteneth to the Presence, whose absence had been noted of most
Courtiers attendant there, but especially of the Princess, who (albeit) found
the company unfurnished, wanting his company, yet durst not enquire of him,
doubting the suspicion of iealious eyes: But Fortune who had so long spurned at
him with her foot, gave him this opportunity to raise him, whom* she had
like to have overthrown, chauncing to look out of a window which opened into
a Park belonging to the Court, he espied the Princess, pleasantly passing
the time with her Train of Ladies, which opportunity he was not willing to
lose, but with all such speed as his fainting legs could make, revived by
the sight of his sweet chase, with all sails spread, in short time he
recovered his wished desire, who was no sooner of the Princess seen, his
humble duty done, and she having requited the same, giving him the time of the
day, with a most pleasant and friendly countenance, she challenged him of
negligence, whom she had not seen in two or three days: and leading him
politikely, pretending matter of importance, to impart unto him, from the
company, she brought him near the side of a fair Copes, which so
ouershadowed them, that the Sun beams could not offend them, where they
might both boldly say whatsoever it pleased them, without being heard or seen
of any, which might interrupt them, which caused her take opportunity to
discuss with him thus. Servant quoth she, I pray thee say, of ye duty thou
have vowed thy mistress, and by those sweet thoughts which are best pleasing
unto thee, what is the Lady to who^ thy love is dedicated? for love doubtless
thou do, thy countenance bewraieth it, which I have noted, with more regard
then becomes a maiden: yet of care to thee, whose health I tender, for thy
courtesy and good service done, which I would requite in the best manner I might;
and for thy looks shows thy heart craves to be pitied of thy Lady, let me
know her, who may chance stand thee in some steed, for women may prevail much
one with an other. The Knight wrapped into a heaven of joys, hearing the
goddess of his devotion, with such favor and kindness to use him, with a
blushing countenance standing at the bar, before her, whose sentence
pronounced, was either life or death, he says: Honorable and gracious
mistress, give me leave so to call your highness, since you have dained a
captive the title of your servant, and pardon my presumption, answering your
demand; that I love I cannot deny, which argues your skill in physic great
(whom) my tongue is restrained to reveal: but if your highness could judge
whose love I most adore, and long have, and judging, ease me, I should have
cause to say, no physic proferer on the earth whatsoever, might compare with
my gracious mistress for skill; I dare say no more, fearing to offend. The
Princess all this time gazed on the perfection of her servant, as deeply
enamoured on his perfection, as the Knight inueagled with hers, for her eye
made a survey of his excellent feature, which she found more perfect, by how
much the more she had bent her liking to love him. Thus love which had assailed
both their hearts, endued them with such a si^pathy of joy, beholding themselves
all alone, that with over much joy they were stricken mute, so that how much
soever their hearts desired, to let each other know their loves, they could
not reveal the same. In this heaven of happy content they had not long been,
Guenelia a Lady, that attended the Princes, brought her word, the King her
father, with the King of Thessaly, was coming into the Park, which place they
had chosen to recreate themselves: Where passing on by fair Paris, they
diligently listen to the sweet records of the pritie birds, who skipping from
tree to tree, gave as well the content beholding it, as the ear pleasure in
their notes, great was the delight they received, viewing the beauty of the
place, which for pleasant walks, sweet groves, and fruitful trees of all
sorts, was matchless, into which many pleasant brooks had recourse: on the
banks of which, finding the place bewtified with Natures gifts, they sat them
down earnestly beholding the pleasure of the fishes, how pretely they chased
one the other, with many a pleasant conceived toy, which they noted, censuring
of each several action, as they thought best to increase their mirth. When
some time was spent on this pleasant manner, Philarcus King of Thrace, finding
himself all alone with the King of Thessaly, having never questioned of him
his unhappy fortune, began with him thus.

Let it not be displeasing unto thee famous King, that I intrude my self so
far into thy familiarity, to require the cause of your graces travail,
through which your life was so dangered, if you vouch^a^^ me this favor, you
shall command a matter of more import, so please it you, at my hands.

The Thessalian King, attending this un(...) question, was driven into such
(...) thoughts, that his color showed better his discontent to recount it,
then his tongue ableness to answer the kings demand, how willing so ever he
was to satisfy him, yet after some pause taken, he says:

Right courteous, and mirror of the world for Nobility, though nothing can be
more displeasing to my grieved heart, then recounting my adverse fortune, yet
that your Grace shall not find any ingratitude in me, at whose hands I have
received such honorable entertainment, attend me.

It is not many years since Mantonna my father deceised, who left me (unhappy
I) his successor to inherit the crown, which I did not long enjoy, before
Donatia King of Egypt, required of me my sister in marriage; who being
beautiful, and in the flourishing time of her years, having not yet attained
to the full of fifteen, young enough to be bestowed, yet of that wisdom, that
I referred ye choice of her love to her own liking, induced* thereunto by the
many evils happening by such made marriages, where the children are forced by
the covetous desires of their parents, to join wealth to wealth, others for
great patrimonies; all for lucre, few or none for love. But whether the beauty
of my sister Phedera (for so was she called) or the desire of her dowry, which
was great, or either of them, or both, I cannot say, ^ut my sister being made
acquainted with his suit, I craved her answer, for which his Ambassadors
attended in my Court, with the best entertainment I could give, whom my sister
Phedera with her own mouth answered (woe is me) unhappy the tongue that
pleaded denial to his suite, but most of all, unhappy the hour when first of
all he determined to crave her at my hands, in whose power it was not to
grant: no sooner arrived his Nobles at the Court, and he scarslie had received
the sum of her answer, but as one bereft of all honor, reason, and
government, he vowed revenge on me and my country. And leuying a mighty power
both of horse and foot, assailed me in mine own territories, whom by the
mighty power of the Almighty, I expelled my land, to their great dishonor,
and no small loss to my subjects: yet how great soever his overthrow was,
(an honorable mind I must say) were the cause just, he ordained a mighty
power by seas, whereof being by my espyalles advertised of the time as near as
they could guess they would be ready, with a power well shipped and furnished,
I met him near his own Confines, where a mortal fight was begun, and most
valiantly continued, neither side giving any show of fainting. But alas, too
soon comes that grief which meiteth my heart into thousands of tears, to
recount the Admiral of mine own Squadron, being suncke, and two others forced
by the cunning hand of their Gunners, to lie by the Lee, the rest fainted:
which being perceived of the enemy, they boorded, and by hundreths entered my
ships and galleys, who were valiantly repulsed. But men can do no more then
God will give them leave, so long they continued the fight, that the scupars
gushed blood, as they had often with the water delivered by the Pomp. And here
lay one maimed, and there a number slain. This pitiful stratageme, when my
heart with heaviness beheld, being so hardly assailed, my self, after that I
was cleared from the Fleet, the wind favoring me with a happy gale, and my
ship being good of sail, I forsook the fight, in hope to have recovered in my
own Country, and by a new supply, have given him welcome thither. But my
hopes herein deceived, a boisterous storm growing, the sea who is merciless,
arose in extremity, swelling with such outrage, that my weak bark no longer
able to endure her cruelti^, was put against our wills on thy coast, my Pylot
unacquainted with the same, and a hoary mist over spreading the land, sodeinly
the ship stuck, being near the shore, which drove us to great terror. To
remedy the which, the Mariners did their best, but in vain strive they that
labor against his will that commands all. (What should I say) the outrage
of the storm was such, as forced the ship upon the Lee shore, which gave us all
cause to remember our maker, and with hearty prayer to crave his assistance:
but our comfort, was comfortless, our ship split, and we all driven to make
what shift we might, my self happening on the main yard, after that I had been
grievously beaten at sea, the whole night was driven a shore on your Confines,
I never heard of any other that were saved. With this the tears restrained his
speech, that he could not speak, which moved the King to more pity of his
estate, and friendly embracing him, he said; No more my Lord at this time, I am
sorry that I have given you such cause of grief, thus by recounting so
lamentable a state, renew your passed griefs. But comfort good King, when
tides be at the lowest, they spring again. If the Egyptian King be so
extreme, reason with courtesy will not content him, the cause being no other,
but to force the love of a woman unto him, of which, perhaps he were better be
without: On the word of a King, and by my honor I swear, I will not leave you,
until I see you settled in your kingdom. Thus the King whom sorrow had
ouerburthened, was by the comfort of this noble King his host, recomforted,
whose whole study was now in preparing of an Army to aid him, to which care
we leave them.

Nutania, whose restless passions neither time nor place could alter, burning
in these remediless thoughts, considering the penance her loving heart was
like to endure, she fell into this humor.

Nutania, how have the Fates ordained to make thee unhappy? that thou being
delivered from an oppressing enemy, then steps in love to begin a new
Tragedy. Thou see her fawnings is but flattery, then seek to eschew them,
enter not too far in the forde, least minding but to wet thy shoe, thou plunge
over head and ears. Thy years albeit not many, with the examples of others,
whom then have read, may learn thee to be wise: if thy fancy be fixed on such
vanity as may breed thy sorrow, expel it as thou may, suffer not love to
harbor in thy heart, for harbored, he commonly pleades possession; and once
possessed, neither force, nor entreatie may remoone him, so ambitious a tyrant is
he, that void of pity, against law and all hostility he holds what he
list. Alas Nutania, if thy enemy be such what avails thee; thou may wish
to be freed from his tyranny, but can never avoid it, so imperious is he,
yet not manly, but as a Coward, making the breach where the wall is weakest:
poor women is the mark, whereat most commonly he aymeth, who being by nature
pitiful, are easy to believe, and by ^oo light credit, are taken by them
they best like of. Thus (poor wench) do thou nothing but heave feathers
against the wind, which return into thine own eyes: thy speeches uttered in
loves dishonor, will be challenged, and like a traitorous Rebel to his Deity
shall thou be convicted, arraigned and condemned, for deprauing his Godhead. If
it be death (fondling) to speak against the majesty of a Prince, what is it
to contemn the powers above? The best remedy thou have is reconciliation,
wherewith the Gods are pleased; and heartily sorrowing for thy miss, yield thy
self vanquished, and yielding, seek by favor, to attain the end of thy
desires. Thy love is matchless, and doubtless honorable, his countenance
shows the true badge of Nobility, and his valor and bounty do answer
what his other perfections promise: I have often heard it spoken, that women's
helps in extremity have been great; if that be true proof Nutania, call thy
wits together, and so end thy torments, by enjoying thy hearts content, so
much discontent by yielding to the same.

Thus resolved, without longer stay she called unto her Guenela, her chief
attendant, who from her infancy had been brought up with her: In this Guenela,
she conceived her greatest hope, unto whom she said: Guenela, since I had
reason to discern good from evil, thou know how I have tendered thee, and
how willing I would be to seek thy preferment: make trial when thou please,
so shall thou be assured of that, which justly thou may hold in suspense. But
leaving these coniuring words, I must Guenela, commit unto thy secrets, a
matter of import, whereon my honor and reputation depends: for I tell thee
Guenela, I have made choice of thee amongst, all those which I may command, as
of her I love, and have best cause so to do, having had such society, else
should I rather choose to dye ten thousand deaths, then reveal it.

Guenela, which had her whole hope of good from the Princess, hearing her
speeches, with tears standing in her eyes, proceeding of joy, for the honor
done her by her Lady, protested unto her by heavens maker, and what else he
framed, to be secret in her determinations, and do her best endeavor to
accomplish whatsoever she commanded. The Princess taking her word for
current, in whom she never found deceit, said; Guenela, that it is incident to
all creatures in their kind to love, I know thy wits be not so simple, but
thou can conceive, and he that frames us, directs our likings as best
pleases him, be it prince or beggar, from the highest to the simplest, and he
my Guenela, has linked my liking to a most brave toward Gentleman (on whom I
think) if affection which is blind, deceive me not, is worthy to be mated
with the greatest in degree on the earth. To keep thee with frivolous speech,
is no time now, having other matter enough to discourse: therefore that thou
may know him to whom my love is united, Pheander the new adopted Knight is
he, (Pheander) famous for his valor, renowned for his bounty, and admired
for courtesy, he, he, Guenela, is the joy of my heart, (and my hearts sole
delight) without whom I cannot live, no, I will not live, I, neither may I live,
such is the service my heart has vowed in love unto him: therefore if thou
love me as thou have professed, by thy industry seek to ^aue my life, which
cannot but perish not obteining my desires.

Guenela, listening to her discourse, willing to become second in this Comedy,
had her brains beating already in search of the charge committed unto her,
yet would she not answer any thing sodeinly, considering how displeasing
speeches spoken out of time, be unto lovers corasiues: yet chearing the
Princess, she requested until the next morning, respite for answer, which
the Princess granted, affying greatly in her which was wise and well demeaned,
many ways (sometime doubtful) sometime pleasing, sifted her senses to the
proof, whom to her study we leave.

The Maiden Knight, whose extremes were far more (if more might be) after his
abrupt parting with his mistress, that he grew so melancholy, as nothing were
it vyandes to relieve his weak corpse, neither the daintiness of pleasing
sweet Music wherewith his friends presented him, might any way delight him,
so that in outrageous manner, he exclaimed on his misfortune, cursing the
tidings bringer of the Kings repair to the Park, and his tongue for not
revealing his grief, his Physician so ready to hear, that dispairing of his
hope to enjoy her, he was likely to mischief himself: yet reason affirming,
that the learnedest Physician could not discover the disease of his Patient,
without he show it, how near soever he guess. Entering further in
consideration of her favorable speeches, shaking off fear, like a hardy
soldier, he determined in writing to let her know his love, since he had no
hope to meet her again at the like advantage. Therefore like the condemned,
hoping of pardon, lives the Knight, yet desirous to be resolved, either of
comfort or despair, he calls for Pen and Ink, and write thus. To(...)
willingly vouchsafe him as partner of her best fortunes, yet making a kind
denial, she said; Sir, though I could willingly do you more service, then
modesty will I acquaint you with, it is not the part of our Country
Gentlemen, to make peasts of Gentlewomen, having Pages fit for the purpose: if
I refuse your request, attribute it to no discurtesie in me, which am very
loath to offend her highness, not knowing whether the sentence of your paper
may discontent her or no. That many messengers have incurred displeasure, yea
and loss of life as the cause has deserved, I hope it is not unknown unto
you, yet has the harmless messenger known as little what he carried, as I
desirous to know of you.

Sweet Guenela, quoth the Knight, that it is wisdom to beware by others
harms, I deny not, yet is it discurtesie to deny the request of a Gentleman,
which have ever showed my self a dutiful servant to his highness, and
honoring him, can I frame my heart to preiudise that Lady of incomparable
virtue? No, no, heavens never permit me life, to offend her in the least sort.
Therefore doubt no such matter, for on the word of a Gentleman, my life shall
be offered and freely given, to excuse thy friendship, wherein I am so greatly
pleasured by you. Guenela, noting by the often changing color in telling his
tale, his heart was not his own, but had some more business in hand then he
would impart, loath to offend his patience by her denial, said; Sir,
persuading my self of your loyalty, I will for this time become your
Ambassador, although it should impair my credit with her Exellence, whose
favor I hold as dear as my life, and that you shall assure your self of my
trustiness herein, so please it you to meet me in this place to morrow, by
that time the Suns power shall have drawn the deawe from off the earth, I
shall return you answer as you desire.

Thanks good Guenela, for thy courtesy, assure you I will not dye in thy debt,
if ever Pheander may requite it by any industry. In the mean time quoth he,
favor me so highly as wear this for my sake, and pulling off a Dyamond of
great prise gave it her, which she was loath to accept, yet giving thanks for
his courtesy, she said:

Sir, would you did understand, I prise not my pains, that you should reward me
with hyre, or do you good in hope of benefit* or as it is unfitting a gentle
woman to take gifts bestowed in such manner, so is it discurtesie and no part of
a woman like condition, to refuse the gift of a friend: therefore accept my
thanks, till I may better deserve it. Thus time passing away, Guenela taking
her leave, departed toward the Princess, and the Knight to his lodging,
where, how many sundry thoughts assailed him, I leave to them, that have
endured the like.

Guenela, come to the Princess presence, by her pleasant iesture was of the
Princess perceived, who was jealous of her being acquainted with her malady,
who calling her to her bed side, she enquired where she had spent the time so
long from her, knowing that all her Attendants were combersom unto her, but
only Guenela, with whom she might pass the time in discoursing her love.

Madame, duty commands me, answer your demand, yet having been to search some
dainty that might yield delight to your weak stomach, and cause better
d^gesture, by chance prying in ye guard in for such things, I was encountered by
the best skild in the dominions of Thrace who gave me a receipt, which I judge
by my simple skill, will give your Majesty great ease; yet does the Physician
doubt whether your stomach will digest it. This gracious Lady* quoth Guenela,
has been the cause of my absence, and no other. (Alas good wench) how am I
beholding to thee, that caring to recover my strength, searchest the depth of
thy skill, but Guenela in vain s^ekest thou her health, whom no phisitia^ with
all his herbs, drugs, and simples, balmes, emplaisters, or what Art may
provide, can remedy, only God the great commander must by his grace bring my
desires to end, or by death, end my days of life.

What Madam, ever in this tune? once alter these discords which makes your
music iar, and sing y^ belief with a cheerful voice, so may your mind be a
little eased, and the receipt I have to minister, work with the more effect: I
speak this Madam, of experience, for every skillful Physician will prepare the
body of his Patient, before he minister. Therefore Madam, if you will shake off
this melancholy, you shall have a taste of what I promise, if not, your grace
must pardon me, it were great pity so precious a thing should be cast away.

Well Guenela, quoth the Princess, thou art disposed to cross me with thy
words, which does but increase my disease, yielding small comfort: therefore
leaving those Jests, say me my good wench, if thou have ought will do me good?
(if not) use me no more thus unkindly, least overcome with the extreme of my
grief, I chance to say with my tongue* what my heart will repent, or use my
hands with such rygor, as becomes not a maiden.

The Gentlewoman seeing the wind blow so warm, fearing as much as was
promised, seeing the Princess impatience such, thought not good to tempt her
above her strength, for women being by nature warm, with a little f^wel will be
made hot, past reason: wherefore, making a preamble to her discourse, like an
eloquent Orator began thus.

(Pheander) with that word, making a long pause, to note the Princess
countenance, on the sudden naming her beloved, was interrupted thus; Pheander?
Guenela? what frantic humor causes thee to name him in this manner, with
whom thou had never anything to say? Madame quoth Guenela, attend the rest,
before you either condemn me, or commend me. Then proceed quoth the Princess.

This Pheander, of whom my tale is before your Exellence to be told, is that
Knight who of your majesty is called the Maiden Knight, this Knight as it is
told me, loves a Lady, but who^ I cannot declare, before I know: but as it is
told me by his dear friend which knows the secrets of his heart, so tormented
is he in his passions, that the night naturally made for rest, (restless) he
consumes in great discontent, (the day) wherein all creatures delight, is unto
him loathsome, so that through watching, and refusing his diet, with other
cares which cloyeth his stomach, his lovely face is altered from the sanguine,
unto the yealow colored Saffrone, (yea Madame) these mine eyes are witnesses
of it, who this day saw him pass into the Court, so feeble, that his weak
legs might hardly endure the weight of his body. No more of this my sweet
Guenela, least thy tongue busied too long on this Tragedy, overcome with the
extremity of my grief, I ^e enforced to seek an end of my torments by
dispatching my own life. Oh Guenela, is this thy comfortable confection? Is
this the relief thou preachest off, which would yield me such quiet of mind?
Unhappy Lady, why should I live to see another enjoy my Love? Is not Pheander
my servant? have not I made choice of him? and shall another no way worthy to
enjoy him, have that interest which might delight the Goddesses? Peace Nutania,
whither romest thou? let reason subdue rage, let not every one know thy love
to Pheander, but conceal it as thou may, and seek some secret devise to
give thy heart ease, by death which is thy best remedy: yet would I live to
become a succor for the well deserving Knight, and gain his hearts desire for
him if I might. Cruel were that ^ame and not worthy to enjoy the simplest
groom, which caus^es for love, consumes such a man in all perfections and
liniaments of body, as Pheander, without yielding him love. But hearken
Guenela, that thou may in time when my body shall be intombed among the
dead, report unto my Love, (and loving Knight) how dear I held his love, as my
countenance often showed, (though he) careless of loves toys never regarded
it, and for he shall well know at my last end how I wish his welfare, do but
this for me, by his friend to learn the Ladies name who^ the Knight is so
inthralled. This is all the service that I will ever command thee, that knowing
her, I may become an intercessor for him, whom my heart more desires than all
the worlds possessions: with this, tears which trickled down from her eyes,
restrained her tongue. In which sorrowful passion, her maiden became a partner,
and grieved for her folly, committing so heinous a fault in procuring the
same; she excused in this manner.

Most gacious Princess, how much I grieve to see your discomfort, I can not
say, but hope your Grace will pardon me, which have been more bold, (presuming
on your favor) then beseems me, neither what I have done (gracious Lady)
was of any intent to offend you, but to acquit my self of blame, in a matter
which I have of courtesy undertaken, as the sequel shall manifest, if it shall
please your Ladyship to peruse this letter, which will (no doubt) resolve you,
without further pains to me, or trouble to your Grace, what she is that is
best beloved of the Maiden Knight on the earth. This letter I received at his
hands, who hearing of your disquiet, desirous (as it should seem) to
acknowledge his duty to you, coniured me by many fair words, and proffrrs of
good, to deliver it unto your hands; which albeit for modesty I did long
refuse, thrusting that from me with my finger, which I would willingly have
drawn to me with all my force: in the end I consented, and the rather for your
Ladyships quiet, which as I suppose, will bid it welcome for the masters sake;
who if my judgment in the Planet Venus deceive me not, will prove shortly a
conjunction, or I Will never trust my skill again; for Venus being in the sign
Leo, has domination over both houses, viz. he and she, or he and you.

The Princess at her last shift, when she heard Guenelas tale, void of all
hope to enjoy her beloved Pheander, after she had a while paused, as one at
length awaked from her memento, as from a sleep, she says; Now trust me
wench, thou have cunningly gone about the bush, and have daintily sought to
enter into my deepest secrets, yet how cunningly so ever you have dealt, there
may be a quilitie to deceive both thee and him: but I pray thee Guenela, tell
me what speeches used the Maiden Knight at the delivery thereof, tell me sweet
gyrle in friendship.

The despairing Knight (good Madam) for so I must call him, how ever his
valor shows it self in field, as no doubt woorthily; so says report: yet
in love I see his dastardness, who loves, yet dare not reveal the sum of his
desires, but must commit it to a tell-tale paper; languishing to the death,
wanting his delight, and prolonging his sorrows by silence, his looks
bewraying more than he can utter: for be it said, he that had seen not long
since his beauty and gallant grace, the ability of his body, and noted every
particular lineament, at this time with the debility thereof, should see a
metamorphosis, which might move the most hardest heart to pity; the cause to
me unknown, but suspected. The assurance I doubt not but your Grace will soon
understand, if you vouchsafe to tear the seal and peruse the contents.

The Princess which thought every minute a year till she had knowledge of the
Knights mind, put her maiden from her prattle with a fained message, when
being all alone, with a number of sorrowful sighs for the Knights
perplexity, she read, and many times read those lines, which gave her first
comfort of enjoying her hearts coutent: how welcome they were unto her, it may
better be imagined than explaned; whose head was wholly busied in answering
the same, for which the thought it not unfit to use the help of Guenela;
wherefore resting from her former studies, we leave her contemplating on her
love, til Guenela her return; who seeing her Ladies callour somewhat revived,
began to smile. Madame (quoth she) though I made a fault in detayning so long
the physic that I promised you, yet I hope your Majesty will pardon that
offense, considering the good it does in working; how you digest it I know
not, but he that has least skill in judging complexions, will say your
marriage is mended by twenty in the hundred; if you recover but so much of your
loss every two days, there are few (in one week) will believe you have been
sick. Well wanton, well (answered the Princess) you have been pretily
disposed to play your part, and take your pastime in beholding the folly of
both our loves, which I am the more willing to forget, in that thou have so
rightly judged of both our griefs. But leaving jest, I pray thee say my sweet
Guenela, what said my servant when he delivered these letters unto thee?
Madame, to say truth; nothing touching his love; but imported with such
earnestness; for the presenting them unto your hands, as might have made many
proud to do so charitable a dee^e, craving it with speech so pitiful, and
looks so ruthful: for mine own part, my heart imagining by your affection,
that the Gods which caused your grief, had fettered him, and well knowing
where love is united, the ones weal is the others good; though I were hardly
won to the same, I undertook the hazard of your good will, promising to return
to him an answer thereof, wherein I shall break promise, without you grant
your consent.

Oh Guenela, doubts thou of my consent for answering of his kind letters,
which have endured so many nights of unrest, and careful days for his sake?
No, heavens never grant me good in this world, if I seek not his content, and
that with so good love and affection, as he offers his love and service to
me, unkind were I else, that loving am beloved, should suffer my dearest love to
languish, who may remedy it. Therefore Guenela, as thou have plaide the
Advocate, so make I thee my principal and chief Secretorie: peruse these
lines, and in right consider if that his grief deserve not to be pitied, then
let me see thy skill in enditing, to the which thou shall have my help. Delay
the time no longer, hunger (my Wench) is sharp sauce (as those say which have
good stomachs) and I measuring his desires by mine own, imagine that meat
cannot be more pleasing to the hungry, then the unexpected tidings of
consent, from his new acknowledged Love. Soft fire, Madame, quoth Guenela,
makes the sweetest Malt, say our huswiues: your Ladyship is far wide: what?
no sooner at the style, but over haste makes waste; look before you leap,
least a block unthought of, chance to break your shins. What if these
letters impart his love, how are you assured thereof? Men are subtle, and can
cast many colors to deceive women; all is not gold that glistereth, nor al
sugar that has a sweet taste; under the greenest grass lurketh y^ poisoned
Adder; the Crocadile sheadeth most tears, when he seeks most to deceive: try
ere you trust, Madam, repentance comes too late; therefore howsoever you affect
him, conceal it: Lightly won, is as lightly lost. The Labourer that gayneth
his money by hard labor, is more chary in parting therewith, then the
purloyning thief, or the ryotous youth, which by subtle practices draws all
he can from his kind parents, to maintain his inordinate expenses. Let him
bite on the bridle a while, yet gently line his curb, that he galle: not a
little thing pleases a child, and a good countenance is worth gold, to him
that regards it, as he professes. Weigh your own estate, which are heir to
this most famous crown of Thrace, with the baseness of his calling, which was
no better than a Merchant: consider what a corrasiue this love of yours would
be to your honorable father, should he know it, and how your Nobles would
stomach him for his birth, grieuing to live in obedience to one so far their
inferior. The envious regard not what virtues he is possessed with, which I must
needs say, deserve to be accounted: the man gayning honor by virtue and
valor, is more worthy to govern the State then the Noble, which ignobleth
his house by his bad demeanor. How many such there be in this Court I grieve
to see, who living licentiously, abuse themselves in such odious manner, that if
your Ladishippe heard the pitiful complaints of the Commons, crying out on the
Prince for justice against them, and how by favor of their friends, ruling
both the King and the State, they are suborned, cleared of the crime, and the
poor Complainant, returned with a check able to break the heart of a simple
man: abuses which may be more lamented, then easily remedied.

But touching the Maiden Knight, from whom I have digrest, I speak not any
thing to disparage his love, nor to draw your lyking from the Knight, but wish
you temper your affection, in such sort, that you may long enjoy it with
content to you both, and so govern your Graces looks and countenances, that
the lightness of the one, nor the liberal bestowing of the other, give
jealous heads any cause of suspicion. For Princes be great marks, and have
many eyes beholding them, and once perceived, what peril it may procure to
either part, your wisdom can conceive. Thus in duty have I spoken, and
delivered a gross advise, which I refer to your Graces better consideration.
Well have thou said, my Guenela, quoth the Princess, but what avails
counsel to a desperate mind, no more then he that seeking to quench the
flame, powers Oil to it, I find thy love so great toward me, that I cannot
requite it, which with such good regard balanceth each peril incident to both
our states, if thou can as well devise how we may enjoy our delight, without
which we perplexed, cannot long endure, what is it that Nutania shall ever
enjoy, but Guenela shall command? Then as thou tenderest my good, bethink thee
of some remedy, for my love to him is such, as nothing may extinquish. Say my
sweet Guenela, shall I by writing answer his Letters, or no: In this I will be
ruled by thee, how gladly soever I wish his comfort, in whom, of al earthly
creatures, consists my most comfort. Experience is the best wisdom quoth
Guenela, who would ever have believed loves power to be of such effect, how
imperious soever he seemed, had they not seen and heard what I do? through
which I am compelled to recant my heresy, and say Love is a God, or how is it
possible he could command Princes. But to your Graces request, whereas you have
referred the answer of Pheanders Letters to me, I was never so void of
reason, nor so desirous to be counselor to your excellence, to take so great a
matter upon me, yet shall I (so please it you to hear me) deliver my simple
opinion, as I would do my self in the like action. The old wives say, they
that feed with the devil must have a long spoone; and they that go about to
master Love had need of many good precepts: dissuade your Grace I will not to
forget it, for* I see it is vain, neither would I wish you to answer by
writing; for a paper is soon lost, and lost, to whose finding it shall come,
it is uncertain; as soon to some envious enemy, as a wel-willer; in which some
word simply meant of you, or me, may be construed by them at their pleasure,
whereby your name may be brought in question; and a slander raised, is not so
easily suppressed; writing is a specialtie, whereof the subtle Lawyer takes no
small advantage: to avoid all which casualties, this may you do; pretend some
matter of conference with him, and appoint the time when he shall attend your
pleasure, at your lodging, coming secretly unto you, and at such time as the
King your father shall be employed in serious affairs, so may you use your
speech at your pleasure; this would Guenela do, your Grace may use your
discretion.

I like thy devise well (good wench) and give thee many thanks (quoth the
Princess) therefore fail not to meet him for thy promise, what else I refer
to thy best indgeme^t. Now in faith Madame (quoth Guenela) you have made a
good choice for a solliciter, but take me as I am, this is the first suit that
ever I was retained for nor I doubt not (if I speed well now) of many
elpantes. As they were thus pleasant between themselves, they heard a trumpet
sound to horse, which caused the Princess to send her Page to enquire the
cause, who returned her answer, that the king with his train, were setting
forward to hunt a wild bore, which his Forrester had roused: this news gave
them cause of joy, hoping that Fortune favored them with a happy time, which
they were both loath to omit, doubting the like opportunity; the Princess
especially, who could not be quieted in mind, until she heard her Knight
answer for himself; wherefore a Page was presently commanded to search for
ye Knight, willing him with such convenient speed as he could, to meet Guenela
in the garden; the Page used such diligence, ye soon he was brought unto the
Knights presence, whom he found solitary (as a holy father) at his Orizons,
whom the Page awaked with his joyful message, which was welcome unto him,
albeit doubtful whether of weal or woe, either to augment his sorrows, or
utterly to extinguish them. The sudden hearing of which, caused him to pause a
while, when having determined, courteously returned answer to the Gentlewoman,
that he would attend her, he rewarded the Page so bountifully, as he had cause
to boast him of his well employed service. Guenela having received his answer
by the Page, aduertized the Princess thereof, who commanded her to haste,
least she gave the Knight cause of discontent by her long stay: but for all her
speed Pheander was long there before, atte^ding her coming; who was no sooner
of him perceived to enter the place, but his heart pr^^aging some good, was
more delighted thereat, the^ all the motions that could be imagined, after his
courteous salutations done, thus said:

Sweet Guenela, I know not what to imagine of thy sudden message, yet willing
to be resolved, as one that by thy answer exspecteth his doom either of life
or death, I attend thy pleasure: say therefore, sweet Lady, what faith the
Princess to my letters? with whom Guenela purposed to be something pleasant,
and not to cloy his stomach with such pleasant confections, that he should
surfeit therewith, and framing a countenance to her speech, she said:

Sir Knight, of all the Gentlemen in the Court of Thrace, my good opinion was
such of you, that on your word, I durst have hazarded my greatest credit, which
expectation thou have far deceived: and therefore not worthy to be accounted
among such honorable men at Arms, which take their principal honor, holding
their word with Gentlewomen. At the delivery of which speech, he that had took
regard to the Knights countenance, might have thought him past phisickes
recure: And withal, standing so mute, it verily persuaded Guenela, that he was
ready to deliver his interest of life, which made her alter her rough words,
and with a smoother method new file them; doubting that her Comedy begun in
mirth, should prove a Tragidie, to the great grief of the whole Country, which
generally honored him. Wherefore taking him by the hand, she said; Sir Knight, I
am sorry I have charged you so far, what cause soever I had, but it is womanlike
to be slain with words, and no fit passion for a man of your profession. That
you may comfort your self, I first pardon the offense against me committed,
(and enjoin you) as you tender your credit with the Princess Nutania, that
you fail not to repair at such convenient time as you best can, to her
lodging; where if you hold your word, you will excuse your messenger.

Oh Guenela, how have thy speeches tormented me, filling my entrails with
such a confusion of comfortless thoughts, as have overcome my senees. Yet
Guenela, if thou be courteous, or have any spark of gentilitie abide in thee,
Say my good Lady, what countenance gave the Princess to my bashful paper?
Vouchsafed she the reading of them? (Or how) to discomfort you good Knight,
quoth Guenela, it were pity, being already at so low a datum, which pitieth
me to behold. Comfort can I give none to thy desires but this, thy suit is
love, as your Letters import, in which despair not, for thy mistress is a
woman, though a Princess, and how pitiful our sex is, I will not boast, but
wish thee not despair: If thy birth were as great as thy virtues, thou might
board and bed, as good as the Princess Nutania, unto whom I will be a
faithful soliciter. Mistake me not Pheander, I speak as a friend, and so
leave thee, until thy coming to my Lady, which detract not, for time lost, is
such a precious thing as can never be recalled. Before whom, when thou shall
come, plead thine own cause, and discover thine own grie. And so farewell.

Pheander, which had some greater hope by Guenela, her last speeches, was so
over ioyed, that he could not bid her farewell: yet after his memento past, he
says, farewell the faithfullest friend in my distress, that ever I found.
(Oh Guenela) happy may thou be in thy loves, and highly honored amongst men,
by whom my cares are thus comforted, (faithful Guenela) the worker of my
hearts happy content, by whom past all hope, I am by thy faithfulness and
truth in delivering my message, freed of so heavy a burden, as was likely to
have torn my poor oppressed heart in a million of pieces. Thus vplawding
Guenela, he had almost forgotten his word. Leaving further to descant on this
plain song, return we to the Princess, who was advertised by her woman, what
had passed between the Knight and her, not omitting his heavy looks, and
pitiful speeches. And then again as glad to please the Princess, whom she
was assured loved the Knight, let not at large to set out his honors gained,
his comeliness of person, bounty, and whatsoever the world admired in him,
she highly advanced: to the great content of ye Princess, who thought every
minute a year until she saw him, whom she with hearty desire expected, (long
looked for, comes at last.) And Nutania who at a casement waited diligently his
coming, espied her beloved Knight, what joy it caused, let them judge, which
better experience have made perfect in lovers delights. The Princess having the
sight of her so long desired Knight, sent Guenelia to entertain him, and to
bring him to her presence. The Princess studying to frame her countenance for
his welcome, bethought her self of sundry means, eftsoons, doubting by her
too pleasant and kind usage to be thought too forward in love: then, what
discomfort her heavy looks might move to him, whom she most desired to please.
In this quandary, fitting on a Pallet, leaning her head on her pillowe, Guenela
has brought the Knight to her presence, who doing his duty, was by the
Princess again saluted.

Attending like the guilty condemned, his sentence from her mouth, which was
to give him either life or death, the Knight thus at an nonplus, overcome with
the beholding of the Princess exellent perfection, was by her the mirror of
all honor and courtesy, removed out of his dumpes, in this manner.

Sir Pheander, whether I should chastise thy presumption in writing so boldly
unto me (or no) I am not yet resolved, but before I acquainted my father
therewith, I thought good to hear thee speak, for that I would not sodeinly
disgrace thee, whom I have so often graced: as well to hear thy intent
committing so great a folly, as what thou can say in excuse thereof. Princes
are not to be ieasted with, nor to be attempted in such manner by their
inferiors, and therefore thou have highly erred in that thou have done, and
encurred the danger of our strictest laws, by which thou art already
condemned, were thy fact known. The Knight standing at the bar, where Bewlie
sat chief Judge, was surprised with so many griefs, that he might hardly
utter any word, yet revived by hope of those comfortable and sweet words
pronounced by Guenela, he says;

Gracious Lady, that I have presumed far, I cannot but acknowledge, yet that
I have encurred such punishment as your highness infers, I deny, unless
death be the guerdon assigned the faithful; (for dutiful service) and entire
affection, urged me to seek thy favor in love, without which I may not live:
so deeply is thy virtuous perfections imprinted in my heart, which if I enjoy
not, I desire no longer to breathe. Therefore Madame, if thou disdain his
love, that living, dies continually for thee: do but say the word, and this
blade so often imbrued in the blood of mine enemies, shall sacrifice his
masters own true heart before thy face, that thy cruel self, (may
witness to thy self) how faithfully thy servant has loved thee.

The Princess grieved to hear these speeches, moved with great ruth, could
hardly forbear sheading of tears, yet modesty the ornament of womankinde,
caused her to feine a counterfeit show of displeasure to him, whose tears
wroong drops of blood from her tender heart, yet that she might not too
sodeinly confess her hearts desire, nor give him cause of utter despair, she
says; Pheander, that thou may see, and seeing, report in all places where
ever thou shall become of women's pity, I grant thee pardon for thy fault, and
with my pardon, thy life, which was wholly in me to dispose. For loving me as
thy Prince, I heartily thank thee, but in seeking to obtain my love as thy
wife, that have been denied to diverse and sundry Princes, in that thou
errest: let each estate frame themselves in love to their equal, so shall they
sooner obtain their desires, and their loves in more tranquillity be
maintained. Thou know thy birth how base it is, and though for thy virtues
it pleased my Princely father to advance thee, who cannot of his Princely
nature, but reward the d^serts of the well deserving. If for his good to thee,
thou seek to rob him of his child, therein thou show a very ungrateful
mind, and laiest open to the world thy base condition. Therefore persist to
prosecute thy suit, let reason vanquish that brain-sicke humor which so
afflicts thee; in doing which, thou shall show thy self, to be thy self: For
no greater conquest can be achieved, then conquering a man's own effects. Do
this, and thou shall find Nutania thy faithful and assured friend, who will
be as careful to advance thee, as I have found thee ready to pleasure me.

Alas good Madame, answered the Knight, I have often heard, the whole needs no
physician, it is easier far to give counsel then to take it. The full gorged
Churl little regards the staruing creature at his gate, (but madame) could
you conceive the least part of many thousand griefs that afflict me, you would
pity me at least, though you yielded me no farther favor: If thy heart be not
harder then the Adamant, (pity me) sweet Lady, and yield thy grace, to
augment my life, or utterly deny me your favor for ever. I exspect but your
answer, for my resolution is no other then I have professed, (dastards fear to
die) but the Noble mind prefers death which ends all sorrows, before a
life to be continued with discontent. The Princess which was at her wits end
as full of grief, as he of sorrow, turned her speeches from her matter, to
question him of his Country, the manner of the Court, and state thereof, thinking
so to be guilde the time and put him off for that season. But so long dalied
she, that she was forced in the end to confess her love to be no way inferior
to his. Thus as I have said, demanding of the Knight many questions, she
earnestly entreated him, to resolve her whether the Prince Dionicus, were such
as the world reported him, who had name to be a Paragon, excelling in all
actions required in a Noble man. The Prince hearing his name called in question
by the Princess, on such a sudden, believed verily that she had some secret
knowledge of him, which made him with blushing cheeks to say, what reports
soever your Grace has heard of that Prince Dionicus, I know not, a subject I
was to his father, and ought to speak reverently of him, (yet what is truth)
and not for affection or despighte, to say other then I will with my blood
auow. Wherefore Noble Lady, I will truly answer your demands.

The Prince whose father was matchless, gaining the love of all men, with care
and honor maintained the reputation of his Country, which by his careless
son is blemished, who neglecting the duty of a child, without regard of
father, crown, or kingdom, exiled himself, no man knows where, or whether
he rest alive or no: since which time, the king his father, who loved him too
dear (if fathers love may be too dear) has likewise absented himself, and
lives in exile. The mother Queen, has resigned her due to death, leaving (by
loss of those honorable persons) their country without a head, and their state
by subjects to be governed, whereby a ruin of the kingdom is like to ensue,
all proceeding from the Prince. A miserable country is that (quoth the
Princasse) and to be lamented; but more the loss of so noble a race, the
father having been such, and the son as (report says) so toward. But say
(good Knight) quoth she, was there never cause supposed of their departures?
nor did not the father through his harsh demeanor, for youth in these times
take unkindly their fathers unkindness: and age is froward, which frowardnes
might minister great cause of discontent. Madam (quoth the Knight) to my
knowledge, this I will say, my father being a Courtier in some regard, whereby I
became familiar with the Prince, and as youth will make choice of some one to
participate with, so it pleased the Prince, loving my father well, to use my
company in all his exercises; through which I saw his demeanor, with such
reverent duty to the king acknowledged, and as kindly requited of the king,
as on the earth might not be found love more perfect til his speech failing in
his mouth, he could utter no more. The Princess giving heed to each word by
him pronounced, albeit she saw the repeating of the Princes life, was somewhat
cumbersome unto him, yet ceased he not to urge him, to show such sorrow in
delivering the storye so of her desired. Ah Madame (quoth the knight) at his
departure, began our Countries grief and my sorrow, from whom in life, I could
never be separated, such was my love to him, which refused himself, his
Crown, and dignities. Adolefull tale have thou delivered (quoth the Princess)
which I perceive moves you to impacience, wherefore, one demand and an end.
The Prince Dionicus, made choice of you, for his companion: Then under
benedicitie let me crave (all law of friendship exempted) did he not acquaint
you with his determinations? for me thinks it is scant credible, that such an
unity should be amongst men, their loves being so perfect, but he should
disclose each secret intent whatsoever: many reasons draws me to suppose it,
which I will omit, for I perceive I am too tedious. Your Ladyship urges me
far, yet will I accomplish your request, who have power to command me. The
Gentleman who never offended, but in committing of this great offense, long
before his departure, having belike some motion of desire in his thoughts,
became of a pleasant Gentleman, the most melancholiest that could be found;
that quite abolishing all company, he best contented himself with his secret
cogitations; continuing this humor so long, that he fell sick of an extreme
Fever; which so increased upon him, as all Physickes relief was quite given
over: so that small was the hope of his recovery, whose distress, the kind
King, with the mother Queen, grieved in such wise to behold, as in short
time it was hard to be judged which of the three endured most extremes. But
God that in adversity sends comfort, restored the Prince to some strength:
belike receiving some comfort in his imaginations, and by his recovery, the
King and Queen were both so comforted, as in short time they were raised from
their sick cabinets, to frolike it amongst their noble subjects, who ioyed in
nothing so much as in their healthes. But how soon the Sunshine of their
happiness was ouershadowed with clouds of comfortless care, grieueth me to
recount; yet dare I not gainsay your Ladyships request. The Prince recovered of
his malady, made semblance of such content, that none but himself could
witness vy the least suspicion, his hearts discontent, yet oftentimes should
I, being seldom from his company, sighing with a number of far fetched sobs,
hear him say, Peerlesse Lady, would my love were as well known to thee as to
mine own heart, then doubtless would thou pity me which lanquish for thee,
that art the only Princess on the earth, excelling in all virtues which
beautify the honorable; the report of which has fettered my fancies to thee,
that I protest to be thine, or never mine own: then looking with a ghastly
loook about him, to see if any ouerheard him, he would fall into some other
discourse, ever applauding ye rare perfections of his mistress, who was
unknown to all but only to himself and I, who from the first he acquainted
with ye same: briefly Lady, (for I weary you with my discourse) the love of his
Lady has drawn him from his country, whose absence caused the kings exile, and
the Kings exile the Queens death.

The Princess hearing all these extremes to grow from affection, knowing well
her own hearts discontent, with a sigh from the deepest, which wroong tears
from her heart, she said; Alas noble Gentleman, whose joy so soon
overwhelmed, has heaped so many cares upon me, what folly was there in thee,
that would not disclose thy love which burned so vehemently: was the dame
so base, that thou fear thereby to ignoble thy issue, or of such high estate
thou doubtest to obtain her; if either, by persuasions all griefs might have
been mittigated: if a Monarch, why thou by report deseruest her; if a beggar,
thou might make her noble; what ere she were hearing thy distress, could
she forbear to pity thee? No, no, were her heart more harder then the
Diamond, it could not choose at ye hearing thereof, but relent: else, well
worthy were she to be scorned of al Ladies, and never to be named amongst
the number of women.

The Prince seeing the Princess in this pitiful humor, thought it good
striking when the iron was hot, and taking the opportunity, answered her thus:
Is your Ladyships censure such of hard-hearted Ladies, and will not be entreated
of him, whose love to you, is no whit inferior to the Pr. Dionicus, as himself
would confess were he present, and hard me recount ye many griefs, wherewith love
has afflicted me: and might he ^e Judge, would allow me recompense for my
service in love. But Madame, if without offense I might demand this; say
Nutania, the Princess of Thrace were the Saint, unto whom this unhappy
Prince had vowed his devotions, and that all the passions he has endured* are
for your love, would you vouchsafe him love in recompense thereof? The
Princess driven to her shifts at this demand, could not tell what to
answer, yet sharpening her wits (as women can do) she said: Pheander, Love
is not to be dallied with, as I have heard them say, which speak by
experience; therefore I cannot directly answer thy question, but were I the
Physician that could cure his malady, and had so good judgment of his affects
as of mine own, charity would I should minister unto his disease, what effect
soever the potion would work; provided this, that he disclosed his grief in
time: mistake me not Pheander, and pardon me if I conceal what I would utter,
my thoughts are mine own. Truth Lady (quoth the Knight) neither was ye same
demanded to urge any thing more the^ stands with your good liking: yet for
the prince; this I say, it were pity he should die for love. So say I,
(quoth the Princess) for few men there be of that condition, and as seldom is
such a one seen, as multitudes of black Swans. Your error is great, Madam,
(quoth the knight) for many have been with love so overcome, that Kings have
been enforced to stoop to their subjects, and the greatest conquerours, whose
valor many volumes record, by love compelled to forsake themselves, taking
sundry shapes and many toils, to gain the love of their Ladies. I speak now
Madam for the Prince, whom I love well, and challenge your charity may be to
him continued, for your love is the only physic that must cure him, or else all
other helps are frivolous: in hope whereof, he breaths a lingering life, til your
gracious consent finish his griefs, yielding to his desires, in whom it
rests, to restore him; banished, to his regal dignities, who is y^ cause of
his exile: dastardness has caused him to conceal it, bearing the extremity
of his passions with intolerable pain, whose flames increases by viewing your
exellent perfections; The want of whose grace, haleth him on to desperation,
not able any longer to resist loves assaults, which with such hot allarmes
assaileth him, that longer he cannot endure them. The Princess hearing her
Knight plead for the Prince with such earnestness, leaving his own suit, to
draw her to love him of whom her thoughts were least on, thought it some
policy of the Knight, which imagined love had vanquished her, swelling with
anger at these new imaginations, he^ color changed into so many forms, that
the least child which had seen the same, might easily have gest what small
content those last uttered speeches wrought. But doubting least with silence it
should be perceived, with a heart full fraught with fury, she said; Deceitful
wretch, unworthy the favor of the simplest drug, that by thy subtle practices
have sought to insinuate thy self into my secrets, was it not false varlet,
sufficient that I forbear the punishing of thy own bold writings, but to my
face in colorable manner, deludest me with tales of I know not what. Have I ever
graced thee since I first saw thee, and requitest thou my favor thus,
dallying with me as with thy inferior, or some of thy base Trulles? No, no,
use thy jest with such that can better digest them, and from henceforth be
warned, (and warned) take heed how thou dare either by word or writing, use any
like motions, least I acquaint y^ world with thy impotent dealings, and by
death thou receive the guerdon of thy ill: and so fare as thou may, for never
expect farther favor at my hands.

The Prince hearing this finitiue sentence, from her, whose tongue was to
pronounce his life or death, thought it high time to speak for himself before
she departed, and staying her as she would have gone, he humbly besought her,
not in displeasure to leave him, but with patience endure what he could say:
which albeit she might hardly be won to grant, yet her former affection
banished chollor in such wise, that he had liberty to speak, saying;

Gracious Lady, that I offended your Exellence, whom of all earthly creatures I
most honor, I heartily sorry for it, judge me not so impudent or senseless, to
move matter without some reason, especially enduced thereunto by your exellent
favor, and charitable pity of the wretched estate of that unhappy Prince,
who has vowed to love your grace to the death: and by granting him your love,
you shall draw him from death, and thereby not only restore him, but fill the
hearts of many thousands with joy, which with tears continually lamenteth his
loss, which is lost to them for ever, and shortly will be loss to himself
and the whole world. Unhappy Prince, why name I him Prince, whose miseries is
more the^ the most wretched slave that lives, who not able to endure the force
of love, has forsaken himself, to follow his own affections, without
knowledge of father, kin, or subjects. Muse not Madam, at the strangeness of
the Tale I have to deliver, nor let it seem incredible, that I am that unhappy
Dionicus, lawful heir of the Numedian Crown, that Prince, through whom so
many miseries is befallen his country, his fathers care, and cause of his
careful mothers untimely death, who fettred in loves bands, by report of thy
peerlesse beauty and virtues, has drawn me to take the habit of a merchant,
usurping the name of Pheander, the more unsuspected to attain the sight of thee
whom my heart so desired: whom if thou pity, lives by thy love to do thee
honor, and without thee, may no longer enjoy this life; in pursuit of whose
love, if I die, my ghoast among the rest of lovers* shall sing hymns in laud
of thy peerlesse beauty.

The Princess as one in a trance, could not tell whether she heard him speak,
or dreamed, yet noting his countenance which showed a troubled spirit, tickled
with a sudden joy, as women be proud in their Loves, that her love to Pheander,
was methamorphosed to Dionicus, the Numedian Prince, of whom her fathers
Courtiers reported such honors, she said; Pheander, or how I shall call thee I
know not, thou have filled my senses with a world of co^fused thoghts, in
recounting the strangeness of thy fortunes, which I can hardly be drawn to
believe, nor is it possible that the Prince Dionicus could live in the Court of
Thrace, so long concealed, without knowledge of some one, if I might by reason
be induced to believe the same, I would say more* Madam quoth the Prince,
howsoever I have disguised my self heretofore, as loath to be dishonored, yet
believe me in this, that I said no more then is truth. Therefore if thou
could not love Pheander being a merchant, for ignobling thy noble house, yet
as I am Prince of Numedia, vouchsafe me thy liking, by whom thy honor can no
way be disparaged, but by exchanging love for love with him, advance thy honor
far higher. Say n^w Madame, all niceness set apart, can you love?

The Princess, whose love was equal, though willingly she would have colored
the same, yet moved with a pitiful desire to ease his grief, which far
surpassed, as also to ease her own heart which was not a little infected with
the self disease, their welfares depending both on her grant or denial. After
she had deliberated a while, fixing her hand in his, which she easily grasped,
and leaning her head on his shoulder to cover ye blushing of her face, as
ashamed of what she had to say unto him, in revealing her own grief, she said;

Famous Prince, whom the world applaudeth, and our Courtiers of Thrace, with
wonder do admire, that I loved thee being Pheander, I cannot deny, and how many
iarres I endured for thee, I omit: each particular, wringing tears from my
heart, which how willing so ever it was to have made the same known, modesty
restrained, laying before me many wrongs offered in Ladies love, by such
perjured knights, as have professed with their toongs what their hearts never
meant, whereby diverse Ladies of honor, have been dishonored, and sundry lost
their lives, (which considered) blame me not, if I rather choose to die, then
pass the bands of modesty so far, as seek thy love, or knowing thy grief,
to blame mine, (yield) before I heard thee auow on thine honor, what thy
letters imported. But gentle Prince, that thou may better believe what I
report, how much soever my heart has denied to reveal, persuade thee, if I
loved thee being Pheander, and a counterfeyt merchant, assure you, I cannot
hate thee for that thou art Dionicus, (the one a Prince) the other an
inferior, of whose love were I assured, and that his tongue and heart agreed
in one, Dionicus, should be in love so requited, as never any should have
interest in Nutanias heart, but the peerlesse Prince of Numedia. At uttering of
which, tears restrained her speech, which ye Prince noted, and perceiving that
she spoke what her heart thought, he ^omforted her thus.

Faint not Madame, neither sorrow for those comfortable confections bestowed on
a dying creature, whose favors has haled him from the grave, whereunto he was
like to have been swallowed, had not thy comfort reclaimed me, who living,
died for thy love, which grace shall never be forgotten. And that you shall
assure you my faith and love is firm and honorable, I protest by that honor
that ever the Numedian Prince has regarded, that my love to the Princess
Nutania, is no other but honorable, nor never none has had any interest in
Dionicus, or ever shall, but the only bewtifull, and verteous Princess
Nutania: and on that, take here my hand, and with my hand, the heart, love, and
honor of a Prince. Guenela, lending an ear to this prattle, hearing them so
earnest, to put them from their melancholy, took the word at advantage, and
coming sodeinly to them, said; Madame, at finishing of bargains they shake
hands, if there be any exchange between your knight and you, you were best to
take witness, least disliking the match, he recant his word. Guenela, quoth
the Prince, your Lady is beholding to thee for thy care, (and I) your debtor,
challenge it when you please. Sir, quoth Guenela, I thank you, but wilt please
you remember your promise, and excuse Guenela (quoth the Princess) without my
Lord y^ Prince his further entreaty, I pardon al faults committed against me;
for confirmation of which, get your Lawyer to draw an acquittance general from
the beginning of the world, and I will sign it.

Nay Madame (answered Guenela,) it were an evil servant that will not take her
mistress word for a dozen or two of stripes, which I am sure had been the
most, and if they should light on my ribs, might well grieve me, slay me they
could not, my heart is of more valor then so. But Madame, shall Sir Pheander
marie the Princess Nutania, that you call him your Lord the Prince? if that be
the bargain, I fear there is some fire in the straw. And how then (quoth
the Princess?) Nay Madame (quoth Guenela) nothing, but I pray God give you
much joy, and make you happy in your love. While they were thus pleasant, a
page brought word that diverse Ladies were come to visit the Princess, which
caused them, how loath so ever, after many sweet imbracings and loving kisses,
between them enterchanged, to give each other the farewell, parting better
content, then they came together, having unburdened their hearts of much
griefs, giving content to both, by yielding to love, which vanquished both,
whom to their pleasing imaginations I leave, to recount the Kings of Thrace,
and Thessalie, their pastimes in hunting. These Kings following the chase with
great pleasure, as pastime they greatly delighted, were so wearied with the
same, and toiled with the extremity of heat, which made them choose some place
under the shadow of the spreading trees to refresh themselves, where they had
not long rested, but they were espied of an ancient woman, the widow of good
ye^man, and her son, who having workmen not far from thence, were carrying
them victuals. The poor aged woman having seen (as she thought unseen) the
kings, doubting they were some of those robbers, that haunted those mountains,
would have shifted from them another way, but were interrupted of the King,
who suddeinly calling them, drove them both into such a shaking fear, as they
which are ouerburthened with a fever. The King who graciously regarded their
timmorousnesse, comforted them with all the favorable speeches he could use,
protesting unto them, that in their company they should receive no discurtesie,
by none, if the King himself were present, and therefore willed them to set
fear apart, and to tell them what they were, the cause of their fear, and
their business they had that way? These honorable speeches of the King mildly
uttered, comforted them, wherefore in such blunt manner as her bringing up
required, she said;

Gentlemen, for so you seem, if your inward conditions, answer your outward
habit, (as many in this age does) whose garments might become men of great
worth, if apparel may make a man more worthy, yet diverse times cover those
carkases, void either of worship, honesty, or other good condition. Pardon my
harsh behavior, (gentle sir) and blame me not for avoiding the way, experience
ha^^* taught me to eschew harms, who to my cost have dearly paid for my
learning, having my goods spoiled at home, and my self and family, dangered
abroad: and without offense may I speak it, by such, whose countenance and
attire, might well have deceived them of more judgment then my self.

The King delighted with her plain speeches, demanded where she dwelled, and
whether she had a husband, or lived a widow? Oh sir, if any gentilnesse abide
in you, (quoth she) urge me not to deliver a tale of such ruth, as your
questions import. The remembrance of my passed pleasant life, when I call to
mind, with the cares I now am combred with, many sundry ways, are so
displeasing unto my grieved heart, as I may not without many tears shed,
recount the same. These words spoken in heaviness, noted of the King, made him
more importunate to hear the rest, and therefore willed her all fear set
apart, to reveal unto him, what estate she lived in, and if any wrongs were
offered her, he protested by oaths which might have been well believed, to
remedy it, yea if it were the King himself. The careful widow encouraged by
these comfortable words, albeit she hoped of small relief from him, partly to
ease her heart, and a little to disgrace her adversary which was mighty, all
the revenge she could take, thus said;

(...) that I may not seem discurtious to you, whose curti(...)ed, is more
then I can any way deserve, but in (...) your welfare, which pittieth a poor
widows e(...)e weal is the good of her poor fatherless Or(...) with pity
my case, and consider thereof, as (...)ease. Then drying her eyes, which like
gutters bedeawed her cheeks, she said; Not far from hence (gentle sir) is my
poor cabinet, where this fifty winter I have maintained ye port of a poor
woman, my husband in his life delighting in hospitality, and on his death bed,
gave me charge to do the like, which I have observed, hurting none, nor never
denying any good to them that sought me; the needy I (...)bored, whom with my
bread and such vyands as God sent, (...)e fed. But now sir, (quoth she) and
therwithall a deep (...)itnesse of her hearts heaviness, restrained her
speeches, (...) some pause, said; But now sir, such is the
oppressi(...)covetous in authority, that my living is taken from (...)ith my
family compelled to seek harbor where we can (...) if God the comfort of the
distressed, provide not within (...)e months for us, longer we have not there
to abide. Tel^ me woman (quoth the King) what he is that thus iniureth thee,
and the manner how? and as I am a true subject to the king, I will never leave
thee til thou art with justice reue^ged on him. Oh sir (quoth she) urge me no
more to that, for my adversary being honorable, and of account with ye king,
although y^ wrong I sustain be great, yet will he revenge him self so on me and
mine, as my life will be the least and last* such is his bloody mind, who has
neither conscience, nor thought of any good, ^le after so many years of
peaceable possession, of this tennement, in name of my husbands auncestry, as
our evidence does specify, he would not thus extreemly deal, with those whom
charity would he should comfort; but such is his cruelty, who ought to be
courteous, that his covetousness is never satisfied, halling all from the poor,
profitting none, but himself, his children, or servants, who reap the
benefit of many men's labors, for wh^^ suite passes, but what he must like
of? or what w(...) King deny, that he will grant? Lamentable is it (...) the
complaints of the commons, of al estates, ho(...) they murmr, nay not only
against him, bu(...) by others reports, that the Kings name is (...)stion of
many, all proceeding of this canka(...) guiding all, abuses all. The Soldier
serving (...) his countries honor wants his pay, which causes him fall to
robbery, and other unlawful exercises. The Farmer, Grasier, and such that live
of the benefit of their tillage, feeding cattle, and other hard labors, have
their cattle taken, their corn, and what they enjoy, and driven to seek
their money by long suites, and in the end glad to besto(...) the one half to
be assured of the other, yet dare none (...) plain how great so ever the
oppression be. Thus sir* (...)tisfie you, I have spoken the truth what I have
he(...) partly that I know, which I and many more ma(...) but cannot remedy it.
But sir, what I have spoke(...) you will conceal, for if you be friend to him,
w(...) not name, yet you can imagine: If under your f(...) words lurk deceit,
and that you have sifted me, to be^ay me to his cruelty, such il befall thee as
I wish him, whom I have cause to curse, and others with me, who^ he has
likewise wro^ged. But had the king knowledge how he uses his subjects,
especially his tenants, who is our good Landlord, and thus many years has
been, he would redress it; but he having ye charge of al, has received a great
fine to thrust me from my right, which God remedy, and grant our king to
understand his tyranny. Amen (quoth the king) May it be possible that he whom
(I know) the King has loved so deer, and(...) fixed, where their cause should
be heard and restitution made, which in such sort was accomplished, that his
lands, leases, plate and Jewels, were distributed to the wronged. The widow who
first gave notice thereof, the King enriched with greater possessions to
maintain her hospitality, and Zachary for that his Dania should not for want of
wealth refuse him, he bountifully rewarded, so that every one was pleased, and
returned content to their homes.

Now Gentiles, the History shall shows you how Theophilus King of Thessaly,
expected the aid of Thrace, for restoring him to his kingdom, which promise the
King so regarded, that in short time, through the diligence of those Captains
to whom the charge thereof was committed, the number appointed was furnished,
with shipping, munition and victuals, for the Army, of whom the Thracian king
took the Muster, appointing their leaders. The chief (by name of General)
for the service, was the Maiden Knight, who was urged unto it by the two kings,
in such manner, that no excuses nor delays which he could make, might be
accepted, unless he should by his too much refusal, purchase the name of
coward: this choice greatly disliked the Knight, whose wars in love, had but
newly begun to take success, who scarcely assured of the Princess, although
her promised faith might put him in comfort, yet weighing the vnstability of
their sex, he doubted least his absence might draw her to that which he would
heedfully regard being present. The tidings of her fathers election, made of
her love for general, as novelties are rife and flies with swift wings, came
unto the hearing of the Princess, unto whom if they were irksome, suppose you,
that know how grievous the parting of two faithful lovers are, who having her
only felicity in contemplating of her beloved Dionicus, their joys but now in
the blossoms, was so nipt in the spring, as care banished all future
happiness, and sorrow began to claim her w^nted place in both, but especially
the Princess who framed of the weaker mould, heaviness had taken the more
impression in her, so that forsaking all company, her cheifest delight was to
be solitary, where she might with deep sighs and many brynish tears,
unburden her ouercharged heart, cursing bitterly the cause, and causer of
seperating her love. In this melancholy uttering such speech of despair, as
though she saw the dreadful messenger Death, already seized upon the
valiant knight. The knight who could take as little rest, as his Lady pleasure,
could find content in no place, until he came to the Princess lodging,
whom found in this passion, which was more grievous then all the rest, her
blubbred eyes pressyng blood from his heart, beholding her in that plight,
whose happy content, was his only joy. But how cumbersome so ever it was unto
him, with wisdom he advisedly weighed, that cares must be comforted in time,
least taking deep root, they will consume the heart subject unto it.
Therefore after many kind persuasions used, he laid before her, the honor
of the place assigned him, and what infamy would redownde unto him refusing
it, with the dishonor of him, and stain to his Proginy for ever, the cause
being right, and the action of her Princely father so charitable, whereon the
welfare of a whole kingdom consisted.

The Princess whom grief had near overcome, hearing her beloved speak so
honorably, and well considering it was greatly to his infamy, to deny her
father, though hardly won to patience, yet armed with hope of his valor and
fortunate success in his journey, reason and wisdom subduing grief and
sorrow, she grants her consent, heartily praying for his safe and sudden
return, to his eternal honor, and increasing of the hearts content.

Time that staieth not, causes these Princes to part, Pheander, to give
directions for his journey, his provision being all to make, but such care had
he of the same, as he was sodeinly provided of all needful things, expsecting
a fair wind for imbarquing his companies, which God sent as they desired, when
each one taking leave of their friends, with many a loath departing farewell,
he betook himself to the mercy of the waves, who by his goodness, that
commands and governs all things, favored them with so happy a gale, that
in short time they might discry the high land of Egypt, which being by his
skillful Pylottes known, they struck their sails to Hull, until a general
Council was called, where every man had liberty to deliver his advise for the
benefit of the action. Where after long debating, and each peril advisedly
weighed, it was determined, the Fleet should put again into the Sea, least
they being a huge number should be discried, and their intent thereby made
frustrate. To bring their purpose to better effect, a Frygate was slenderly
manned to avoid suspicion, who in the night rowed hard aboard the shore, with
Commission to take what ere he were they could first lay hold off, that they
might be the rather advertised of the state of the Country, and where the King
was.

This devise sorted to such effect, thet through the great diligence of the
Lord Cariolus, who was appointed for the same, as one desirous to gain honor,
by dawning of the day they recovered a Rock, which opened with one of their
principal port, under which unseen, they might shelter themselves, and yet
have sight of each shallop, whether he were fisher or other, that came or
went. Long had they not lain exspecting their desires. But Fortune, who
favored their enterprise, discovered unto them a a Galley bound for Babylon,
fraighted with many passengers of honor, and exceeding rich, with plate, money
and Jewels. This Galley first discryed, half dismayed the company, who feared
she* had been a man of war sent of purpose to surprise them, so that each
one had greater desire to be gone again, then to attempt any thing against
them. But in extremes is the Noble mind best tried, as the Lord Cariolus in
this, who seeing the cowardice of such base companions, first by fair
persuasions encouraged them to the attempt, showing in his countenance his
resolution, and arming them with hope of victory, not omitting the reward of
so honorable an action, which if they escaped with victory being the
beginning of their enterprise, deserved more to be recompensed then all the
rest. To give you courage my hearts (quoth he,) I say not to you go, but follow
me your Leader, who will either win her, or leave my life in so good a cause.
But these speeches with those dastards prevailed not at all, who seeing the
match unequal, cried still to be gone, but Cariolus, who weighed his honor
far above all, moved with great impatience at their denial, with his Rapier
drawn came amongst them, reuiling them with odious speeches, and protesting
what ere he were that should in the least sort either by word or countenance,
make show to return, should with his own hand be murdered, and so long as he
might breath, no faint hearted villain should dishonor him, who came to gain
honor. Therefore sweet bloods (quoth he,) take courage and fear not, death
with honor, is to be valued more then life, with a kingdoms possession, who so
follows me, shall find me ever his friend, and what ere I possess, shall
have interest in it. The company how loath so ever they were to be won to so
hard an adventure, yet seeing the noble man so resolute, thought it bootlesse
to refuse him, or to make semblant of dislike, holding it more wisdom to
keep his honorable friendship by their forward aduenturing, then procure his
envy by their cowardice, and seeing it high time to resolve, the galley
approaching them near, they cried to proceed, and they would all follow him,
Cariolus pleased with their willingness, had scarce leisure to give directions
for the fight* before the galley came within hayling, whose force being such
and so well manned as she was, made small account of the Frygat, who although
they halled many times, yet making as if they heard not, bore up with them, and
valiantly without words, entered her in the Prow, putting them from their
Ordinance, where they within board with their Pistolles, Semitaries, and other
needful weapons, valiantly behaved themselves, Cariolus crying still courage,
courage, Thessalie, so long that in short time the Cauileres were all stowed,
and his company leaving his Frygat entered all the Galley, as lawful Prize to
be shared amongst them. The Noble Cariolus having ended the fight, he kindly
with words of favor and promise of liberty, with great reward to the slaves,
urged them to apply their labor, which with so willing hearts accomplished his
request, that in short time they had sight of their Fleet, and bear with them
all they might, which being descried, they could not imagine whether the Galley
were friend or no, wherefore the General to avoid peril, as wisdom with
valor is requisite, doubting that by firing or other mischief, they might
annoy them, he called by his flage of Council, the commanders of each ship,
frygat and galley, aduising them to take great regard, how they suffered the
galley to board them. By that time the whole Fleet was prepared in squadrons,
rowing five and five, warlike and brave, Cariolus came up with them, when the
fleet halled them, they espied his own colors advanced on the Poope, and an
other Ensign hanging under her stern, which sight gave them great cause of
joy, to signify their gladness for his success, each ship in the foreward with
their Ordinance and small shot, according to the manner of the sea, bad him
welcome. In which Triumph, unhappily with a scowrer which negligently was shot
from a Hargub^ze, was the Noble Cariolus wounded, to the great grief of all
the Nobles. The General having understanding thereof, in his shalop boorded him
withal the speed he might, carrying with him his own Surgion, and such as
professed physic, doubting the grief to be more dangerous then it proved,
whereof, albeit the report was first offensive to him, yet was comforted in
this comfort, the wound not mortal, they regarding it as nothing, when the
General had carefully seen the wound searched and dressed, enquiring what they
were which he had taken, he caused all the chief of them to be called unto him,
who on their examinations would confess little, which forced the General to
put one of ye inferiors, attendant on Phidamia, the Egyptian kings brother, to
be tortured, who forced with the cruelty thereof, confessed what they were,
and how their going for Babylon, was to entreat a peace with the Emperor, who
as they were informed, levied a power to subvert their country, in revenge of
the wrong offered Phedera, sister to the Thessalian King, slain in a battle
fought at sea, by the Egyptian King. This news was not sooner revealed then
welcome, for hereby they were assured of an expected friend, yet enquired the
General, whether their King had married the Princess Phedera, or no, and
where he lived? Sir quoth the Egyptian, after the victory obtained, wherein
the Noble Theophilus perished, the King my master, furnished for such an
attempt, without further stay or suffering them to gather head, which he was
sure they would do, hearing of their Kings ill success: to prevent which, he
framed his course thither, where they suddeinly arrived, and by their power and
policy, subdue the chiefest of the Nobility, who having them sure, they
easily and in short time, overcame the rest, where he was by general voices
(though) against their liking, Crowned King of Thessaly. How he punished the
Nobility, I omit, embacing them, and raising in their places them far
unworthy such honor and reputation, so that neither Gentleman or other of
account, but lives in great servitude and slavery, glad to be relieved with
needful vyands and apparel, at their hands, which themselves have often fed.

The Princess, for all the persuasion he can use, he cannot in love obtain,
yet has he used the good Lady, more cruelly then I would willingly report, the
strangeness of her tortures being such, as few but does greatly pity. And
now as our last Poastes imparted unto us, he has appointed a time wherein she
must resolutely answer him to his content, or end her life in fire. The which
cruelty to her used, reported by Merchants of Babylon, with the virtues of the
Princess, and coming to the Emperors ears, being now in the prime of his
years, either of policy being mighty, to release her, or whether to make
her his Lady and wife, I cannot say, but he has required her in marriage,
pretending great love unto her, which the King will not grant unto. But in
words of great despite has answered him, in such manner, as he greatly
disliking, has with fire and sword defied him, who being a Prince of very
great might and force, our nobles of Egypt, have thought good rather to join
with favorable shows of friendship, then abide the extremity of his fury.
Lo sir, quoth he, thus have I satisfied your request, which is all I can do.
And for the same quoth the Knight, receive thy liberty, with what other favor
I may do thee.

These news was as pleasing to the Maiden Knight, as if he had been possessed
of the Crown, and having such advantage, holding it small policy to loose
any time, comforting Cariolus, emmitting the charge of his prisoners unto his
good regard, he hastes to his own ship, where, unto Theophilus King of
Thessaly, he recounted what he had heard, desiring that order might be
presently taken, whereby the enemy might be surprised at unawares, so might
they finish their intents with less danger and more honor, on which they
agreeing, they summoned their chiefest, unto whom, the Knight recounted what
the Egyptian had declared, beseeching the King whose cause it was, to speak
his mind, then the rest to give their advise what they thought was best to be
done, for accomplishing their desires, and planting the King in his own
Countries.

These questions propounded, each particular peril, with each advantage, and
occasion which offered good success was thoroughly debated, when they had each
one delivered their mind, Pheander, whose honor was now in the Balance, as one
that desired no worldly possessions so much as the reputation with his
mistress and the King, said; Noble Gentlemen, you have all like resolute,
brave and hardy men at Arms, showed in your speeches the desire you have to
do this noble King that service for which we come, if therefore you will incline
your ears to my opinion among the rest, I shall acknowledge my self greatly
favored by you. The whole company which by courtesy was drawn to his love,
was easily won to this request, and willed him say on, which he did in this
manner.

My Noble Lords, and friends in Arms, touching these motions made for our
proceedings, it has bin by the Egyptian reported, whom we do credit, the King
is in possession of Thessaly, which Crown, we know all, he does dishonorably
usurp. The Princess, she, in such extreme, that by his cruel censure is not
long to live, unless against her will she grant to love him, who is loathsome
in her eyes. To prevent which, it behooves us to search the best mean that we
can, and for that every one has given his censure, this is my advise, that
having these Nobles in our possession, in whom consists the strength of his
Realm, our company being lusty and strong, we will raunge their confines,
where finding place and opportunity, we may surprise them at unawares, who
being subdued, his force shall be the more impaired. That done, we will with
all convenient speed pass for Thessaly, where I doubt not but to come before
the time limited the Princess for her answer, and to reskew her, delivering
the possession of the Crown, into the Kings hand, the Knight having said,
presently it was confirmed, and each Captain departed to his charge according
to directions given, entered the confines of Egypt, where they wrought by such
policy and directions of the Maiden Knight, that they landed in the dead of
y^ night, the greatest part of their Armies, marching in warlike order toward
the City of Buckelia, where the king kept his chief Court, and where their
greatest force was. But before they could recover the walls, or come to view
the same for any advantage, they were descried, and the gates shut, against
whom the Citizens made such power as they could for their defense, which
unexpected of the Knight, caused him to stay until himself went to know
their pleasures and to deliver his own intent. And mounting himself, only
accompanied with his Herald and one Trumpet, he came before the walls,
sommoning them to parley, which was answered again by an other Trumpet, and
such of the nobility as was within, showed themselves unto him, demanding a
cause of his coming in Arms to disturb their dominions, and the subjects to
their King.

Nobles of Egypt, answered the Maiden Knight, Theophilus lawful King of
Thessaly, whose Crown, your King Donacia, unjustly withholdeth, preserved by
heavens power for your scourge, and to revenge the blood of those innocents
slain by your cruelty, is come with fire and sword to require his right,
which if you accept, and will deliver, he sendes you by me mercy, if you deny
and do not surrender your Crown of Egypt, with all the regalties, honors,
privileges and customs, thereunto belonging, and become his faithful subjects
and liegemen, you shall all perish with the sword, and your Country flaming
with fire, shall be overthrown, in such manner, that in time to come, there
shall nothing be found but the ruins of your gorgious Palaces, and stately
Cities, this has he vowed by the honor of his name: therefore choose like
wary Champions, and let me know your wills, for no detraction may be used.

The Egyptian Pheres, which heard the name of Theophilus, whom they long
sithence supposed dead, were surprised with a sudden fear, in such manner as
their senses were deprived, and they r^s^ed like men in extacie, fearing the
revenge of him whom they did all know was by their King highly wronged, yet
showing the Nobility of their minds, shaking off fear, they said; Sir
Knight, thy unlooked for message is such, as we know not sodeinly how to
answer, neither will we like faint hearted peasants, derogate from our Noble
ancestors, the honor they long maintained, with cowardice to deliver that
which nature and fidelity urges us to defend, our lives we esteem as they
are, vain, and every day subject to casualties and death, nor do we enjoy that
small time given us, but only for our Commonweal, and benefit of our
Country, being pillars on whom the state depends: you have dastardlyke waited
opportunity to take us at advantage, our King not present, whose right and
interest we are sworn to maintain. Therefore to Theophilus say; That as we
serve our King, and live by his Grace, we will with our dearest blood withstand
the invasion of any foreign Prince whatsoever. If our king as you allege,
have offered wrong unto him, let him revenge it on him, and seek his amends
where he may get it, for other entertainment let him not look for here.

The Maiden Knight, hearing their resolution, greatly commended their valor,
and loyalty to their sovereign, who seeing their truth, pitied them, and
wished all men so faithful minds: yet how well so ever he lyked their
answer, their intents was to be considered, who came with more resolute minds
then to be won with fair words, and therefore returned with all have to the
Camp, where to the king, he briefly delivered the sum of their answer, which
the king took no pleasure to hear, rather desiring their submission by
courtesy, then the effusion of blood; yet not to pity them in such manner to
give over the advantage he had, wherefore that they might be assured of his
resolution which came to conquer, from his usurping foe, taking his Army which
was led by the appointed General, he brought them before the City, unto
whom they gave many sharp and fierce allarmes, and were valiantly repulsed, not
without great loss of either part. Thus continued the assault long and
dreadful, till Pheander noting the time of the Princess Phederaes death to
draw near, when either she must be rescued, or dye that extreme death
assigned, he determined to put all on fortune, to see the end, and not longer
to prolong time. And calling those whose valor he had most assurance off, he
made known unto them his intent, requiring their company, whereunto small
persuasions served, desirous to be a partner with him in his actions, which
were in all things very honorable. The knight assured of his friends and
followers in this action, gave directions to all Captains, at the going down
of the Sun to be ready furnished with their companies, to bid the enemy
battle, doing their best, before that place where their chief force was, in
the mean time, he with his accomplices would assail some other part which was
of less ability to defend.

Thus these noble Gentlemen, having determined as they say, to win the horse
or lose the saddle, neglected no time, so that against the appointed hour,
each man in his place was readily furnished, and most valiantly attempted with
all warlike Ensigns to enter the City, battering, scaling, and each several
ways searching, that policy or valor would permit, to bring the City to
ruin, and vanquish ye enemy, which was most nobly defended with great courage
and much loss of either part. While they were at their hardy fight on either
part, it is not to be forgotten, how the Maiden Knight with his associates,
seeking opportunity, by chance lighted on the side of an old wall, which being
somewhat decayed, they by industry of their hands and painful toil, easily
made the breach such, that they entered at pleasure, and passing through the
streets which led to the assaulted gate, molested no man until they came
thither, where entering the same, slew the watch and opened the gate,
advancing the Thracian Kings colors on the top thereof, crying ever in their
way as they passed, Thessaly, Thessaly. This cry amazed the Citizens, and Armed
the Thrasians to the hotter attempt, who entered to the rest, and with such
courage bare them, that they had soon vanquished the defendants, who to save
their lives, had betaken themselves to their Churches, as places of Sanctuary,
from whence they sent their wives and Infants all disrobed, to search the King,
and in their names to require his pardon, such diligence made the modest
matrones, that they were brought by Pheander to the King, where prostrating
themselves at his feet, their face bedeawed with tears, they humbly besought
him to take compassion on them, their husbands and children, that as he was a
Conqueror, so with favor to use the glory of his victory, as the poor
subjects might not have cause to complain them of his cruelty, who had done
nothing blame worthy, but as true subjects to their sovereign the King, whose
heart was moved with pity at their suit, gently took them up, measuring their
calamity by his own misfortunes, and bethought him of their fidelity, yet
pretending a show of unkindness, for refusing his mercy proffered them by his
noble General, he would not be entreated sodeinly to grant them life, which
the Noble Pheander noted, and like himself, waying their faith to their
Prince, and weal of their Country, which with their lives they had sought to
maintain, he was content to remit their fault, and not only to pardon their
lives, but restore them to all former liberties, and places of honor, without
any disparagement to their royalty, so that they would acknowledge him their
sovereign, and be as faithful to him and his, as they had showed themselves
to that usurper his enemy. This choice at first seemed hard, yet of two evils
the least is to be chosen, as these Nobles of Egypt, who seeing their lives,
wives, children, and what they possessed, to be in the hands of strangers, whom
they could not withstand, making a virtue of necessity, were the rather won
to yield themselves unto the Kings pleasure, at the intercession of their
wives, whose tears shead in abundance, moved them to ruth, in such wise, that
subiecting on these conditions to his Exellence, they proclaimed him king of
Thessaly and Egypt, swearing fayaltie unto him, and delivering hostages for
their loyalty. This done, the king with general consent Crowned, the Commons
began conceive an especial hope of his honorable love to them, whose kindness
was such, that having the City and whole kingdom at his pleasure, would not
suffer his soldiers to imbeasell or purloyne in any sort, but rather made
choice to reward the Mercenary men out of his own treasury, which honorable
beginning, gained their especial lyking: when order was taken for the
government of the state, Pheander who was mindful of the Princess Phedera,
hasted the King on for Thessaly, often putting him in mind, what dangers the
good Lady was likely to abide, if she consented not to the King, who was more
cruel then courteous, wherefore taking their pledges, he left the noble
Cariolus his Vizegerent, to take the government upon him in his absence, and
with the next favorable wind, they set sail for Thessaly, where to their good
success we leave them, to tell you more of Mustapha, the Heathen Prince, who
was in the Princess Nutania her custody.

The mighty Emperor of Constantinople, understanding the ill success of his
son, with the great slaughter of his men, was moved at the first to such
chollor, that he had determined for ever to abandone his son, and never to
have known or regarded him, but being persuaded by his nobility which
tenderly loved the prince, he was at length by their motions, won to
conceive, how unstable fortunes chances are, and how victories sometimes happen
as well to the coward as the valiant, not forgetting to urge unto him, how
dishonorable it were for a Prince, to leave the meanest subject he had at such
an exigent, that should adventure his life in his service, much more was his
Majesty bound by natures laws to relieve his son, and not suffer him as one
forsaken, to remain in the hands of his enemies, upon which motion of his
Bashawes, the King caused two Galleys to be rigged and furnished, appointing of
his chiefest Nobles too, for that voyage to Thrace, as well to advertise him of
his sons welfare which he favored, as also to agree upon the sum of his
ransom, all things furnished for the voyage, the Bashawes having taken leave of
the Emperor and the rest of their friends, favored with a happy gale, they
shortly arrived in Thrace, of whose arriual, the king by his messengers was
advertised, who being of nature honorable and courteous in behavior, caused a
sumptious train of Courtiers, with all the honorable manner they could, to
receive them at their Port of landing, taking like order in all lodgings and
places of repast, his Officers at his charge to attend them, which in such
exquisit manner was performed, as the Bashawes with their retinue, admyred
their entertainment. Thus by easy iournies came they to the court, where the
king with the princess, gave them many welcomes, enquiring kindly after the
good health of the renowned Emperor their master, whom he maligned no whit
at all, how hardly so ever he had measured his friendship with him, when the
King and these Nobles had spent some time in discoursing, they enquired of the
welfare of their Prince Mustaffa, whom the King caused to be sought and
brought to their presence, before whom they bowed themselves in all
humbleness, as to the son of their sovereign, whom he again with all
kindness imbrased, passing the time with much pleasure, ioying in the welfare
of his friends. The King doing them all the honor that could be devised,
passing the time with such recreation and gentle sportes as the Country
affoorded, at length, a sum of money for the Princess ransom was agreed
upon to their content, for that it was reasonable, and the conditions
honorable, which obtained their vittailes by the king was relieved, and all
necessaries at his charge purueyed, in such manner, and with so much bounty, as
they had great cause to report honorably of the king. Long had they not
tarried, but a wind pleasant and favorable, presents it self, which good
time, they neglected not, but taking leave of the king, their prince, and
princess Nutania, who accompanied them onwards to their galleys, three whole
days iournies, they leave them to the care of their iourny, who being
imbarqued, in short time arrived at Constantinople, where how welcome they were
to the Emperor and his Nobles, I omit, to let you understand of y^ honorable
reports made of their entertainment in Thrace, and the welfare of the prince,
whose company, there were few but desired. The strangenes of this report made
of Philarcus, was exceeding admirable in the Emperors ears, who wondered not a
little, that a king whom he had so much wronged, should use such kindness to
his son, and courtesy to his messengers, extolling highly the honorable
condition of the king, and much lamenting his own follyes, so rashly without
any occasion offered, to injury him so far as to spoil his Country, and to
rob him perforce of his only child, his sole delight and comfort. To
recompense all which, and to keep his friendship, he presently elected other
nobles for Thrace, to be employed, which with the princess ransom, and many
rich presents to the king and his daughter were dispatched, with Letters of
love, and desire of amity, all which, coming to the Thrasian king, were so
heartily accepted as they could wish, and in presence of the nobles, and states
of both Realms, was the peace concluded, and a band of everlasting friendship
promised, to all their joys. Thus with great delight at the earnest
intercession of the king, spent those Turkish nobles sometime in Thrace, till
their prefixed time ganne draw to end, when receiving their Prince with great
rewards, and many thanks for their pains they put to Sea, and were not long
before they recovered their famous City of Constantinople, where they were
most royally welcomed, but especially the Prince, for whose safety many
pastymes was ordained, with Iustings, Turneyes, Barriers, and other pleasing
delights, wherein the Prince honorably bare him self, to the great joy of his
father, and pleasure of the whole state, who gloried greatly in him, which was
likely to prove a most honorable Prince; and their ensuing comfort. But while I
digress, let it be considered, that y^ Maiden Knight, who thirsted to see the
end of his desires, slept no time, but made all possible means he could, as
wind and weather would give leave, until he arrived in Thessaly, which he
recovered in so good time as he could wish, and taking that opportunity which
was offered, he landed his companies, and near to the sea side encamped his
power, until he might be advertised of what power the King was, and where he
remained, for the atteining of which, many espialls was sent out sundry ways,
and many Ambuscadoes laid, to intercept such as traveled the country: but
their landing being discryed, every one in the haste they could make, hyed them
to their cities and places of defense, where they with their store of provision
which they brought, were received. The King, who securely passed his time,
taking care for nothing, and ioying wholly in the hopes he conceived of his
Ladies grant, being advertised of the arrival of a foreign power, overcome
with sorrow at that instant, as one that never tasted adversity, was surprised
with such sudden heaviness, as no words, no persuasions, nor any comfort, might
mittigate his sorrow, what pains soever his Nobles took to pacify him, his
guilty conscience presaging some hard fortune to be at hand: the Nobility
which had more regard to his welfare and his country then he could on the
sudden imagine, after they had caused their Rampyers to be shut, and their
Fortresses to be made, doubting the worst, desirous to be resolved what the
enemy was, that thus daringly durst board him in his own country, they caused
the Lord Mama Bacha, sometime one of the chiefest in Thessaly, a wise and well
governed Gentleman, to be sent unto them, to know whence they were, and their
pretense, which against their wills, vnacquainting them with their pretense,
had entered their confines. The Noble man to whose charge this was committed,
though he had small care of any matter, living dishonored in his own Country,
where, in his Kings reign he was the only honored, and amongst his Nobles in
most account of him, had his wits sundry ways imployd, and on diverse matters,
yet amongst all imaginations, the thought of his own sovereign was least, the
report of his death being so certain, but what so ever he could imagine was
uncertain, wherefore as desirous to be resolved of his doubts, as the King and
Nobles to be thereof certified, only accompanied with an other of the
disgraced Nobility, they hyed them toward the Camp, and was by the
Ambuscadoes soon surprised and brought to the Pauilion of the General, who
saluting them with kind countenance, demanded whence they were, and what
occasions led them in such suspicious manner toward their Camp. The Nobles
which had small care which end went foreward, after they had well advised
themselves, said; (sir,) if we give not those tytles your honor deserve,
pardon us which offend not of presumption therein, but of ignorunce: that we
come as spyalls to view thy force, and to discover them, therein you deceive
your self, but come as messengers from our King, to know thy pretense, and
what thou meanest landing thy Armies without his license, which is contrary to
law of Arms? If thou come in peace and not as as enemy, resolve us this, and
thou honor us? The prince taking their words at advantage, where they said
they came from their King, with a counterfeyt show of great dislike, said;
Traitors how dare you to my face use those colors of simplicity, when you
aver you come from your King, which I know is altogether untrue? wherefore that
you shall warn the rest how they delude me, you shall have the reward of
traitors, and calling for the provost Marshall, commanded him to cut off their
heads. The Nobles, thinking he had been past jest, seeing their executioner so
ready, humbly besought him to credit what they had said, which was true, and
pardon their lives, for that law of Arms protecteth the messenger of the
Prince, from whom they come, therefore it would redowne to his great dishonor,
to violate the hostility of all Princes. While they were thus at their shrift,
it chanced Theophilus their lawful King, to enter the Pauilion of his General,
whose presence much appalled the Thessalian nobles, who standing as men past
themselves, had no thought but in beholding him, which so much resembled their
supposed dead king, the long noting of whom, caused them to renew their
sorrows, and with remembrance of the times they had past, to shead tears. The
King imagining what they thought, knowing them well, put them from their
studious thoughts thus.

Men of Thessaly, what means your heaviness? think you hereby to delude this
noble Gentleman, or by your fainings, to procure your favor, if either one or
other of these causes, you deceive your selves, and incur you more trouble?
Wherefore to avoid the perils incident unto you, if you be right Thessalians,
and tender the walfare of your Princess, in whose rescue we come, briefly
declare unto us, in what estate she abides, and where the usurping king has
his residence? Mama Bacha, hearing that pleasing tongue, wherewith he was
acquainted, assured himself that it was their king, and without further stay,
humbly kissyng his Majesty's feet, his face bedeawed with tears, and his
tongue foltering in his mouth, as one with sudden joy overcome, he says; My
gracious sovereign, how glad am I that enjoy breath, to behold your Majesty
alive, whom all the world reputeth for dead, the heavy tidings of which, with
your ill success, moved the hearts of your loving subjects to such extreme
heaviness, as nothing might comfort, that past comfort, and al hope of
beholding your princely face, we reckoned you amongst the dead. In the extreme
of this sorrow, as all evils commonly fall in one, when every heart and eye was
deploring the loss of so gracious a Prince, then began our further griefs
through the oppression of this usurping tyrant, whose cruelty to thy subjects
has been such, as greeueth me to recount. Thy sister he deteineth in prison,
from whence he has vowed she shall never be freed, until with consent she take
him for her king, or by gainsaying his demaundes, receive that death which he
has doomed her unto, whose wrongs we poor men how much so ever we pity,
yet can we remedy nothing, our ability being little, and our reputation less,
Amongst these cruel Egyptians who has robbed us of what we possessed, not
suffering us to enjoy our ancient patrimony, nor what they might any way
dispoile us of: to revenge of which, we hope in thee and thy power, who wilt
maintain and defend thy own lawful right, rather offering thy life amongst
us that honor and love thee as our lives, then leave us any more. To the
accomplishing of which, my self, with all thy own Country borne subjects
that we can procure unto us, will lend what aid our weak force will stretch
unto, and thereof assure your Majesty.

The King hearing the lamentable report of the Lord Mama Bacha, could not
forbear to show the heaviness of his hearts sorrow, by his outward motions,
yet to hide it as he might, embracing them both, he framed a feined joy to see
them, how so ever his heart was ouerburthened with grief. When they had passed
some time in parley about their affairs, and that some offers were made by
these Nobles, of their aid and assistance, a general Council was called,
where, by consent of such as had government, understanding the power of Donatio
the usurper, was no more but such as guarded his holds, it was determined,
after the army had refreshed themselves two or three days, to martch forewarde
to the City, there to beleager the King, and cut off from them all supply of
provision for victualles, whereof they had small store.

In the mean time, the Lords of Thessaly, to give notise to all their
friends, (with all speed) as they tendered their own liberties, to repair
with such power as they could make unto the Camp. This devise was no sooner
determined on, but the Noble Mama Bacha, without returning to the King, spared
not his pains and all others which he could command or entreat, proclaiming
in every place as they passed, Theophilus their lawful king, straightly
charging all natural subjects of Thessaly, to make repair unto the Camp.
These tidings at first were hardly believed, yet such was the rumor of a
foreign power landed, that all which could bear Arms repaired to the King,
whom they found at the assault of the City where the usurper kept, such was
the multitudes of people, which from all countries in his Regions came unto
him, that in short time he had power sufficient to ouerrunne a kingdom. The
usurper Donatio, who had least thought ever to hear or see the Thessalian
King, when the report of his being in the Camp, was brought unto him, his
courage quailed, and his hope of enjoying the Crown, was quite extinguished,
so that dispairing, he became like a man lunatike, that nothing (whatsoever)
might move him to any mirth or content, so that giving over all, he cared not
what became of himself or his, yet was he carefully counseled by his Nobles,
who regarded both his honor and their own safety: but whatsoever they might
counsel or determine, was ill imployd, at his hands was nothing to be had,
wherefore, after they saw his small care, and that he was not to be advised,
they determined, either in field with vnappoynted battle to try their
fortunes, or by some such composition as might be for their Courtries safety
and their reputation, to give over their title pretended to the Crown of
Thessaly. Before that any thing was of them resolved, the Maiden Knight, which
had his mind on his Lady, as well as of other affairs, could not rest in
content, until he had finished, and either gained what they came for, or seen
the event of fortune. Wherefore to avoid further delays, he summoned the
City to parley, wherein he required their answer, whether they would receive
their lawful King or no, if yea, they should suffer him in peace to enter, or
otherwise upon their answer, to abide the hazard incident to Arms, which he
protested should be void of all favor, if he prevailed, and they refused this
offer of his. These summons, caused the Nobility to look with better advise
into their estates, and with consideration to wey each particular peril, which
they found to be very many, and dangerous, especially seeing the multitude,
who were natural subjects, and did rather affect their own King, how so ever
they professed in outward appearance, then the usurper, which made them the
more earnest with their King, unto whom they declared the offers made by the
Maiden Knight, with y^ doubts they had of his success, who were nothing in
number to the Kings power, which daily increased, and contrary, his decreased:
wherefore they advised him to yield unto such Articles of honor as they would
require, which should be both for his honor, and safety of him and his. The
usurper hearing these persuasions from them, whereon his cheifest hope
consisted, forgetting all former friendship and love to any of them, with most
odious words reviled them, calling them traitors, dastards, and vpbraiding them
with cowardice, which were never found but ever forward in all his actions,
only this excepted, wherein was no hope. These speeches moved his Nobles to
such fury, that departing from him in discontent, they resolved for their own
safety, to seek what means they could, and not by delays to incur his
displeasure whose friendship they were by all means they could use, to
entreat. Wherefore in name of all the rest, the Lord Philiago, principal
Treasuror unto the King, by whose direction the rest would be governed, sent
for the Princess (Phedera) from prison, whom he used with honorable speeches,
comforting her with hope of her kingly brother, who lived, and was in person
come with a strong power, to deliver her from that captivity which so long she
endured, humbly beseeching her grace, to become a favorable soliciter to his
Highness, for them, who were to be commanded by their sovereign, whose
subjects they were, protesting that neither for envy to him or his, they
undertook the action, but at commaundment, and to avoid the ignomious title
of cowardice, which all of honorable birth or mind, ought to detest. The good
Princess which could not tell, whether she might give credit to his words or
no, answered him thus.

My Lord Philiago, under the greenest grass lurketh the most perilous poison,
and experience has taught me, in my durance, the knowledge of friends, these
sodeine offers of love to my brother, whom you all know, is long sithence dead,
causes me the more to dread, I am going to him, and that your proffered
friendship is but to that end to bereave me of that which long since I wished
to leave, if it be so, good my Lord, hyde not the truth thereof from me, for
therein shall you show your charitable mind to a distressed Captive.

Far be it from my thought, Noble Lady, quoth Philiago, that I should any
way delude you, or move you to credit any thing other then truth, whom I have
my greatest hope of good, to assure you of which, so pleases your Exellence, I
will my self bring you to his Majesty's presence. When the Princess heard him
make these proffers of favors, and perceived by his iesture he did not
counterfeyt, overcome with joy, she was in a trance, from which, revived by
the careful industry of the Lady Urania, wife to the Lord Philiago, she gave
the Noble man great thanks for his tidings, assuring him on her word, that she
would so recompense that good, as he nor his, should have any cause to
complain of her ungratefulness. Urging him with her courteous speech, to
detract no time but to bring her to the Camp where the King was, which he
willingly yielded unto, and causing a stately Charyot to be ordained, and
richly apparrelling the Princess as befitteth her, accompanied with his Lady
and two daughters of rare beauty, himself waiting on her disrobed, issued out
of the gates, and in short time came near the Camp, and were by the
Sentronelles discovered, and brought to the Kings presence, who seeing the
Princess, whom he had great doubt the tyrant would have murdered, so
sudden a joy surprised him, as he might not speak, yet ouercomming his
passion, joining his face with hers, after many kind imbrasings, he says;
Phedera, how have the heavens blessed me, in giving me life to behold thee,
more dear unto me then a million of lives, whom sithence I possess, as the
only joy I conceived hope of in this world, I account my happiness more, then
to be possessed of the worlds reuenew. But tell me Phedera, what are these that
accompany thee, strangers to me they are, how friendly soever they have used
thee?

Most gracious soueraign, for these noble persons, I am to entreat, having
passed my word, to be their safe conduct from any violence should be offered
them, therefore good my Lord, receive into your favor, the Lord Philiago,
Treasurer to the usurper, his Lady and daughters, such as are by them
protected, so shall thou honor me the more, by mainteining my word, which
relying on your princely nature, I have past. The Maiden Knight, willing to
hold her honor in regard, said; Madame, how his Majesty on the sudden may be
won to favor your suit, I cannot say, having had such great cause to revenge
him on their cruelty, but for his life, let him thank your grace, if he enjoy
it. The King, whose heart pity moved to tender the suit of the princess,
coming toward the noble Philiago and his Lady, with great courtesy took them
from the earth whereon they kneeled, accepting them to his majesty, using them
with such honor and courtesy, that they admired him. After he had revived with
his kind confections these sorrowing suitors, he said; Philiago, as I have
pardoned thy life, so fail not to tell me, thy Kings determination, whether he
will yield, or in battle try the event of our fortunes?

Gracious soueraign, quoth Philiago, that he determines to seek your grace, is
more then I can say, for such desperate humors assaileth him, that he is not
himself, and friends fails him, from the Noble to the peasant, whose wisdoms
have with grave advise considered, what wrongs has bin offered your grace, and
has upon your Princely motions of mercy, solicited him to pity them, and
yield unto your grace, which when he could not be persuaded unto, we all left
him, and I in name of all the Nobility, humbly beseech your highness of
mercy, who only attends but my return, at which time on your gracious word,
they will deliver the City.

My Lord quoth the King, what cause so ever I have in the most extreemest manner
to revenge me on you all, yea to the very child that sucketh, that I omit. And
that thou and they all shall know I delight not in blood, nor wish I the life
of my mortallest for, return unto them, and from me say, that if in
submissiue wise, they issue their gates, and at my feet crave mercy, bring
with them their usurping king, I will accept them, so that thou and they shall
swear your dutiful allegiance to me and mine, shall be hereafter maintained
in such manner as becomes faithful subjects to their Prince, I will admit
them to my grace, and will be unto them a loving and gracious sovereign.
Philiago, which had that he most desired, uttering with many deep sighs, the
joy his heart conceived for his good success, after many humble and hearty
prayers for the kings long life in all happiness to be maintained, he besought
his grace to give him leave with his happy tidings, to make glad the hearts of
those sorrowful Nobles which exspected his return, which the king granted,
deteining his wife and daughters to attend his sister, whose joys exceeded the
extremes of her misery, enjoying her Noble brother, which she was out of all
hope ever to behold again. To their recreation we leave them, and pass on
with the Lord Philiago, who made no stay until he came to the gates, where
diverse of his friends exspected his coming. No sooner entered he the City,
but sommoning the Nobles and Gonernors of the Citte together, he delivered unto
them, what favor he had received of the King, and how willing he was to show
like clemency unto them all, upon those conditions specified, whereunto he
persuaded them to yield, not omitting any thing to make them mindful of the
little hope they had of the usurpers success, for which they had no reason to
incline unto him, who had so small regard of them, but rather let him endure
the reward of his own follies, then that so many should perish for one man's
wrongs. Resolved thus, they hastened unto the Count, at whose sudden
entering, the King was greatly appalled, considering in what discontent they
parted with him, yet showing a countenance void of all fear, he required the
cause of their coming, whom they soon resolved, letting him know each
particular of their event, persuading him to patience, for what they had
determined should be accomplished. The King hearing his own doom of misery
pronounced, albeit it moved him to great impatience, yet restraining chollor,
he with his smooth speech, besought them of respite for his answer till the
next morning, which they willingly consented unto. And so leaving him, they
departed each one to his several mantion. But he in whose heart revenge
harbored, having his mind wholly bent on their ruin, after he had conferred
with such as were as full of mischief, as himself of cruelty, and was by
them advertised, what power they were off, he caused them secretly in the night
Armed, to assemble at the Court, where in very covert manner they remained,
until the time came that the Nobles should come to receive their answer, who
void of all suspect of evil, entered the Palace, desirous to know his
pleasure, touching the matter th^^ between them in question. No sooner c^^^
they to t^^ kings presence, but the cruel tyrant / showing in his cou^te^^nce
the pretense of his heart, began in ^^^^mes of great reproach to exclaim
against the Nobles, whom he accused of treason and unjust dealing, against him
and the state of his country, that flying from him which was their lawful
sovereign, sought to supplant him, to Crown another. But Traitors quoth he,
you shall reap such reward as your treachery deserves, and therewithal
giving the watchword, his confederates which for the purpose was ambushed,
issued upon them, and sodeinly surprised as many as they could come by, the
the rest that fled, entering the City, proclaimed the lawful king, offering in
his name free pardon of life and goods, to as many as followed them. At which
offer of grace, the commons, wearied with the oppression of the usurper, in
multitudes assembled themselves, and guided by Philiago, they fiercely assailed
the king in his Court, fleying as many as they could reach unto, and reskued
their fellow Nobles, whose death by the Tyrant was determined, had not the
valor and policy of this noble Philiago prevailed. In this exployt, many of
the company of the usurper was slain, him self with such as escaped, betook
them to the mountains, where they encamped themselves, exspecting aid of
those he had preferred. But they more regarding their own weal then his
honor, and seeing no comfort or hope of recovery, submitted themselves unto the
kings mercy, and was of him received. This canuesado passed, the commons with
general voice elected Theophilus for their King, Philiago, poasted him with
all speed to the Camp, and to the king delivered the treacherous pretense of
the usurper, with the event of all his and their actions, and in the name of
the whole state besought him to receive the Crown, and the faithful love of
all the commons. Theophilus hearing the mischeeuous pretense of this usurper,
pitying his subjects that had so long been governed by a prince so ill
conditioned, at the earnest intercession of the noble Philiago, guarded with a
troop of his trustiest men at Arms, marched he to the City, at the entery rf
which, the whole Nobility, bare legged and bare footed, received him, and to
his highness delivered the keys of their ports, with presents of rich price,
marching before him to the Palace, crying with a general voice Theophilus,
Theophilus. The king noting his subjects loves, with hearty thanks requited
them all, exhorting them to obedience and loyalty, which if they faithfully
followed, he would be a merciful prince unto them. Theophilus, in possession
of his Crown, willing his friends should participate with him, dispatched a
messenger for the Maiden Knight, the Princess, and her attendants, who all as
their duty, obediently fulfilled his commandment, the Maiden Knight
excepted; who careful of his charge, and looking into the practices and
devises of the usurper, besought his grace to pardon his not coming to Court
for a time, until he had seen the event of his affairs, and sending for
such guides as he was informed to be well acquainted in these desartes, he
put himself in search for the usurper, and his scattered crew, whom in short
time he found, to the number of one thousand, on horse and foot, which he
no sooner espied, but chearing his companies, which were not above forty, not
minding to give them days, he bravely assailed them, and so valiantly behaved
himself in that conflict, that after two whole hours spent in hardy feats of
Chiualry, there was few of the companies living. The king he surprised as he
was flying, with whom he returned to the City, and to the king Theophilus
delivered him, who kindly accepting his Present, returning the knight many
thanks for his pains. This brunt past, and all things by the valor and good
industry of the Maiden Knight, brought to quiet end, the king unwilling to
detain his subjects from their own homes, recompencing euey man for his
service, dislodged the camp. A world of wonder it were, to recount what
general joy was throughout the land for the return of their king, and his good
succes, for which great triumphs were ordained, with Iusts, Barriers and Tilt,
wherein the nobles of ye country in great bravery behaved themselves, but the
best and chiefest honor in each several action, was given the Maiden Knight,
who like himself so behaved himself, as there was no talk, throughout Court
and Country, but tended to the general commendations of this noble Prince.
Thus as all things has end, so ended these tryumphes, and the King in peace
enjoyed his kingdom, which through the Thracian Kings assistance, and the
valor of this honored knight, he obtained. Al things quieted, the Maiden
Knight, after he had a small time reposed himself from his travels, humbly
besought his highness, to suffer him with his companies to depart, which
favor, he could not by any entreaty obtain. Wherefore to satisfy the King
with his own longer stay, he dismissed his Army, whom the King so royally
rewarded, as no man had cause to complain of his time spent, but every one to
speak of his honor and bounty. The conduct of whom, after he had with great
care puruaide them victuals, with all things necessary, he committed to
Vrelia, a noble man of Thrace, by whom the knight advertised the king of his
stay, which was chiefly for the Lord Cariolus, whom they left Vizeroy in
Egypt, recommending also his service unto the Lady Nutania, he presented by
this noble Vrelia, the usurper unto her, as her prisoner, (and his conquest).
Thus all things carefully puruaide, the wind blowing a favorable gale, they
imbarqued themselves, and sailing with a wind as they could wish, they shortly
arrived in safety at their desired Port, where their welcome was such of the
king, as they might joy to receive it, where friend with friend, ioyed for
their return, only the Princess endured the greatest penance, missing the
return of her knight, who could not be persuaded of his welfare, wanting his
presence, yet accepted she the usurper his prisoner, and through the great
protestations of the Lord Vrelia, had hope to see him again, whose heart
enjoyed small content, wanting his company.

Here Gentiles we leave the noble Pheander, in company of the Thessalian King,
spending his time in small content, wanting the sight of his desired Lady, and
his Lady with tears bewailing him, whom she more desired then the worlds
possessions, to show you what happened the ancient Barnardine, who as you have
heard before, left the Numedian Court, with all his possessions, Pilgrimelyke
iourneying toward Delphos, there of the Oracle to be advertised of his king
and the princes life or death, and coming to the sacred Chapel of Apollo,
after his Orisons done and his offerings made, before the shrine of Appollo, the
pitiful god moved at his intercession, and considering the faithful love to
his prince and country, which is pleasing both to gods and men, after he had
with tears bewailed his prince, was thus answered.

Barnardine, thy faithful love to thy prince and country, we have regarded,
and moved with pity of thee and thy commonwealth, whose subjects distressed,
desire to have knowledge of their king and his princely son, with what shall
befall them, receive these lines which shall import the event of all, yet for a
time conceal them, and continue thy travail.

Barnardine, whose heart was lightened with this comfortable voice, looking
about him, espied a paper, which taking up, he read in this manner:

Ambicious, shall your land with wars annoy,
Taking perforce, what subjects does enjoy.
A foreign power, these Rebels pride shall quell,
Through whom, your commons shall in quiet dwell.
Before his face, whom they suppose for dead,
The Traitors shall for life, with pity plead.
A stranger Queen, on kingly seat shall sit,
Unto whose rule, your commons shall submit.
Religious, seeing your countries happy state,
Overcome with joy, shall dye at Princes gate.
He unto whom your Crown belongs aright,
Is all in one, a Merchant, King, and Knight.
Supposed lost, thou once again shall meet,
In foreign soil, sitting on princely seat.
When in thy travail, such one thou shall see,
As such there is, which shall be found by thee.
Keturne thou then, ^^^e dread thy guiltless blood,
Whose life preserved is, for thy Countries good.
When the aged Pilgrim had perused th^se lines, musing at the darkness of the
same, which he construed many ways, yet had no certainty, wherefore resolving
on the merciful favor of the God, which had so pitifully heard his prayer,
he passed on his journey in search for those princes which he hoped was
living, whom to his travail we leave, to return unto the Princess Phedera,
who having the company of the Maiden Knight, had sundry motions of desire to
enjoy his Love, evermore applauding his person, courtesy and valor, which so
far exceeded all men's in her judgment, that she honored him for the
Paragon of the world, holding her for the most happiest Lady on the earth,
which should enjoy his love, wishing that she were worthy of his love, and
framyng her self by all means that modesty would permit, to gain it. But
he whose heart was fixed on his Lady, had no motion of any other, only wished
to be with her whom he so much honored, whose presence, he more desired,
then all the riches the world could offoord. Tormented with these restless
passions, which was of the King and Courtiers noted, especially of the Lady
Phedera, many imagined the cause, yet none so good a physician to find the
truth, or cause thereof; as continual care weakeneth the body and causes
many extremes, so Pheander, feeling in himself a weakness of nature, and
looking for some disease through his melancholy to ensue, finding the king at
convenient time, he humbly besought him of favor to depart, alleging that the
air, and contagiousnesse of those Confines, was nothing agreeing with his
body, and that his longer stay, might be by his confusion.

The king which loved him as his own soul, and tendered his welfare more*
then the wealth of his kingdom, whom he had found so kind and forward,
aduenturing his life for his good in many broils, though loath to leave him in
whom so much he delighted, yet noting his melancholic humors, which had much
altered his complexion, imagined it was no excuse, and therefore the rather
condescended to his request, appoynting a time as he desired, when if God sent
wind and weather, to be ready with their shipping, to conduct him to Egypt,
whither the king promised with his sister and nobles to accompany him, for
which journey, a strict command was given to all Officers to see each thing
necessary puruayde, which with such diligence was performed, as in short time
all things was as they could wish or desire furnished, only attending a fair
wind to set sail, which they stayed not long for. But a gale fitting their
purpose, the king with his sister, the Maiden Knight, and their train,
embarked themselves for Egypt, where by the good furtherance of him that
commands all, they shortly arrived in safety, whose coming, being known
unto the Vizeroy Cariolus, with such provision as they could make on the
sudden, repaired unto the place of landing, where the king joyful to see the
good recovery of Cariolus, in most kind manner embraced him. And so general
welcomes being given on all sides by the Nobles, they pass on toward the
Palace of the king, who with a general love of his Commons, was to his great
delight welcomed, with such shows of joy as on the sudden they could prepare.

Thus after some time spent in banqueting and other pastimes for their
welcomes, to beguile the time the better, the Maiden Knight standing on
thorns, until he might behold the sweet content of his lives comfort,
finding Cariolus in place where they might discuss at large their minds. The
knight not forgetting his promise made to Cariolus in his own country, and
willing to make amends for the wrong he had there, thus said:

My Lord, what I have to impart unto you as one that wishes your good, is
such, as becomes a friend, vowed to do your Lordship what service my ability
can stretch unto, only I beseech you, promise on your honor to conceal what I
shall discover.

Cariolus, who both honored and loved the knight, musing to what these speeches
tended, relying on the fidelity of him whom he never had heard or seen to
commit any dishonorable action, gave him his word and honor, to be as secret in
all things as he could desire, which the knight accepting, thus said:

My Lord, first I humbly beseech your favorable love, to be continued, and
pardon my great offense committed against you, in Numedia, where not being my
self, I committed a most heinous offense and dishonorable, for which I am
willing to make such satisfaction, as you can require.

Cariolus, hearing the knight use these speeches of submission, noting them
well, and bethinking himself what had fortuned, being in Numedia, could not
call to mind any unkindness offered him by any inferior person, neither did
he well remember the princes discurtesie, yet leaving nothing unsought, calling
his wits together, bethought him of the prince, whom they forbear to
answer, until he had with earnestness noted the phisnomy of the knight,
whose face with long sickness, wherewith he was at that time possessed, was
quite altered from the form it now had, which made him more to admire. But
calling to mind the resemblance of the aged king, he conceived by some signs
of his favor, that it was doubtless the prince, yet doubtful he was, for
that being so nobly borne, he came to the Numedian Court, with no better
countenance then a Merchant. After many thoughts, not willing to offend through
rashness, or to offer any unkindness, he humbly besought him in true
friendship which he had found, to pardon him, which could not call to mind no
wrong done him, nor any familiarity that ever had been between them.

Well my Lord, quoth the knight, I see your mind is free from revenge, that
know not those that have endaungered your life, and therefore am the more
willing to reveal my self to clear you of this doubt. Know that I am
Dionicus, the unhappy Prince of Numedia, who in my fathers Court so much abused
you, whereof I repent me, and have sorrowed for it. But pardon me good
Cariolus, and accept that friendship I vowed unto you, which will endeavor to
deserve thy love in all occasions wherein true love consists. To give you
some cause to credit what I say, I have thought good to find this opportunity,
not only to reveal myself to you, whose favor I desire, but to do my best
endeavor to deserve the same, and to advance thy estate, if so you can like of
my offer.

Cariolus, amazed at these speeches, after he had with more advised eyes beheld
the Prince, was assured it was he, prostrating himself on his knee, humbly
besought his grace of pardon, which had so irreverently behaved himself. But
gracious Prince quoth he, faults unwillingly committed, deserve the less
punishment, I speak for my self which am ready to make amends in performing
^^y penance it shall please your highness to enjoin me, yielding many
millions of thanks for that favor you have vouchsafed, in giving me that
credit to reveal your self, to the unworthiest of many in high esteem, which
desires your highness knowledge, vowing by the honor of my Noble auncestry
to be governed and directed by the Prince Dionicus, and shall so please it your
highness, follow your grace, where soever it shall stand with your good
pleasure to conduct me. The Prince interrupting his speech, lovingly embraced
the Lord Cariolus, giving him many thanks for his kind offers, which he was
assured was faithfully spoken. In recompense of which, my Lord (quoth he,) and
to make you some satisfaction for my former wrong offered you, I will en^uour
to advance your estate, so it stand with your good liking, in this manner.

You see my Lord, though with some trouble and effusion of blood on either
part, the King in peace and quiet enjoys his own Country, and with the
Crown of his enemy, is like wise invested. Alluring baytes are kingdoms, and
have caused many Nobles, who not content with their own estates, to hazard
honor, life, and whatsoever else they enjoyed, to attain unto them.

But my Cariolus, if thou can frame thy lyking to my wish, and bend thy mind
to the love of Phedera, the Princess, my endeavor shall be to obtain her for
thy Lady, and the Kingdom of Egypt for her dowry, besides, she is heir to
her brother, who dying without issue, shall to higher honors prefer thee.
This is all my Noble Cariolus, that I have to say, (and so much I say) for that
I wish thy advancement, if thou like the Lady, and have not bestowed thy
lyking elsewhere. Say thy mind, as to him, which not only in this, but in all
other matters wherein I may do thee good, command me as thy self.

Cariolus, who was wise and well demeaned, endued with valor and courtesy, as
much as might be required, humb^^ returned many thanks for this unexpected
good, moved with a desire of kingly dignity, well content to enjoy so brave a
princes for his love, without farther stay, said;

My honored Lord, I cannot frame my tongue to yield such thanks as my heart
would utter, only this good I crave, that your highness continue your
gracious favor toward me, whose will shall be ever a law to Cariolus, who
will ever be directed by your majesty's advise. And seeing most honorable
Prince, you have motion of willingness to do me this good, I humbly beseech
you continue it, and bind Cariolus in everlasting bands of true friendship to
your service. Here were they interrupted, by the coming of the King, who
hearing that the Prince was gone that way, delighting in his company more then
in any others, came suddenly on them, yet not in such manner, but he was espied
of them. The King which saw them so earnest in their speech, coming up with
them said; Sir Knight, were my Lord Cariolus a Lady, as he is a honorable
Gentleman, I should be very su^pitious of you both, that you would find time to
stretch a point farther then became you. In faith Gentlemen (quoth he,) as
there is brotherly love between you, which the world well notes, let be a
trinity, and accept me for the third person, so shall you honor me more then I
will say, and endue me with such happiness as I will not for avoiding of flattry
utter. Your Majesty quoth the prince, may jest, but would it were known unto
your grace, our loves to your highness, you might then say, you have such
poor friends of us, as will ever be ready to adventure our lives in your
honorable service. Experience good Knight, answered the King, long sithence
has taught me that, whose eyes are witnesses of your loyalty, which I will
endeavor to requite, as when you please to make trial, you shall find,
especially you my Lord, whose blood lost in aduenturing for me, I can no way
requite. Seeing quoth the prince, your highness is thus disposed to jest,
pardon I beseech you, what I have to say, and favor me so much, as to hear my
humble suit, (and hearing) let me obtain it at your gracious hands, in
granting which, your grace shall more honor me then I dare report. Honorable
Knight, answered the King, among friends, what should need distrust, my heart
greeueth, that the noble Knight Pheander, should doubt to obtain, what ever
rests in my power to grant. Wherefore sweet friend say on, for by the honor of
the Thessalian kingdom, whose crown I enjoy through thy good industry, what
ever thou requirest shall not be denied. Thanks gracious Lord, not for my self
I entreat, but for this gentleman, whose heart having sworn fayaltie to love,
which is the sovereign guide of all men, has framed his lyking unto the
Princess Phedera, whose servant he has vowed himself, if then noble Prince,
it shall stand with your highness good leisure to accept of him, whose
honorable birth and haughty deeds of Chiualry, may merit some esteem with
persons of worth, I have my desire, (by granting of which,) and obteining the
Princess good lyking, I shall be more honored, then if your grace had invested
me with both the kingdoms of Thessaly and Egypt.

Pheander, quoth the King, if thou had required as much for thy self as thy
friend, thou could not have honored me more, whose amity I desire to
participate with, above all men of what account so ever: but seeing thy request
is for him whose advancement I desire, and for thou shall know in what regard I
hold thy love, I will do my best to procure her love, women have fancies, and
are headstrong in their affects, whether she have granted her love I know not,
neither can I force her lyking, if I could, it were not convenient, for a
forced beast is froward, and women wedded to their will. If in their love they
should be contraried, were better lost then found, their revenging minds are
such, as they will not be quiet, until for their husbands safety they have
armed his head with such proof, that he may walfe in safety amongst the best
headed stags in my Forest. But leaving this jest, (Pheander) that thou may
assure thee of my love, my industry shall be to gain her for thy friend, whom
I both honor and love, and for you my Lord, I give hearty thanks, that will
accept of her, whom I (may say) I love as a brother, who if I can persuade, to
your wish, her large dowry shall testify. Our pleasant parley has procured me
a good appetite, my stomach tells me it is dinner time, wherefore Gentlemen,
leaving this talk which is as much conquest as the greatest of Hercules, which
did never conquer woman, (unto me) let us walk, and doubt not but I will play
the Orator in such wise as shall procure your content Lord Cariolus, and
satisfy your request. Thanks gracious Prince quoth Cariolus, which is all I
have to requite so great a benefit, only your true liegeman shall I ever
continue, and be ready at your pleasure to do you service.

Here Gentlemen, the story tells us, that the Thracian King, (as flesh is
mortal) vexed with an extreme sickness, was so oppressed therewith, that nature
failing through weak age, all physic helps were frivolous, so that perforce
he must pay his due to death which commands all, whose breath failing at the
sommon of this tyrant, which may not be entreated, his soul departed this
earthly trunk, to see the joys of the everlasting kingdom, whose death his
subjects so with pittious plaintes bewailed, as might have changed the most
hardest heart into a Caos of lamenting sorrows, beholding their tears, whose
body was most royally intombed amongst his Ancestry. But among those which
sorrow overwhelmed, and had like to have drowned in deaths gulf, the
Princess, whom nature forced in some sort to lament, as a child having lost
her father, was so weakened with her plaints and hearts sorrow, that long time
it was not to be thought she could recover it, so much was her tender heart
touched, eftsoons bewailing her fathers death, and then again, greeuing for
the want of her Love and Lord the Maiden Knight, of whose safety whom she more
desired then to be Lady of the whole earth, could not be persuaded. Long did
she languish in these extremes and could not be comforted, in so much that she
rather desired death then to live. But he that in extremes is our best
comfort, preserving her for the Commons benifit, sent her health, who being
recovered, the Coronation finished, and the Crown by common consent of the
Parliament confirmed unto her, many offers of marriages were made unto her, for
which, humble suits of her Counc^ll were not omitted, who desired nothing more,
then to have the issue of her noble body succeed her. But no persuasions might
move her from the Knight, who had the chief interest of her heart, to whom she
had vowed her self, protesting likewise, never to grant her love or liking to
any one, but only to him. This resolution so much grieved her nobles, that
nothing could breed more discontent, yet as duty commanded, framed themselves
to her government, who with such wisdom directed all things for the benefit of
her common weal, that it was admirable to behold that wisdom in one of her
sex.

But to return to our matter. The Thessalian King, who minding his honorable
word with the noble Pheander, finding opportunity, ganne question his sister
in this manner.

Phedera, since the decease of our dear parence, thou have been left unto my
government, for whom, (without boast) or desire of benefit of thee or any, I
have had that care as of mine own good, and ever will, so thou be ruled by me.
And for I see thy years requires to be linked in marriage, that thou may
participate in love with thy husband, and spend the prime of thy years as is
fitting thy estate, I have found a Gentleman of honor and valor, such a one,
as on my word loves thee, and I have cause for his pains in my service
imployd to honor. Therefore good sister, if thou love me as a brother, and have
not bestowed thy love elsewhere, in this matter be ruled by me, and in doing
whereof, thou shall find me thy brother, and most assured friend, who will
ever be as careful of thy well doing and honor, as of mine good. Say therefore
thy mind plainly, and let me know whether thou do love, or can love?

The Lady, whose wisdom was such as balanced her honor, not knowing whether
her brother were in in jest or earnest, thus modestly said; Gracious Lord, and
my dread sovereign, pardon I humbly beseech you, your subject, and suffer me
not through my fond answering so frivolous a question, which you urge but for
my trial, to procure your displeasure, or mine own shame.

Why Phedera, quoth the King, you mistake me, if you think I jest, for on my
honor, I mean what I say, therefore dally not with me, if you hope of my good.
But tell me if thou do love, or wilt love my friend?

The Lady hearing the King in earnest, although she could be well content to
have enjoyed the sweet pleasures of love in marriage, thus said; Dread Lord,
and my most gracious sovereign, sithence it is your pleasure I should answer
your demand, Know, that as modesty is the ornament of Maids, and chastity,
the garland that bewtifieth all our sex, so have I carefully weyed mine honor
in such manner, that I neither love, nor as yet ever made choice of any in
love, but have eschewed all such frivolous motions of the flesh, to my greatest
power, as beseems a Lady of such honor. That I may love, I doubt not, because
it is the commandment of our maker, and incident to all creatures, who in
their kinds make choice of some one to participate with: yet shall my love
never be such, as may disparage your highness love toward me, but such as
shall be to your content. And for your graces pleasure is to bestow me on a man
so honorable, so stands it with your will to let me know him, I will
answer more directly.

God a mercy for that wench, quoth the King, then I doubt not but we shall
have a match, or else thy wisdom is not such as I wish it were. But tell me
unfeignedly my Phedera, can thou love the Lord Cariolus, a man for birth
honorable, for valor, to compare with most aduenturing Knights in the world,
in person comely, and so dibonire in his behavior, as for courtesy he is to
be matched with the best? He is the man Madame, whom if you can fancy, thou
honor me in thy love, and thou shall find me a brother, nay a father, if
fathers love may exceed the brothers* Say therefore thy mind, and let me know
thy answer?

The Lady whose hope was, her brothers suit had been for the Maiden Knight,
with whose love she was a little touched, yet modesty mastering such fond
motions, would not let affection take such root but that she could at her
pleasure expel it.

After the Lady had heard her brother, whom she perceived by his earnestness
in uttering his suit, would not willingly be denied, she said; Pardon me my
good Lord, if I pass modesty, considering your great praise of the Gentleman,
believe me, he is much beholding unto your Grace, who could have thought you
would have proved so good a soliciter? had your study been the Laws of this
Realm, no doubt, but you should have had many Clyants: were the Gentleman here
himself, he could not have said thus much, and therefore he may think
himself beloved and honored of your highness. But for answer, as I would not
have you in your first wooing disgraced, least it discourage you in your own
enterprises being a batcheler, so can I say little of my self, who is to be
governed by you, to, whom in all humbleness I refer me, and shall so you be
pleased, be content, if it were with one not so worthy as the Lord Cariolus.
(And yet)

Nay Madam, quoth the King, leave not off so abruptly with an aparentizes, your
words are doubtful. Tell me therefore, is there any other before me? if there
be, and thou have made choice, (and you both agreed) I will not gainsay it, nor
tie thee to any other then thy own content in marriage. Therefore say, what
those words (and yet) imported?

Pardon my over boldness, gracious Lord, answered the Lady, which unadvisedly
ouerpast those speeches, and credit my word, which have no love fixed in my
heart, but will endeavor my self to the liking of him whom you shall command
me, yet will I answer your demand, and meaning of those words, taken so by
your grace at rebounde, though I must and will, frame me to the love and liking
of the Lord Cariolus. Yet had the noble General been pleased, and with that, a
deep sigh staid her tongue, in such wise, as she could go no farther.

The King understanding which way the wind of her desire blew, though he could
have been better content with her choice, yet to put her from other thoughts,
and to have his suit take effect, he persuaded her to let slip such fond
imaginations, for that he had placed his love on a Lady of his Country, whom
he would not leave for all the world. With these happy tidings for the Lord
Cariolus, after some other kind speeches to y^ Lady, the King departed, so
ioying in his good success, y^ he could not rest until he had comforted the
Lord Cariolus with his answer, whose mind egged on by the Maiden Knight, was so
fixed on the Lady, that she was become the mistress of his heart, and he ioyed
in nothing but in contemplating of her love, thinking every day a year, and
every hour a month, until he heard the Kings answer, musing thus on his Love,
tossing with a mind disquietted, from one side the bed to the other, his
Page brought him word, that a Gentleman from the King, attended to speak with
him, which sudden news, revived so his spirits, as made his heart more light,
then long time before it had been, hoping to here such happy tidings as his
loving suit required. The Messenger having delivered his message, judge you
that be lovers, whether you could slack any time until you heard the doom of
your mistress, which he was assured to do by the King, unto whom he hasteneth
with such speed as he could. To whose presence being come, the king as joyful
for his good success and his sisters grant, as the Lord Cariolus to hear it,
with a smiling countenance, which showed the joy of his heart, said;

My Lord, though my skill in wooing be but small, having never accustomed my
self to any such practice, yet have I played the cunning Advocate for your
Lordship, and will assure you, so you hold your word and promise, the
Princess shall be yours, and thereon take my word of honor.

Cariolus, so over ioyed at these tidings, could not well tell whether he heard
the King speak, or dreamed of this happiness. But standing a while in an
extacie, his senses being come again, with eyes ghastly beholding the King,
thus said; My honorable and gracious Lord, what may I do to requite your
Princely favor, who has vouchsafed me so great honor, not only to bestow
your only sister on me, but to become my honorable soliciter, what I would
say, modesty compels me to conceal. Only this I assure your Majesty, my
loyal service shall ever be ready at your command, in such dutiful manner,
that your Majesty shall have no cause to repent you of so great a good done
unto a stranger. Enough my Lord, few words does suffice among friends,
wherefore forbear these speeches, love my sister, and for her sake, think of
me as a friend, which will be ever ready to do you what pleasure I can. To give
you some interest of my faith, appoint the marriage day at your pleasure, and
for her dowry, accept this kingdom of Egypt, which shall remain to you and
your heirs for ever, only this homage shall you yearly tender in my Court of
Thessaly, two swift running Coursers of this Country, and so God make you
happy in your love, and a joyful father of many children. With this the
Maiden Knight entered his presence, unto the King what man so welcome, his
duty done, the King lovingly embracing him, said;

Sir Knight, I have not long sithence comforted your friend with my happy
tidings, and not only assured him of a wife, which I hope will prove loving
and kind unto him, but have invested him with the title of King of Egypt, of
both which, I wish him so much joy, as I desire to have joy, his wedding day
let him appoint at his pleasure, which shall with the greatest honor I can be
performed.

Most gracious and dread Lord quoth the Knight, how this your honorable
courtesy have tied me unto your service, I omit, that at my request has thus
favored my dear friend, whose good I esteem as mine own, and ever will be
ready with my best endeavor to serve, at all times and places where my force
or service may do either your Majesty or my Lord Cariolus good. And seeing it
is wrought to his content and your Graces good lyking, let me entreat this
favor of you both, that the wedding may suddenly be solemnized, for that my
stay may not be long here, such desire I have to see my sovereign Lord, who
I am sure exspecteth my return long before this time. Sir quoth the King, did
you know how displeasing those speeches of your departure were to me, that
desire nothing in the whole world so much as your company, you would never
harp so much on that string. But how long so ever your stay shall be, this
day eight days I do appoint for the wedding, so my Lord Cariolus be agreed,
and say Amen.

Never quoth Cariolus, let him be allowed for Clarke, which refuses to say
Amen, to such a parson, the Orizons bringing such content, seeing your Majesty
referres it to me, Amen say I, and humbly thank your Grace for your honorable
favor.

The wedding day appointed and assigned, the King sent for the Princess, who
that night supped all together, which being ended, the Princess, in presence
of many of the Lords of Thessaly and Egypt, was betrothed unto the Lord
Cariolus, and the marriage day appointed, against which time, were all the
nobles sommoned to be at Court to attend the King, by whose commandment all
the preparation for honor of that day might be devised, was ordained, the time
of night being spent, sommoned their watchful eyes to sleep, wherefore after
many solemn adues, taken one of the other, they hastened on all sides to their
rest, only Cariolus and the Princess best content, she ioying in her Love,
and kingly brothers lyking, and he blessing a million of times the day wherein
he first saw the Prince, procurer of his so great good. What other imaginations
assailed them, let those suppose and think which have felt the sweet content
in love. To which I leave them, to recount unto you y^ sorrow of the Thracian
Queen, who ruling with honor, beloved both of Pheres and Commons, in as much
royalty as might be desired, endured so many sundry torments of mind, wanting
her most desire, that the day was irksome unto her, and the night ordained for
rest, restless she consumed, that with her continual watchings, and others
passions, he^ body became weak, and a grievous sickness assailed her, the
cause, none could imagine, neither might physic minister any cure to her
disease, so that given over to the death, she lanquished in great extremities,
not daring for modesty, to reveal the cause, only this was her cheifest
comfort, when she could be freed from the company of such Ladies and
counselors which visited her, with Guenela to recount her love, sometime
extolling his valor and person, and eftsoons accusing him of disloyalty,
exclaiming on her hard fortune which had engaged her liberty to a Knight
careless of her honor and good, cursing and accusing Guenela, being soliciter
for such a wretched Knight, whose speeches oftentimes was so answered by the
Maiden Guenela, as in jesting wise would she turn her words of despite into
laughter, such was the sharpness of her wit, which left no means unsought
that might procure in the least manner her content. Oppressed with great grief
we leave the Princes for a while, to return unto Cariolus. whose wedding day
being come great was the joy on his side, but more the preparation of al
courtiers, who were ready with many costly shows, at y^ Tilt, Turney, and
Barriers, to try their valor and fortunes in Arms. But as the fairest day is
ouercast with clouds, so was their mirth changed to great and grievous
lamentions, and their joy to sorrowful complaints, which thus befell.

The King now in prime of years, desirous to try his force at the Tilt, with
his presence to honor his Nobles and do the Princess favor at her marriage
in these pastimes, made choice of the Maiden Knight, to encounter him, as the
worthiest in Arms, who being of all others most unwilling to deal against
him, humbly besought his grace of pardon, and accept of some his Nobles who was
more worthier of that honor. But the King with whom no entreaties might
prevail, would not be denied, which made the Knight with great heaviness of
heart to wish he had not Armed him that day, such was his discontented mind,
which doubtless presaged some ensuing evil, as to y^ great grief of all the
whole company happened them. Thus when no denials might preuail, the trumpets
sounding a charge, they set forward with such swiftness, as the earth trembled
under their horses, both breaking their staves in such manner, as all the
company with joyful shoutes applauded their excellent skill in that exercise.
But alas, in midst of this pleasing practice, how suddenly their joys were
eclipsed, woe is me to recount. The King and his elected companion, at the
trumpets sound, setting with courage forward to encounter one the other, in
brave manner brake again their staves, but in an unhappy time, a splinter of
the knights staff, by most unfortunate chance, entered the sight of the Kings
Beauer, which pierced the head to the brain, in such wise, that with the heat
of his travail, and grief of the wound, he was enforced to forsake his horse.
This sudden mishap, to the company brought such discontent, that all their
mirth laid apart, sorrow was made Lady of the feast. But amongst those that
most lamented this unfortunate chance, the Maiden Knight had his part, whose
grief was such, that had not the Lord Cariolus bin by fortune present, in the
extreme of his melancholy passion he had slain himself, such was the wisdom
of the Noble Cariolus, as his reasonable persuasions prevailed so with him, as
he caused him forsake his doleful Lodge, to accompany him to the presence of
y^ king, whose masters of Surgery, had newly ended their travail of
dressing his wounds, them the Knight questioned of the danger thereof, and
besought them in courtesy to acquaint him therewith, whether he held it
mortal or no, which how unwilling so ever they were, as loath to discomfort
the King or those which loved him, such was the courteous entreatie of the
Knight, as he could not conceal the danger thereof, but revealed unto him the
little hopes they had of his life, and the reasons that induced them thereunto,
which news, was little pleasing unto the Knight, who with many tears lamented
that mishap, but grief ministers no physic to the diseased, nor sorrow
avails not to mittigate extremes. Wherefore by Cariolus comforted, he
cease in so exceeding manner to lament, determining to abide the Kings doom,
unto whom he purposes to reconcile himself, and to that intent awaiteth the
waking of his Majesty, who was after his dressing fallen a sleep, whose
grief was such, as he could take small rest. But rowsing himself, awaked
from his slumber, called for the Lord Cariolus, who was waiting for the same
purpose, unto whom being come, he says;

Cariolus, let no man boast himself of happiness which is mortal, for that
they are subject to crosses, and casual mishaps, as thy self may witness
with me, and many others that have seen this mischaunce befallen me, when I
least expected it, the original of my grief proceeding from my self, which
would perforce my good friend to the action whereunto he was so unwillingly
drawn: but what heavens have ordained, what man can gainsay. The omnipotent
power of the Almighty, has laid his cross on me for my greater good, to call
me from these worlds vanities, to seek his everlasting kingdom: Yet ere I
leave this frail life, sweet Cariolus let me see that honorable Knight, by
whose hands death sent his sommance, dear he was unto me, and his love
worthy to be embraced of the mightiest Monarke. Oh Pheander, could thou but
imagine with what faithful love I loved thee, thou may sorrow for my loss,
whom thou and all the world cannot reclaim from this great hazard wherein I
remain. With this the knight which was not far off, presented himself unto
him, who kneeling at his beds side, said;

Most gracious soueraign, might my grieved heart which overwhelmed in sorrow, is
(...) in a sea of many miseries, consume it self with grief, for my evil
committed against you, how happy a creature were I, which have bin the
occasion of your highness so great unrest, yet how unwilling, heavens record
with me. And therefore my dread sovereign, pardon my fault so unwillingly
committed against your Majesty, as dear to me as mine own soul, whose life,
if ten thousands lives depended thereon, I wish might be sacrificed for thy
health, and the loving subjects of of my gracious sovereign, whom by my
ouer-hardinesse, I have robbed of so loving a Prince. Let me I say, chief
causer of your sorrow, reap the guerdon due to a murderer, and revenge your
kings death, by taking my life, which had I a million of thousands lives, could
not make satisfaction for my evil committed against you. Here tears
interrupting him, denied his tongue liberty of speech, whose lamentation,
filled all the nobles with such heaviness, as for tears they could not utter
a word, especially the King, whose grief being great, was increased by his
doleful lament, yet casting of this womanish humor, drying his eyes, doubting
the nobles and those present, should accuse him of fear, (dreading to die)
whereunto we are all born, with a soft voice, tenderly wringing the Maiden
Knight by the hand, he says; Noble Gentleman, cease thy heaviness, thy
grief so augments mine, that the thought thereof, wrings tears from my heart,
thy unwilling offense, with my heart I forgive, and to show how dear in life
thou wast unto me, (my good Pheander) accept at my dying hand, my kingdom of
Thessaly, the lawful inheritance of thy faithful friend, love those people,
my kind subjects, and so govern them with favor and lenity, as they have no
cause to complain of my dead course, and for my life which by thy hand through
y^ apointme^t of him that gave it me, I must leave, I heartily forgive thee,
and accursed be he or them, which shall ever impute i^ unto thee, in dishonor,
any fault against me committed. That thou louedst me, thy tender care of my
good has showed such proofs, as tied me in true friendship to be thine for
ever, Death is not so irksome unto me, but that I must leave thee, and the
sweet content I received in thy company: grief of my deaths grief, my own
Pheander, compels me omit what I would say, wherefore briefly thus; Forget
not thy dying friend, and show that love to my Lord Cariolus, whom for thy
sake, I have to this Crown of Egypt advanced, as I ever found, and in extremes
comfort him with thy aid, as thou have done me, my sister Phedera forget not,
whom to thy charge I commit, leaving her to thee, and thee to be in my place a
brother, who living loved her, as my hope is thou will. And so dear friends,
heavens blessedness befall you all, and so prosper you, as I loved you. And you
Pheres of Egypt and Thessaly, whose love I have found as subjects, in all
dutiful manner, let be continued unto these your elected Kings, who will with
honor govern you, so shall the giver of all happiness bless your lands,
with the blessing of peace and plenty, for they that honor their king, does
reverence the Lord who created him, and he will give them plenteous rewards.
Noble Gentlemen, grief cutteth me off, flesh must yield to earth how loath
soever, the mightiest, death has vanquished. Therefore as my Vltenam vale,
remember my words, and pray God to send us the abundance of his grace, that we
may through his mercy, have a joyful meeting in his kingdom that never shall
have end. I feel the heavy messenger approaching, therefore farewell to thee my
dear sister, whom I charge as thou louedst me living, be loving and kind to
thy husband, doing him that honor is due unto him, thy children bring up in
fear of their maker, and so God bless thee with happiness. And thou Pheander,
unto me, no creature in life more dear, remember my parting speeches, love the
Lord Cariolus, as I have loved thee, and thou my adopted brother Cariolus,
honor him during thy life, that I am sure faithfully tendered and loved thee,
so shall God be pleased, for no sin in sight of his divine deity, is more
intolerable then that monstrous vice of Ingratitude, which for avoiding the
heavy wrath of of God, I wish thee eschew. Nobles and you all my very good
friends, to exhort you to remember your duties, whose wisdoms is more then I
will recount, were a matter frivolous, and perhaps may move some offense, yet
take my simple meaning which speak to you that have ouer-loued me, which love
let be continued, honor your Kings with reverence and love, for what you do to
them, is done to God, which are his Vize-Regents on earth, and his anointed.
Move no rebellion, nor be mainteiner of evil, for such faults, how secret so
ever, God will to your overthrows reveal. Remember his word, which has
commanded you to be obedient without murmuring, and fear him which governs
all. I can say no more, my speech fails me, therefore generally my Lords,
farewell, and so turning his weak body to the wall, surrendered his soul to
the heavens, from whence it had his being, to the intolerable grief of all
his subjects, who with many brinish tears lamented his death, but especially
the Knight Pheander, and Cariolus, whose marriage, the loving King honored,
with his funeral, which in the most honourablest manner, Art or honor could
devise, was solemnized, lamented generally of all his subjects, but especially
the Egyptians, who more dearly loved him for his clemency, then their own
natural King.

The funeral finished, a Parliament was sommoned, in which time, the Maiden
Knight so prevailed with the Nobles of Thessaly and Egypt, that by common
consent of the whole assembly in both houses, temporal and spiritual, the
regiment of both kingdoms, was delivered unto the Lord Cariolus, and the
Maiden Knight, resigned his interest for ever unto him and the Lady, who was
lawful inheritrix unto the same. The Parliament proroged according to the
custom of the Country, great preparation was made for the Coronation, which in
most solemn and honorable manner was accomplished, with so many sundry shows
and delightful pleasures, as might weary you to read. Let it suffice to the
great joy of both Realms, all things to so honorable an action was so
exquisitely performed, as no man but took great delight in beholding thereof,
praying with an universal voice for their long lives, to be in happiness
amongst them continued.

Thus all things to the joy of the noble Pheander accomplish, and to the high
content of the King Cariolus and his Queen, by the advice of the Maiden Knight,
an election was made of a Vizeroy to go for Thessaly, the King making choice
of two evils the least, conceiving this opinion of the natural subjects of
Thessalie, that they would live in their dutiful obeisance, when a conquered
nation gathering head upon many light occasions, was easily drawn to revolt.
These considerations with great wisdom weyed, the Lord Fardinand, one of the
privy Council of Thessaly, was elected for that government, unto whom, the
King after his Commission signed, and honorable gifts given, so wisely exhorted
to obedience, and care of his love and duty, that as many of the nobles as
were present, and noted the same, admired him, rejoicing that God had provided
so for them, to leave them in the government of so toward a Prince, of whom so
much ensuing happiness was exspected.

Order taken for his affairs of weight, the Vizeroy imbarqued for Thessaly,
and his Nobles departed, each one to their several mantions, saving such of
his privy Council which were attendant at Court. The Noble Pheander, was now
to take his leave, the very remembrance whereof, was more offensive to the King
and Queen, then al their former troubles. Bootles it was to entreat his longer
st^y, who standing on thorns, til his desire was obtained, in beholding the
most beautiful Princess, might no longer be persuaded, wherefore the King to
honor him the more, by whom he was for ever honored, caused a Fleet to be
prepared of twenty Galleys, whom by his strict commandment, was most royally
furnished with all needful vyands, and other necessaries for his voyage, which
on such sudden was purueyed, as might well show their diligence to whom that
great charge was committed. All things ready for his departure, and a fair
wind blowing a fresh and comfortable gale, these friends were now to depart.

After leave taken of the Princess, who with many brinish tears bewailed the
same, the King with his Pheres accompanied him to the water side, where his
company appointed to attend him, awaited his coming, where after heavy parting
on both sides, and many tears spent of the commons which beheld their
sorrows, he imbarqued him self, and by the good favor of the winds, and
diligent industry of his Mariners, suddenly los^ sight of land, and had the
wind so favorable, that in short time they atteined sight of the high land of
Thrace, with which they bear all that they might, yet could not possibly
recover their Port that night.

This Fleet of Galleys being on the shore descried, none could imagine what
they were or should be, to prevent the worst, the Council careful of their
own safeties, and commons good, assembled, the power of their City, making
provision for defense, what ever happened.

The master of the Admiral, not daring to enter the harbored by night, lay
off again into the sea, hulling until the day watch was in hand, at which time
they set sail to go for their harbored, and by favorable assistance of the
winds, recovered the same. After the Sun had showed her self in her beauty
two hours, to survey which power, and to give notise to the Queen what they
were, the Lord Aminta^, Lord high Admiral of the land, was in a Frygotte
sent, who bouging as much as the force of his staves would permit him, being a
man honorable and venterous, not knowing what they were, whether friends or
enemies, came up with the Admiral, and laid her aboard, of whose coming, the
Maiden Knight being advertised, doing him duty, caused his Flagge to be
furled, and his Ancient to be taken down, whose order the whole Fleet
followed. When the Admiral saw the Knight Pheander, whose welfare they greatly
doubted, between them was much rejoicing and many imbracings, as friends
joyful to see one the other. Passing in pleasant parley the time, they came to
Ancor, at which time, according to directions given by the Knight, all their
ordinance was discharged, with their small Artillery, rejoicing according to the
sea manner, for their safe arrival, to the great admiration of all the
beholders, which could imagine no certainty what they were: no sooner was the
Ancors ground, but the Lord Admiral causing his Frygot to come aboard, entered
the same, accompanied with the Maiden Knight, and other Nobles of Thessaly and
Egypt, which came to accompany him, as Ambassadors from the King, who were all
most royally entertemed of the Nobles, which attended their landing, and were
conducted to the Court, where according to their estates they were sumptuously
lodged in the Court, and like order taken for purueying for their train.

Amongst others that had enquired the news of these strangers, and what they
were, Guenela by chance, as women are inquisitiue of novelties, had with
diligence learned what those Nobles so royally enterteined were, with the
arrival of the Maiden Knight, who was no sooner known unto the joyful
Maiden, (made more joyful by these happy tidings) but standing en thorns
until she came to the presence of the Queen, doubting least her news should
be so stale before she came, as it would be scares worth the carriage, she
omitted no time. To whom being come, and finding the Queen in her accustomed
melancholy passions, though new some way otherwise employed about the
imaginations of these strangers, to put her from her study, thus said.

What Madame, ever in your memento, in faith were I of your privy couns^ll,
and might persuade with you, I would wish your Majesty become Lady of some
Nunnery, where you might have company, since nothing may delight you but
contemplation.

Guenela quoth the Queen, cease thy fond talk at this time, and give me
leave, who have matters of weight to employ me on.

If it be so Madame, (quoth Guenela) I am to crave pardon for my boldness,
otherwise, if it might not have been offenciue, I could have acquainted your
highness with some news of the Maiden Knight, which because I see it is
troublesome unto you having business, I beseech your grace license me to
depart, until it shall please your Ladyship to find leisure to hear me.

The Queen hearing her name the Maiden Knight, was so waked from her dumps, as
she called Guenela, and with earnest entreaties besought her to let her know,
what news she had heard of those strangers, and what moved her to name the
Maiden Knight?

Madam, (quoth Guenela,) if your Ladyship would have permitted me to speak, I
had without farther delays, acquainted you with such news of these strangers,
as I hear, and have diligently enquired, who are Nobles of Thessaly, in
Embassage for y^ King, accompanied with the best welcomed Knight in Africa.
The peerlesse Pheander, your graces sworn servant, the naming of whom, so
revived the Queen, that he that had the worst sight might have perceived how
pleasing these news were unto her, yet doubtful of her Maidens speeches,
which often had deluded her, to move delight, the said;

Guenela, thou have had more pleasure in feeding me with vain hopes, then has
contented me, yet have I borne thy follies, imagining in what sort they were
used. But now Guenela, leave thy Jests, least they grow odious, and move me to
chollor against thee, which would not willingly be drawn unto. Therefore tell
me without dallying, is my knight arrived with these Nobles, or is there
certain tyings of his good health by these strangers?

Madame (quoth Guenela,) if my ouer-boldnesse have incurred your displeasure, I
humbly crave pardon, who had no intent to offend, he witness with me, which
searches my deepest secrets, but to assure you of what you so much desire,
know Madame, the Maiden Knight is with Nobles arrived, who as I hear, are come
from the Lord Cariolus, who by procurement of the Maiden Knight, is married with
the Princess of Thessaly, and is royally Crowned by consent of both Realms,
lawful King of Thessaly and Egypt, the one, his Queens lawful inheritance,
the other, the late Kings bequest, who by unhappy fortune, has left this
life. Thus Madame have I acquainted your highness with what I have heard, the
truth thereof being proved, I hope will procure my pardon. Guenela (quoth the
Queen, ten thousand times I thank thee for thy tidings, which I will so
requite, as it shall be the best news that ever passed thy mouth, to give thee
some assurance thereof, take this Diamond, which she pulling from her finger,
delivered her, and look for a better reward. The hasty approaching of the
Council, interrupting their speech, caused them cease their farther parley,
who staying the Queens pleasure, sent her word, they had some matter to impart
unto her, who were presently admitted to her presence, accompanied with the
Maiden Knight.

The Council having done their duties, the Maiden Knight presented himself
unto her Majesty, whose sight so appalled her, as she could say nothing,
shamefast modesty striving with her willingness to bid him welcome, which she
could not do as she would, least her countenance should disclose her hearts
desire, yet not omitting such honorable favor as she could do him, she offered
her hand to kiss, which in all humbleness he accepted, acknowledging his most
bounden duty unto her highness, whom the questioned in this manner.

Servant quoth she, we had thought your lyking had been such to the Dames of
Thessaly, as we should have bin invited to your wedding, or that your
entertainment had been so evil in our Court, as you were weary of the same,
that you have thus long absented your self from our Presence, (under
Benidicitie) servant, as you owe duty to your mistress, make me your
ghoastly father, and before my Lords here present, tell me and dissemble not,
what has been the cause of your long stay?

Gracious sovereign, quoth the Knight, if I answer what is truth, I hope your
Majesty will accept it, and pardon me, if in my harshe answer I pass those
duties which I would not willingly do. For my love to foreign Ladies, I may
justly deny, which neither saw any since my departure from your Confines, in
whose presence I took pleasure: During my long stay, how unwilling that has
been, I call to reccord these Nobles strangers, which can testify my long
desire to have tendered my dutiful service unto your highness, whereunto I am
bound. Therefore dread Lady, pardon my offense therein, who being at a
foreign Princess commandment, must obey it.

Well servant quoth the Queen, I must give credit to your words, else should I
do you wrong, but how so ever, you are wel^^^ to your mistress, who is a
debtor of yours. The sight of this Noble Ph^^ti^^, wrought more effects then
all the medicines Art could minister, whose presence quite expelled all former
cares from her Princely heart, though her body weakened with her long
lanquishing, could not be so sod^inly restored. But time, and short time, with
the comfort she conceived of her loving Prince, restored her to her former
health, as you shall hear, in the ensuing history.

Now return we to the Nobles, who awaited her highness pleasure, for which,
the Queen counting of her speech with the knight, thus said;

Honorable Lords, if it be no matter of counsel for which your coming is at
this time, let us know the cause, my servant I dare commit some trust unto, who
shall participate of these your affairs. Mighty Princess, (quoth the Lord
Parsinio,) matter of state concerning the government or affairs of your
Commonweal, we have not to utter, but only do beseech your highness, to
command for your honor, that these noble strangers be enterteined according to
their estates, with such courtesy and bounty, that they many have cause to
speak of your Court and honorable entertainment, as of a worthy deserving
Prince. And more, to do your noble subjects honor, the Lord Cariolus, who by
marriage of the deceased Kings sister, is Crowned lawful King both of
Thessalie and Egypt. This is all most gracious Lady, whereof if you please to
conceive, and give order for the same accordingly, you shall highly honor us
your subiecs, and gain to your self the famous report of strangers, which is
the garment that bewtifieth Princes, and governors of states.

Thanks noble Gentlemen, (quoth the Queen,) for your honorable care of us,
which are not acquainted with any such matters, wherefore I beseech you my
Lord Parsinio, to keep them company during their stay here, let my Officers
attend them, and their allowance be such, as may not impair our bountiful
mind, thereby to deserve honor, (if feasting be honorable) especially let
their train be well purueyed for, both in large allowance of vyands and
lodging, for those are they by whom fame will ring, being of the baser sort,
either of honor, or dishonor, as for their Embassage, we will omit the hearing,
until God endue us with some more strength, and so farewell.

The Nobles having done their duties, and gone, it may be imagined, whether the
Knight departed with consent or no, on whom the Queen bestowed so gracious a
look, as he might well judge of his welcome, but command his longer stay she
would not, to avoid the suspicion of jealousy, or that her love should be in
the least sort suspected, Contented with the ^ight of her beloved, after their
departure, commanding the rest of the company from her, deteining only
Guenela, between them began some pleasant parley, wherein, first the Queen,
and then Guenela, descanted at their pleasure of the Knight, emitting no
iesture he used in his speech, his person, and what else greatly delighted the
Princess, who would often say, how mannerly is my servant become? yea quoth
Guenela, it is hard to say, whether he learned the same of man or woman, nay on
my word, quoth the Princess, I dare acquit him, for any company keeping with
women, his maydenly blush, assures me that he has learned no courting
fashions of the Thessalian Ladies, ( Credo) quoth Guenela, and Madame so ever
believe, for a good belief, is a step to salvation, or by my hollydom, your
cheifest chaplin is not so just a man as he ought to be. Thus pleasantly
discoursing, we leave them, to recount unto you the royal entertainment of the
Thessalian nobles and their train.

The Lord Parsinio, to whom the Queen had delivered this charge as you have
heard, took such care in performance thereof, that as he was noble, and every
way endued with honorable conditions, so was his care, in discharge of that
trust committed unto him, as the nobles admyred their royal cheer, their
diversity of sports to beguile time, with costly shows, each accident so
exquisitely performed, as the thoughts and imaginations thereof, mo^ed th^se
strange nobles, when the company had left them to their rests, in contemplating
of their gracious entertainment, to consume sometime the most of the night,
admiring the bounty of the Queen, whom they with earnest minds desired to
see. As these Nobles consumed their time with pleasure, which made it seem the
shorter, so the Queen which had care for receiving their message, after the
first fight of her servant, began so to comfort her self, that with those
comfortable confections her Doctors provided, and receiving such vyands as
physic thought most meetest, she began to recover her decayed color, and
her faint limbs over weak with forbearing such sustenance, wherewith nature
should be relieved, recovered their strength in such wise, as it ioyed her
subjects to hear of her recovery.

Time which overcomes mighty things, has brought the Queen to that good
estate, as finding a day wherein the Suns power, vanquished the airs
rumaticke coldness, the walked into the gardaine, where she solaced her
self, beholding Natures abiliments, which beautified the earth in such manner,
that the pleasantness thereof, with the sweet smelles, bredde her great
content. The Maiden Knight, which had desire to show his duty in attending
her royal highness, hearing this happy tidings, hasteneth to the gardaine,
whom the Queen no sooner saw, but calling him unto her, after his duty
done, and her Majesty taking him up from the ground from off his knee, she
said;

My Lord, what excuse can you frame now, for neglecting your duty to your
mistress, which cannot have your sight being in Court, without a messenger, if
the sight of any one attending us, be offensive unto your Grace, we will
remove them, rather then loose your company, so we may know them.

Noble Princess, answered the Knight, that I acknowledge not my duty as I
ought, pardon me, and weigh in the balance of your gracious clemency, my
zeal and hearty desire to do you service: who albeit my heart desires no
such happiness as your Princely presence, yet knowing that Princes have many
eyes to behold them, and Envy lurketh in the hearts of subjects, who imagining
more, then is on either of our parts thought, may with their evil speech raise
that scandal, as may blemish your renown being a virgin, and procure my
greater trouble which am a stranger.

Clenly excused quoth the Queen, I see now good servant, you have not spent
your time idly abroad, if I might know your school mistress, I would be so
bold to thank her, for the diligent applying her scholar.

Madame quoth the Prince, I am glad to hear your grace so well disposed, I
hope your Majesty, having recovered strength, and your business with these
nobles over past, will think of your servant, and remember your word to me,
which chalengeth the same at your majesty's hands.

My Lord, quoth she, had I not held thy love in regard, I could not have denied
the many suits of my Pheres and Commons, which have besought me, and with great
earnestness entreated me to marriage, but so dear has thy love been unto me,
that I desired death, rather then falsify my faith to your grace, for whom,
and through whose unkindness, I have endured much hearts discontent.

No more of that quoth the Knight, good Madame, expel from your mind passed
griefs, and think upon the ensuing pleasures which will exceed all the
discontent has been: to hear your discontent, is little pleasing unto me, who
never closed these eyes, nor never beheld the rising of the glorious Sun,
without millions of times remembering your grace, whose presence I more desired
then I will explain. Guenela seeing some of the Council entering the
Gardaine, gave them intelligence thereof, breaking off their speech thus.

Sir, if you have taken orders in holy Church since your departure, it is more
then is expected of all the court, which in time past have showed your self so
worthily in Arms, to your lasting honor. If you have, and her grace have
chosen you for her ghostly father, enjoin I beseech, her majesty, to some
easy penance, for her long sickness is not to endure much fasting, besides,
here is of the Council, who has waited to say something, either to the Queen
or your grace.

These words of Guenela, caused them surcease their talk, and with shows of
loving countenaunces, to give each other the farewell. The Knight framing his
talk to Guenela, who finding him alone, thus said; Sir, experience of mine
own discontent, has taught me, what a corifiue melancholy is, to a pleasant
mind, who in your absence, have endured many sharp words, yea, and
oftentimes, those thundering speeches, lighting with blows either on my
ribs, head, or face, (in revenge of which,) had you bin present for whose
sake I endured them, I should have adventured the cracking of a sword with your
grace, or greatly have wanted of my will.

Why how now Guenela, quoth the Knight, art thou metamorphi^ed? has the Gods
joined thee abiliments of a man, as well as armed thy heart with courage? (faith
wench) art thou so valiantly minded to break a blade? take heed, it is dangerous
for your sex to deal with weapons, but I will desire the Queen to search
you, least happily as ^ad a chance befall her maids, as Dania, which
enterteined Jupiter, in likeness of a Swan, If Guenela, be likewise by their
consents allienated from her sex, it were good to prevent evils in time, had I
wist, comes too late.

My Lord, quoth Guenela, blushing with shame, your Lordship has through my
fondness, taken me at advantage, misconstruing my simple meaning, which have
eu^r honored you: Conceal my folly in this, good my Lord, and forget it, and
pardon my fond words, which have felt many stripes for you.

Nay Guenela, quoth the Knight, I may not with my honor let pass a matter of
such importance, without revealing it to her highness, least your words (as
you say) spoken in jest, turn some of our Ladies in earnest, to be beholding
to mother Midwife.

The Queen which had reposed her self, with beholding the beauty of nature,
and taken ye pleasant air which did greatly comfort her, having some
conference with her nobles, departed the gardein, which made the rest withal
the speed they could make, to follow, whereof Guenela was nothing sorrowful,
who was thereby compeld to leave the Knight, of whom she wished long before
to have shift her hands.

The Queen gathering some strength, was loath to detain the strange Nobles
longer from her Presence, wherefore by her Nobles she limited a time to hear
them, against which day, was all her nobles summoned to be at Court, with her
Ladies and women of account to attend her Majesty, who with the Lord Steward
of her household, had taken such order for all diversity of vyandes that might
be provided. The day appointed come, not unexpected of the strangers, who
provided themselves as sumptuous as they could, apparrelled after their
country manner, attended the time of her Majesty's coming forth, who being
come, and in her Chair of Estate set, word was brought unto the strangers,
who marching with the nobles of Thrace through the Court, was in most
honorable manner presented unto her Majesty, who with countenance debonaire,
and grace magisticall, as became her royalty, bad them all welcome, in such
courteous and Princely manner, that the strangers at this first fight were
driven to great admiration, beholding that grace and honor in a woman, which
they would never have believed, had not their eyes been witnesses. The Queen
having given them these hononorable welcomes, each man taking his place,
Ormania, the cheifest in Commission from their King, thus said;

Magnificent Prince, our King, your highness late subject, acknowledging his
humble duty to your Exellence, has sent us his liegemen and sworn servants,
to signify the same, who in faithful love voweth, never to be allienated in
mind from that duty, which becomes each natural subject to owe his Prince
and country. By us he presents his offer of service, which shall be with all
his power ready, at your highness pleasure: the rest his honorable Letters
shall import, which humbly kissing, on their knees they delivered into her
Princely hands, who returned many thanks to their King for his love, with like
to them, which had vouchsafed that travail; to see her Court and Presence,
beseeching them to take in worth a maidens entertainment, in doing which, she
should think her self much beholding unto them.

With pleasant parley, and discoursing of sundry matters and questions by the
Queen propounded, touching their Countries, they passed the time until
dinner, not without great admiration of the strangers, which beheld her
stately grace, her sumptuous attire, the duty and honor done by her nobles
and Ladies, which with their costly apparel and rare exellence in beauty,
greatly delighted them. The time of dinner drawing near, the tables covered,
and all things prepared for the same, the Queen taking her place, the
Ambassadors were likewise placed at another table in her presence. The manner of
her service, with the diversity of vyands of all sorts, was such, as they
could hardly believe, so many sundry kinds of soul, fish, and other, cheer
for them prepared, were to be found in the limits of the earth. Thus with
wonderful delight, cheared still by her highness, they passed the time until
the end of dinner, never forgetting the majesty of her grace, which so
honorably bare her, as no Prince could in her time compare with her. Dinner
ended, the Queen courteously bidding those strangers welcome, she was
conducted by her Nobles into a Gallery, which for bewtifull shows with rare
pictures, and devises of rich price, was so adorned, as the strangers had never
seen the like. Not long had they passed the time in noting those glorious
devises, but the Courtiers, who had provided themselves to do her highness
honor, and cause her delight, which had so long time withdrawn her self from
all pleasures, armed in all parts, with each man his several devise, they
entered the yard, appointed of custom for the Tilt, where a window opening
from the gallery, the Queen with the strangers were set to behold those
pastimes. The whole company come, each one for honor of her grace, delivered
his Scuchion of devise, unto her Princely hands. Where Gentiles suppose you,
that know Ladies praises, or dispraises, what happened. Where to beguile the
time, was each devise by the Queen and her Ladies, surueyed with such vigilant
eyes, as nothing was unremembered, every one giving their judgment according to
that affection they bear the presenter. While they were thus desca^nting, and
the Marshall with the Judges, appointing each man in his degree to try
himself, behold, a pretty Page, mounted on a light running Courser, with his
guide before him, winding his horn in poasting manner, coming near the place
where y^ queen was, lighted from his horse, and being not of height
answerable, to deliver his Letters with his hand, putting them on his wande,
(after his duty done) humbly kissing them, he delivered them unto her
majesty's hand, which y^ queen perusing, questioned the Page if he had ought
else to impart? Who answered, Most famous Prince, my Lord and master, hearing
of this assembly which fame has bruted, to the honor of this royal company,
and high commendations of these nobles, has sent, as not daring to approach
the place without their lawful favor obtained, who for honor of his
mistress, which he affirms, and will maintain, to be the most exquisit Lady
for all perfections in the confines of the earth, he offers at the Tilt, with
each gain-sayer, to break six staves. If there be any such that will accept
his challenge in mainteining his mistress honor, let me know him, who shall
soon be answered. The Page being unknown, the nobles wondered what he might
be, which without exception had made this challenge, imagining that he was some
man of valor, and y^ it were discurtesie to deny a man at arms whatsoever.
Thereon generally concluding, they returned him by the Page, this answer.

Page, though thy masters peremptory challenge, deserve rather to be maligned,
then accepted, yet such is the nobility of Thrace, as honoring Arms, and all
professors thereof, accept the same, and where we had appointed every one his
companion, we are content to remit that election, and to bind all our force to
his dishonor, and so to him unknown, commend us, whom we entreat to Arm
sodeinly, and speed him hither. The Page receiving his answer of the nobles,
the Queen calling him which mounted was ready to depart, said;

Sir Boy, to thy unknown Knight commend us, whom we thank, for vouchsauing us
that honor his Letters import, which our nobility have without any suit of
mine accepted, of whom he shall find men endowed with courage. The Page
departed, sundry were the imaginations what the Knight might be, who had
offered them this proud chalendge, in midst whereof, a trumpet sounding, they
expected the challenger, who entered armed in all parts, with black armor,
which was garnisht with many wounded hearts, on the breast, a Lady with a cloth
of fine lawne whipping them, ouerspreading as many as she could reach with a
scarf, carnation colored, his word (in Greek) despair not,) pacing on with
easy paces, according to the use of the place, coming near that end of the
Tilt which was opposite with the Queens window, vayling his head to her
Majesty, she graciously had him welcome, shaking her hand. Long had he not
staid, but the Lord Marshall in like manner, with show of great courtesy bad him
welcome, and desired him to prepare himself, for the defendants attended him.
My Lord, quoth the Knight, at their good pleasures, when they shall put
themselves forward at the trumpets sound, I will meet them. Thus warning given
them, without longer stay, the Lord Vrelia, his copartner in Thessaly, set
forward, whom the Maiden Knight met with such force, as his feet were too big
for his stirropes, and he likely to have taken a more disgrace being unhorsed.
This first encounter was noted of all the nobles, who commended his strength
regarded him nothing, but with such valor met him, that he made him to his
great disgrace, forsake the saddell, at which a general showt to the Knights
great commendations was given. The Lord Vrelia having had his part, another
came in place, who went not away without some disgrace, so generally behaved he
himself, and with such honor and valor bare him, that the Judges, fathers of
Arms, gave the honor of the day to him, whom they all, though a stranger,
highly commended. The Knight coming before the Queen, humbly doing his duty,
was with his Trumpet sounding ready to depart, whom the nobles would not
suffer, without his knowledge, beseeching him, not so much to dishonor them, of
whom he had deserved honor, in such manner to leave them. The Maiden Knight,
who would as willingly have revealed himself, as they desired, though he made
show of some discontent, yet would not deny their request, but calling for his
Armourer, opened his Beauer, who being known to be the Maiden Knight, they
were all the more honored, taking no disgrace to be foiled of him, by whose
hands so many had lost their lives, which were honorable and expert in Arms.
Being discovered, he presented himself to her majesty, who not a little
joyful of her servants good fortune, whom the graced in this manner. Servant
quoth she, thanks for your pains, and honoring us at this time, for which I
ensure you, I think my self much beholding, it had been pity, truantlike
you should have left these honorable Lords your friends without having
acknowledged your self unto us and them, who you shall see, will be careful
to procure a Surgion, who doubtless shall cure those bleeding hearts, if any
such there be ofskill in Thrace. Honored Lady, quoth the knight, the well
spring of courtesy and nobility, most humble thanks I yield your majesty, for
this grace, without whose favor and grace, to whom in duty I am so bounden, I
desire not life. This said, the Queen and the strange nobles departing,
supper being ready and they set, their table talk was of the brave behavior
of the Knight, who had all the honor attributed to him, that was to be
required, wherein the strangers were ioyed, loving him dearly, and to increase
the fame which generally was given him, they in presence of the whole assembly,
declared the honors her majesty's Champion had gained in Thessaly and Egypt,
with the death of their King, who of a wound by his hand at the Tilt, dyed:
leaving nothing unspoken which might any way honor him, whereof the Queen
ioyed not a little, though she concealed the same.

Supper ended, and some part of the night spent in dancing, masking, and other
Courtlike pastimes, the Queen commending the nobles to their restes, bad the
company good night, who entering her lodging, it might have ioyed the heart of
any Lady in love, to hear the general laud of the Ladies, given to the
Maiden Knight, of whom no other talk was to be heard, each honorable part in
him commended to his desert, and of his valor in Arms, no praise was
sufficient: wherewith the Queen was not a little pleased, nor Guenela
discontent, to hear the only Prize of honor given her Lord, by whom she
had hope for her passed service, to be preferred. Thus ioying on all parts,
we leave the Queen with her company to their rests, and return to the Nobles
strangers, whose commendations and honorable reports of the Knight was such,
that nothing could be more pleasing unto them, applauding the wisdom and
noble demeanor of the Queen, whose like in her time, was not as they supposed
to be found: with such sundry discourses, passed these Nobles the night, to
which we leave them for a time. These Princely pastimes ouerpast, the care of
the Queen was for dispatch of the Nobles of Thessaly, whom she was loath to
detain from that desire they had to see their Country. Wherefore, after some
two or three days spent in discoursing of their countries, and state of their
realms, with the commodities thereof, eftsoons enterlacing their discourses,
with some pleasant parley, wherein the Nobles were much delighted, the Queen
took order with her Council for their answer, limitting a time therefore, to
the good content of the strangers. Against which prefixed time, the Queen
having care of her honorable word, had their Letters all written and signed,
when omitting them to a banquet, she in such honorable manner delivered their
answer, with such words of love, and desire of good to their King, as overcome
with joys thereof, the strangers were not able long time to answer,
presenting their King and Queen with gifts of high esteem, and highly
rewarding their honorable pains, which they gratefully accepted, taking order
for Galleys with victuals, and other necessaries to be purueyed with speed and
beuntie.

This honorable entertainment of the Queen to those strangers, being in the
prime of her government, gained her such honor through their reports, that
those which heard the same, admired her, whom they imagined was peerlesse, for
wisdom, bounty, and courtesy, not omitting the favor and love of the
Nobility, of whose worthiness, they could never speak sufficient.

As time finisheth the greatest affairs, so the careful travail of those to
whom the provision of the Fleet was commended, was such, that there was no
wants in short time left unfurnished, that lacking nothing but a fair wind,
which he that commands wind and seas, sent in such happy time, as they
could with, which not willing to loose, they commend the health and happy
government of the Queen, to him that rules all. And so accompanied with the
Maiden Knight, who was loath to leave them, and many other Pheeres of the
land, they were conducted each one to his several Gally, where being
imbarqued, their Sails cut, and they affore the wind, they gave their
farewell, with such a brave ringing peale of great Cannons, and then likewise
their small Artillery, as wonderfully rejoiced the beholders, which by the
Gunners from the Queens Forts a shore, was as worthily answered. Thus parted
these nobles, who in short time arrived in safety in Egypt, with their King,
unto whom, having delivered the Princes Presents with their letters, they
omitted no reports of their honorable entertainment of the Queen and her
nobles, in such manner, that where they or any of their train long time after
became, their table talk, was only of their honorable welcoms in Thrace, ever
applauding the magnificent grace, wisdom and bounty of the Queen, whom
they gave the Prize unto, of all that lived in her time, leaving nothing
unremembered, which might any way impair the honorable reputation of her
nobles, which used them with all the courtesy and bounty becoming their
estates: but especially the Maiden Knight, the discourse of whose valor and
manner of behavior, bred more delight then the rest, for that the nobles and
commons had knowledge of his valor and worthiness. These honorable
commendations of the nobles, ioyed the King, who in his secret thoughts
applauded her highness favor and courtesy, that for his sake and honor, had
used those his subjects in all Princely manner. But amongst those which took
pleasure in hearing those discourses of the nobles, the Queen enflamed with
their reports, burned with desire to see this peerlesse Princess, as the
second part of this history shall show you. Till when, leaving the King with
his Pheers to their solace, return we to Thrace, Where the Knight imboldned by
the favor of his gracious Lady, was not so great a stranger with her
highness, but that he might at pleasure repair to her presence, with whom by
his earnest suit, and desire to be possessed of her whom he so much loved and
honored, he egged her on still to marry, which for she would not do, without a
general consent of her nobles and states of the realm, she caused a
Parliament tobe sommoned, at which time, finding her fit opportunity, she
imparted her determinations in this manner.

Honorable Lords, and you our loving Commons here assembled, let not those
few words I have to say unto you, breed any discontent, that will deliver
nothing dishonorable to my state, and your disparagement: to withhold you from
the same long, were more niceness then wisdom, wherefore briefly thus.

Sithence I was by permission of him that exalts and pulls down Princess,
at his will, I am by your honorable and general consents, Crowned Queen of
this realm, to whose government you have as lawfully descended from him whom
you al loved and feared, committed your selves, sithence which, you have all
with shows of honorable love, and care of our state and realms, by sundry
examples persuaded me to marriage, which you say, may breed your happiness,
whose good, he that searches my hearts secrets, knows that I more prefer
then my life, on whose suits so often made, I have advisedly considered, and
noting the many perils incident to our sex, which rather require to be
governed, then to govern, the name of King being feared, honored and loved,
through fear, when they hold our sex in contempt. All which considered, with
your former suits, if I grant to your request, I doubt not, but I shall find
that favor, which the poorest of my subjects have, freely to choose, where
their loves and likings leads them, which if you grant, I shall hold my love
well bestowed on you, and shall have cause to think your request in times past
has been honorable, and not to tie me to any inconvenience, assuring you, that
whateuer he be that I shall bend my liking unto, shall not disparage my estate,
nor dishonor you, but be worthy for wisdom, valor, and what else is
required in honorable persons, to mate the Princess of most renown on the
earth. You have heard what I have to say, and wherefore chiefly this Parliament
was sommoned, of which I crave your answers.

The Nobles and Lords, both spiritual and temporal, with the Commons of both
houses, hearing the Queens motion, were all mute, not knowing sodeinly in a
matter of such weight, what to answer. But removed from their dumps, the
Speaker being both wise and well demeaned, as befitted his place, humbly
prostrating himself, thus said;

Most gracious Princesie, albeit your Majesty's request to this honorable
House, is no more then we have earnestly sought, yet pardon our sudden
answer, and give us respite of time until to morrow, the remain of this day,
so it stand with your Princely favor, shall be spent to hear the censure of
all estates in these Presence, whose love and duty is such, as they will deny
nothing, wherein your royal and honorable estate is not disparaged, but in
all things, will with all humbleness subject themselves to your highness
pleasure.

The Queen loath to require such haste in answering her question, graciously
commanded him to rise, granting most willingly to his demands, for which the
whole assembly with a vniall voice, gave her Grace most humble thanks.

The Queen having delivered the sum of her desire, graciously commending
them to his will that frames all things, accompanied with many of Pheeres,
departs.

The Queen departed, all matters in questions laid apart, the Pheeres and most
cheifest of both Houses, assembled themselves in Council, where you must
suppose, no matter for benefit of the state, was omitted. The request made by
their Queen, with great advice considered, which amongst them was admired,
where many imaginations assailed them, devising of each side, what he should be
that is in so high esteem and favor with her Grace, and of such worthy
reputation as she has reported him, eftsoons naming one, then some other,
yet the principal object of her love never remembered, which drove them all to
an non plus.

But what ever he were, time of their own desire to answer, craved some
dispatch of what they had in question. Wherefore leaving frivolous questions,
they proceed to their begun action, gladly would they have been certified of
their elected King, but in vain it was for them to require it. Wherefore
considering their own desires, they thought it would be taken in evil part of
her highness, to gainsay what with such humble and earnest suits they had
required, assuring themselves of her wisdom, government, and care of their
goods, which was so wise, and every way so honorably demeaned, which
considered, thereuppon relying, it was generally determined, to refer all to
her own will, pleasure, and good lyking. On which resolved, the cheifest of
the Nobility, accompanied with diverse of the Clergy, in hope of the Queens
good acceptance, speedeth them to the Court, who sodeinly was advertised of
their being, with their request, which was, to have access to her highness.
No sooner was her highness thereof certified, but leaving her Chamber where she
was busily employed about those businesses which she had in hand, devising of
the answer of the Commons, leaving all, she speedeth her unto them, where
taking her place, their duties in all humbleness done, and she with all
honorable courtesy requited it, the Speaker in presence of the whole assembly,
thus said;

Dread Soueraign, the Lords both spiritual and temporal, with commons in this
honorable Parliament assembled, weying with care and wisdom, the honor of your
highness, and carefully tendering the weal public, have with great care of
both, (the premises) considered, with your majesty's request, albeit, they have
no knowledge of his honorable person, unto whom your royal liking is united,
yet relying on your Princely wisdom, and care of your subjects, by whose
welfare their happiness is to be maintained, with one vniall consent, they
willingly subject themselves unto your highness will and pleasure, assuring
your grace, that whom you shall vouchsafe to endue with title of Lord and
husband, they will accept for their sovereign, and will in all humbleness,
acknowledge with loving hearts their duties unto him, as to their lawful King,
by your majesty's election. Thus my gracious Lady, have they willed me to say,
in behalf of them all, and most humbly beseech your highness, to make known
unto them the name so honored, which you have vouchsafed to like, to the end
they neglect not that duty which is due unto him by your good grace.

The Queen hearing this answer of her Commons, was more ioyed, and in heart
contented, then ever she was since the death of her father, her loving
countenance showing the content of her heart, so long discontent, which made
her, with most lovely grace and courtesy, to say;

My Lords all, and you of the Communaltie, you have in yielding to these
honorable motions by me made, highly contented her, whose desire in love, made
me not so headstrong to consent without your general lyking, my choice being
such, as may be mated with the oneliest Lady of highest esteem in the world,
as I doubt not your selves will confess, when he shall be known unto you, my
high esteem of him laid apart, for that you may say, affection is blind. And
as the Proverb says, The Negro by nature, black and loathsome in our eyes,
esteems her Infant fair, so Love, which commands all creatures, caused many
Princes and Ladies of worth, to submit themselves to base estates, Imperious
love so over mastering their hearts, to assure you that my lyking is not such,
and to satisfy you, which with your courteous consent has contented me, know
your so elected souaraigne, and he that I have subjected my love unto, is of no
less worth then a Prince, royally borne, and descended from the loins of a
King famous, and a Queen endowed with much honor, himself showing his royal
desent by his demeanor, which is valiant, wise, and courteous, such a one, I
know your desires is to choose for your sovereign: all offection set apart,
such a one have I chosen, which shall cause al your ioies, if you joy in any
good. Where breaking off your speech, with other words of courtesy, yielding
them great thanks, she called Guenela, whom she commanded, to send some
trusty messenger for the Prince, willing him, all business set apart, to
repair unto her, which done, framing pleasant discourses which delighted the
nobles, she sought to their contents, to beguile the time until the messenger
returned, which made such haste, that he found the Knight, unto whom he
imparted the Queens pleasure, which albeit, the sodeinesse thereof, was
troublesome unto him, cloying his head, devising of sundry matters, which her
hasty sending for him should import, yet neglecting no time, he speedeth him
to the Presence, where to the Queen he was the welcommest man living, as her
countenance declared; who calling him unto her, commanded a chair to be
brought, and seating him on her left hand, to the admiration of all the
beholders, which done she said;

My Lords, and you our loving subjects, muse not at this unwonted favor used
to this Gentleman, nor repine not, for that it is your own choice. This is my
choice, and he that I have sworn my love and loyal affection unto, who
albeit has thus long subjected himself to our service, doing us many high
favors, as your own eyes can witness, enduced unto it by that high commander
of men, who has procured many Princes to the like: for our love, as I am
assured, he abandoned his Kingly seat, disguised in the base attire of a
Merchant, came to our Court, where what honors he has gained by his valor and
courtesy, not one of you but know Numedia, being his native soil, and the
kingdom his by lawful desent from the King his father. Let it not dismay you
my friends, nor judge my words spoken of him for his honor, to be more then
truth, so shall you wrong him whose worth you may be by my reports assured
off, and injury her which had never intent, but to deserve well of you all.
Therefore as you have your desire knowing him, in token of your love and
general consents, by whom he is your adopted King, show by your signs of
content, how pleasing my choice and lyking is unto you.

The Nobles amazed at the Queens speech, although they could hardly be enduced
to believe what she had said, yet such was the love they honored her with,
that giving credit unto her words, without longer pause of the matter, that the
Queen might the rather be won to credit their former speech, with a
universal voice, prostrating themselves before him, they cried, God save the
King and Queen, vowing unto him loyalty and failtie, as unto their King and
sovereign.

Thanks good my Lords, quoth the Prince, for your good consents, and doubt not
of my love to you, which with such hearty affection shall be showed, that my
dearest blood shall be shead, ere the least hair of the basest of your heads
shall perish. Which said, the Queen standing up, requested the Nobles, that as
they had with consent elected him their King, so they would appoint the time
for solemnizing the marriage with the Coronation, changing his name from
Pheander the Maiden Knight, to Dionicus, the lawful heir of the Numedian
Crown, for that was his right, and the name of Pheander, but usurped.

Which request of her Majesty, they easily granted, appoynting the marriage
three days following, and the Coronation presently to follow, which to their
great joys was accomplished, with all the honor might be done by their
subjects, the costly shows, and all manner of delightful pastimes there used,
I omit, albeit it was pleasing both to their King and Queen, and brought great
joy and comfort to all beholders. The marriage with the Coronation past, the
Commons delighted with their King, assured his grace, to be so honorable as the
Queen had reported him, and they found, who in that Parliament to honor the
Thracians the more, and let them know, his love was no whit inferior to
theirs, he entailed the Crown of Numedia, to the lawful heir of Thrace,
succeeding, assuring them, that his Nobles and Commons, should confirm and
assure the same.

Which courteous favor, the Nobles so gratefully accepted, as they returned him
for the same, many gracious thanks, the Parliament proroged, according to
custom of the Country, their duty in all humbleness done, the Nobles, with
the cheifest of all parts in the land, wished the Queen and King many happy
days, to their joy and hearts content: which they requited with such shows of
love as might delight them, and give them cause to joy in their Princes
election, of whom their comfort was great, and their assurance of tranquillity
with foreign Princes, through his magnanimity, to be such, as al true
subjects might have pleasure to recount. Their leave taken, every one departs
well content, to his home.

Thus the King and Queen, enjoying hearts content, their loves more and more
increased, that there was no talks but of their faithful love and hearts
lyking, through which, the Commons lived in peace, praying for their long lives
to be continued. To which content in love, the story leaves them, recounting
the arrival of the aged Barnardine, in Thrace, who with his long travail came
unto the Court, where wandering Pilgrimelike, living by the devotion of
bountiful people, he spent some time in contemplation, others in viewing the
beauty of the Court, and manners of the people, eftsoons commending their
religion, and serving their creature, taking much pleasure in discoursing with
such Pilgrim strangers as he meet, of the diverse conditions of those
Nations, whose Countries he had seen, which being many, he affected no
Princes Region, as this Country of Thrace.

The aged father over worn with grief and long travel, was so much altered
in his face, as he that had well known him, might very well have mistaken his
feature, which made the King, who oftentimes had noted his comely person, his
Pilgrims attire and other ornaments, to religious belonging, greatly to affect
him, little suspecting it was the aged Barnardine. But as time reuealeth
greatest secrets, and brings friends to knowledge, so the King taking
pleasure, beholding this Pilgrim, noted him so often, that his phisiognemy to
his memory, presented the feature of his beloved Barnardine, which imagined
thought, began to take such root in the King, as he greatly desired to have
some conference with the Pilgrim, evermore persuading himself that it was his
noble Tutor, and careful Physician. To assure him of that doubt, he determined
to have knowledge of the aged man if he might, and for that intent, caused his
Pages to give diligent heed, if they saw him in the Court, to bring him
tidings thereof, which they did according to his Majesty's commandment,
attending with such care, at that usual time he was accustomed to come, that
he passed not of them unperceived, whereof they gave the King intelligence, by
whose command, he was sommoned to his Presence.

The aged Pilgrim at this first somance of the messenger, was in such dread of
wrong to be offered him, as he greatly feared some ill to betide him, knowing
that Princes have many eyes, and strangers are marks, how poor so ever their
estates are, specially frequenting the Court as he did, yet he whose conscience
could not accuse him of any evil intent against the King, had this hope, that
God whom he served, does protect the innocent, and would deliver him. Thus
casting his care on him that commands Kings, not without many imaginations
what should be the cause he came unto the Kings Presence, unto whom, as one
that knew his good, he prostrated himself, praying heartily for the Kings
prosperity.

The King which saw the old man bowing before him, kindly took him from the
ground, tendering his age, which he honored, whom the more he noted, the more
the lovely face of his beloved Barnardine, presents it unto his memory, the
thought of whom, caused his heart to much sorrow, yet shaking off grief, of
father, kingdom, and friend, he said; Aged father, in whose face appears
gravity, tell me, of that dutiful love thou owe thy most beloved friend, of
what Country thou art? and what fortunes has brought thee to this region?
that honoring thee, whose age requires the same, I may further thy suits if
thou have any, or wanting wealth, I may leleeue thee. The woeful Pilgrim,
revived by those honorable speeches of the King, said;

Renowned Prince, the mirror of honor, of whose fame the world is filled, to
satisfy your Exellence, know, that occasions of importance thereunto moving
me, I forsook my native Country, in search of those whom my fortune was never
yet to meet, yet have I traveled many kingdoms, and in my travel, have
seen many Princes Courts, and noted their several demeanors, yet most
gracious sovereign, never took I pleasure in any, as in this Country of
Thrace, the nobles especially giving me cause to admire them whose minds show
their true Gentilitie, as the fruit makes the tree known, in which taking
delight, I have, though more then beseems a stranger, so often frequented thy
Court, wherewith, if your grace take any offense, I humbly beseech your pardon,
which am now ready to depart.

The King, which had heard that tongue so often read him many Lectures, and
given him instructions of honor, was not deceived him, though albeit he forbear
to acknowknowledge him, whom he desired so heartily to see, unto whom he was
more welcome then any man living, yet concealing himself, he said;

Father, thanks for thy love, and honorable report of our realm and people,
for which I rest thy debtor. But say me, aged man, of what Country art thou?
and what account were those friends with thee, whom thou with such travel have
sought? whether thyallies, or thy friends by adoption. At this motion of the
King, the old man overcome with the thoughts of those of whom his pitiful
tale was to be told, could not forbear tears, which with such abundance of
sobbes and heavy sighs were uttered, that it moved the King to great ruth,
seeing those silver hairs which he honored, bedeawed with sault drops, the
witness of his his discontent. Wherefore like the careful Physician, having
ministered bitter Pills to his Pacient, seasoneth the same with some sweeter
taste, he comfort ye aged Barnardine, with words so pleasing, that it cheared
the old man, yet would not pardon his report, which caused him say;

Famous King, if pity of my age may any way move you, urge not my faltering
tongue to utter a tale of such ruth as it imports, the remembrance whereof,
ouercloyeth me with sorrow, and will bring your Exellence small delight.
Therefore sovereign Prince, pardon me, which cannot reveal the truth of so
pitiful a tale, (as yet) without the hazard of my life, my heart so
ouercharged with grief, that to think thereon, halleth me near to death,
then pardon me. But how loath so ever, the King might not be entreated, whom
with such pleasing speech he halled on, that comforted by his majesty's kind
words whom he would not gainsay, he said, sithence nothing may persuade your
Exellence to pity me, accept in worth my rudeness, and pardon it. Which
said, humbly doing his duty, as one that could his good, he thus proceeded.

Dread Lord, know Numedia is my native soil, where through the grace of my
thrice noble Prince, I consumed my youth in that happiness, favored by his
favor, with the best of account in that Region, and so graced by the King,
that he committed y^ government of his dear son, more dear to him then his
life, to be trained up by me, of whom, as duty willed me, I had that care as
is required of a subject to his Lord, ioying in nothing the world possesses,
so much, as in the towardness of the Prince, whose verteous youth, might be a
loadstarre to all that ever I saw, for courtesy matchless, bountiful as
Tymon, more valiant then Hector, or the best deserving y^ lived, cunning was he
in the liberal Arts, what should I say of him whose honorable praise, no
tongue can with such commendations utter, as his honors and virtues requires,
so generally beloved of all men, that death is more sweeter to many thousands
of his subjects, then the remembrance of that Noble Prince. Here tears
restrained his speech, that he could not utter a word, standing so astonished,
that he rather represented the Image of death, then a living creature, whom the
King put from his heavy passion thus.

Father, thou have filled my heart with a world of wonders at thy strange
talk, which I conjure thee, of that love thou owe the Prince whom thou
sorrowest so to remember, not to leave in such abrupt manner, but proceed, dyed
the King, and the Prince so of thee honored, and through their deaths began thy
travail. Say sweet father?

Though the reporting of this doleful history, more grievous unto me then
death, should finish my days, yet such is the penance by your majesty's
coniuring speech enjoined me, that what grief so ever I endure, I will
satisfy your grace.

The Prince, oh my Lord, that it would please you to pardon the rest, growing
to years of discretion, I know not through what means, neither could I for
all the diligence I used, attain unto it, but sick he was, and so oppressed with
such a strange agony, that no physic could minister relief unto him, or
yield him any ease, so that there was small hope of his recovery, the
strangeness of each maledy being such, as sometime faring like a man frantike,
no persuasions of reason night prevail with him, who in his health was to be
ruled in all things. This passion so long assailed the Prince, and so little
hope of his recovery, that the extremity thereof, began touch the King and
Queen mother, whose careful love was such, as nature could not require more in
parence whatsoever. The continual grief of the prince, wrought such care in
the aged King and Queen, that it was not to be found which of them was most
grieved, or whose lot it was to give his due to death, first, yet as no care is
so great but has some comfort, so the commander of men, when all hope of life,
was past hope of men, restored the Prince to health, and by his health,
recovered the King and Queen, for whose weal, the Commons more rejoiced, then
of their own good, so that a general joy was throughout the realm, tryumphing
at this happy recovery of the Prince, the King, and Queen. But as the fairest
day is ouershadowed with clouds, so was the sunshine of their joy eclipsed,
through the great folly of the Prince, who unknown of all men, or acquainting
any with his pretense, left his father, Crown, and subjects, and lives no man
knows how, or where, for whom the King felt a million of woes: grief so
assailing his aged corpse, as he was like to rest with death, but reason
subduing affection, he recovered his sickness, and leaving his land without a
governor, likewise departed, whither no man knows. The mother Queen being
of nature weak, resigned her due to death, whom as duty commands me, I
entombed with such honor as beseems the person of a Queen, and so persuaded
with the Commons in a Parliament for the same intent called, as the government
of the Realm was committed to six of the nobility, who are bound to resign
their authority when the lawful succeeded shall require it, which done, I
forsook all I enjoyed, and Pilgrim like as your highness sees, have
traveled many Countries in search of my soueraign the Prince, but for all the
diligence I can use, of them can learn no tidings. Thus with tears standing
in his eyes, he ended his lamentable history, which the King was assured to be
true, but least was the thought of Barnardine, that he had delivered this
doleful tale to the Prince, which had likewise some cause of grief, which so
near touched him, as he could not for tears utter what he would, yet putting
by his passions as he could he said:

Aged father, matter of great ruth have thou delivered, which to hear is most
lamentable, and may touch that careless Prince near, by whom this chance
has chanced, his parence and subjects: but tell me father, all grief laid
apart, in what state lives the subjects of thy King, under their government
which has the charge, yet is your grace not satisfied quoth the Pilgrim, but
will exact on me more to increase my grief, which seeing you delight in, I
shall unfold that which in recounting, will finish all, yielding my breath to
him that gave it me, therefore attend.

Not long sithence, unknown, I chanced to accompany in my travail, a
Gentleman of Numedia, to me well known, which for I saw I was out of
knowledge with him, I questioned him of many matters, as your grace has done
me, which amongst other his news of discontent, reported that those elected
governors, whose hearts broyling with ambition and desire of the whole
authority, as the title of King, to the ambitious is sweet, so these covetous
wretches, taking part one with the other, some enclining one way, some to the
other part, that civil discention was raised, where the father bear Arms
against the son, the son against the father, and kinsman against kinsman,
one imbruing their hands in others blood, through which, many a woman is left a
widow, and many a sweet Infant fatherles, which makes me greatly fear,
without his help, that sends all help, to the helpless, the land will be
impouerished, and our King and Prince returning, shall from their proper right
be debarred, by these usurping vilaines, whose hearts, my aged teeth in revenge
of their treachery, and wrong done the Commons, I could tear. The Prince
hearing that tale of disco^tent, was moved more at y^ wrong offered the
Commons, then all the former history, which made his say;

Father I have noted thy long talk, which has moved (...)th to sorrow and
desight, greeuing for the Commons (...) (...) ioying that any Prince should
have a subject of such worth, as is rare in these times to befound, wherefore
father, that thou may live in my Court to draw others to their (...)iue to
their Prince, I will here detain thee, and for thou love that careless
Prince Dionicus, will honor thee (...)g my life, enduing thee with treasure,
and what else* thou shall at any time command, for all I enjoy is ^h^^e, ^^^
if hereafter thou shall think it convenient, I will with ^ (...)ng power, ^^^er
their distressed Confines, and ^h(...)ing those Rebels, leave thee Regent in
their place, until further tidings shall be of thy King or his son, whom I
am ^^re will not abuse them.

The aged father, hearing th^se honorable speeches from the mouth of the King,
was astonished, knowing well that Princes of esteem honor themselves, holding
their words, yet not minded to give over search for his sovereign, he returned
the King humble thanks, beseeching his highness to pardon him, which has
vowed to end his life in performing his v^w to the Prince, and either hear
tidings of him, or never see his Country, the place of the world most
pleasing unto him. The King hearing his words, having great experience of his
fidelity, could conceal himself no longer, but imbrasing him in his arms,
^^deawing his aged hairs with drops like rain, he (...),

Faithful Barnardine, the mirror of true friendship, whose equal in love is
not to be found, what cause have I to honor thee, whose care is such of me,
that have so ill deserved, but forgive me Barnardine, my miss against thee
committed, forgive me noble father, and you subjects of Numedia, who by me
unhappy creature, have been so much wronged, and thou Barnardine, my careful
Tutor, forgive me I ^ntreate, and continue thy love to me unhappy Prince,
