Of Gentylnes and Nobylyte.
A dyaloge between the Marchaut the Knight and the plowman dysputyng who is a
verey Gentylman and who is a Noble man and how men should come to auctoryte /
compilid in manner of an interlude with diverse toys and geftis addyd thereto to
make merry pastyme and disport.

The merchant O what a great wealth and prosperyte
It is to any reme where merchants be
Having fre lyberte and entercours also
All marchaundyse to co^uey to and fro
Which thing I have used and the verey fet found
And thereby gotton many a thousand pownd
Wherefore now be cause of my great riches
Thoroughowt this land in every place doubtless
I am magnyfyed and greatly regardyd
And for a wise and noble man estemyd

The knight Master merchant I here you right well
But now in presumpsion me thynk ye excel
To call yourself noble in presence here
I wys men know what your ancestors were
And of what great stock descendid ye be
Your fadyr was but a black smyth perde

March. Why sir what than what be you I pray you

Knight Mary I am a gentylman I would ye know
And may dispend yearly v.C. mark land
And I am sure all that ye have in hand
Of yearly rent is not worth v. markys

M But I would thou knewist for all thy krakkys
I am able to bye now all the land
That thou have and pay for it out of hand
Which I have got by mine own labor and wit

K Yet art thou but a chorle and I have a skorn
Thou shuldist compare with me a gentylman born

M Why what callyst thou a gentylman tell me

K Mary I call them gentylmen that be
Born to great landys by inherytaunce
As mine ancestors by co^tynuaunce
Have had this v.C. year of whom now I
Am desendid and commyn lynyally
Beryng the same name and armies also
That they bare this v.C. year agoo
Mine ancestors also have ever be
Lordys Knights and in great auctoryte
Capteyns in the war and gouerners
And also in time of pease great rulers
And thyn were never but artysycers
As smythes masones carpentars or weuars

M All that is truth I will not deny now
Yet I am more gentylman born than thou
For I call him a gentylman that gentilly
Does gyf unto other men louyngly
Such thing as he has of his own pper
But he that takith ought away from a another
And does gyf him no thing again therefore
Owght to be called a chorle evermore
But mine ancestors have giffyn alwey
To thyn ancestors such thing as they
By their labors did trewly get and wyn
For mine ancestors bildid howsis wherein
Thine ancestors have had their dwelling place
Also mine ancestors have made tolis
To all manner crafti men belongyng
Whereby clothis and every other thing
Where of thyn ancestors need have had
With the same tolys have ever be made
So mine ancestors have gyffin their labors
Ever to comfort and help thyn ancestors

K I deny that ever thauncestours of thine
Did ever gif to the ancestors of mine
At any time any thing except that they
Gafe some what therefore other ware or money

M Mary god a mercy John for that now
That is even a pyg of our own sow
How can lordys and estatis have ought in store
Except thartyfycers do get it before
For all metalis be dyggyd furst by myners
And after wrought by the artyfycers
woll fell and every other thing
That is necessary to mannys coueryng
And all other thyngis that men use and were
Is al wey made by the artyfycer

K I grant that the artyfycers do make it
But be cause comenly they have little wit
Gentylmen that have landys and domynyon
Of all such riches have most possessyon
For reason will ever it should so be
wise men to have folys in captyuyte

M Mary as for wit and subtell inuencyou
Mine ancestors with thine may make co^perison
For though my fader were a smyth what than
yet was he a marvelous quyk wyttyd man
And coud work as well for his pert
As any in this land vsyng that art
And deuyse new fassyons in chynges that he made
That every man to bye his ware was glad
And carue and grave in iron and stele
Both Image and letters meruelously well
And there on ley gold and gylt it also
Fine and pure as any gold smyth coud do
My grauntfader also was a mason
Of great wit as any in this regyon
And coud byld a castle and tour right well
In which some of thy kynnys men now do dwell
where in aperyth right good masonry
with Immagys and armies wrought curyously
My great graundfadyr lo was a weuer
Of wollyn yarn and of other gere
And made marvelous pleasant workis to be hold
Lynyn dyaper sylk and cloth of gold
All such subtell thyngis as I have rehersyd lo
Mine ancestors by their wyttis coud work and do
And as for thine ancestors I know no thing
They coud do by their wittis worth of praisyng
But use occupi and wast ever more
Such thyngis as mine ancestors (...) before
And thou and thie ancestors (...)
Of such thingis wrought (...)
Of other men oughtist not be praised therefore
But the praise ought to be given ever more
To the artyfycer which by his wit
It deuysyd and so co^nyngly wrought it
wherefore if thou sey that wit and polesy
Be the things perteynyng to gentry
Thyn ancestors may never compare with, mine
For their acts prove them wyser than thine
For thyn did never no thing in their days
Concerning quyk wit that was worthy prays

K yes I wis lewd Iauell I would thou knewist it
Mine ancestors have had more wisdom and wit
Than thine have had and coud do also
Many things that thine coud never do
for in the country at sessyons and syse
They have be elect to be Justice
And for theyer wit and great dyscressyon
They have Iuggyd and done correccyon
Upon thine ancestors artyfycers
That have made false warys and ben dysseyuers
And help for to maynteyn every thing
That is to the common weith pteynyng
They have been also in time of war
Both in this land and other courreys far
Dukrs and leders of the hole army
And by their wyttis and warly polycy
Study forecast and dilygent travail
Have won many a great fyld and battle
And thine ancestors that were there
were never able to bear shyld nor spear
And were never but soldyars and pyoners
Nor never had wisdom to be rulers
But because mine ancestors have ever be
Dyscrete and wise they have had anctoryte

M Nay nay thine ancestors came never all
To auctoryte for wisdom p^ncypall
For though so^e were wise yet some of the^ again
Had small discression little wit or brayn
But because of the long co^tynuannce
Of their great possessions by enherytaunce
By the folysh manner of the world we see
For that cause ever they have had auctorite

K And I say that good reason agreth to it
For though the fader have no great wit
The sone that is wise should never the more
Lose his land or auctoryte therefore
For he that by study dylygens and pain
Great landys or possessions does attayn
His own life is to short and to lyte
For to take the fruit of his merit
Reason would therefore that after his life
His heyrs before strangers have p^rogatyfe
And the co^tynuaunce of such possessions
Makyth noble men and gentle condycyons
And they whose blood has long continued
As gentylmen so they should be honored
And so mine ancestors long time have be
Great possyssyoners and in auctoryte
Therefore consyderyng my great lynage
My blood my noble birth and parentage
Thou art not able to compare with me
Another in gentylnes nor in nobylyte

Here the plouman co^mith in with a short whyp in his hand and spekyth as
folowith Plow. Nowhere is bybbyll babbyll clytter clatter
I hard never of so folysh a matter
But by goddys body to speak the troth
I am better than other of you both

K Auaunt kanker de chorle fro whens co^myst thou

P Mary folysh peuysh daw even fro my plow
Now say woldyst any thing there wtall

M ye mary thou lewyd vyllayn and rud rascal
It is for the full ill besemyng
To perturb any gentylmens talkyng

P Gentylmen ye gentylmen Iak heryng
Put your shone in your bosom for weryng
I account myself by goddys body
Better than you both and more worthy

K Auaunt knave get the out of the gate
Or I shall lay my sword on thy pate

P That shall I prove I make god auow
Never in better time have at the now
Et verberat eos
M Now hold thy hand fellow I the pray
And harkyn what I shall to the say

P Sey knave say what can sey

M Hold thy hand I pray the and com no narr
I am a merchant and no man of war

K Thou art not honest I tell the plainly
To make any quarrel here so suddenly
To perturb our co^munycacyon

P Here ye may se syrs by goddys passion
Two proud folys make a crakkyng
And when it co^myth to point dare do no thing

M Our coming hyder and our intent
is not to fight but by way of argument
Every man to show his oppinyon
To see who could show the best reason
To prove him self noble and most gentylman

P By god all the reasons sith ye began
That ye have made thereof be not worth a fly

K No sir I pray the than tell me why

P Furst as touching noblenes I say
There is another of you both did prove or lay
Any of your actys whereby that ye
Should in reason prove you noble to be
Or thereby deserve any manner praysyng
But all the effect of your arguyng
To prove your noblenes was but only
Of the deddys and acts of your auncestry
And of the acts that your ancestors did before
ye at the nobler never the more

K As touching my self I dare make compison
Of as noble dedys as he has any done
For I am and have been one of the cheualry
At the commandment of my prince euerredy
And every time of war have be captayn
And leder of a.M. men or twain
And with horse and harnes spear and sheld
Have Ioydyd my body in every field
The rentes of my landys have spend lyberally
And kept a great house contynually
And holp to ponyssh theuys and brybers alwey
To the great tranqaylyte of my contray
And you master merchau^t wit never take labor
Except it be for your proffet and lucoure

Plow. Go to go to now master merchant
There is a reason that gyuyth you a taunt
I trow more than you can answer well

M Nay I wys pyvysh and rude Iak Iauell
I can make an answer so substancyally
where to another of you is able to reply

K If thou can answer my reason do

M That can I well do. P. Then go to fool go to

M I say the common well of every land
In fete of marchauntdyse does pryncypally stand
For if our co^moditees be vtteryd for naught
In to strange landis and no riches brought
Hydyr therefore / we should come to beggary
And all men dryffyn to life in mysery
The^ we noble marchauntis that in this reame be
what a great wealth to this land do we
we utter our warys and by theyrs good chepe
And bring them hyder that great proffet
And pleasure daily co^myth to this regyon
Too all manner people that here do won
Forthermore ye see well with your eyes
That of straynge landis the co^modytees
we have such need of them that be there
That in no wise we may them for bear
As oil sylkis frutis and spyces also
Gold silver yryn and other metal is moo
All dra^mys and druggys longyng to physyke
which men must needs have when they be seek
which in this reame can not well grow
Our country is to cold and not hot I now
with out which thyngis we should life in mysery
And often times for lak of them we should dye
And I spend my studi and labor contynually
And cause such thyngis to come hyder daily
For the comfort of this land and common wealth
And to all the people great, pffer and health
And for such noble dedys reason will than
That I ought to be called a noble man
And another of you both that here now be
In noblenes may accompare with me

P Now well hit by gods body well hit
Of one that has but lyttyll wit
Answer me one word furst I pray the
what is the noblest thing that can be

K what say thou thereto thy self let see

P Is not yt the noblyst thing in deed
That of all other thyngis has lest need
As god which beynith etern in bliss
Is not he the noblest thing yt is

K yes mary no man in reason can that deny

P well than there is no reason thereof why
But because he is the thing omnipotent
And is in hun self so suffycyent
And nedyth the help of no nothyr thing
To the help of his glorious being
But every other thing has need of his aid

M Mary that is very trough and well said

P And lykwyse yt thing that has most need
Is the thing that is most wreched
So suffycyency is ever noblenes
And necessyte is ever wrechydnes
And he that has more need of that thing
For the p^teruacyon of his living
Then his fellow has his fellow must needs be
By this same reason more noble than he
what than.P. by the same reason it prouith lo
ye be but caytyffes and wrechis both two
And by the same reason prove I shall
That I am the noblyst man of us all
For I have need of no manner thing
That ye can do to help of my lyffyng
For every thing whereby ye do life
I noryss it and to you both do gyf
I plow I till and I ster the ground
whereby I make the corn to habounde
whereof there is made both drynk and bred
wych the which daily ye must nedis be fed
I noryss the catell and fowlys also
Fyssh and herbis and other thyngie mo
Fell herr and woll which the bestis do bear
I noryssh and preserve which ye do were
which if ye had not no dowt ye should
Starve for sak of clothis because of cold
So both you should die or live in necessite
If ye had not comfort and help of me
And as for your fine cloth and costly array
I cannot see whi ye ought or may
Call your self noble because ye were it
which was made by other menis labor and wit
And also your dilicate drinkis and viand
By other menis labors be made so pleasand
Therefore master merchant now to you I sei
I can not see but I am able and may
Life without you or your purueaunce
Live without you or your purueyaunce
For of fode and cloth I have suffisaunce
Of my self for lyffing necessary
And now sir knight to you I sey plainly
I see not that ye can any thing do
For the co^myn well or ought longyng thereto
But each man being in auctoryte
Having wit may do it as well as ye
Therefore to spek now of necessyte
There is another of you both but ye be
In more need than I therefore I sey plain
I am more noble than other of you twayn
Now that is a folysh reason so god me save
For by the same reason thou woldyst have
Eueri best fyssh and other foul than
To be more noble of birth than a man
For man has more need of bodily coueryng
Than they have for they need no thing
The bestes have herr and also a thik skin
The fissh skalis or shelis to keep their bodies in
The foulis fethirs and so eueri thing
By nature has his proper covering
Save man himself which is born all nakyd
And therefore he should be than most wrechyd

P Mary no man can make a better reason
For that is a sure and a true co^clusyon
For if a child when he is furst born
were not holp and coueryd he were sone lorn
He has no strenght to help him never a dell
yet bestis have power to help them self well
So co^sideryng ma^ns body in deed
A best is more noble and man more wrechyd
Be cause he has need of many mo thyngis
Than bestis have to help of theyer lyffyngis
Also man must daily labor and sweet
To get him sustynaunce as drynk and mete
The grownd he must dyg and the bestis kill
For bread and mete his bodi to fill
Grapis frutis and herbis norssh dyligently
To make good drynkis to refressh his body
But all brut bestis have coueryng natural
Sufficyent to cover their bodies with all
And find their fode ever on the grownd ready
with out any pain labor or study
So eueri man by reason of his body
Is more wrechyd and in more mysery
Than bestes be / yet thus not wythstandyng
Man is most noble of creatures living
Not by his body for that is impotent
But by his soul being so excellent
For by reason of his soul intyllectyue
He subde with all other bestes alive
And co^pellyth all other bestis that be
By his wit to releue his necessyte
But bestis have no wit them self to defend
Nor can get no more than god has them send
For take any best that weryth here
And do clyp it of bare a gayns winter
That best has no manner of polecy
To get other coueryng for his body
Of cloth nor skyns nor has no wit
To put it upon him though one have made it
Nor can byld no house nor kyndyl no fire
To warm his body if need should require
But yet a man has wit and understanding
For to help him self in every such thing
So man for his soul intellectual
Is most noble creature of bestis all

M That is a verey good and preguant reason
yet me thynkith thou makist a degression
From the argument that we furst began
which was to prove who was most gentylman
which we disputyd I would thou haddist hard it

P Tussh I hard what ye said everi whit

K Then show thy reason therein or thou go

P Nay be god I have some what else to do
I must go by me a halporth of gresse
The spokes of my cart therewith to dress
Trow ye that I will leave my bysynes
For your babelyng pomp and folysshnes
Nay by sent mary I will not do so
For I can now to the merket goo
And for an haipeny as much gresse by
As shall cost me in our town a penny
And I tell the plainly with out any bost
A halpeny is as well sauid as lost

P Straw for an halpeny therein is no wast
Tarry with us a while phapps thou mast
By our acquayntaunce now here get more
Than thou gatist with thy cart this monyth before

P Straw for thy council torde a fart
Trowist I will gyf up my plow or cart
And follow thy folish appityte and mind
Nay I am not yet so mad nor so blind
For when I am at my cart of plow
I am more meryer than other of you
I would not change my life nor my lyffyng
For to be made a great lord or a king
There is no joy nor pleasure in this world here
But hill belly fill and make good chere
Be if prince lord gentilman or knave
Hit is all the joy that here be can have
But these covetous and ambicious wretches
They set there myndys in honor and riches
So much that they be never content
So they life ever in pain and torment
But a man that can this meanys find
To have fode and cloth and a merry mind
And to desire no more than is needful
That is in this world the life most joyful
Which life in this world no man shall acquire
Till he subdew his insaciat desire

M I see well thou has a cursed apysh wit
Then if thou wylt depart I pray the yet
Come again when thy bisines is do

P For what intent now should I do so

M For we will in owre old argument prosede
Who should be called a gentylman in deed
And we would be glade to here thy reason

P I will come again upon a condition
That ye will wayt upon me both twayn
And be not out of the way when I come again

K We will not be far hens P. then I will not fail

M Then I pray the let not the pmise quail

P Lo here is my finger now trust me well
I will come again if I have my hele
For by god I promise you one thing
I am as true of my word as the King
But if I find you not here then by my trough
I shall call you oppenly false knauys both

M Thou shall find us true in every thing

P I thynk so / except lyeng and stelyng

K Then far well for a season a dew
Then fare ye well both I dare say as true
As some that be tyede in newgate

M well now he is gone god speed well his gate
But what shall we do now the mean season

K Let us take now some recreacyon
And come again here and keep our poyntment

M Now thereto I am right well content
And in the meayn wyle good lord of thy grace
Preserve all the people here in this place

Amen
Finis prime partis
Secunda pars
The Plouman
P Here I may walk and wander to and fro
But I se not them which I would speak to

M Yes by rode here we be both twayn
To whom thou dydyst promys to mete here again
To dyspute the questyon that we began
which of us coud prove him most gentylman

K Thou seydest thou hardyst our arguments all

P so did I another good nor substancy all
For thy folysh and pyuysh oppynyon
was because of the great domynyon
Of the landis and rentis where to thou wast bore
which thyn ancestors had long time before
Thou thynkyst thy self a gentylman to be
Ant that is a folysh reason semyth ne
For when adam dolf and eve span
who was then a gentylman
But then came the churl and gederyd good
And there began furst the gentle blood
And I thynk verily ye do believe
That we came all of adam and eve
Then to speak by reason great possessions
Make no gentylmen but gentyl condycyons
That is the cause and best reason why
One should be called a gentylman truly
And forthermor mark well this reason then
If a ma^nis ancestors have be gentylmen
And verteous and good to commyn well
That ought to be reputyd never adell
To the praise of the child which does refuse
Such good co^dycyons and the contrary use
But he ought to be dyspraysyd the more
Because his ancestors has shewid him before
A precedent of gentylnes and vertew
which good example he does not infew
For the gentylnes of hysblode clery
In him does decay and utterly dye
So he that vsyth co^dycyons verteous
Though that his ancestors were vycyous
Ought not to be dyspraysyd therefore
But ought to be honoryd and praysyd the more

K yet me thynkyth more honor should be gyffyn
To him which is of noble blood and kyn

P Then if thou wylt look honored to be
Be cause of thy blod then mark well and see
The vylyst beggar that goth by the door
Had ye not both one god and creature
ye came of one furst stok and progenye
Both of adam and eve ye will not deny
The beggar and thou were both do wtles
Lonseyuyd and born infylth and uncleanness
Thy blood and the beggars of one color be
Thou art as apt to take seknes as he
if thou be in the body woundyd
Thy flessh is as ill as his to be helyd
Alas I have known many or this
So proud of their birth that all theyrlyffys
would gyf them to no labor nor lernyng
which brought them to miserable endyng
That in pouerte wrechydly did dye
Or fallyn to theft and hangyd therefore full hye
So I sey vertew and good co^dycyons than
Is that which makyth the very gentylman
And though the fadyr may bequeth to his son
Hyts riches his land and his possess yon
yet may he nothyr gyf nor vequeth
Unto him in no wise after his death
His vertew nor his gentyl co^dyeyons
They can not descend as other possessions
And if thou wylt be a gentylman nedys
Thou must than use vertew and gentle dedys

K Why desire men then praise evermore
Of the actis of their ancestors done before

P One cause there of is for lak of lernyng
They perseyue not the reason of the thing
Another is be cause there be many
That call them self gentylmen unworthy
which life voluptuously and bestyall
And do no good in the world at all
But lyse in pride sloth and vnthrystynes
And be cause they have no manner goodness
Nor properte nor vertew in them where by
Any man should thynk them any praise worthy
Therefore they seek for co^mendacyon
Of the acts that their ancestors have done

M Then Imeruell men desire to be called
Of the blood of them that excellyd
In worldly honor as kings and emperors
where some were tyrants some were co^querours
And few desire to be called of their blod
which have been called Just me^ verteous and good
And vsyd indifferent Justice and equity
Mekenes abstynens or wylfull pouerte

P if I should tell the the verey cause true
It is because they love no such vertew
which vertew and gentle co^dycyons should be
Longyng to gentylmen of properte

K If gentyl co^dycyons be the cause lo
Tken will I compare with both you two
For I have vsyd ever gentle manner
And so have mine ancestors that before were
For fursto: all when this world began
Long after there were but few people than
Men had suffycyent of every thing
with out great labor for fode and clothyng
All thing was in co^myn among them doutles
But after ward when people did increse
Ich man to increse his pleasure and volupte
Of goods and lands desired properte
wereof great sttyf and debate did arise
The^ such as mie au^cestours were that werewyse
Did studi to make laws how the people might be
Lyssyng to gedyr in pease and unity
And agayns enmiys alwey defendyd
The people that tyllyd the ground and laboryd
The people pseyuyng than their goodness
Their great wit dyscressyon and gentylnes
were content to gyfe them pert of the proffet
Coming of their lands which they did get
As corn catell and such thynes as they wan
But after when that coin of money began
They chau^gid those seuenuse and were content
To gyfe them in money an a^nyell rent
So for their good and vetteous co^dycyons
They came furst to lands and possessions
So possessions began and were furst found
Upon a good and reasonable ground

P By gogges sweet body thou lie falsely
All possessions began turst of tyranny
For when people began furst to encrese
Some gafe them self all to Idylnes
And would not labor but take by vyolence
That other men gat by labor and dylygence
Than they that labouryd were feign to gyfe
Them pert of their gettinges in peace of life
Or else for their landis money a porcyon
So possessions began by extorcyon
And when such extorsyoners had oppressyd
The labouryng people than they ordeynyd
And made laws marvelous strayte and hard
That their heirs might enjoy it afterward
So the law of inhetyaunce was furst begone
which is a thing agayns all good reason
That any inherytaunce in the world should be

K That is a shameful opinion semyth me
For when I have labouryd and by great study
Gat and purcheysyd landys truly
It is good reason that I have lyberte
To gyfe those landis to whom it lyketh me
Or else to let them descend lynyyally
To my child or cosyn of my blod most nigh
For inherytaunce must nedys be a good thing
Because so much good thereof is procedyng
Every man to his blod such love does bear
Because the land shall descend to his heir
Be will byld thereon and the land improw
And make corn and grass to encrese and grow
Graft fruit set trecs and norysh timber
And to incresse fyssh make pondys with water
Stok busshis and wedes which dystroy herbage
And all baren ground bring to tyllage
And amend the hye ways that be there about
And do many other good dedis no dowt
For the profet of his heyrys that shall be
And for the co^myn wealth of his country
which things surely he would never intend
if the land should not to his heir descend

P By thy reason no nothyr thing is meant
But a good deed upon an yuell intent
when men for love or pride do such good dedis
The dyuell therefore shall quyt the^ their medys

K whyder god or the devil quyt them therefore
Is now to our purpose never the more
For their minds and intentes no man can tell
But touching in herytaunce this I wot well
Much good co^myth thereof and dayli does grow

P Nay much Ill co^myth thereof I shall prove how
For these men that be of great possessions
Unto their blod have such affeccyons
If any land like them that lies nigh them
Of their pore neghbors they will distroy them
Or by extort meanys they will them compel
The land for half the worth to them to sell
And when they lake money they will alwey
Ever borow and never wyllyng to pay
And when they shall dye ye see the experience
Few of them have remors of co^syens
To make any manner restytucyon
Of any land so wrongfully gotton

K Thou have spoke fore agayns gentylmen
But what seyst thou of marchaundes then

P Many be good and worshipful also
And many charitable dedis they do
Byld churchys and amend the hye ways
Make almys howsys and help many decays
But some be couerous and full falsely
Get their good is by dysseyt and usury
And when they have a.M. li. in their cofers
They will rathyr suffer their neyghbers
To sterue for hunger and cold and to dye
Or they will gyfe to help them a penny
And yet more over when any of them be
Promotyd to rule or auctoryte
They dysdayn all lernyng law and reason
And Judge all by will and affection

M Thou art but a rayler to speak so sore
Again gentylmen and merchants evermore
Be not plowmen and other that dryfe the cart
And such rusticall felows as thou art
Falls shrews and life as vycyously also
As gentylmen of lands and merchants do

K yes this vylleyn carters almost echon
Have another co^scyens nor devotion
For brybe and stele every thing they will
If they may secretly come theruntyll
And as for prayer and dyuyne service
They love them in no manner wise
Nor neuyr would labor nor work do
If need of lyffyng drofe them not thereto

P yet gentylmen and the rych merchants that be
Use much more vice and iniquyte

M why thynkyst all merchants and gentylmen naught

P Nay I sey not so that is not my thought
I am not yet so folysh nor so mad
For I know many good though some be bad
yet some will suffer his dettes unpaid to be
And dye and Ieoperd his soul rather than he
wyil any of his lands mynysh and empayre
That should after his death come to his heir
And some of them so proud be of their blod
And use small vertew and do little good
But gyfe all their myndys and their study
To opprese the pore people by tyrrany
And some of them thynk this for a surete
It is the most honor to them that can be
To the able for to do extorcyon
And to mayntayn it without punycyon

K By goggrs swet bodi thou art a stark knave
Noble men and gentylmen so to deprave

P what thou proud horeso^ fool who^ do thou knave
I trow thou woldist a good blow or two have
with a good whypstoke to tech the curtesy

K Auant beggarly knave I the defye

P what wylt thou wage battle by and by now
That shall I prove straight I make god auowe
Et hic verberat eos
M Keep the peace masters hold your ha^dys for shame
To make this besynes ye be gretely to blame
ye will dysturb all this hole company

P Nay mary it is a cause to make them merry
To walk such a proud fool is but sport and ga^e

K By cokkys body were not for wordly shame
I should cut thy flesh or else see thy heart blood

M Sir hold your to^g your wordis be nothing good
we lose here with this lewyd altereacyon
Much good pastyme and recreacyon

P why what better pastyme her can thou have
Then to here one to call an other knave
And see such a proud fool walked with a whyp

M But I love it not therefore of felyshyp
Leave this brablyng and with good argument
Try the matter that is nost co^uenyent

P Nay I will try it how so ever he will
Be it with wordys or deeds I will answer him still
For be god if he will not be content
To be co^cludyd by good argument
I will co^clud him one way or that I goo
Or I shall prove it on his pate that shall I do

K Thou spekyst lyk a clerk that has lyttyll wit
when a case is put if he can not soil it
By no manner reason that he can ley
Then will he answer him this wise and sey
Beware what ye sey sir now I advise you
for it is treason or herysy that ye spek now
To thentent to rebuke him opynly
Before the vnlernyd people that stand thereby
And if he can no color of such thing find
Then will he vex and chafe in his mind
And cast out some lewd words of quarelyng
To torn the hole matter to chydyng and fyghtyng
And so do thou now like one that were mad

P Nay I would thou knewist thou folysh lad
I am another mad nor dronken yet
For mine oppynyon I have well prouyd it
By substancyall reason and argument
That enherytaunce is not conuenyent
And showed better reasons than thou can do

K Nay thy reasons may soon be answered unto
For god defend that estates of enherytaunce
Should be dystroyed for by that good ordinance
Gentylmen of lands vndoutydly
Bring up their children full honorably
Some put to the scole to learn co^nynge
To instruct the people in virtuous living
Some made to be actyfe in marcyall deeds
Able to defend the land when need is
And the rustycall people that have no land
Such things be not able to take in hand
wherefore if we should dystroy enherytaunce
we should destroy all good rule and ordinance

P But such men as have great rentes and lands
And no estate but term of their lyuys
And every thing thereon will norysh and save
For the great zele and love that they only have
To the co^myn wealth of their country
And for god sake lo these people be they
That be worthy to have possessions
And such people of virtuous condycyons
And no another should be chosyn governors
and they should have lands to maintain their honors
Term of their lyuys as long as they take pain
For the co^myn wealth this is good reason plain
So that noman owght to have any land
But such as be apt and have charge in hand
For the co^myn wealth as pryncys and rulers
Bysshoppes curates prechers and techers
Iugges mynysters and other officers
That of the co^myn wealth be executers
And valyant men of the chyualry
That be bound to defend the people daily
Such men as be apt to all such things
Should have lands to maintain their lyffynges
So enherytaunce is not besemynge
To let them have lands that ca^ do no such thing
Nor I thynk it not reasonable another
One man to life by labor of an another
For ych man is borne to labor truly
As a bird is to fle naturally
Nor a man ought not to have such lyberte
To lefe lands to his child where by that he
Shall lust for to life in sloth and gloteny
Compellyd to do naught but life voluptuously

M There is always good remedy for that
That is to compel them to do some what
So that ych man having enherytaunce
Have some auctoryce and governance
wherein he should take pain and besynes
To coustrayn him to eschew Idelnes

P Then this great myschef should follow of hit
Often times they should rule that have lyttyll wit
Or disposyd to be proud and covetous
Or to life after their lustis voluptuous
which if such men had auctoryte
Many things no dowte mys orderyd should be
where Justice should be / there would be tyranny
where peace should be war debat and envy
So there is no good reason that I can se
To prove that any enherytaunce should be

K yes that shall I prove by good auctoryte
For read in the bible and thou shall therein see
God said to abraham tibi dabo
Terram hanc et semine tuo
which is as much to say to expound yt true
I shall gyfe this land to the and thyn yssew
Here is a good prove that it was gods will.
That Abraham and his blood should continue still
As possessyoners and have the governance
Of that land as their propre enherytaunce

P Thou answerest me now even like a fool
As some of these fond clerks that go to scole
when one puts of them a subtle questyon
Of phylozophy to be provide by reason
when they have all their wits and reason spend
And can not tell how their part to defend
Than they will aledge some auctoryte
Of the laws or else of deuynite
which in no wise men may deny
And yet ye know well that of phylozophy
The pryncyples often contraryant be
Unto the very grounds of deuynite
For the phylozophers agree here unto
Quod mu^dus fuit semper ab eterno
And deuynys quod in principio oim
Creauit deus terram et celum
But thou dydest promise openly even now
Only by natural reason to prove how
That enherytaunce ought for to be had

M By gogges body syrs I hold you both mad
ye be like some woman that I know well
when they would any matter unto a man tell
They will tell.xx. talys by the way
Nothing to purpose to the matter that they
Did furst intend to tell and declare
And in like manner now both ye do fare
For ye dyspute now whytheyr enherytaunce
Be a reasonable thing or a good ordinance
which is a matter no thing perteynyng
To the questyon mouyd at the begynnying
For the questyon was which of us all three
Coud prove himself most gentylman to be

K As touching that we have all spoke and said
Ich man for his pert as much as can be said

P Nay I have yet reasons last whereby I can
prove my self of us all most gentylman
That another of you both can void by reason

M If thou have ought else to say now speak on

P Then to you both answer me this short clause
Is not ge^tyll co^dycyons the most pri^cypall cause
To make one to be a gentylman

K Paraduenture it may be so what than
peradventure quoth a
Nay I shall prove that by examples many on
For musyke makyth one a musycyon
Gra^mer to be good gram^areon
And also geomytry a godd geometryeyon
And chorlysh condycyons a chorle for to be
And so of every other estate and degree
And where gentle condycyons be doutles
In any person there is gentyllnes
Than as vertew makyth a good man
So gentyl condycyons a gentylman

M All those points I thynk must nedys grau^tyd be
what arguyst more therot forth let us see

P How seyst than to pride wrath and e^nuy

K They be naught and evil I thynk verily

P what is mekenes pacyens and charity

K Euerychone a gentle and good properte

P what is covetous and lyberalyte

K The furst good the other naught for surete

P what is gloteny sloth and lechery

K They be naught all who can that deny

P what abstynens good besynes and chastyte

K Uerteous and gentle propertees they be

P Sith ye have grau^ytyd this I shall prove plain
I am a gentylman so is none of your ^^ayn
Furst for pride your rayme^t shewyth what ye be
L. i.
For ye will never be content except that ye
Have the fynest cloth and sylke for to were
Of oryent colors and all your gere
So costly / your housys gylt gloryously
As though ye would therein your self deyfy
ye covet evermore goods lands and rent
what so ever ye get yet never content
wrathful ye be mouyd to anger anon
And enuyous dysdaynyng every man
And as for me I am content alwey
with a pore cotage and simple array
I dysdayn no man and yet pacyently
Can suffer to be called knave and not angry
Sometime I call him knave again in have
And when I have said my anger is past
ye have your beddys so pleasant and soft
wherein ye ease your self to long and to often
which makyth your bodies so tender to be
that ye can not endure labor like me
with no manner course fode ye will be feed
But with pleasand wynys and most whytest bread
with flesh and fysh most dylycate and fat
All fruits and spyces that can be gat
And when ye have had such pleasant refeccyons
To aswage your carnal insurreccyons
what so ever she be wife wedow or maid
If she come in the way she shall be assayd

M Thou lie skla^derours chorle for I think of troth
Thou vsyst sych vyse more then we both

P Nay by cokkes body I use no sych life
For I am content with blak maud my wife
Trow ye yt I care for these nise proud pri^mys
These pai^tyd popagays that hold up their chynnes
And look so smoterly as who say they would
Have every man woo them that does them behold
Tote man for all sych venereall werk
As good is the foul as the fair in the derk

K Thou say true / drafe is good Enough for swyne

P yet thou answerest to no reason of mine

K Thy reasons all right well answer I can
For I sey it be comes a noble man
To have rych apperell and clothyng
And goodly housys of costly byldyng
And that ych man according to his degree
Be knowyn from other and what they be
For if such costly things were not made
work for pore people coud never be hade
And many folks than should fall to Idylnes
which is the mother of vice and wretchydnes

P ye but I delight no such vanytese worldly
I delight another in sloth nor gloteny
I dyg and delfe and labor for my lyvyng
Never ydyll but somewhat ever doing
Daily I ren and go bear sweet and swynk
I ete broun bread and drynk small drynk
Content with course meat what so ever it be
so it quench the hunger it suffysyth me
These points I use which I have rehersyd now
Be not these gentyl condycyons I pray you

M If thou use them need compellyth the thereto
For if thou coudist hardli thou would other wise do

P what I would do then ye can not tell
It is not to purpose but this I wot well
Sith that I use my life in such good manner
whyth such gentle condycyons exp^ssyd here
More than ye both do still contynuyng
And sith that gentle condycyons is the thing
To make a gentylman the cause pryncypall
wherein I use my life most of us all
who can by any reason deny than
But that I am of us all most gentylman

K In feyth if thou be gentylman therefore
Thou art a gentylman agaynt thy will full sore

M Sith I se he sta^dyth in his own co^sait so well
That opinion we shall never expel
From him by no argument nor reason
Therefore now for a little season
Let us depert from him I hold it best
Then we shall have with him some rest

K I agree thereto for caton says this
Contra verbosas noli cotendere verbis
Contend nor argu never in no matter
with him that is full of words and clatter

M wherefore for a season let us both depert

K I am agreid thereto with all mine heart

P why sirs than will ye depert and be gone

M ye that we will farewell for a season
For to tarry here longer we see no great cause
Et exeant Then fare ye well as wise as two dawys
And I pray god send you such grace both twayn
To be stark cockcoldes or ye come again
Now masters they be both gone away
Therefore one word now hark what I sey
we see well now by plain experience
when a man is set in a wyllfull credens
All to fortefye his own opinion
If god him self than would with him reason
In effect it shall no more avail
Than with a whyp to dryfe a snayle
Therefore no remedy is that I can see
For yuell men that be in auctoryte
But let them alone till god will send
A time till our governors may intend
of all enormytes the reformacyon
And bring in their handis the rod of coreccyon
And the reformyng of iniuryes them self see
And will say p^cysely thus it shall be
For exortacyons techyng and p^chyng
Gestyng and raylyng they mend no thing
For the amendment of the world is not in me
Nor all the great arguments that we three
Have made sith we resonyd here to gedyr
Do not p^uayle the weight of a fether
For the helpyng of any thing that is amys
we can not help it then sith it so is
I will let the world wagg and home will I goo
And dryf the plowgh as I was wont to do
And pray god send us peace I will no far mell
Therefore masters all now fare ye well
Hic miles and mercator iterum intrant
K Now by my troth I am glad that is he gone

M And so am I by sweet saint John
I hard not a chorll this seuyn year
Show so cursed reasons as he has done here
For the mayntenaunce of his oppynyon
yet he his desseuyd for all his reason
For it is necessary that rulers be
To have posseyons to mayntayn their degree
And those few to dryfe the multitude all
of the other people to labor to fall
For if the rulers drof them not thereto
The people would be ydyll and nothing do
And most reason is that governance
Should come to such rulers by inherytaunce
Rather than to have them chose by eleccyon
Often tymys by dread mede and affection
Men of evil conscyens that great tyraunts be
Read old cronyclys the prove ye shall see
And though they have great wit and lernyng
Yet so proud they be thereof they fere nothing
Another god nor man but evermore still
with out council or advise follow their own will
But they that by inherytaunce rulers be
Though they have no great lernyng yet we see
yet makyth them more ferefull and better content
To follow wise men's council and aduysement
And sith that yt has been so long co^tynned
Enherytours to have rule and so long usyd
And that they have ruled by as dyscressyon
As the other that have be chose by eleccyon
If that order of rule by succession of blood
Should be dystroyd it should do hurt and no good

M That reason is so great no man can debarr
Nevertheless that churllysh knave that carter
After his fond oppynyon thynkyth thus
Himself more gentylman than us

K And therein he lies for by expiens we see
That gentyl co^dycyons most com^enly be
In them that be of noble blood borne
For take.xx. carters which never were beforne
Aquayntyd let them be to gyder
Take.xx. straynge gentylmen in like manner
These churlysh carters I dare well say
will not agree to gyder skant one day
with out chydyng quarrellyng or fyghtyng
ychone will stele from other and be pykyng
And strife which of them at the skot shall pay lest
And indeuer them who can play the knave best
But these gentylmen I warant you will study
who can show to other most curtesy
And of their gentylnes will pfer to pay
For the other and show what pleasurs they may
So touching gentylnes I say surely
Men of great birth use it most com^ynly

M There can be no truer saying nor sentence
And the cause thereof we see by expience
For these pore wretches that have no thing
Must be nygardys churlyth and spayryng
But gentylmen be taught to be lyberall
And so they may be for they have where with all

K And as touching noblenes that argument
which the plowman made late puyth euydent
That gentylmen borne to land must nedys be
For suffyency of most nobylyte
For beside goddys gyfts of grace and of nature
As wit and bodily stryngh yet they be sure
Of other riches as of land and rent
To avoid need so they be more suffycyent
of them self than other pore people doutles
Then if need of strange help cause wrechydnes
And suffysauns be cause wrechydnes

M A better reason no man can deuyse
And yet farther I thynk likewise
He that has great haboundance of riches
May use lyberalyte and gentylnes
And also it is ever necessary
That some life in wealth and some in mysery
And let churllys babble and say what they will
Hit has been so ever and will be so still
For it is almighty goddys purueaunce
wise men of folys to have the governance
And they that rule well I beseech Ihesu
Send them good life and long to contynew

Amen.
The Philosopher
ye soferayns all dyscrete and excellent
Before whom this dyalog showed has be
Touching iii. points by wey of argument
Furst what is gentylnes and what nobylyte
And who should be chose to hye auctoryte
This questyons they be so hye and sottell
Few dare p^sume to dyffyne them well
Yet I thynk now under your coreccyons
The thing that makyth a gentylman to be
is but vertew and gentle condycyons
which as well in pore men often tymys we se
As in men of great birth of hye degree
And also vycious churlyssh co^dycyons
May be in men born to great possessions
And forther as touching nobylyte
yet standyth much pert I thynk doutles
An suffycyencye reason does agree
But that suffysaunce making noblenes
Must nedys he a^nexid unto goodness
For suffysauns is not the cause pryncypall
That god his noble but his goodness wythall
So virtue is ever the thing pryncypall
That gentylnes and noblenes does ensue
Then these hedys rulers and governors all
Should come thereto be cause of their virtue
And in auctoryte they ought not continue
Except they be good men dyscrete and wise
And have a love and zele unto Justice
wherefore souereyns all that here present be
Now mark well these reasons here brought in
Both agayns men of hye and of low degree
For this intent only to rebuke syn
For the best wey that is for one to begin
To convert the people by exortacyon
is to persuade them by natural reason
For when that a man by his own reason
Iuggyth himself for to offend
That grudgyth his co^scyens and gyffyth co^puncyon
Into his heart to cause him amend
But such blind bestes that will not intend
To here no good council nor reason
Ought by thee law to have sharp coreccyon
But then if the laws be not suffycyent
which have be made and ordeynyd before
To gyfe there fore co^dygne ponyshment
The pryncys and governors be bound evermore
To cause new laws to be made therefore
And to put such men in auctocyte
That good men Just and indyfferent be
But because that men of nature evermore
Be frail and following sensualyte
yt is impossyble in a manner therefore
For any gouernouss that be in auctoryte
At all tymys Just and indyfferent to be
Except these be brydelyd and thereto compellyd
By some strayt laws for them deuysyd
As thus that no man such rome ocupye
But certain yerys and than to be removed
yet that while bound to attend dylygently
And if he offend and surely prouyd
with out any favor that he be ponyhysshyd
For the ponysshment of a Judge or offycer
Does more good than of thousand other
And until that such orders be deuysyd
Substauncyally / and put in execucyon
Look never to see the world amended
Nor of the great myschefes the reformacion
But they that be bound to see the things done
I pray god of his grace put in their myndys
To reform shortly such things amys
And though that I my self now prase
Thus mine oppynyon have publysshed
Or any of my fellows hare in this place
In any point here have us abused
we beseech you to hold us excused
And so the auctour hereof requires you all
And thus I commit you to god eternal.
AMEN.
Iohe^s rastell me fieri fecit
Cum priuilegio regali.
