The lamentable spoil of Teuerton.
YT is not unknown to many, and chiefly to English Merchants that the Town of
Teuerton, in Deuon-shire, about Ten miles on this side Exceter, was the chief
Market for Cloth, that is in all the West parts of England: pleasantlye situate
upon the clear running River of Exe: garnished with many costlye and goodly
buildinges, inhabited with diverse rich and wealthy Merchants: and so well
peopled, as no other Town (of the same bigness) in all those quarters, could
compare therewith: And by reason of ye Market kept therein every Monday for
Cloth, and other commodities, it was greatly frequented of all the country
people near adjoining, especially of Clothiers and such other persons as had
any dealinges therein: where they were sure of sale, and to have present money
for their commodities were it never so much, where always before dinner, they
had their Coin truly paid, which was no small benefit to all the poor men
of the West parts, as Weauers, and Tuckers and such like. But such is the
mutabillite of fortune, and the uncertainty of our mortal state: that no man
can make assurance of that he has, nor warrant his own welfare one minute of
an hour, as by this following example, and many other the like is manifest:
For we may be well assured, that the Third day of April last, when the rich
Inhabitants of Teuerton rose in the morning: Nay, when they were in the Market
at Noone, they little thought that before night their wealth should have been
turned into such want: but now behold a thing more wonderful: he which at one
a clock was worth five Thousand Pound, and as the Prophet says, drunk his
wine in bowls of fine Silver plate, had not by two a Clock so much as a
wooden dish left to eat his meat in, nor a house to cover his sorrowful
head, neither did this happen to one man alone, but to many other, being
neither in danger of the cruelty of wars, nor on the Seas, where they might
fear the fury of waters.

But when they thought themselves secure, and far from any imynent perrill,
in prime of the bright day, not when their Town was empty, but when their
streets swarmed with store of people, not when they were a sleep or naked in
their b^ds, when they could not shift for themselves: but when they were awake,
apparelled and fit for any business; Lo then (I say) suddenly, as it were in a
twinkling of an eye, came that great grief upon them, which turned their
wealth to miserable want, and their riches to unlooked for poverty: and how was
that? mary sir by Fire.

But no fire from Heaven, no unquenchable fire, such as worthily fell on the
sinful City of Sodom and Gomora: but a silly flash of fire, blazing forth
of a frying pan, the circumstance whereof I will briefly show you.

The fire first began at the West end of the Town, on the fardest side of the
said fair River, about one a clock in the after noone, in the very prime,
and chief of the Market, when people were most busiest in the sale of their
commodities. For there was dwelling in a little low thatched house a poor
beggarly woman, who had got a companion fit for her purpose, I mean an other
woman of the like condition. And they together went to bake pan-cakes with
straw: for their abillitie and provision was so good, that there was no wood
in the house to do it. And as they were busy about their cookerie, suddenly
the fire got into the Pan, which also caught present hold on the straw lying
hard by, by means whereof the house being very low, was by the high blaze of
the straw fiered in the very roof, which by the force of an extreme high
wind which blew strongly in ye West, kindled with such vehemency, that their
was no help for the same, the fire whereof took hold of a certain bay-house
near adjoining, and from thence it pass to the Town milles. The wind
blowing still fiercely did drive the fire into the Town, and by this means in
less then half an hour the whole Town was set on fire, and after burnt:
except the Church and Courthouse, which sometime belonged to the Earl of
Deuon-shire.

But mark what followed: men would have thought, that upon a Market day, when
every street was so well replenishe with people, from all parts, there had been
help enough quickly to have quenched the flambe thereof, having also the
commodity of a river near adjoining: But yt came not so to pass: for they
had neither books, nor buckets fit for such service, which all other wise and
discreet Citizens do politiequely provide against such casualties, which
might have been a means of their preservation.

Notwithstanding, it is said that the chief of the town had often been in
hand, to make such provision: but never brought it to effect, for howsoever it
was well motioned, it was ill remembered, the want whereof they now felt to
their great sorrow and cost: for whether it were covetousness, or necligence,
or both: which in these days is the cause of great evil, it is certain they
were destitute of such engines, the miss whereof when they found, then all too
late they bewailed their approned folly: which was undoubtedly Gods just
Judgment for their iniquities: by the which let all other Towns take example.

Whereby we may gather, it is not in man's power to prevent with strength of
hand, the least plague which ye Lord does purpose to bring on any place. For
you shall understand that all that day the wind being at West-South-west, and
blowing extreme hard, the power thereof was so great, high, and vehement, that
it inforest the kindled flambe to rise most fiercely beating the same toward
the Town in most outrageous sort; so that, by the time the people with all
expedition hadd gathered unto that place to quench the fury thereof, behold
ere they wist the fire had taken hold in the Principal place of the Town,
and by that time they came back again and got thither, they perceived other
houses to burn in like manner: so that while many were busy in helping their
neighbors, their own houses was in as ill a case.

Then began the cry to grow most grievous in every part of the Town, the
mighty wind still increasing the fury of the enraged fire: here stood one
man crying for help, there another, another, and another: wringing their hands
and making great lamentation: more and more the number increased, insomuch that
the people were so amazed, they knew not which way to turn, nor where the most
need was.

The fire increased so fast, grew so vehement, and spread so far, that at last
there was about 400 houses on fire at once, so that every man was glad to shift
for himself, and so nere as he could to save his own life, but all in vain,
for he which even now rested in hope, his house should escape the danger, in
the turning of a hand, had all on fire about his cares, the wind beating the
flambe in their faces: all which came still so suddenly, that there was no
remedy to be had for the same.

Most dreadful was the noise which was then heard in every corner and street
of the Town, women pitiously screeking, maidens bitterly crying, and children
roaring out of measure, the mother running to save her children, the husband
for the wife, neighbor, calling for neighbor, friend, for friend, while they
were beaten out of the town with raging flames of fire. For so extreme, and
outrageous did the fire pass from house to house, there was no loking to save
their goods: no way to preserve them from destruction, for all the Cloth in the
market, wares in their shops, goods and household stuff, money, plate, apparel
and bedding, yea all was burnt and nothing saved: and which is more to be
lamented, diverse townsmen did hazard themselves so far within the danger of
the fire, to save some part of their goods, that they never returned back
again, but were there most pitiously burned to death, and consumed to ashes:
Diverse of them being of the best men in the Town: Many children and other
feeble persons was burnt in the houses, yea horses and other Cattle in stables
and back places, with all their corn and victual.

Among the rest there was an old blind man burnt, named Nicholas Hartnell whom
his friends hadd brought forth of his bed, and laid him for his better
saftie in the Market house, but while they were making shift for themselves in
some other sort, before they could return again, the poor man was by fire
turned into ashes:

There was in like manner one Lawd and his wife, which were found lying in the
street arm in arm burnt to death, but not quite consumed: At what time there
was found lying between them five Pound in Gold, with the which as it seemed
they sought to fly away: But being smothered by the smoke and and fires flame,
they had their passage wofullye stayed: there was found the sculles and bones
of many more.

Likewise one Beeres wife a woman of good reputation, was burnt in ye street:
And also one widow Prouse before she could get out of her own doors suffered
the like tormenting death.

Then well apayd was that man, that had ye benefit to keep himself and his
family from danger: so that for the have they made to get away into the
fields, they ouerthrewe and tumbled down one another in their passage forth.

The Tyles by the beat of the fire, flew cracking from the houses, like as it
had been a company of wel-charged Muskets rattling against some sconce: And
again to hear the houses crack, and the burned timber fall down with might
and maine, made the very hearts of the people to shake for fear. When in
short space after, they saw whole houses tumbling to the ground, after they
had a while stood tottering too and fro with the mighty blastes of the
South-west wind.

At what time it was hard to say, whether their sorrow, or fear was greatest,
when they beheld their goods burnt to ashes and heard the thundering noise
of the falling houses, which caused ye firm earth to quake and tremble under
their feet.

Truly whosoever does enter into consideration hereof, must needs
acknowledge, their case to be most lamentable, and their sorrow unspeakable,
during the time of this terrible fire: the rage whereof lasted not above one
hour and a half, and yet in that small space, had it burnt to ashes, (as I
said before) above the number of Four Hundred houses: most of them belonging
to the wealthiest men in the Town, with all the goods that were in them, so
that all the substantial townsmen, were constrained to lie in the fields with
their woeful wives and children, and to lodge themselves on the cold ground,
that in the morning had choice of beds to go unto: such was their sudden
wrack, and hard fortune.

Therefore it is a vain thing to trust in the uncertainty of worldly riches
which being gotten with travel, and kept with care, is notwithstanding sone
lost, being in hazard of a Thousand dangers. And therefore most happy and
blessed are they, which according to the counsel of the holy Ghost, do lay
up their treasure in Heaven, where it can perish by no perrill, that can
happen, but does ever remain safe in the sure keeping of the Lord God of
hoastes.

Before the fire was fully ended, and diligent search made there was found
lacking as it is very credibly reported an Hundred persons or there-about, of
the which number (as I have already mentioned) diverse were found dead in ye
streets, shoppes and houses, I mean in the place where shopps, and houses late
before stood.

The residue of the woeful people remaining yet alive being over, burdened with
extredme sorrow, runs up and down the fields like distraught and framick men,
being driven (as before is mentioned) to shroud themselves under trees and
hedges, lying on the bare ground: moreover they are so greatly distressed for
lack of food, that they seem to each manns sight more liker Spirits and
Ghostes then living creatures: Likewise it is by wise men verilye thought that
the losses of this Town, will not be recovered again, under Three or Four
hundred Thousand Pounds.

But you shall understand, that notwithstanding all the force of this
consuming fire, there is yet some Twenty houses preserved, the dwellings of
poor and silly men: And certain alms houses, which is a most rare and
strange thing: For as diverse Merchants of this City is creadibly certified by
letters, that the fire inuiornd those silly Cottages on every side, burning
other houses to the ground which stood about them, and yet had they no hurt at
all.

Surely if we should enter into consideration hereof, we could not choose but
confess, that this was the only work of God, to make his power manifest to
men, as he did in delyuering the Three children out of the fiery furnace,
even so did be preserve those poor persons with their houses and goods, for
some special cause best known to himself according to that holy canticle
sung by the blessed Virgin Marie: he has filled the hungry with good things,
but the rich he sent emtie away.

It is said of some yt this was a just punishment of god brought upon that
Town, for their unmercifulness, and small regard of the poor, which were
daily seen to dye and perish in their streets for lack of relief: poor
Lazarus lay unregarded at the rich man's gate, and could not get one little
morsel of meat to cherish his hungry heart: therefore (if it were so) yt was
the just judgment of God, that they which through covetousness would not part
from any thing, should suddenly lose all: For there was not so much as one
piece of Timber left, of all those Four Hundred houses, but all were consumed
to ashes, except some few chimneys, and stone walls which are monuments of
the Towns ruin.

Whereby it is come to pass, that those rich Marchantes, that erst scornd to
grace a poor ma^s house with his presence, is now glade to request their
favor for the worst corner in their Cottage, where they may remain in this
their misery: which may be a good warning for all other men of the like
abillitie, how they contemn and despise the poor members of Christ houlding
them in disdain, whom God has oppressed with poverty.

O famous London, thou that flowest in wealth, and aboundest in Riches: Thou
which art the chief Lady-cittie of this Land, whose fame sounds through al
Christian Kingdoms, cast thy clear eyes on this ruinous Town: consider her
fall, and pity her distress, learn by her calamity to look into thy self,
examine thy conscience and see whether thou have deserved the like plague or
no: give thou example of true contricion, and as thou art chief in glory, be
thou chief in grace, that god may long and many years vphould thy prosperous
estate,

Yea let all the goodly Cities and Towns, which beautifies the Western plat
of this flourishing Island, look upon their woeful Sister Teuerton, who lately
did brave it with the best, and thought her self nothing inferior to the
fairest: But now she sittes clad in mournful weeds, having her fair head
covered with pale ashes, her bravery converted to beggerie, her glory to
disgrace, and all her mirth into moan: so that their is nothing seen but
lamentation and complaint. Oh Teuerton well may thy friends cry over thee (as
sometime great Kings did over Babylon) saying, alas alas for that proper
Town of Teuerton, that wealthy and rich Town, for at one hour is thy
Judgment come: thy Merchants may now weep and morn, for no man buyeth ware in
thee any more.

Consider this thou fair City of Exceter, thou which art next neighbor to
this distressed Town, which have (as it were) the smoke of her fire, yet before
thy face, and her lamentations tynging loud in thy cares; pit her heavy
hap, that know not what misery hanges over thy own head.

And let me speak to thee, thou Town of Plymouth, whose stately buildinges
ouer-peareth the hills, easting their prospects upon the mounting waves: take
warning by Teuerton and turn thy many vices into virtues, least God turn from
thee his great and mighty blessings.

Sin is the cause of many sorrows: and vngoblinesse ye groundwork of all
intolerable grief: yet if we should think, that the people of Teuerton
were the greatest transgressors, because they have suffered the greatest
punishment, of any town in the West: we should think much amiss: For as our
Sauoiour Christ said unto the Jews, suppose not that those on whom the Tower
of Silo fell, were greater sinners then the rest, but except you repent, you
shall likewise perish. So say I to you and al other Cities and Towns in
England, think not that the Inhabitants of Teuerton did surpass all other in
wickedness, because they exceed all other in woe: but it has pleased God to
punish the^ for your instruction, that behoulding their fall you may fear to
offend, and learn by their misery, your own speedy amendment. For what is
he which passes by this Town, and ^a^st knew the flourishing state thereof,
seeing now her lamentable spoil: but many be provoked to cry with Jeremy,
and say of Teuerton, as he spoke of Jerusalem: Alas^e, how desolate sits
this town, that sometime was full of people? how is she become like a widow,
sorrow full, heavy, and comfortless, which lately was had in good regard, and
famous among all her familiers: she weepeth sore in the night, and her tears
run down her cheeks in great abundance.

But it is easy for all men to say this: to shake their heads, and cry alack
alack: But a hard matter to make benefit thereof, and to be warned by their
neighbors harms: Notwithstanding let all distressed people know, that
whosoever faithfully trusts in God, shall never be forsaken: well may they
sustain sorrow, but they shall not be left in misery.

The Lord that brought them low, can raise them again aloft, as it is manifest
by Iobes affliction. Therefore God grant we may take patiently those Fatherly
corrections which he lays upon us: knowing that all the miseries of this
life, is not worthy of the least joy, which is prepared in Heaven for the
souns of men: Unto the which place Christ Jesus bring us, that by his blood so
dearly bought us. Amen.

FINIS.
