second answer / touching the Church Discipline.

Isay. 62. verse. 1. For Syons sake, I will not hold my tongue, and for
Ierusalems sake, I will not rest: until the righteousness thereof break forth
as the light, and the salvation thereof be as a burning lamp.



Ibid. verse. 6. and 7. Ye that are the Lords remembrancers, keep not silence,
and give him no rest: until he repair, and set up Jerusalem the praise off
world.

Imprinted. M. D. LXXV.

To the Church off England / and all that Love the truth in yt: Thomas
Cartwright Wishes mercy / and peace / from God our Father / and from our Lord
Jesus Christ.
THe Church off God so often us scripture not compared only / but figured in
the City Jerusalem: serves for instruction / in this cause. For as in yt /
the wall first broken down / was last made up again / and that more then 14.
years after the temple builded Esr. 6. 15. Neh. 2. ^.
so is yt commenly in the spiritual wall off the church / which is the
discipline the lord appointed / as well for strenght of yt / as for houlding out
of all adversary power / whether yt be corruption off doctrine or manners. The
first is to be seen / in the Act. of thapostles: where (after the churches
gathered by preaching) there was an eldership severally placed in them) to whom
the execution of the church discipline does especially appertain. The other may
as easily appear / to him that considers the estate off the church after the
Apostles / by monuments off those times: in which allwaies as this fort off
government left by them was first suffered to decaie / so the pureness of
doctrine decreased: until the church yt self (except a few stones here and
there scattered) was browght to heaps off dust. If y^ be asked / why the
discipline having right to enter with the doctrine: finds not always / that
favor amongst men. The cause ^s apparent / that when Satan can not gain this
first point to houlde the doctrine out off a city or Kingdom: he swears
after the second / that yt may be there with smallest fruict / and shortest
continuance. Wherein let (I beseech you) be considered: his doings / against the
building off the wall off Jerusalem. For if he bestirred himself so / in
hindering that material wall: it will be les marvel / if for hinderance off
this spiritual he trudge to and fro / open his whole pack off subtilties / and
as yt is in proverb bestovv both ^vet and dry.

And first touching the persons he uses / in his fight against both: they are
not much unlike. For in steed off a bastard kind off Esr. 4. 12 Neh. 6. 1.
Israelites / Apostataes from God and his true service (which were there the
foreine enemies): we have now the Papists / who (as shall appear) he set in the
forward of this battle / against the discipline now propounded. And as now we
have within the church / which covered with the name off the gospel and off
the teachers theroff / give a more dangerous assault then the Papists: So
were there then even off the Neh. 6. 10. 17. 18. 19.
Jews them selves under gouerners and Prophets / which secretly and openly
opposed them selves. As for the practices / they are so like in both: that all
which will open their eyes / may easily epsy the same workman. For as the
enemies then placed their cheef strenght / in accusations against the church /
that if it were Esr. 4. 12 etc. Neh. 2. 19.
suffered to lay the foundacio^s of the wal it would move sedition, and
rebel against the King: even so our adversary / to arm the Prince against
this cause / sounds nothing more then rebellion / sedition / and such like.
If this were not able to discrie / or (at least) to give warning off this
unfaithful dealing: yet this may. That these are the very weapons off the
papists / which not able amongst us with so great succes to be used by them
selves as those which are known enemies: have been ministered to the D. that
being thrown owte off his hand in whose mouth is the gospel / they might be
thowght to have been made for defense / which were forged for overthrow of yt.
For where Brentius teaches / that the ministers owght not to bear dominion
over the churches like princes: Hosius accuses him / that by the same mean /
he went about to Lib. de haeres. nost. tep.
displace Caesar. And upon like occasion / that we would l. 2. de legit.
iudic. reru^ eccl.
overthrow al kingdoms and superiority: that men might do) vvat they list.
That if the Almans, had once lib. 5. de cathol. eccles.
shaken off the Pope: they would shake off, Caesar sone after. If these be
compared with diverse off the D. accusations / and namely with that page 455.
lin. 1. yt will be meruail that (onles he were in this point taught by the same
spirit Hosius was) he could iump so even / not only with the like accusation /
but almost with the same words. But this shall better appear / in discourse
off this book where is showed not only that he has the like / but the very
self same cause with the grossest Papists. I say the grossest / for that in
some points / as off the churches election and pastoral residence / there are
found off them more favorable to the trwth then he: which ioining with
Catholic writers both old / and of our time / have written against the estate
off the Popish church in that behalf.

And that no man's simplicity be abused by an owtward profession off the gospel
/ as thowgh yt were unlike that they which professed yt should be enemies to
the trwe discipline: or incredible that the same which cry out off the Tyranny
off Antechrist / should refuse the moderat and wholesome government of Christ:
yt may please them to understand that this cause has before this bydden the
assault not off the Papists alone / but even off them which make show off so
deadly war with papistry: that the greatest force of their resistance / has
been a fear either pretended / or vainly phansied / least the gyuing place to
the discipline should draw after yt the popish Tyranny. M. Cap i to unto M.
Farel in the book off M. Call. Epist
Capito a man off singular learning and godliness / affirms that it was
objected unto them which went about to restore the discipline. that they
would be Tyrans over the church which was free, and call back again a nvve
popedom. M. Upon 4. Ephesians.
Bucer: Satan goes about, that by restoring of the discipline, the faithful
Ministers should be thovvght to seek ambitously the same Tyranny, which
Antechrist did. In the life off M. Calu.
M. Beza when the Eldership and exco^municatio^ were to be instituted: there
vva^ted not which cried ovvt, that the popish tyranny was by that means
called back again: also that the magistrates office, was thereby in part
invaded. Now if these slanders be compared with the pa 299. 27. line page 459.
47. lin. item pa. 560. lin. 5. item pa. 646. li. 29. etc.
Answerers: al may understand / that althowgh / the instrments used against the
discipline vary in time and country / yet the author (misleading some by
simplicity / and thrusting other headlong throwgh covetousness or ambition) is
the same in our country / which was then in Germany / France / or Sanoy. For
that the discipline now propounded / is the same which suffered this
co^tradiction off certain professors off the Gospel / shall manifestly appear
in this discourse: and may be partly understood both by Cap^^^^ letters /
written to comfort a ministre off Geneua then Wrestling for yt / as by Bezas
words which particularly note one or two parts thereof. Nether can
disagreeme^t of the favorers thereoff / in interpretation of some place /
signification of some word / alteration off some circumstance (if any be)
hinder this: no more then diverse pictures off one face / having all the same
great and principal drawghts / can hinder us from acknowledging the same visage
in them al: albeit one be more coningly drawn then other / have more lively and
orient couloures then other / have one small line more or les then other. Onles
peradventure / men will be so unadvised / to deny the doctrine off the Gospel
to be the same professed at Geneua / at Zurick / at Witemberg: because the
professors / had in some smaller points their several Judgments.

Another principal kind off artillery / wherewith the D. leueleth at this wall
off church discipline: is ^haccusation / off Anabaptistry. This also (as may
appear) is taken from the Papists. For when the persequuting off the church
in France (where together with the doctrine this discipline was established)
was misliked off the Almanes: the French to appease them said / Calu. in his
praeface to the psames.
there were none so cruelly handled, but Anabaptists and troublesome fellows,
which would overthrow not religion only, but the whole order off the
comme^ wealth. And althowgh the D. has in this behalf travailed mightily /
and gathered (as yt were) a heap off stones to throw at us: yet for fear off
being conuincted off so manifest vntrwthes he dare not throw one / but privily
and as yt were under hand: saying / he will not accuse any, he will not
condemn any. that is: he will (forsothe) not flea us him self / but hold our
legs / while other flea us. But he shall never so escape / the iudgemement off
God. For if he were guilty / Act. 22. 20
which kept their garments that cast the stones: how much more shall he / that
put stones in their hands. althowgh / if we were such: we owght so to be
noted / that others might take heed / off such detestable heretics. All which
false surmises with diverse others of Donatism Papism puratanism. We might with
one sentence off the holy man Job / have refuted. For so are they not only
vntrw / but for the most part without al color of trwth: Job 31. 35 36.
that taking our adversaries book off accusations upon our shoulders, and
applying them unto our heads (that al might read and see them) we might as
off a crown, or robe have received commendation by them. Howbeit / because
there was some danger least the D. lofty titles / and glittering estate might
either seduce some simple ones / or utterly carry away those whose minds were
forestalled with some prejudice against the cause we maintein: I thowght good
once at large / and piece by piece / to lay forth the unworthiness of his
accusations. Now I see / there is no end of his dishonest charges: I mean not
by further answer in poursuit off his oulde / or avoiding his nwe / either weary
my self or the reader. For seeing the vntrwth off them / is in the eyes and
ears off all: why should I travail to stop his Throat / which (as an open
sepulcher off vntrw sumises) will as (seems) never with any reasonable answer
be filled up.

And that you may have a taste off his equity: note (I beseech you) his
answers unto our defense. This is well said, if unfeigned: page 33. page 55. page
33.
These glorious words are but mistes, to blind the eyes off the simple: The
Anabaptists would say the like. Verily if they say so they shall deteste them
selves / with all their wicked fantasies: and give as sound a Confession of
the trwth / as the Doctor can make any. But let us imagine him self accused off
all these points / which he surmiseth of us: I would gladly know / what he
would answer. Let him conceive his purgation as effectually / and in as good
words as he can / make all the protestations he can / offer him self to what
examination he can: how easy is yt for his adversary with the same equity he
uses toward us / to dashe al. This is well said, but it is fained: there was
never heretic, which to hide bis poison, pretended not some color off truth,
etc. And by the grace off God / we are as far / yea further also (as shall
appear) from al points off Anabaptisme / then he. But (says he) let the like
effects proceeding of like page 33.
causes, and in like manner: judge the likelihoode between the Anabaptists,
and them. Truly if he prove the causes like / the controversy is at an ^^de.
And if the search off the trwth had been his mark: here he would have begone /
where the trial is certain / and not off the effects. Which allthowgh they
be falsely surmised: yet some are such / as may ensue (albeit after another
sort) as well the preaching off the trwth / as the publishing off falsehood.

And surely if the Anabaptists / when they rose in Germany / had met with
such confuters: yt is very like / that they (now put to flight) would have
occupied the greatest part off it. But the godly mynisters / assured of a good
cawse / provoked to most solemn disputations: where all seeing their vanities /
might learn to deteste them / and them selves (made to understand their
folies) might be stricken with shame / which might bring repentance. This they
did by example off the Godly learned in times past / and off Augustine namely:
Who provoke the Donatistes and Manichies to Disputation / in the hearing off
all his church. This cause therefore if yt should not prevail / by force off
trwthe yt must gain / throwghe the indirecte means / and cowardly fight off
the Answerer: so far from procuring this trial / that he accuses me as
desirous of popular praise: because refusing his private confe^rence (as he some
where has affirmed) I only put him in mind page 354.
/ of a disputacion. Whereto also pertains / that he counts yt
Anabaptistical: that this is propounded in places where the gospel has pa.
12. 34.
been already planted. As if there were a fitter place / to propounde the
Discipline: then where the doctrine / has allredie been received. where
should the wall be fitlier made: then where the city / is before builded.
Where / the diche cast: but where the Orcheyarde / is already planted. If yt
had been preached / where was ignorance / or small knowledge of the gospel the
would have taken great advantage. for that they might so have abused the
blindness of their hears to cause them believe that which those that have their
eyes open could not be brought unto. Now they preach in places / where the
gospel was planted: he will make that also serve for a stepp / for his
accusation to clime up by. So that howsoever we behave our selves / what
commodity off circumstance soever we have: the D. has such an engine / that
he can not only cause yt not to serve for us / but also make against us. For
sure I am / no place could have been les suspected then London and Cambridge /
two off the highest hills in all the realm: from whence both the sound off
yt might be the easilest carried into all other places / and which abounding
with knowledge off the gospel / were fittest to judge off the goodness off the
cause. Wherein I doubt not / but the good hand off Gods direction / and the
example off the Apostells: have been considered. who that they might have
fuller sheues off the seed of their doctrine / preased to the chief and moother
cities / making their account / that the mother being won / the daughters
round abowte would be easilier entreated. And althowghe yt come to often to
pas / that there is some Amazias / or high priest nere the court / which uses
both his eyes to watch that none come thither / to disquiet his unlawful
possession: yet forsomuche as it is as impossible to pull the wings off the
wind that yt should not blow / or shut the windows off the heavens that they
should not rain / as to stop that trwth / which God in his holy word has
breathed / and does rain by the clouds off his mynistery: I dowbt not / but
the voice off yt is come to the highest / and shall have that fruict in time /
which God has disposed off. If yt should not: yet every faithful mynister is
detter unto his flock / 20. Act. 27.
off the whole trwth learned out off the word off God: as well for reioicing
their hearts in increase of knowledge / as that thereby they might bewail their
sins for want off yt: and forthwith be stirred to continual prayer / that
God would incline the Princes heart and off others in authority / to give yt
that defense which apperteineth.

Nether do we therefore call upon the examination off our doctrine / as thowgh
we feared least our behavior should be examined / or as if yt resembled the
Anabaptists manner of living: but that I might show / how disorderly the D.
goes to worck. For althowgh before the Lord / we (and I for my part
especially) as miserable sinners hang down our heads and cover our faces: yet
our behavior (throwgh his grace) towching that surmised of us / is such) as we
nothing fear / but with all indifferent judgment yt contains plentiful
remedy / against the sting off all such slanderous tongues. Wise Physicions /
when the desease is unknown: seek yt by owtward tokens off pulse / urine /
etc. If we had nourished any night or corner doctrine / which we whispering in
the ears of certain / would not have had come out of the doors of our
private houses: yt should have been accounted to him for wisdom / by signs and
conjectures to have inquired into our covert opinions. But now seeing we have
Fanckly and openly published our judgments and as yt were on the Fair and
Market days proclaimed them / offering them in schools / in churches / by
preaching / by writing / not only to the taste off the commen people but to the
examination of the best learned: after all this to inquire by signs and tokens
/ is to seek his adversary which stands hard by / to call for him which is
present. And yt is as if one / to know what judgment an other is of: had
rather take his mark by the color of his coat or tag of his point / then by
his speech or hand writing. And if it were / the good will off God: I would
(for this matter) he had a window / to look into our consciences. To make and
end of answer / to these surmises / whatsoever is proper either to the heresy
off Papists / Anabaptists / Donatists / or puritanes: that we utterly
condemn / unto the bottomless pit off hell. But if amongst the filth of their
herises / there may be found any good thing (as yt were a grain off good corn
in a great deal of darnell): that we willingly receive / not as theiree / but
as the Iues did the holy Arc from the Philistines / whereof they were unjust
owners. For herein yt is trw / that is said: the sheep must not lay down her
fell, becavvse August. 2. lib. Sermon. de mo^te.
she sees the wolf somtim clothed with yt. yea yt may come to pas / that the
Synaguog off Satan: may have some one thing a^ sometime / with more conuenience
/ then the trw and Catholic church off Christ. Such was the ceremony off
pouring water once only upon the child in baptism / used with us and in the
most reformed churches: which in some age / was used only by those off the
Eunomian heresy. As for the Answerer / let Sozom. 6. lib. 20 c.
him remember that the just Judge lives: before whom (if he do not speedily
repent) one day notwithstanding his gloses (I accuse none, I apply yt to none)
he must houlde up his hand / with Satan the Prince off the accusers off the
children off God: whereunto I doubt not but his own conscience is his Apparitor
/ and has given him summonce. And thus much for answer / unto the D. general
/ partly accusations and partly surmises: against the favorers / off the
church discipline now propounded.

There follow / particular charges: against the autors off the admonition / and
against me. Those against them have been answered / and the answers so far
forth as they touch the cause / are in this book maintained: saving certain
new charges. Wherein I dowbt not but they will take yt in good part / that I
use silence: seeing that some of the smaller things are such as lie not in my
knowledge / and some so manifestly vntrw / that they need not fear any credit to
be given unto them: the D. him self (as I thinck) not believing them. Of his
accusations against me / because some have eye as well to the speakers as to the
things spoken: I trust / yt shall not be grievous / if I answer something.
Especially when in this preface / beside other things: I purpose (God willing)
to Synk / nigh half his later book. For if one would make survey off reproaches
/ vntrw surmises / and false accusations / wherewith he has frawght yt: beside
a nwe lode which he has charged the second edition off his first book with: he
should (I suppose) find / nigh one half spent in those wares. Wherein he
deals with me / as certain beasts; which pursued cast forth behind them an
intolerable Cicero. ^. li. de not. deorum.
savor / thereby to affray their hunters from further chasing them. In deed /
they are very unpleasant: but the good savor off the trwth / and off honest
behavior in things he accuses me off / has (by the grace off God) so
comforted all the senses off my mind / that he has not escaped by this
policy.

Some off his accusations / touch the cause: but the most part / touch yt
not. Off this later kind one sort are off my manner of living* albeit he count
yt a childishe kind off confuting, that one should leave the cause, and take
him self to the person. Here / my ministry is diversely Page 25.
accused: as that I did not seek for the order off priesthood as it is called:
for that is that he means I should have done by oath or else departed the
College. The answer hereto is longer / then this page 799. page 709.
treatise may embrace: which I am ready to exhibit before him / to whom it
belongs: because I am provoked / I humbly desire him to receive the cause.
But in a word: yt is a mere cavil. For the meaning off the statute off the
house / is to provide that men should not turn their studies / to other
professions off law etc: but that there should be to furnish the College off a
number off preachers / off which I was one / as soon as I entered. Nether was
there any duty of mynisterie / which the College could require off me; that I
was not enabled to do according to the laws of the church off England / by
virtue off that mynisterie / which I had received. So that the law yt self (as
that whose meaning was fulfilled even with my entry) did not require yt. Also
the corruption off the law / or at the least off his interpretation (binding
men to beg a ministry and thereby after a sort to testify off them selves
that they befit for yt) might after knowledge that I owght not to beg it /
justly keep me back. By how much more / I were worthy to be condemned / if
(as he accuses) I had ambitiously desired to be the Queens majesty's
divinity reader: for which / I never Page 586.
opened lip. If I had / how knows he / I did yt ambitiously: who makes yt
lawful, to ask yt. So that onles / he know my heart: my laboring Page 48.
for it (if any had been) is justified by his divinity. The life / I answer to
an other not vnlife: that I earnestly desired, the degree Page 781.
off doctorship. Wherein beside that I moved nothing / but yielded only to the
request off certain frindes: I had (before my grace propounded in the schools)
the advice off more than a dosen learned ministers. Who considering / that I
had the office off a Doctorin the university: were off opinion / that (for the
good they esteemed might be done thereby) I might swalow the fond and idle
ceremonies / which accompany yt. His fourth is / that I page 12. page 446.
have forsaken the ministry. whereunto I answer / as I In this book pa. 154.
li. 16.
have for them whom he likewise charge. His fifth / that I my self pa. 225.
preaching before here and there where I thowght good, now condemn yt in
others: the answer whereof / is partly page 45. line 17. off his / and partly
page 41. line 20. off my book. The last / pa. 354.
that I refused his conference: which is vntrwe. For beside that I answered /
that yt was meet the doctrine I had taught openly / should be defended openly
/: and beside that also I went to two off the university Doctors / to be
conferred with: I offered my self to his private conference / which althowgh he
had promised / yet under pretense that I was (as he said) incorrigible / he
would not perform. The truth is / he offered private conference by writing: but
having before experience off his unfaithfulness many ways / I refused yt. And
thus much to his accusations / towching as well my coming to and going from
the ministry: as also off my behavior in yt. Of the most wheroff / there are
diverse witnesses: and off all / the Lord him self both witness and judge /
whose presence in this defense I set before mine eyes. Unless peradventure /
that also may seem to appertein hither: that by defense off this cause / I page
173.
would choose my self the place off my mynistery. Whereof I lay evil
foundations / which teach that no man may place him self: but wait / for his
calling: especially when by his doctrine / I may feed in every pasture / and
lightly grasing or taking the uppermost of one / straight way goo to an other.

In the other part of my life / after he had thrust me out of the College: he
accuses me for going up and down doing no good, and living p. 241. 283
at other men's tables. that I was not idle / I suppose he knows to well:
Whether well occupied or no / let it be judged. I lived in deed / at other men's
tables, having no house nor wife of mine own: but not without their desire / and
with small delight of mine / for fear of evil tongues. And althowgh I were not
able / to requite yt: yet toward some I went abowte yt / instructing their
children partly in the principles off religion / partly in other learning. His
other accusations / beside the cause: are off my manner off writing. The matter
is blamed: for that (as he says) page 207
yt consists wholly of other men's notes and collections, and that I have pa.
412.
scarce red one off the autors which I have alleged: yea and that I also page
123.
conte^ne them, namely master; Nowels Catechism. And for the form. It is
blamed as undutiful toward the pa. 1. 9.
Archbishops, bishops, etc. namely the pa. 423.
Bishop of Salisbury, and himself especially. That off contempt off M. Nowels
/ and other men's works: I detest as intolerable arrogancy. The other /
wherein the question is off great reading: I let pas. For if he be learned / and
I not / have read them all and I scarce one: it will easily appear to the
learned: beside that (as I have said) it towcheth not the cause. Only I
admonish / that he do yt hereafter / with better ground. For notwitstanding
(it is like he hunteth me with more howndes / then I him: yet beside those
places I confess my self to have received / he notes not many / and (that
excepted off Jerome mistaken for Musculus) not one trewlie.

Let us therefore come to the form. Where in my behavior toward the bishop
of Salisbury / I would gladly know of him / what words he could have
prescribed me: whereby I might more modestly have dissented from him. So that
unless the simple defense of the cause / be misbehauiour: I am well assured /
there is no duty broken. For my speches off the Archbishops / etc. generally /
if all should be taken either in this or the former book against their persons
/ which I speak against their offices: his accusation should not be /
altogether untrue. But as condemning these offices or their corruptions / I
make no conscience to speak contemptuously off them: so diverse off the persons
which bear them / both for their learning / and proof of godliness showed in
times past / I will not cease to reverence / until which (I hope will not be) by
open enimitie against a known trwth / their own consciences shall think them
selves unworthy. And this to an indifferent reader / shall suffice: for toward
the D. I have no remedy / which expounds all duetifull sayings counterfaict
humility, glorious and Smooth words to get credit.

My dewtie toward him / is accused diversely / of vnbrotherhood, pa. 4. 8. 9

unfaithfulness, want of good will: made heinous / by circumstance of perjury
and unthankfulness Wherein I will not answer / that I used not you as master /
because you used not me as fellow: but ask page 1. 20. etc.
you / wherein this breach off duty consists? If Iowe you fidelity, Iowe
yt more unto the lord: if good will, the trwth must be preferred: if the
master of Trinity College be a friend / the trwth is more: If you a brother,
the trwth owght to be brother, sister, mother and al. Against what part off trw
fidelity is yt / to reprove him openly by writing: which had openly by writing
spoken evil off that / which I was / and am persuaded to be the everlasting
trwth off God / and reviled those / which maintained yt. Against what poinct /
off good will / to have showed him the way / whom I judged to be out: to light
him a candle / whom I saw in this poinct to grope in darcknes. And if I did yt
sharper / then your taste can like off / beside that bitter things / are often
wholesomer then sweet: you should not thinck much to be stricken with the back
off the sword / which have smitten others with the edge / nor to be lightly
pricked with some empaire off your credit / which haue^ thrust others throwgh
/ in taking from them so much as lay i^ you / al opinion both of godliness and
learning. You doubt / whether I meant good faith when I called you a brother:
take heed lest in giving no credit unto others / you leave no place for others
to give any to you. And if I had offended / in these: yet my unthankfulness /
can not be great. You never gave me any thing in my bosom or secretly / what
you have given by sound off trump and openly: can not be hidden. But my
reproaches, and (as you often call them) gybes: can not be excused. yt is not
meet / that I should my self sit in judgment off my own modesty: yt is
unreasonable also / that you the party grieved should. For as selfeloue may
blind mine eyes / and (as parents in their children) not only cause me not to
see the blemishe / but also to thinck yt an ornament: so may displeasure dasel
yours / and cause your judgment to decline to much on the one side. My
conscience do^th not hitherto accuse me / in this behalf: others also whom
this has misliked / vvil peradventure be more favorable: if it be first
considered / that you account diverse for pleasant speeches / which are not /
thereby to avoid that you could not answer. Of which sort is that 767. line 6.
and 576. line 23. Secondly / if yt be considered / that you take some things
otherwise: then I vvrote them. For example / where I note your homely mirth of
the cursed wife, and thief which stole the page 707.
priests purse, to have been with the baggipe and not with either the harp or
lute: you expound it / as thowghe I had taken my self to the country wherein
you were born. Which verily I meant not / but had regard only to the greek
proverb / whereof Tully makes In orat. pro Muraena.
mention: that those which could not come to the honor to handle the harp,
were content to use the bagpipe. Which is evident / in that I oppose country,
not your country, your mirthe, to learned mirth. Here also (seems) should be

Let him take all these whereof diverse are often repeated / and if he be ashamed
off them / hide them: yet for any word off reproach I have used in either off
my books / I will find both more / and more bitter in his later book / wheroff
I have not once made mention. Where also it owght not to be forgotten how his
second book is as heavy with this kind off stuff as his first: if not
haeuier. They say / it is better to be beaten Arist. in his Rhetoric ad
Theodecten.
second: because the hardness off anger, is commonly broken upon the first. But
(yt seems) the Answerer dronck in more off his anger / then he powered forth.
Lastly / let it be considered whether his answers are (for the most part) so
ridiculous / that if he which is said to have Her^clitus.
wept so much had replied upon him: he could easelier have houlden hot coals
in his mouth / then have absteined from those salt sayings / which he so sore
complains off. Here I omit / that the scripture does diverse Act. 23. 5 1.

times use this kind off reprehending: Also that the most August: 15. l.
co^tra Faust. Manich. c. 4.
modest spirit off all the ancient writers not permits only / but as yt
were exhortethe / to a merciful kind off deriding. So that / the mind being
pure: the thing yt self used moderately to discredit sin / can not be condemned.

His accusations / which touch the cause follow: where abbridging the
magistrates authority / often repeted but never proved / shall be seen in the
proper places. There / shall appear that I have browght it into no smaller
roum: then the word off God has shut it / and the best learned and godliest
writers both nwe and old have plainly taught of yt. In which point / let yt be
also here observed: how there be no words so fenced against all cauils /
which the D. will not assay to deprave. For where I cited examples to prove
/ that men are said to do things whereof they page 156,
are the chief and principal and not the only doers / and amongst them
alleged that off Moses which appointed officers by Exo. 18. 25 Deuteronomy. 1. 15
page 157.
the peoples consent: he fears not to say / that I thereby pushe at the civil
magistrate, and infinuat that the prince may not appoint under officers without
the peoples election. But let him answer / what is the instrument wherewith (I
will not say) I pushe: but so much as towche yt with my little fingar? is it
because I say / those governors were chosen with consent of the people? the
scripture (as is after showed) does manifestly prove yt. Or did I ever teach
it in pulpit / page 198. off this book. Decad 5. sermon. 4.
mention it in disputation / defend it in talk / whereby these words might with
more likelihood / be haled unto such a sense? what would this man have done
(trow you) if I had (as Master Bullinger does) upon that place of Moses
concluded / that the peoples consent / owght to be in the election off their
Pastor. Not unlike to this / is that whereby (upon a rule brought and applied as
well by other learned men / as by me to the Ecclesiastical election) he would
insinuate: that I meant yt should be translated to the civil estate. Where
appears: that there is no spark off equity in him. For if the rule were
given generally / then my applying of it only / to Ecclesiastical elections /
does rather call yt from being understood off the civil: if it be given of it
alone / then it is clear that I used it accordingly. Beside that I have showed
/ that it is far otherwise in the civil then in the Ecclesiastical
government: and that things unlawful in one / are notwithstanding lawful in
the other. But thus must I restore that I never took: and be Psalm. 69. 4. Psalm.
35. 11 pa. 10. 14. 118. 171. 195.
accused off things which I not only never did, but not so much as know
off. Here also falseth / an other accusation of flattery off the people, with
injury to the magistrate. Where him self gives, me at least this testimony
/ that I have been evil scholed in that craft: which have chosen masters / that
can do so little for me. If the state off our commen wealth had been such / as
wherein the people had born the sway: his accusation vntrw / should yet have had
some color off trwth.

An other accusation / is off wrong in not setting down his book: page 2. 16.
27. 72. 89. 280. 593. 656.
as one looth it should be compared, and for fear my corrupt dealing should
appear. But this accusation / lies against the most part of learned men: which
having confuted adversaries off the trwth / have not only not set down there
books / but not given their readers so particular addres for conference / as I
did. Here therefore / either let him absolve me: or condemn me / with them. That
I did yt not in such respect as he says / I have protested: the truth wheroff
shall now appear. And withal / that notwithstanding his setting down: let the
reader judge whither he uses (as he says off me) frivolous replies, childish
collections, fraudulent deprauing off my book. Beside that he has passed by
diverse reasons off mine vntowched: page 16.
yea and as shall (God willing hereafter appear) guilfully left out of his own
book / in one or two places. And because I am entered into his dealing / having
been tied now full two years / to turn this stone of his writings: it will not
be amiss to admonish of some of his practices / whereby the reader may the better
know how to turn himself in them / either present or to come / if he keep on the
some course. In the rest therefore off his book / beside reproaches / furmises /
etc: one part is spent / in naked affirmacions withowt proof / vented often by
questions etherfond or from the purpose / and in dry testimonies off men: both
which are (as other his furniture) repeated / and that sometimes again and
again. That where the Cuckoo / trobleth but once a year: he with his untunable
repetitions off one thing to the same purpose / trobleth all the year long. Yet
has he / every hand while: to be short.

In his testimonies / beside that yt shall appear / that so many as make to
the cause they are almost every one either falsified / or drawn from the
meaning of the autors: yt is first to be observed / that to answer the places
off scripture alleged / yt is very like that he first turns to Master
Calvin / if he be against him he goes to ask favor at other: if no body
answer nothing / yet he brings sundry times even that nothing / that is to
say which makes not for him / sometime also against him. Secondly / where in
his former book / he propounds certain things / as his own: not able to
maintein them in this / he callethe for the autors assistance / of whom he has
not so much borrowed them / as taken them against their wills. yet he counts
yt vain glory, to take page 20^
out off an author, and to conceal his name Notwithstanding / if he had known
from whom his collections came / which he uses / and had been thankful to his
autors / in that sort he says we owght: we should often have had in the
margent / for Augustine, Ambrose, Chrysostom, etc. Pigghius / Hosius / Harding
/ etc. To let pas diverse reasons I gave him / which he never thanked me for:
but hides them as well as he can / by taking them up before hand / or he came
to the place where I give them. Thirdly where his authority is nameles / and
goethe under this general title / other learned men thinck otherwise, a
learned man says so: have yt for suspected / off popery. For that / in some
off those places: he can have no other autors but Papists / as I am persuaded.
Last off all / that he does often bately recite them / vvithowt applying them
to his matter: or gathering his argument off them. The cause vvheroff is / for
that they are not hable / to bear any argument / the vanity whereof / would
not forthewith appear / if it were gathered. Which is manifest / for as much
as where any color off argument does but peep / there he presses them
diligently: which practice he uses in his other proofs / albeit he precisely
reprehendeth it in the autors off the Admonition.

Touching the other part of that which remains in his book / standing either
of his reasons against our cause / or answers off the reasons against his ^in
both you may observe / that the proving off that in question / by that which
is likewise dowbted of / occupies a great room. In his answers to mine / he
will often acknowledge no argument: Because yt is not set down in the precise
either order off propositions / or other exact form of Sillogism. Which (I
thinck) is a streighter law / then any writer hitherto has been bound unto:
yet I will not refuse it / if he vvil give me an example: the matter having now
been so largely debated / to the understanding of the simpler sort. Let him
therefore / if he dare trust his cause: deal that way / an other while. As for
diverse particular faults / in his lodgick / and grammar throwgh evil
translation / considering that they bring no prejudice to the truth in question
/ and hurting not the vnlearneder / are quickly espied off the other: I am well
content / to hold back. Thus much / to the Answerers both general and
particular accusations and surmises: in such sort / a^ I mean (God willing)
never upon any his importunity to return unto again. For as for that page 21.
line 3. and such other as have manifest confutation in the places out off
which they are raised / they are most unworthy the naming.

Having spoken thus much for their causes especially / which misinformed by
the D. have no good opinion of the discipline now propounded: yt remains to
say something for theirs / which acknowledging yt for the trwth off God / do
not stretch forth their hands to bring yt in / or at the least / not with that
endeavor which owght to be. Wherein yt seems they do not so fully consider
that before alleged / of the use of the discipline / the same in the church /
that the wall about the city / or hedge about the orcheiard. If we thinck / that
men which vvoulde be safe from their enemies / need not greatly to trauail
after a wall / or they which would have their tender plants bring plentiful
fruict and be vntowched off hurfull beasts / not much to labor after a hedge
or diche for safegarde of them / then we may also thinck / that the church /
and the doctrine of the Apostels whereupon the church is builded / may long
continw and flourish vvithowt the discipline left by them. But if / the one be
not to be looked for: the hoping for the other / will but deceive us. Whereof
if there were no proof / but our own experience: the case is clearer / then can
be well denied. For whereof comes it that so many thowsandes (I will not say
of men and women) but of towns and villages remain in such ignorance of all
duty toward God / and their neighbor: that the estate off their ox (which
with his last breath shall end his labor / and hear no more the voice of the
whip) is a thousand times better then theirs / whom everlasting tomentes of
body and sowl vvait for / and must assuredly ensue if they so remain. Comes
it not hereof / that in steed of a learned ministry / which should show
them the right way / be thrust upon them at the pleasure / or permission off
the bishop / and appetite off the patron / blind guides which scarce know a
foot of it them selves: yea which sometimes (as comes to pas in sundry popish
priests that remain) endeavor to turn them out off the way / if happily any
were entered? Wheroff comes it that off those which have able ministers to feed
them: diverse towns can not yet get out of this comdemnation, is it not thereof
/ that some pastors like covetous nourses charging them selves with more / then
they are able to nource / suffer them all to starve? that other some more
unnatural then the dragons them selves (which lay out their breasts / unto
their young) by dispensation / turn away their faces quite from them? whose
mouths / are almost never open to teach / but when their hands are likewise
to receive? And if some in a good intent to help many / lend one hand to one
congregation / and his other unto another: yet when either of them require both
hands to be pulled out off the mire wherein they stick so fast / his fault
being a great deal les then the others / the peoples condemnation remains the
same. Wheroff also is y^ / that in diverse off those Towns where the gospel
has daily shined: the darcknes of ignorance / has not been put to flight.
Comes yt not thoroff / that many speaking smally to purpose off the text they
handle / or blowing up their sermons either with poets fables / sayings off
Philosophers and that often in strange language / amaze them rather with a
wo^nderme^t of their learning / then edify the^ in faith and trw repentance.
And not that only / but thereby also bring them out of al taste with all simple
and plain kind off teaching: so that they which do not so / are called by
reproach English Doctors. Which by often meetings of the ministers / in
exercice off Prophecy or interpretacion of some scripture / through mutual
censures and admonitions: would easily be remedied.

Wheroff is it / that even where the gospel is soundly and abu^dandly taught:
knowledge has not accordingly followed. Is it not thereof / that the principles /
and grounds of religion are not by Catechism laid forth: that those of whose
either capacity or diligence yt is doubted / are not (that a supply may be made)
particulerly examined? Wheroff comes yt that Arians / Valentinians and
Anabaptists / in diverse sorts with such other detestable heretics: are so
rife / in many places of the land. Is it not thereof / that there is no
eldership / which might assist the pastor / to epsy them out: no pastorable by
substancial reasons to convince them: no authority there to decide of them / or
after decision by ecclesiastical censures to punish them. Wheroff comes yt /
that horrible blaspheming the holy and most reverend name of God / quarreling
and fighting / dronckennes / filthy speaking / fornication / adultery /
slaundering and such like / run over almost in every place / off which some
are so open that there is no night or corners sowght to hid them / but are done
in the high streates / and at noon days: yea (which is fearful) that often
there is more danger to them that reprove these faults / then to those which
commit them. Is it not hereof that there is no eldership to watch over these
offenses / to admonish the offenders / and by ecclesiastical censures to
correct them. Wheroff comes it / that in so many excellent laws / provided
against roges and beggars: there are yet (to the manifest breach of the law of
God / and hasard of the commen wealth) such nombers. Is it not heroff / that
the office off Deacons / which god had ordained for that purpose (the bare name
remaining) is abolished: and that the Lord will give no blessing to those good
laws / because his order is neglected. Finally hereof it comes / that having
a gracious Prince mainteining / and her honorable Counsall favoring the
preaching of the gospel / in so long and quiet peace / apt for the furtherance
off yt: there is notwithstanding so small fruict that (saving a few which the
lord has gathered) for the general estate of the Realm / the Gospel may
seem hitherto rather to have shined for further condemnation of it / then for
light or heat of salvation / joined therewith, what price therefore we set of the
glory off God / what account we make off the salvation of our country: that
estimacion we must keep / off the discipline off God / left unto us by his holy
Apostels.

This if it were deeply weighed: it would cause us to breakthrowgh the lets
which (I see) stay some / and make other some to faint in the furtherance of
this cause. For some which desire that this cause might gain / throwgh a mind
abhorring from contention / especially inward / an with them of the same
religion: stand further of from yt / then otherwise they would. Wherein I
willingly acknowledge Rebeccas affection: a figure off the church off God. For
notwithstanding she prayed / unto the lord for children: yet feeling them
strive within her Womb / Genes. 25. 22.
wished she had never conceived. But alas / the state off men is not so happy:
to obtain any excellent thing / without strift. Errors and falsehood have often
times easy entrance / whilst the husbandmen sleep: but because the ennemy
always waketh / the trweth must fight / or ever she / can get any thing.
wherein / to pas by an infinite number of examples: that which is proper to this
place (off the dangerous assaults which this cause suffered at Geneua) is
worthy off your consideration. For albeit the contention there was not in
Judgment only / and in words / but with great disorders and tumultes / to
the present danger off the city: yet M. Calvin / and other faithful
servants of God / In M. Call. Epistles.
offered them selves not only to los off their ministry / and banishment / but
even to death / rather then they would go one foot back / from that truth off
the discipline / which they had learned out off the word off God / which had
been / rashly done / if the matter had been off so small importance: as that
(for redeming off peace) they might have let the cause of the discipline fall /
or laid it aside / until a fitter time. There are (God be praised) no tumultes
nor vprores with us / and I hope there shall be none: but as yt is not lawful
for us to move any / so to withdraw the hand from defense off the cause / for
fear of them to be moved by others / is against duty.

There are others / which as the espies off the land of Canaan Nomb. 13 28. etc.
/ confessing it good and profitable for the church: yet in respect of the
manifold lets / affirm it a thing impossible: and thereby not only discorage
them selves / but weaken the hands off other. And even here also / I see
Rebecca again. For yt appears by the lords answer unto her / two peoples
should be divided ovvt of her bovvls: that she was in some despair off having
strenght / to Genes. 25. 23.
be delivered of her desired seed / considering the dangerous wrestlings and
struglinges / in her womb. And in deed / if we consider our selves / if we look
upon our own arms: I grant the walls against it / are higher then will be
scaled / the gates and bars / are stronger then will be broken throwgh / the
children come to the birth / there will be no strenght to bring forth. For
herein casting our acco^ptes / we must wait for not only the misliking of our
brethern / which be misled / the hatred of the obstinat Papists which see
their kingdom vnreparable / if this get place: but the deadly enimities off
Hypocrites / and Atheistes / which will not suffer their untamed lusts to come
under any yoke off correction / nor their lose affections off riotous pleasures
/ proud ambition / and insatiable covetousness to be bound / with any bands
off wholesome discipline.

But of the other side / if we look unto the lord / and his mighty arm which
not only with a blast of his mouth strikes the walls / and breaks the
gates in pieces / but also makes the high walls to fall / and the iron gates
to open of their own accord / which makes not only the weak / but even the
bare^ women to bring forth: No difficulty or impossibility in the judgment
off men owght to turn us from any lawful endeavor / to promote the cause. The
example off the wall in Jerusalem finished / notwithstanding all the enemies:
serves here / for our confirmation. For if the lord / stretched forth his hand
for furtherance of that material wall: he will not in the aduauncing off this
spiritual / hold it in his bosom. If he forsook not his servants / under
heathen Princes: he will not be wanting to them under Christian. Hitherto
belongs / the example in Geneua: before mentioned. The whole estate off the
City almost / from the highest unto the lowest (amongst whom were also the
greatest part off the ministers) was bent against yt: two or three simple men
scarce able to train their legs after them / having no other armor then the
trwth and a good conscience / stand for it. If flesh and blood should here sit
in judgment / the field were lost / or ever yt were begun: the friends off
the discipline / should (for that they took the defense in hand) be accounted
fools / for that they would not co^pound the matter / mad men. But what was
the issue? Verily the Lord so magnified his word / in the hand of his servants
/ that after trial off their patience by diverse troubles / the Capitaines
against yt / came to shameful end / a number yealded / the rest that continued
their enemitie / durst not show yt / the trwth yt self was established / and so
(to the singular commendation off that city) remains. And shall we / in so
great a number whose hearts the Lord has inclined to favor this cause
despair? especially seeing yt is easier to be established with us / then with
them: and may here be settled / withowt so much as a dog moving his tongue /
which was not there / withowt dangerous vprores. For where no wholesome law can
pas there / onles the most part consent: only / the hundredth part with us /
weighs down all the rest.

Yt remains / that as the Iwes in the wall off Jerusalem / did every one
according to the ability the Lord had blessed them Nehem. 3
with build his part: so those / whose hearts the lord has lightened with the
knowledge of this truth / should as their callings / and means which the lord
has given them will serve / lay their hands to the work. That those whom the
lord has given favor or acces unto her majesty / would set before their eyes
the example of that worthy courtier Nehemias: which (forgetting his private
profit and preferment) for full recompense of all his faith Neh. 2. 5.
full service unto his Prince / was glad to obtein at his hand the building up
of the walls off the city of God: and therefore not to reserve the grace and
credit they have with her highness / for their own matters / but to bestow yt
upon the Lords. That the Prince her self / would consider how (to let pas
the danger unto her soul) unworthy yt is off her honor / if throwgh vntrw
reports either against the cause / or favorers thereof / she turn away her
ear from hearing / and taking knowledge of it: seeing a heathen king / did not
admit such rumors against that which concerned the glory off God: althowgh
they were offered thick and three fould / and that by his one country men /
against the Iwes / which were but strangers. Finally / that we all
continually / pray to the lord: that he would vouchsafe to open their eyes
which are yet ignorant in this behalf / confirm those which have knowledge /
and confound the^ (if any be) which either for honor / or lucres sake /
willingly bend the^ selves / against the truth.

To the reader.
THe cause off the slovvnes of answer, has been in part my often sickness, and
want off books off all Sorts: a fevv only excepted, which I brovght with
me, and those for the most part English: so that for every Place almost, cited
off the D. I was constreined to seek in other men's libraries, and after I had
used the book, to carry it home again. Which with what los of time, yt was:
may easily be esteemed. Ad hereunto: the slacknes off the print. For althovvgh
yt had been my singular advantage, both for polishing and better ordering off
things, to have put nothing under the pres, before the whole book had been
finished: yet beginning to print, after I had made an end off one treatise, and
begone an other, yt was notvvithstanding scarce able to overtake me.

Amongst the causes, why I set forth one part, before the whole was ended:
one is, for that this former part rose to a just volume. An other, that if any
thing have escaped which may be hurtful unto the trvvth: I might (being
advertised) amend yt in the later part: vvheroff I desire the Godly reader,
with as convenient speed as he can, to give me understanding.

The treatise off the apparel I have passed by, the causes vvherof (assigned by
me) if they shall not be approved, by those page 40^.
to whose judgment I submit my self: upon signification off their mind in
that behalf, I will resume yt again in that place where I shall handle the
conuenience and inconvenience off the ceremonies off the church, unto which
place, I vvish I had reserved the most part off that Tractat, which in my book
is the first.

The learned reader I desire, that where ^ confute some things, unworthy in
his judgment to be mentioned: he would give that, to those that are not so
well advanced. Althovvgh I confess, that off a number off them the consultation
(whether any were so rude as not to perceive them, vvithovvt help) stood me
in more, then the confutation. The reader that vnvvillingly reads the
controversies, between those off the same profession in doctrine (I trust)
shall not lose his trauail, if he desire to be confirmed against the errors off
the papists: the same in many places, with the Ansvverers. Off all I desire,
both learned and others, that they would support my weakness, wheresoever and
in what sort so ever yt shall appear: seeing I trust, it shall be manifest unto
them, that in a good cause, I have labored also to keep a good conscience.

For better understanding of the book, after you are a little entered: you
shall (where I remembered yt) find the doctor, althovvgh not alvvaies in so
many words* yet in the same sense, in a smaller letter: the testimonies and
that alleged out off my former book and admonition being in a greater.
Sometimes throvvgh his to much fondnes, and repetition, I put only a word or
two: to give the reader to understand that I wander not vvithovvt an
adversary: referring him, for further knowledge unto his own book, when I
refer you for any place, either of my former, or else off both his (a fevv
excepted in the beginning) I follow his later book: where all these books be.
Of faults escaped in the printing, some are such, as either overthrow the
whole sense, corrupt yt: or that otherwise may greatly hinder you. Which I
have set apart from the rest, desiring you to vouchsafe to correct them
especially, with your pen: considering that yt is but a small labor, to you
in one book, which would have been infinite to me in all. Fare well gentle
reader: and if thou take any profit off my labors, remember me in thy prayers
unto the lord for his assistance in the rest off my life, and namely for that
which remains of answer, unto the D. book.

The faults, most necessary to be corrected.

The answer, unto the doctors praeface: entitled, to the godly reader,
TO all here / in controversy / considering they are barely said without
proof: if they be affirmations / one yea / if they be denials / one nae / shall
be enowgh: seeing they are all handled at large in this book. Except that / off
ceremonies used in popery / wheroff how vntrwly he speaks when he says that
the rejecting off them / stands upon this / that we may not use, in any wise
or in any consideration retained in the church any thing that has been abused
under the Pope: both has manifestly in my former book / and further shall (God
willing) in the later part off my reply appear.

Answer to his two Tables / wheroff the first is entitled off dangerous
points off doctrine: the other off vntrwthes and falsified autorities,
contained in my reply.
AFter I had ended my book / and was entered upon the preface: I received a
treatise called / An examination off M. Doctor VVhitgiftes censures, contained
in two Tables, set before his book entitled the defense of the answer to the
admoni. Whereof as I was glad for the truths safe which shall receive strenght
by yt so I was sorry / that I received yt no sooner / for that it might both
have cased me off much labor / and have served me for a good direction in
those places / which might seem to require a larger defense / then the shortness
yt follows / would receive. And as those off the church which acknowledge this
trwth / so I especially / for whose support (I take) yt was written / heartily
thanck the author and desire the reader / to use yt for a supply / where my
answer does not satisfy him. Which answers off mine / so far as I have
hitherto gone: he shall find / after this sort.

The replye unto the answer page j. etc.
FOr the four first sectyons / being either false accusations / bare
repetitions off my words / or profes off things which I have set down and
confess: I will not answer. His fifte section answerethe not any thing / to
diverse reasons which I have set down / to prove that this cause can not be
charged with disorder / whose whole work is / that nothing be done owte off
place / owte off time / besides the bounds off every one His several
calling. in the 6. sectyon 4. page he falling to railing / doothe gwilfully
pass by the reason which I have alleged / why this doctine which we maintain
/ can not be thowght enemy unto princes / seeing yt was a freende to princes /
when princes where enemies unto it. For him self can not deny but the
government by elders / the choice off the ministers by the church / the most
off those things which he especially supposes to have war with the civil
magistrate / and are in controversy between us / were in the times off the
Apostells / when they being trodden under feet off the civil Magistrate / did
never lift up their heel against his power.

And where he says / it is no plain dealing to draw that to this cause /
which is trewly spoken off the gospel: he needed not to have charged us with
want of plain dealing / seeing we offer to show the discipline to be a part
off the gospel / and therefore to have a common cause / so that in the repulse
of the discipline / the gospel receives a check.

That the discipline off the church / is not in the number of those things
which are varyed / is disputed in the second tractate / and in her several
parts / through out the whole book. That the distinction off the common
welthe / and the church has been and owght to be kept of al men / which
have spoken or written with any Judgment / shall be showed in the 20.
Tractate: and therefore althowghe the answerer do a 100. times repeete this
thing in bare affirmacions: yet the reader shall once for all / look for the
answer off these things in those places.

In his 8. section page 1. he speaks off the authority off the magistrate
upon no occasion / to no purpose / with great words / with no proof. Then
as thowghe I had written in unknown figures as the priests of Aegypte: he
complains of my obscurity / and that he can not understand what I mean:
whereas I could hardely have used greater light of speech / if I had bente my
self thereunto. For I prove the singular benefit that the discipline brings
to the common welthe / for that by the Ecclesiastical censures off admonition /
reprehension / suspension / etc. the lesser faults off lying / uncomely
jesting / and choleric speaking being met with all: the passage is stopped
against the greater faults off theft / adultery / and murder. Wherein observe
his unfaithful dealing / which feining him self not to understand that which
my words do fully sound: doothe notwithstanding forge things off me /
wheroff there is not the smallest ynkling. For here upon he asks / whether I
think not the punishemet of theft / and murder sharp enowghe / with diverse
other which follow: unto all which silence yff they were handled as they deserve
/ were the fittest answer. Howbeyt to shut up the mouth off them / which
seek occasion / I answer: that as the Ecclesiastical censures / shut not owte
the civil punishementes / nor hinder not in any part their course: so the
civil punishementes can not displace the church censures / considering that
as the one is occupied in the punishment off the body / so the other is
conversant in the instructing off the conscience: and we have a manifest
example off the joining off them together in one / and the same action in the
scripture. Where yt was ordained / that he that came not at the day appointed
/ should be 10. Es^^*
punished by the loss off goods which was mere civil / and by separation
from the congregation / which was altogether Ecclesiastical howbeit it shall
be sufficient here to show / that where as the answerer should have disputed
against this that the Ecclesiastical censures together with the ciuille
punishementes / have more force to resist sin / then the civil
punishementes only: not being able to answer to the reason / as though his
nose blead / turnethe a side and looking another way / so reasonethe / as if
the question were / whether the civil punishment were off greater strenght to
hold owte sin / then the Ecclesiastical / which neither is / nor shallbe
the question at this time / yt is sufficient that they be both necessary. And
whereas he asks whether the magistrate has not power to correct lying /
uncomely jesting / choleric speaking (off which only question he might seem
to have some color of occasion given by my words) I answer that in saying
that the magistrate doothe not commonly punish them / I neither say that
either he may not / or he will not (as he doothe vntrewlie surmise) but I had
regard unto the estate both of our common welthe / and of all other which I
know this day / where there are for the most part in these cases / no
courts or judgment seats / which do once take knowledge off these causes it
being also a common principell / thar the law doothe not take care of small
things, as it is alleged in one of the law cases / which is reported in King
Henry the eight his years. And in respect that such like matters are only
corrected by these censures off the church / they are called off certain
consistory matters. And therefore I refuse not only the judgment off the
indifferent but off the most enemy reader / which has but a sparcke off
equity in him: How untrue it is / that either we wringe the sword by these
words owte off the magistrates hand / or suspende the drawing off yt in any
respect / upon the pleasure off the eldershipp off the church.

In the 9. section page 6. as thowghe the imperfection off the church were not
confessed off our parts / he sets him self to prove / that men commit
faults as long as they be in this liffe. Secondly to prove that the church
florisheth with us / he alleges that the common wealth florisheth: whereunto
forsomiche as it is with out the compass off this treatise to meddle with the
recital off the breaches off the common welthe / and there are other proofs
enowghe to convince the deformities off the church: I will make no answer /
saving that he must understand that in supposing diverse crackes in the common
wealth / we are so far from staining the careful watch / and painefulnes
off the godly magistrate (as he surmiseth) that his faithful and godly
travails are rather herebie commended / who in so sore a sickness / and among
so many partly vnfaithefull / and partly unskillful physicions / has
hitherto kept liffe in yt.

In the 10. section / page 6 where he says / that the threatening off the
Prophethe appertains to other realms / which Esaias 60. 12.
refuse and persequute the gospel / and can not belong unto ours: the
discipline being as it is propounded / and offered to be proved / a part off
the gospel / must needs arm the lord against the refusers and so miche
the more / as it coming into the church as into her home / is therefore more
dangerously rejected. And where the answerer in words calls for fruicte off
the gospel: In this enemitie which he has with the discipline off the
church pulling down the hedge wherewith the lords orchyarde should be false
from the inuasio^ of hurtefull beasts: he is as friendly to the fruictes of
the gospel / as the East wind is to the fruits of the earth. For the
Discipline off the church being one off the most excellentest means that the
lord has ordained / to cause the doctrine of the gospel to fructify: he is
found a nourice of that barennes against which he exhorts.

In the 11. section page 7. he has broken his bridell again / and in leuing
the matter in hand / he run^eth to his old accusations / whereunto I have not
to answer. That there is no head off the church but only Christ / shall be
showed in the treatise off the Archebishopp / into which question this
falls. And lest nothing should be said for answer to that which I had set
down: the gloss has here charged me / that I make more off the government
then off the gospel / which is a manifest vntrewthe / for I speak of the
discipline as off a part off the gospel / and therefore neither under / nor
above the Gospel / but the Gospel. But the reason which he adds is to be
noted: for (says he) he likeneth the estate off the church / to the wandering
in the wilderness. First off all if I did liken the estate off our church now
destitute off the discipline / unto the estate off the church which was in
the wilderness: there is wherwithe that similitude is supported. For as diverse
laws were given unto the Jews in Mount Synay / the practice wheroff they
could not have / until they came into the land off Canaan: even so the
doctrine off the Gospel / cannot have the full practice / unless yt have
thereunto joined the discipline. But to cut off all occasion off cauilling / if
I had not fallen upon them that seek yt / I expressed wherein the bringi^g in
of the discipline should have been like the co^duction of the people into
Canaan: not in that yt is either better / or not so good as the doctrine off the
gospel: but in this / that as then the people had their full deliverance /
when they came into that land: so we by this addition off Discipline to the
doctrine off the gospel / together with a whole and entier deliverance owte
off the thraldom off the popish Aegyte / might have greater fredome in the
city off God which is his church.

The other Cavil is off the same sort. For as I propounded the upright kings
to be followed / in their whole and full reformacions: so those which halted I
set before / to the intent they should be avoided / in that their reformacio^s
were not throwghe / and therefore where a reformacion is not full / althowghe
the want be not in the same poincte in which they were behind: yet therein yt
resembles the^ / that as they / so this is imperfect. Beside that it is
untrue that all those kings / which I said to have carried the mark and spott
off their imperfection / suffered manifest Idolatry / as it appears 1. Reg.
15.
in the example off king Asa. Unto the next section I answer nothing.

To the 13. sect. page 9.
GEinge the church off Christ gathered among the Jews / Act. 10.
and S. Peter him selffe were ignorant off one of the greatest mysteries off
Christianity / concerning the manner off the calling off the Gentillee: yt
owght not to seem strange unto us / if those famous Martirs were ignorant /
off some principal point commanded by the word off god. And if it be replied
/ that this ignorance falls not into the holy order off the martirs off
Christ / and that the lord leueth not those which are witnesses unto death / in
ignorance off any such necessary point: Cyprian and Justin Martyr / (wheroff
besides other smaller errors the one held / that those which were baptized by
the heretics / were to be baptized again: the other was a Chiliast / and said
that the faithful / should in the general resurrection line with Christ here
upon earth 1000. years:) I say these two godly Martyrs are sufficient
profes / that the glory off martyrdom / does not free men from being in
danger off ignorance / off some necessary doctrine commanded in the
scripture. Origene (if he were as it written off him a Martyr) had so many /
and so gross errors / that he had need have very favorable interpretation /
to make him hold the fundation of Religion: especially if they be his works
which goo under his name.

And if it be further said / that albeit those martyrs did err in such
weighty matters: yet it is to be supposed that before their deaths / they
changed opinion: I say that that can be by no likelihoode supposed. For then
vndowtedlie they would have called back their former opinions / and not have
suffered them to the hurt off the church / to have lived after theredeathe. If
this be not sufficient / to show that godly Maxtyrs may remain in the
ignorance of some necessary point of Religion: our own Ecclesiastical
stories / do furnishe us with diverse examples off godly Martyrs / off all
sorts / and all times / but especially in the beginning (when the day off the
light off the Gospel / began to peep out off that night off popish darkness
wherein we were) who even in there examinations before their martyrdom /
affirm the contrary off that wheroff we are clearly taught in the word of God.
I have not the book by me / but I well remember there mentioned of a notable
man / and off the later Martyrs / which affirms a very gross descent off
our savior Christ into hell: which is an error in one off the articles off our
faith. Another granting such a Purgatory after this life as the papists do
imagine / and others also diverse failing in substantial points of doctrine:
whereby whatsoever becomes off this place off Nehemias / yet that is true
which I set down: that both good men / and learned / and martyrs / may not
only be ignorant / but also hold / the contrary off some substantial
points off Religion. So that if the example which I used / should not serve:
yet the doctrine which I set down is true and unshaken / yea (saving only a
bare denial) untouched.

And because the Answerer holds out the Slidinges of the most excellent
servants of god / to hide this unfaithful dealing with the church in this
resistance against the truth: he must understand that their want in these
things / is so far from making his fault less / that it shall weighe so
much more to his condemnation / by how much the lord has offered the knowledge
off those things unto him which (he disdainefullie reiectinge) would withowt
all controversy have been joyfully embraced off those blessed Martyrs. And
if he had rather here this sentence off an other then off me: it is that which
Cyprian in a certain Epistle writes / where all Cyp. lib. 2. Epist. 3.
this is confirmed when he says: That yff any off our predecessors either by
ignorance, or by simplicity did not hold that which the Lord did by his
commandment and example teach: that the Lord would forgive that
simplicity: But unto us (says he) which are admonished and instructed, there
is no such pardon left.

And althowghe he now whiteth there tombs with a few faierr words: yet it
is to be feared / that if they were alive / and should but a little touch his
bile: all the learning and godliness they had / should not be able to harness
the^ from those darts of his tongue / which others have felt. And it shall
appear I dowbt not or ever we have done / whether he bear that reverence /
which he pretends / when I shall have showed / that the principal points
which are debated between us / and which he is so looth to forgoo / be clear
and manifest assertions / partly off the eldest and most auncientest
professors off the gospel / and partly off the most famous / learned martyrs
in this our land: I say when these things shall be showed it shall be discovered:
whether this price which he seteth of there judgment / has risen of their
exellencie in vertew / and learni^g / or rather of that cause which I have
before observed.

In the allegation off the place of Nehemias / yff I would follow the answers
train / I need not retracte any thing. For I could allege / upon that that
both before and after there is rehearsed the same story which was spoken off
in Esra / the feast off tabernacles is like to be all one / spoken off in Esra
/ and in Nehemia: howbeit because there are reasons which lead me to think
otherwise: I willingly confess that the story of the celebration of the
feast of tabernacles in the third of Esra / makes against that I said / of not
holdinge that feast so many years. But I deny that the answerer in all this
great triumph / either does or can lose my hold off that place / whereby I
confirmed the continuance off so many years in omitting that / which owght to
have been done by the commandment of god. For notwithstanding the feast were
celebrated: yet it can not be showed / that it was kept in such 23, Leui.
sort as it owght / with boothes made of certain leaves / and bowghes
commanded in the law. And that the words off the book of Nehemias / which
affirm that the children of Israel had not done so from the time / etc: are
not referred only to the joy which was great in that feast / but unto the
kepinge of it with bowghes ^^ in times past omited / there is this likelihood:
that the story shows / how they had celebrated the first day off the feast
withowt any off those bowghes prescribed / and that the second day of the
feast / hearing the law read which commanded those bowghes / they corrected
their error werupon im^ediatelie follow these words of the book that the
children of Israel had not done so, from the time of Iosuah the son^e of Nu^,
whereby appears that there was a general ignorance of the man^er of
solemnizing that feast / even in Esra the high priest / whose expertnes and
knowledge in the law off god / together with a fervent zeal to seek the lord /
is so highly commended off the holy ghost. And if the Hebrew conjunction
Vau, which follows immediately / be taken in the proper signification: the
words off the text will not suffer that word (So) to be referred to any
other thing / then to the omitting off that commandment of the lord / by the
space of so many years as I have assigned. so that unless I will yealde him
this place willingly: he is not able with any force of reason / to wring it
out of my hands.

The places off the kings and Cronicles are not like unto this: for the
speeches are plain and clear there which is not so in this place / especially
to that end / that he would carry them. Where he asks whether he should
say) That I have not read the place, or do not understand yt, or willingly
and vvittiinglie abuse it or received it in some notes from others) let it be
free to him for me to say either of them / or all off them together. But where
he says he, will say none of them / and yet in another place twenty lines
after / charge me with the most heinous of them all that is with wilful
deprauing off the Scriptures: except he can bring it to some figure of
Rhetoric / which will be hard for him to do: it is to open an vntrewth /
joined as it should seem / with a great excess of envy and displeasure: the
streme wheroff was so strong / that it did as it were by force / carry away
the truth off his promise.

Unto the 14. section.
I Only prove that their high estate owght not to shadow the cause in hand:
I say nothing less then that men in high estate can not have the truth:
their is no syllable sounding that ways / the contrary I plainly affirm /
that many off the Nobility and gentry / are Zealous and Religiouse. To what
end therefore these places out off Isay / Gualter / Bullinger to prove a thing
not only not denied / but plainly afmed? For if he think Master
Bullingers sentence does hinder / that the saiynge off S. Paul to the
Corinth. can not be understood of these times: he is greatly abused /
consideringe that the reason which the Apostell there uses / which is that no
flesh should glory in the sight off God / reaches to the whole estate of the
kingdom of Christ / and is not proper to that time. And when Master Bullinger
says that it came to pass especially in that time / he excludes not the
times that follow.

Where as he says the simple and plain meaning of the text to be / that god
in his election to eternal life / has neither respect to learning /
nobility / riches or any such thing: he do the manifestly corrupt the
sentence off the Apostle / and the whole process off his diputation. for the
apostle going about to maintain / the naked simplicity off the preaching off
the word of god / against those that would have the word preached in the
swelling words off man's eloquence: amongst other reasons uses this / that
the lord uses for the most part other means to do his / then the wisdom off
men would choose to do their matters. And therefore that the simple kind off
preaching / withowt all pomp and bravery off speech / might semelesse
strange: he shows the same to come to pass in the calling off god / in
which he takes the most unlikely in man's judgment / and passes by those
that the wisdom of man would sonest take. And albeit it be to an other end /
this sentence off S. Paul is the same in effect with that off S. James: that
god chooses the poor in the world rich in faith. Now althowghe it be true /
that god has not respect Iam. 2. 5.
to riches / or poverty / nobility / or base degree in his eternal election:
yet who is there so void off all judgment / that will say that the true and
simple meaning off S. James in this place is / that god in his eternal election
has no regard to riches / or poverty? When he therefore reproves them to
whom he wrote for that they rejected the poor which the Lord for the most
part chooses / and made much off the rich / which he for the most part
rejects.

Saint Paul therefore shows not only what came to pass in those times: but
what for the most part comes / and shall come to pass / unto the worlds
end in the Kingdom of Christ: even that he had before learned of our savior
Christ / that the poor as those that are afflicted / and cast down with the
sense off their miseries / oftentimes do gladlier receive the gospel. Neither
follows it herevpo^ that the rich and noble are shut out off the kingdom
off God / or that riches off them selves make men less apt to the kingdom
off heaven / seeing Abraham the father off the beleuers was rich: or else that
the rich sometime goo not before the poor in receiving off the gospel:
which we read to have come to pass in Beroe / and Thessalonique / and which
sometimes comes to Act. 17.
pass not only in one city / but in a whole realm / that the nobility
embrace the gospel / and the baser sort despise yt. But this I say which also
the Apostle means / that the common and most usual calling off God / rests
in more off the porer then off the richer sort: that the rich and noble that
have received that benefit of this holy calling / may learn thereby the
better to esteem the treasure they have / and the faster to hold y^. But I
fear lest in confuting his absurdity / I become almost as absurd as he.

You allow nothing which makes against you / and that you may say true all
Scriptures be they never so plain / must be falsified. The place off the
Cronicles in the 29. chapter / is no collection / but the plain and manifest
words off the Scripture / and so clear that it was not possible to have had
clerer words. For after that the holy ghost had said / that the levites the
priests brethern / had helped them until the work were done / and until the
priests had sanctified them selves / he adds the reason (...) that is, for
the levites were more upright in heart in sanctifyinge them selves then the
priests. And here the faith of the Answerer which he uses with his reader is
to be observed. Which having one only translation to meintaine him self /
against a manifest truth of the scripture / has followed that / and left not
only the trewthe of the Hebrew / but all other translatio^s both of the greek
(whereof the oulde interpretour is nothing else but a translator) and of the
latin Munster / Pagnine / Leo Judah / Castalio and other translations in other
languages / which I am persuaded with one full consent / have amended the error
off the vulgar translation in latin. and yet he is not ashamed to say / that
some tra^slatio^ seems to insinuate so^e such thing as I have set down /
in steed that he should have said: all tra^slatio^s the old only excepted /
so expound it: he speaks as thowghe some one translation only had so turned.
And in steed that he should have said they plainly and clerelie declare it /
he says that yt seems in some translation to insinuate: and where he should
have said / the same thing that I have set down he says some such thing.
And on the other side when he speaks of the translation Which serves his
humor. He says / That yff credit may be given to those which be notable
learned men, speaking in the plural number / as thowghe there were a number /
that had so translated it: when beside the oulde translator / he is not able to
show so much as one. For where he says that Pellicane translateth those words
/ etc. he is a-abused: for they are the words off the old translator / and
not off Pellicane / who never set forth any translation. I grant that
Pellicane being deceived by the oulde interpretor so expounds it: but what is
that against so manifest both light of the text / and consent off all other
learned men / which all with one consent refuse the oulde tra^slatio^ as that
which does open violence unto the truth: so that I persuade my self that even
the very papists / as the monk Isiodorus Clarius / has in this point
reformed the oulde tra^slator. And it is a mere fable / that the Levites could
be sanctified easlier / or in shorter time then the priests: neither is their
any such thing in all the law of Moses. For as touching the corporal
pollutions / that happened unto men by touching of things which the law
counted unclean and common or off what other means soever men were made
unmeet / to come either into the congregation of God / or other society of
men: the purgation and cleansing according to the kind off pollution / was the
same and in the same time / not only unto the priests and Levites but also
unto the common people / and this answer is manifestly overthrown by the
words off the text. for in that there were some priests sanctified as well as
the Levites: it proves manifestly that the cause off stay was not in the time
that the ceremony off sanctifing required / for then that should have also
stayed the rest off the priests.

And where he says Surely the very circunstance off the place does prove that
sense to be true: there can no words be sufficient to declare this bouldnes.
For where the holy ghost does assign the cause off the fewnes off the
priests in the work off the lord / in plain words for that the levites were
more vpprighte in heart to sanctify the^ selves then the priests: he would
make us believe that the cause of their fewnes in that work was that which he
has imagined: whereof there is not a lettre in the scripture. For that there
were to few priests to fleay the sacrifices I grant: that the Levites helped
the priests until other priests were sanctified / I likewise grant: but
that the cause off this fewnes was either the want off nombre off those which
were in the order and degree of priesthood / or for that more time was bestowed
in sanctifying the priests then the levites (which he imagines) I deny / and
against his imagination oppose the manifest words of the holy ghost.

In the place also off the 30. of the Chronicles / it is manifest that the
people were more earnest / then either the priests or the levites. And
althowgh the answerer have here neither corrupt translation / nor untrue
exposition / nor patch off reason to set against it: yet he will not yield him
self to the truth. The holy ghost declaring the readiness off the people off
Judah / in assembling them selves so spedilie / and with so general a consent
/ and their zeal in breaking down the monumentes of Idolatry / first at
Jerusalem (as appears both in the last verse of the 29. chapter / and in the
verse goinge before this place) and afterward in the whole contrie off Judah
(as appears in the beginning off the next chapter) if he had said nothing
else yet it might have been gathered. But when he adds immediately after he
had spoken off the readiness / and zeal off the people / that the Levites and
the priests were ashamed: If this be not the cause / I would gladly learn
of the answerer what should be. And the Rabbis althowghe they often times
wringe the words off the text / to cover the shame off their nation / and
especially off those which were in public charge: yet durst never attempt to
strive against such light off words as be here: but in both those places off
the Cronicles / confess the faults off their Schelomo Iarchi.
priests and levites. And one of the^ in this place gives this reason / why
the priests and Levites differred their sanctifiyng of them to the work of
the lord / namely for that they could not believe that king Ezechias me^t good
faith and therefore held of and stood aloufe / because they suspected that the
king would return to his fathers train of Idolatry / as it comes often to
pass in those that serve the time / which wait upon what side the wind will
turn.

And that owght not to seem so strange a thing unto the answerer / considering
that beside this place / there is example off this untowardness of the priests
/ and Levites in respect off the people in an other place / for when king
Artaf hasta had given leave unto the Jews to return unto Jerusalem / Esra. 8.
ca 15, verse.
for the advancement off the service off God with Esra: it appears that there
were of all sorts off men which willingly accompanied Esra in his iorneye /
but of the the levites either priests / or which were simply levites / there
was not found one / until such time as Esra was feign to use his authority
which the king had granted him for the causing of them to come.

Unto the three next sections being reproaches / I answer not / for it is
unworthy to be answered / which he speaks off contrariety with my selffe /
because I acknowledge the Bishops my superiors / which would have equality off
the ministry.

To the next page i3. I answer.
IT is not enowghe for you to corrupt the holy scripture sentence by sentence
/ but you must also overthrow at once the meaning of three whole chapters
together. seems it a small thing in your eyes to confound things diverse /
but you must mingle those which are clean contrary. For S. Paul does not in
the eight / ninthe / and tenth chapters speak against those which strine
about owtward things / but quite contrary disputes against those which
meinteined the free use off all owtward things withowt exception: not against
the spiced conscience off some weak brethren / that made scruple off things
where was none / but against the senseles conscience of those / which under
pretense off liberty off owtward things / gave occasion of dangerous falls
unto the weaker brethren / and which considering only what was in the own
nature lawful / had no regard to the circumstances off place and persons /
wheryvpo^ he shows things otherwise in them selves lawful / to be throwgh
circumstances as towching the use unlawful. And especially in the tenth
chapter he confuteth the very self same reason / which the A. towieth so
roundly with in this place: which was / that for so much as the eatinge at
the Idolles feast / was but an owtward thing / and went no farther then to the
belly: therefore it was indifferent to be used or left at a man's discretion. So
the place (then the which their is none stronger in the whole body off the
Scripture / to bind and keep in the lauishe use off Christian liberty) that
the A callendgeth for the enlarging of it betonde the bounds that God has
set in his word.

And whereas he says that S. Paul declares their contentions which separate
them selves from the church for external things: S. Paul makes no mention
there either off contention or division from the church / neither in deed they
which abused then their liberty contended with the weaker / but contemned
them. Also off dividing them selves from the church in that place is not a
word / who soever will read those places with a little diligence / shall
easily perceive that this is the matter which the Apostle gives out in that
place. As touching external things for which the church of Christ may not
contend / they are such as (there being no commandment of God directly to
use them or not to use them) are left in the discretion of the faithful to be
ordered the most to Gods glory and edifiyng one off an other: therefore as I
think termed off learned writers external / for that they come not unto the
conscience / nor bind not yt. For otherwise that difference off external and
internal things / is not sufficient to give to understand / which are things
indifferent / or vnindifferent. For neither are all external things left to
our discretion / as I have showed: and there are some internal things / as
off certain inward thowghtes and opinions which are not imputed unto us for
sin / whether side soever we think or judge of them. As if I think in my
self that there was never such a Hector / or Achilles / or troy as is
described off Homere and virgill / I sin not: and if I think there was /
neither is that imputed unto me for sin. But these things which be in
controversy seeing we offer to prove them commanded / and necessary by the
word off God: how comes it to pass that you lashe out so many places out
off Bullinger / and Zuinglius against those / which trouble the church for
indifferent things: as thowghe you had already gotten that which you confess
by and by to be in trial: that these things which we demand are not
necessary? What order of judgment is this / first to give judgment or ever
the cause be heard? if you will needs be both party and Judge / at least
you should have saved these until you have as you promised showed the
vntreweth off our cause. And therefore hereafter as often as you do
importunatelie and vnstill fully heap so many places together: you shall have
for answer ^ plain blancke.

To the 16. sect. pa. 14.
WHether you have either scripture or godly learned author for your warrant in
your assertions / partly has been already showed / and more shall appear.
But you must learn that the part of a faithful teacher in the church of god /
is neither to propound any thing to the church / neither to reiecte that which
is propounded by other / off credit off any godly / learned / zealous man. And
althowghe this be to much / yet that which he writethe in the 200. page is to
far out of al square. Where he affirms that the argument off authority /
whether out off the Scriptures / or out off the interpretors off the Scripturrs
/ is the best reason that can be browght in divinity. To both I will answer
here in the beginning that the reader may have wherewithe he may beware / and
know how to estenie both his and our proufes. And first of all seeing the
Apostle teaches Timothy / that the Scripture inspired by 2. Tim. 3.
the holy ghost / is the only rule for the minister (which he calls the
man off god) either to establishe or overthrow what soever may fall in
question in the church: And S. Peter says that who soever speaks in the
church must speak as the words of god: And seeing all the godly zealous
learned men in 1 Epist. 4.
the world are not able to authorize or displace any doctrine in the church
withowt the word of god: I leave it to be considered how dau^gerouslye he
mainteineth his answer to be good for that it has ground either of the word
of god / or the judgment of some godly iearned man / and let it be waied
whether this be to set up an other Doctor in the church then Moses or our
savior Christ.

Touching that the authority off the Scripture in divine matters owght to
prevail / I willingly grant: but that the argument off the authority of
men which have interpreted the Scriptures / is the best reason in
controversies off divinity / but off the Papists (whose strongest towers are
in the testimonies off the Doctors) was never hard off. And thowghe there be
nothing more Papistical then this assertion: yet the doctor holding the name
and profession of the gospel / may to the utter subversion off it / cause
this to be printed and fly abroad. And that the authority off learned men
should be the best proof in divine matters / has more absurdities in yt /
then yt has words. For first their authority is here set in the same rank
with the authority off the Scripture / in that / as the authority off the
Scripturr / so it also / is set in the superlatiue degree off the best proof
Then their authority being preferred unto all reasons / is preferred unto the
reasons drawn out off the Scripture: which in every divinity cause almost /
besides the authority are diverse: drawn off the causes and off the effects
/ etc. Thirdly yt is absurd / to perferr the authority of any man (which is
only his bare affirmation) unto his one reason and discourse. And seeing the
end off proufes in controversies off diuinitye / is that faith may be
engendered in minds / which only can be grounded on the word off God: what
a miserable / yea what ^ cursed faith shall that be / that is hanged off the
authorit^^ off men: which be they never so learned / yet are they (because they
be men) Liars / such as deceive / and be deceived.

And whereas he says that an Argument off authority has an other weight in
our profession / then yt has in humane sciences: I confess it has so / if
the authority off the Scripture be considered: But as for the authority off
men / for the which cause he alleges this / y^ is far otherwise. For yff the
authority off man in humane sciences / and in men's matters / be off small
force: off how how much less force owght yt to be in Gods matters? yt is
clean contrary therefore to that the D. says. For although that Kind off
argument off the authority off men / is Good neither in humane / nor divine
science: yet it has some small force in humane sciences: for as much as
naturally / and in that he is a man / he may come to some rypenes off
Judgment in those sciences. Which in divine matters has no force at all / as
off him which naturally and as he is a man / can no more Judge off them / then
a blind man off colors. Yea so far is it from drawing credit if it be
barelie spoken withowt reason and testimony off Scripture: that it carries
also a suspicion off vntrewth / whatsoever proceeded from him / which the
Apostle did well note when to signify Romans 3.
a thing corruptly spoken / and against the truth / he says: that it is
spoken according unto man: he says not as a wicked or lying man / but symplie
as a man. And althowghe this corruption be reformed in many: yet for so much as
in whom the knowledge of the truth is most adva^ced / there remains both
ignorance / and disordered affections (wheroff either / turns him from
speaking off the truth) no man's authority with the church especially / and
those that are called and persuaded off the authority off the word off God /
can bring any assurance unto the conscience. So that if all that the D.
affirms were true (as it is untrue): and if all those authorities which are
alleged were faithfully / and according to the meaning off the writers cited
(as they are almost all writhen / and falsified) yet being for the most part /
vpholden by the bare authority and credit off men / they can give no rest to
any Christian conscience which shall lean upon them.

And if he say / that those men have not spoken withowt reason and warrant
off the word of god: then besides that he is greatly to blame / that brings
not the reasons which moved them to think so / and whereupon as upon certain
pillars that sentence might stand: it falls out still against him that the
argument off authority has no force: as that which has no credit off it
selffe / but as altogether lame is feign to borowe feet off an other. And then
the D. should have considered / that for so much as the reason off authority
stands for the cause and sake off an other / that is to say for the argument
off causes and other places: it must needs be worse then the arguments
whereupon it hangs. for that for whose cause another thing is / is better
the^ the thing which depends upon it. And thereby further follows that
for so much as reason withowt authority is good / and authority withowt reason
nothing worth: that those arguments which are grounded upon reasons / are
better then those which are grounded upon authority. And whereas peradventure
he will seek some color of defense off his absurd speech / in the words
which he adds (of such learned men as do rightly interpret the scripture:)
that addition as it takes not away from the absurdity: so it adds to the
folly and impropretie of speech. For besides that he takes that for granted /
which is the question / that is to say whether it be rightly interpreted or
no: he should have understood that the rightnes of the interpretation /
depends not upon the authority of the man / or in that such a godly or
learned man did so interpret it: but in that the place is expounded agreablie
unto the suite of the text.

And that the D. which under the name off ancient authority would oppress
the truth / may understand that even in this magnifiyng of authority / he is
not so good a scholar o^ disciple off his pretended masters: of diverse
sentences off the fathers them selves (whereby some have likened them unto brute
beasts withowt reason / which suffer themselves to be led by the judgment and
authority off others: some have preferred the judgment of one simple rude man
alleging reason / unto companies off learned men) I will content my selffe at
this time with two or three sentences. Ireneus says / Whatsoever is to be
shevved in the scripture: can not be shevved but of the scriptures the^ selves.
3. l. 12. c. Iero. says: No man be he never so holy or eloquent has any
authority after upon the 86. Psalm. Epist. 18.
the Apostles. Augustine says: that he will believe none how godly and learned
so ever he be unless he confirm his sentence by the scriptures or by some
reason not contrary to them. And in an other place / hear this the Lord says,
hear not this Donatus says, Rogatus says, Vicentius says, Hilarious,
Epist. 48.
says, Ambrose says, Augustine says, but harken to this the Lord says.

And again having to do with an Arrian / affirms: Against Maxim. ^ the
Arrian. 3. 14. chap.
that neither he ovvght to bring forth the council off Niece, nor the other
the council of Arimin, thereby to btinge prejudice each to other: neither
ovvght the Arrian to be houlden by the authority off the one, nor him selffe
by the authority of the other: but by the scriptures which are vvitnesses
proper to neither, but common to both, matter with matter, cause with cause,
reason with reason ovvght to be debated. And in another place against
Petiliane De vnitate ecclesiae cap. 3.
the donatian heretic he says: Let not these words be heatd between us, I
Say: you Say: let us hear this, Thus says the lord, and by and by
speaking off the scriptures he says there let us seek the church, there let
us try the cause Here yt is manifest that the argument of authority off man
affirmatively is nothing worth / which the answerer notwithstanding makes so
great accounts off: likewise that reason which is not directly against the
truth is preferred to authority which the A. denies. and if Augustine thowght
that in a matter off controversy the authority off so many godly and
learned fathers as were assembled at that Council off Nece interpeting the
scriptures rightly / owght not to be alleged not only to condemn and
convince / but not so much as to prejudice an heresy long agoo condemned: if
he would have the truth tried by the scripture only: let all men judge how
evil a follower off Augustine the D. is / which in the authority of one or two
men lays so great weight / that he thinks that kind off proof to be the
best proof off his and overthrow off his adversaries cause. And if at any
time Contr Julian Pelagiann^ lib. prim. lib. de nature. and great.
it happened unto him (as it did against the Donatistes* and others) to allege
the authorite off the ancient fathers which had been before him: yet that was
not done before be had laid a sure foundation off his cause in the scriptures
/ and that also being provoked by the adversaries off the treuth / who bare
themselves high off some Council / or off some man off name that had favored
their part. And therefore if the A. would salve this with the example off
Augustine in other places: yet for that he never in any cause lays any
foundation / either of any scripture or color of scripture: and being provoked
flies still from it / as from the rock and sands o his cause: it is clear
that if he had that authority which he pretends untruly on his side: yet
the use off it in this sort / were both by the rule off the word off god /
and example off the ancient fathers altogether unlawful. And so the
estimation which you have off the learned may easelie appear unto all men /
to be as they make for you / or against you: so that when they make for you
they are as sharp of sight as Egles: afterward when they are against you they
see no more then Iayes.

You give me adresse unto the wisest / godliest / and best learned amongst the
Ecclesiastical order / to know off them whether they think whith you: but
your address is very uncertain: for those are not always peradventure best
learned to me that are to you / and if you mean those which at there ease do
not unwillingly behold you in this wrestle for the crown of ease and honor
(whereoff they may be peradventure some) I may yet have Good cause to doubt /
whether they be off that judgment with you / or at least whether they would
oppugn this cause as you do. for albeit they be content to take some fruit
off your labor: yet it follows not always that they would do the like them
selves. You know that there are some which will receive that which is taken by
others / that would not venture them selves to take yt: and Jerome Ier. 3. To
praefat in Job.
writes some where: that faults even confessed please oftentimes.

Unto the three next sections
THat your counsel unto the reader off lookinge before he leap is Good:
only I admonish that he look by the candell light off the word off God. For
that off allteringe our Judgment yt comes after to be answered page 45. Unto
that which follows in the 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. I will answer
nothing / saving that for the proof off that which I have set down and he
denies towchinge the advantage taken by the faults off the printer: I refer
the reader to the corrections in the end of the admonition. And where he
denies that the admonition quoted any places for the phrase off speech / and
not the proof off matter: to goo no further / I refer him to the first page
/ where the 7. and 11. off S. Matthew are noted for the phrase / and can by no
means be drawn whether he would draw them.

To the 27. sect. page 24.
WHere he accuses me that I answer not to this sectione in the next line I
answer to it: for confessinge it to be a fallation / and showing afterward how
untruely it is objected / what more could I answer?

To the 28. page 25:
HEre M. D. sekinge busily to hide his nakedness / finds not so much as a
fig leaf to cover his shame with all. Na in sekinge a hole to hide it in he
has met with a hill to show it further of. He accusethe me of dishonestie /
that I have falsified his words in saying that he affirms it To be a thing
indifferent to come to the communion clothed or naked for that he has not
used this word (indifferent). you bind me very straight if you will let me
use no other words then you / that which you said in many words I uttered in
one. I refuse not to be counted dishonest / if I have differred in sense from
you. For whether that be a thing indifferent or no / which is neither
commanded in the scripture nor by necessary collection may be gathered
theroff: I leave it to the Judgment off all those / which have learned that
the scripture is a perfect rule off all things public or private necessary
to be done off a Christian man: which thing also after is more at large
declared. And where the gloss says / that the proof out off S. Paul that it
is no indifferent thing For men to come either clothed or naked is superfluous:
I merueile that he sees not that it is directly against that he sets down
which is / that it can not be showed out of the scripture either by plain
words or by necessary collection, that men and women owght not to come naked
unto the communion. yt was peradventure more then he would have had / but his
absurd assertion required it. After he says he knows it is necessary to
comelines / that a man or woman come clothed: but he denies it to be
particularly expressed in the scriptures* as though this were all one with
that which he set down before / and that there were no difference between
these sayings: yt is not commanded in the scriptures, nor can by no
necessary collection be gathered off them, with this it is not particularly
expressed in the scriptures. And to help to cleanse M. D. Master Ridley a
singulier learned man and constant martyr of Christ must be defiled with this
gross error. Who althowgh being a man might well err: yet it is incredible
that a man of his learning and godliness / could fall in so plain a way as
this. Therefore / unless it be made to appear / I can not believe that ever he
wrote so and if he did / I am sure he is well content that as stubble it
should pass through the fire.

Where you ask why I took that example and left the rest: I gave you the
reason for that the other came to be spoken off more properly in another place
/ and that was only found there: besides that they are far off another
sort then this. Now let me ask you: why you placed that with the rest /
seeing you confess these in other places to be things indifferent / and at the
order off the church: and here deny that you propounded this as a thing
indifferent. if you grant the other to be indifferent / and deny this to be
so / you did evil in couplinge them together which were not matches: yff you
say they are all off one sort / and confess that the other be indifferent
then I have truly reported your judgment / in saying that you houlde this
also as a thing indifferent.

The like cavil unto this / is that he charge me as thowgh I had falsified
his saying / for that I put in stead of his word Argument fallation. I would
know off him whether when he finds fault with the arguments off the
Admonition, he mean to find fault with true Arguments or false. if (as
needs must) he answer false arguments: I say that there is no difference
between a false argument and a fallation, saving that the word fallation is
more proper / and the other word in this signification is used (...), or (as I
may term it) abused: for in deed a false argument argues nothing: and
therefore is no argument / no more then a peinted man is a man. And where he
says that I am not ignorant that there are many false arguments / which be
not amongst the fallations: and further askethe to what fallation this and
that is referred: albeit I could show his ignorance in them / especially in
the two last / yet because that were to draw the reader to moo questions and
those altogether impertinent unto this matter / I will stopp up this head /
and put you in remembrance / that if al were granted you that you demand /
yet your fault remainethe still. For I noted your unskillfulness / in that you
setting down certain arguments which you referred to the fallation off
Secundum qui^, afterward make the arguments off authority negatiuely, and
negatiues by comparison, two several kind off arguments from the first /
which notwithstanding are not diverse / but contained under the former place.
And that we walk not altogether in the clouds from the understanding off the
simpler / yt is all one as yff a man should say / there are three sorts off
English men / one sowthren / the other Bentishe / the third Middlesex. Yff
Master Crammer never used such Logic / such a personage has great injury
to be compelled to communicate with this absurdity: for it nothing helps
you that he used this manner off speech off Negatiues by comparison, unless
that you show that he makethe them a several kind from those off Secundum
quid. And when M. D. is not afraid to offer these unto the taste off the learned
men / he askethe me whether I blushe not trifle in this sort. The trewthe is:
I am ashamed to have tarried so long in so small a matter / and if you had
charged me withe^ ignorance only / and not with falsifiyng your words / I
would (I assure you) have let you gone withal: and I will promise you from
he^ceforth what occasion so ever you give this ways / (except it be
manifestly joined with defense off the cause) you shall do yt withowt answer.
Where he complainethe off want off answer in the next section / he does me
wrong / seeing I referred him to another place for answer. To the next section
I have answered.

To the next sect. page 28.
IF this sentence (he that is a good and a modest preacher will not disdain
as well to be taught as teach) be not an idle vagabonde / and broken loose from
all his follows: then it must needs be a reason off that wherein you said
before / that you knew no man so well learned, but yt might become him to read
and learn Master Nowellles Cathechisme and the Argument is as I have gathered
it. For you to prove that yt becomes the authors off the admonition to learn
that Cathechisme / add that the place off Timothy / does not forbidd to
learn. And again a Modest preacher will not disdain to be taught. So that
this is your argument / A modest preacher must be taught / therefore he must
learn that Cathechisme / and therefore must be enjoined to learn yt. And if
you say that you set yt down to show / that no man is so well learned but he
may learn still / or to show that the place off Saint Paul does not forbidd
to learn: I ask to what purpose? Considering that the authors off the
admonition / do not deny that a Minister owght to learn: but that yt is
unmeet for a Mynister to be enjoined to learn Cathechismes. And as for all
the arguments which the D. gatherethe himself out off this place / they are
so many witnesses against him / that he fowght with his own shadow. For
where he still concludethe they may read Cathechismes / he concludes that
which the admonition denies not: but that which the admonition denies to be
meet / (which is to drive a minister to learn Cathechismes) he never
concludes. Yt shall be therefore at your own choice / whether you will have that
your argument that I have framed / or else that you have not spoken to the
matter.

Unto the 32: sect: page: 28:
IN orators I grant it is a great point off art / to hide art / that it

plainer way has always been most commendable. So that if this were your
order / yt had been good that you had set up some mark by a transition /
whereby we might have understood yt. I know not what happened unto others /
but I confess I saw no such order. I see this / which also is true in your
former answers / that in goinge abowte to heal one wound / you give your
selffe an other. for going abowte to put from you the absurdity off this
argument / you confess that you bestow great labor to prove that / which was
not in controversy between the admonition and you: the other shall be seen in
there places.

To the next section answer shall be made in the place whereunto he refers us.
For the next unto that: I answer that this is a vain shift / the advantage
wheroff he can not take to excuse his folly. For this reason which he here
alleges / he had cited out off Master Bucer / and Master Martyr / page 258
/ and immediately after in the page. 239. he pretends that he will bring
other reasons / besides this to prove that the surplis does edify: and
therefore begins a fresh with furthermore, and then adds Secondly,
whereas if it be true which he here alleges / in his pretense off going
further / he stands still and remoueth not an ynche. For the next unto that /
I say as I said before / and refer it to the judgment of the reader /
whether I have not only not corrupted your meaning / but almost conceived
mine argument in the same words which you use. And where you so boudlie (in
asking) affirm that capp gown and tippet used in popery are good signs /
for that they are signs of good things / namely off the ministers off the
word: I showed how untrue that rule is in the 57. and 60. pages / against
which if you have any thing to say / you shall there understand further.

To the next page 30.
MD. takes it for a thing assured / that the authors of the adminitio^ in
saying that those that first authorized the book of common prayer / were
studious off peace / and buildinge off the church / meant that they were so /
in collectinge and authorisinge that book: for why else says he should they
speak of them? I answer that they had good occasion to say so / to meet
with slanderous tongues / which for the mislikinge off some things done by
them / are ready to charge them as thowghe they condemned the men / or misliked
off all things they did. And although that be granted which he presumes
upon / yet the fault off the argument remains the same it did. for thowghe
they were studious off peace and buildinge the church in so doing: yt might
well be that they took not the best way to peace / and propounding them selves
a good end / chose not the best means of coming thereunto. And for this
purpose (if I be not deceived) in our Ecclesiastical story off king Edwards
times / it is set forth / how upon. suit made by the Emperor / that the lady
Marie which then was / might for her self have the exercise off the mass: M.
Crammer / and Master Ridley / and I know not who moo / became suitors to the
kings majesty / that the request off the Emperor might take place. I dowbt
not but those good men / were studious off the peace and buldinge off the
church in this request / and propounded that for their end: and yet king
Edward that resisted their request / was neither puller down off the church /
nor disturber off the peace / but pleased god / and left a notable example to
all posterity off Kings and Queens / that they should not for any respect
of kindred / league / or allie / suffer any such pollution in their lands.

The same also might be fall unto them in gatheringe off the book / for it
may well be / that there purpose was / by that tempere off popish ceremonies
with the gospel / partly the easelier to draw the papists to the gospel /
(whilst fearing that they would not frame them selves to yt yt should be some
what framed unto them) partly to redeem peace thereby / the breach wheroff they
feared might have ensued off such a perfect and throwgh change / as the
sincerity off the gospel required. Yff this were there purpose they were
studious of peace and buildinge of the church / but yet erred in the mean: so
it appears / that it being granted which the A. demands / yet my
gathering off his argument is justified.

To the 37. sect. page 30.
Why should you note here that Cyprians place was abused by the Papists? yt
is besides your purpose / and contrary to the law to leave your match with
whom your are collered / and take you to a stander by. For so vnhappelie is it
come to pass / that the papists / (whose disorders and corruption off the
discipline off Christ were here oppugned) have found you their champion to
fight for them / whilst they look on. And to what end seruethe this
headless arrowe / not shot / but picked out against the Papists? They are
(god be praised) substantially convinced off the corruption off this place off
Cyprian / by diverse learned men: so that this bare affirmation / that Cyprian
speakethe not off the usurped authority off the Bishopp off Rome, besides yt
is out off season / does rather move laughter / and confirm the enemy in his
obstinacy / then give him remedy against his error. But what weighethe this
word (for) in our language / is it not a causall / and renders a reason off
that which goethe before? Which you have therefore by all lykelihoode left out
/ that this poor shifte might have some color. the rest is answered before.
Unto the next I answer / that yt shall appear when I come to that place /
whether there be such reasons or no.

In the next sectio^ he charge me in great words with untruth / and
askethe me where I find in the ^3. page this argument / that by that there was
one offeuerie congregation / he prouethe that there was one over a whole
province. To whom I answer that in that he concludethe an Archebishopp over a
province / upon Ignatius places which speak off a Bishop in every church he
makethe: the same argument which I have made.

To the next page 32. being bare denials and false accusations / I answer not

Unto the next sect. page 33.
Leaving his untrue accusations / I answer / that where he says that the
case off Luther and Zuinglius off Circumcision and preaching unto gentilles /
which I alleged are not like / for that they be substantial points of
religion / and these be not: it is his oulde cuckoes song. For we offer to
prove this also off the substance off Religion. And I browght the examples
only to show / that to be untrue which he goethe about to persuade / that all
those which contend where the gospel is preached / are to be holden for
disturbers. The Other difference which he places in that Luther and Zuinglius
did that which they did in strininge about the Sacrament / by consent off
their several magistrates: although he does not make that appear: yet I
ask him what Zuinglius / etc. should have done / if the Magistrate would not
have suffered him to answer: should he have suffered the truth to be destitute
off his defense? Where he cites out off Zuinglius that the gospel is a sword
to divide the faithful, and therefore that this doctrine which has made a
division in the church can not be good: I answer that although he might well
say it to the Anabaptists / and that yt so comethe to pass for the most
part: yet that can be no general rule / consideringe that the preaching that
circumcision was not necessary / although it divided those off the church
which believed it from those that did not believe it:: yet those which did not
believe it / did not there fore cease to be off the church / and off the number
off the faithful.

The Sermon which our Savior Christ had amongst his disciples / and those that
believed in him touching that his Io^^^^*
flesh was the true meat / and his blood the true drink / which who soever
did not eat and drink could not have life in him / did make such a cut
amongst the Disciples / that all (saving John 6. 66.
twelve) departed from our Savior Christ. Yff they made a full departure and
Apostasy / it is evident that the gospel cures even those which be in the
church clean from it: yff they did not utterly forsake the gospel / but
offended at that sermon were not as before daily folowers off our savior
Christ: yet it is clear that that doctrine of the gospel / did make
apartition between the twelve / and those other which went there ways / in
that they believed that sermon / which the other did not / they were taught /
and the other offended. Whereupon it follows / that either the doctrine which
our Savior Christ preached / was not the truth: or else the truth may
sometimes / divide the faithful amongst themselves.

I could cite diverse other examples both out off the Acts off the Apostles /
and out off S. John: but these shall suffice to show the vanity off M. D.
reason. And if he will say that if he err / M. Zuinglius errethe with him:
he is vecelie unworthy the name off a Divine / that carethe not how often he
fallethe / so he may fall with company. Howbeit I have showed how M.
Zuinglius saying may be vpholden / and yet make nothing for the confirmation
off that which he would prove.

To the next. pa. 36.
IT fares with M. D. as with malefactors: which having left something
behind them whereby they may be known / for fear off that which follows /
renounce it utterly to be theirs. But that the conclusion off all these
articles is as I have set down / that is to say / that the authors off the
admonition are either Anabaptists / or in the way to Anabaptisme (albeit he
here deny yt:) I report me to the conscience off all those that shall read
him. And let his words be considered / which be that Anabaptiisme is almost
plainly professed in the admonition, and so be judged whether I have truly
gathered his meaning yea or no. I have spoken so plainly in that the Answerer
makes so strange / and weroff he requires more open speech / that I can not
speak plainlier. I use the words which are worn in all schools and writers
which have occasion to speak off these matters: I gave that which I said light
by examples. Notwithstanding he can not see / how the Ministry off England
may be commonly and for the most part unlawful / and not right / and yet
some found which either may have there calling according to the word off god
/ diverse from that which is commonly used: or else (the lawful calling by the
church ceasing) have it by an immediate calling from God. If M. D. will Ier.
3. To praefat in Job.
be so ignorant / as not to know how these two may stand together: let him be
ignorant: if he delight in his blindness / what should he do with a guide.

After he says my distinction is not good off lavvfull and ordinary: for that
whatsoever is lawful in a church established, the same is ordinary, and for
proof hereoff he adds that common reason teaches it: but what is that
common reason / it had been good you had set it down. This is a simple
confutatio^ which you use / to prove that in an established church / lawful
and ordinary are all one. And if I should reply and say / that the
distinction is good / and that common reason teaches so: if I light off as
favorable a reader as you / my proof will be as good as yours* but this is but
to abuse the time / and to delude the world. And it is the more intolerable /
that you are not content to have said it once withowt proof / unless it be
also quoted in the margent / as thowghe we could not withowt some great damage
/ want this high saying. And where you make common reason the judge hereoff
(althowghe she be an evil scholemistris oftentimes in these cases) yet she
teaches here plainly against you. For if a man will consider it in natural
things / yt is evident in the birthe off children / that some thing is lawful
/ which is not ordinary. It is nor ordinary for a woman to bring forth three
or four children at once / and yet it is lawful. And if this common reason be
considered also in political things: there it shall appear likewise / that
things are lawful in a well governed and established common wealth / which
are not ordina^rie As if order be taken that none shall clime the walls of the
city / and the citizens climinge the wall upon the sodeine coming off the
enemy / drive him back: no man can deny but this act is lawful / and yet
it is clear / that it is not ordinary / being otherwise (but in such a case
as this) punishable.

But let these goo / and let us see how this oracle agrees with the word off
god. And first if by a church established / you mean a church which has
one uniform order grounded out off the word off god: you take that for
granted which is the controversy / for we deny that the church off England
is so established. But if you understand by a church established / a church
of god vvherin (with other things well done) the corruptions which are in yt
/ are by common consent off those which rule the church / agreed upon: it is
manifest that in such a church / there has been a calling lawful / which was
not ordinary. For before the coming off our Savior Christ / it is confessed
that there was amangest the Jews (and in Jerusalem especially) a church of
god established / the ordinary ministeries off the priests and Levites used /
the prescribed sacrifices offered / the law read and taught: the corruptions of
the church were not the several opinions of particular persons / but the
uniform decrees off those which had the government. And yet there the lord
raised up Simeon / and John Baptiste / whose vocations being extraordinary /
were notwithstanding lawful. And that there be no hole for M. D. to hide his
bouldnes off castinge forth whatsoever takes him first in the head: it is to
be showed that in the most orderly established churches off god / and most
purelie reformed according to the word of god / there have been ministers
lawful / and yet not ordinary.

In the wilderness the church under the conduite off Moses and Aaron / was for
the owtward face exactlie governed according to the rule that god had given
theroff: and yet we read off the 72. upon whom the spirit of Prophecy fell /
which was no ordinary calling / as that which endured but for a time as the
words of the text (howsoever they be otherwise translated) do declare / which
says / that they added not Number. 11. 25.
to prophecy any more. When was the church better established according to
the rule off the word of god / then in David's time? and yet then (besides
himselffe) there were diverse extraordinary ministers. For there was the
Prophet Natha^ / and Gad / with others not off the Leuiticall order / which
only was the ordinary calling off the church. In the new Act. 15.
Testament the church off Antioche / ceased not after it was established / to
have the extraordinary function off Prophets. And onless. M. D. will say /
that all these functions were unlawful: he must confess that in an
established church / ordinary and lawful are not all one. And albeit in
these times where there is a church established according to the word off
god / the lord does not use to raise up any such extraordinary ministry /
neither is it to be looked for: yet yt is a thing which may come to pass /
and which has nothing in the word off god to the contrary. In stead of
that you say If any church in England do elect there minister otherwise
then the laws off the church does permit, it can not be excused off
schism: you should have said / otherwise then the word off god does
permit. For if it be showed that that order established be corrupt / and
the other which they followed in the calling off their minister according to
the word of god: then they need not to be afraid off the slander off
schism. And where you say such and such parishes must be looked unto,
verily they need not therein be ashamed who look upon them. But If ear the
look you mean is / to put out their eye in taking away the Minister / that
they should be the less hable to look unto your unfaith full dealing withdraw
the churches off God. You understand not you say what I mean, when I say
that the choice off the Minister by the church is such, as the examples off
the scripture do show to have been before the Eldershipp and government off the
church be established. I know in deed these things before have been unheard
off by you / whose ignorance the church must rue. And now when you are told
it in so plain words / as I nothing dowbte but a child off nine years oulde
does understand yt: you can not yet comprehend it. Yt was the practice off
the Pharisees against our Savior Christ / when they John 10. 24.
had nothing to answer / to charge him that he spoke not plainly / but
propounded things dowbtfully that men could not tell where to have him. For
they come unto him and say / how long do thou hold us in suspense? If
thou be Christ tell us plainly: as thowghe he had not told them plainly
before. This Pharisaicall practice the D. uses against me diverse times /
gropinge at noone days / and complaining that I am not plain and open enoughe
/ and going about to make men believe / that I have some thing that I would not
have men understand. And although he confess he understand it not / yet he
reprehendeth it / and so it comes to him which S. Jude chargethe the false
teachers with in his time / that he Iud. 5. 10.
speaks evil off that he knows not. He asks here for examples / and they
stick still in his throat vnswalowed and undigested / which the admonition
gave him: when he has overcome those / then let him ask for more examples.
And whereas he ascribethe as a great absurdity to us / that we make the order
off chusinge the minister before the eldershipp and government be established,
somewhat diverse from that which is before, putting this florishe upon it:
that we allow off all things out off order though against our own order, so
it be against common order: I will not goo abowte to confute that here / or to
show what good cause there is off this diversity (it being sufficiently
declared in that book / which together with the right form off government
commanded out off the word off god / notethe the disorders off our church)
only I will ask M. D. whether the consecration (as it is called) off the
Archbishops and Bishopps at the first entry off the Queens majesty / was
the same altogether withdraw that which has been since. And if there were
a difference between that and this: then in this great desire off his to
stricke he care not how / nor after What sort / his struck is fallen upon
him selffe / and upon those whom he undertakes to defend.

That the words off the admonition have not that sense which is here ascribed
unto yt / I have showed in the proper place: neither will I touch it here /
although the A. set it twenty times before me. Yff he have any thing to say
against that which I have said / there it shall be considered. Although here
the D. was taken eue^ in the very act of false coyninge: yet he shameth not
to deny yt / and with that bloudnes and foreheade / that he is ready also to
accuse him that takes him with the manner. He bids me peruse more
diligently the words off M. Bullingar. I have perused them / and set them
down / first in latin and then in English: and if I have not turned them
truly / show wherein I have faulted: and if they be truly turned / then I
demand again / where these words be found in any of those leaves of
Bullinger which you quote / That they could not teach truly because they
had great liuinges? You say they be word for word there, show but the same
sense or meaning / that is to say that this off M. Bullingers that the
Anabaptists said they could not teach the truth which had any living, is
all one with that which you have set down / that they can not teach the
truth which have great liuinges. And if you can not show it: your
falsification remains increased with the open facing of an untruth. In
deed if you can put out all men eyes / and take away from us our senses / and
all light off grammar / and off the knowledge off signification and propriety
off words: it will not be impossible for you with such confident speeches as
you use / to make us believe that all is turned vpside down / and that the
earth hangs over our heads / and the heavens are underneath our feet. but
you deceive your selffe / if you think that yovve can bear down the truth
so / or that you can hide falshoode by adding another unto yt / whereby it is
made bigger and more easy to be seen then before.

The place added out off M. Zuinglius Ecclesiastes / makes nothing to the
saluinge off your falshoode: and how far our men (as it pleasethe you to call
them) are far from all such sayings / I have before declared. Yff you show
as you say that I do give to little unto the magistrate / I will confess my
fault and confess my felse detter unto you for yt. As for the cleanelines off
my terms which I use / they are not so foul as the things whereunto they are
applied / and the prophet Malachy and S. Paul used them in honester matters
then Mala. 2. 3. Phil. 3. 8.
these are: so that if the phrase off the Apostles and Prophets be manerly
enoughe / there is less godliness in you / which in me houe thus accused them
off inciuilitie. Unto the next section page 40. I answer not.

To the 44. sect. page 41. I grant the corruptions off the church of England
to be such / that man in absteininge from the pollutions theroff / owght not
so sever him self from those open assemblies / wherein the eternal word off
the Lord God is preached and the Sacraments administered / although not in
that purity which they owght to be. But I say again / that the name off
conuenticles is to light and conte^ptuous for those meeti^ges. For here in is
to be considered for what cause they departed. Which was not for the mis
likinge off any thing which Christ ordained / but through the mislike off
that which Antechrist had browght in: not as the Anabaptists did / and the D.
surmiseth they did / for that they judged them selves pure and others vnpure /
but that they feared that their presence where such corruptions were / should
be allowance or confirmation off them: not so much forth hatred off the
estate / off the church off England / as forth love that they had to a
better: nor so much for the hatred off the Ministers which were unjustly set
over them / as for the love off those which were unlawfully by the Bishops
taken from them. Thedorete declares how the Catholics which maintained the
faith of the Nicenc council / Lib. 3. c. 4
through affection to their teachers / divided and severed them selves into
several co^paines: will the. A. faie that all their meetinges were
conuenticles? if he do / he speakethe far otherwise off them then
Theodorete: and yet that division continued 86. years.

And if this be off no authority whith you / yet I would gladly understand
/ what you will answer to the sentence off M. Calvin / which you have
alleged your selffe page ^1. where he says: This honor is meet to be given
to the word off god and to the Sacraments, that wheresoever we see the
word off God truly preached, and the Sacraments vvithovvt superstition
Ministered: there we may conclude vvithovvt all controversy the church to be.
If this meeting with some disorder be the church off god / how is it a
conuenticle? Besides that it ought to have been considered off you / whether
they continued in that division / and whether being taught and showed their
error / they did obstinately persevere: according to which circunstance that
off Augustine owght to be expounded / for not every one which departethe for
any cause whatsoever from that which is the church off God / by and by is to
be accoumpted no membre of the church. For 1. Cor. 11. ca. 18. 19.
seeing that heresy is more heinous then a scisme / and yet heresy does not
cut a man from the church / unless he remain obstinate: much less can a
scisme cause forthwith him that faulteth that ways / to be no member off the
church. S. Paul found greater scismes in the church off Corinthe then those
were: and yet he rebuked them with an other spirit then you use: neiter does
he cut them of from the church / but in the spirit off mildnes restores them.
And if you had learned that you ought not to break a bruised reed nor quench
the smoking flax: you would have dealte otherwise then you do.

If so be that the church of England were reformed (as Mat. 1*
you would bear us in hand) and the Bishops by castinge out off their
ministers out off their churches / had not given the occasion of such
departure: the departure had been more intolerable / And therefore as much as
you add to the amplisyinge of their fault: so much you increase off the sin^e
of the bishops / which withowt just cause / gave occasion of that division
There is great difference between the preaching off the Anabaptists and
heretics / and the preaching off those brethren. for the Anabaptists and
other heretics preachinges be with the upholding off their false opinions /
and doctrine contrary to Scripture werwith you are not able to charge them in
the least point: but that in all doctrine which you preach truly they preach
the same with you. And where you say Disiuncrely that oftentimes the word of
god is preached amongst the Anabaptists and heretics, or the Sacraments
administered: in those congregations which you make Anabaptists / or like unto
them / both the word was preached and the Sacraments Ministered together. And
therefore if you did purposely put that (Or) rather then and: then whilst you
vvrote / your conscience offered you a manifest difference between the
Anabaptists and those brethren. And if you did not put yt purposely / but
mean that in the conuenticles off the Anabaptists and heretics both the
word off god is preached / and his sacraments administered speaking so
precisely: I would gladly know off you what difference you make between the
conuenticles of the Anabaptists and heretics / and the church off God /
seeing that the preaching off the word and ministering off the sacraments are
the infallible notes thereoff. Ind this ought to have given you occasion off a
softer word / yff you had not been driven by the tempeste of your affection /
rather then led by any quiet and stayed judgment off the truth. Because it is
your oulde wont / and either you can not or will not prove or improve your
sayings by the word off god: I will not stand to note how that upon Augustins
word only / withowt any proof out off the word off god / you have here cut
a number from the church. if you bind so hard / and lock so fast: you should
have brought the bond and Keye off the word off god / that the conscience
(which only looks unto the word off god) saying it selffe in that danger /
might be careful to seek how to be delivered. The gloss and the Text vary
here. For the one (in saying that it stands me good name upon, to bring them
out which are free will men and hold consubstanstantiation seems to deny that
there be any such: The other by saying that the^re are not so many, and that
they are not justified: do the indirectlie confess it. And if yt were not
confessed / the thing is so notorious / that albeit I name them not / yet I
need not to fear the supition off untruth / in that which has so many
witnesses. And where you say there are not so many off them as off those whom
you most falsely and slander ouslie call puritanes: As I rejoice therein in the
behalffe off the church off England / so it stands not by any diligence /
good foresight / or discipline off yours / that the church swarmeth not with
them / saying they are suffered to have the highest places in the church /
where (with the leuaine off their false doctrine) they may sour not one
town / as it were three peckes: but whole shires / as it were a whole heap
/ or fat / or other off the largest measures off the lords meal in our
country. And so although they be not by words maintained: yet they are in
deed not only maintained / but also by such sufferance in those places
rewarded. Unto the nine next sections I answer nothing. Ephesians. 4. 13. Coloss.
3. 10.


In the last section 45. page unto the places off Saint Paul (vvherby I prove
that yt is no breach off true Christianity to alter in judgment) he
answers / that the Apostles meaning is not that men should be daily
altering their judgment, and broching new opinions, which is no answer to the
question. For althowghe we may not daily broche new opinions: yet we owght
to correct our oulde errors / as often as we are made understand them. So
that unless he will say / that those which believe the gospel are vvithowte the
danger off error / in things perteining to the government off the church /
etc. or that when they know their errors they should not amend them (boothe
which are absurd): it must needs follow / that he goes abowte to abuse the
reader / which upon that we have changed Judgment / vvoulde draw us into
the suspicion off lightness and inconstancy. And seeing the church off England
changed the book of common prayer twice or thrice / after yt had received the
knowledge of the gospel / and allwaies corrected some thing off that which
yt held for good before: either the answerer must condemn those alterations
as childishe and unconstant / or else he must confess that a whole church
lightened with the knowledge off the gospel / and established in a certain
order off government / may with owte fear off suspicion off that li^ghtenes
which he does surmise / displace the former order and place an other. Unto the
4. next I answer nothing / saving that where the gloss charge me with
contrariety: I desire the reader to consider what contraririe or what color
off contraritie there is / between these sayings / the church can not long
continevve vvithovvt common vvelthes, and the church may be established
vvithovvt a Christian magistrate. Yff I had said that the church might be
established witheowt a magistrate: then there had been some likelihood off the
contrarietye he surmyseth. But he should understand / as long as their be
magistrates / althowghe they be not only unchristian / but Tyrannical and
persequuting: yet the blessing which the lord gives unto his own ordinance /
so ouercometh all their malice: that there cease not come even from that
disordered government / some thing to the preseruacion of the church. The
answer which his gloss asks for / towching churlishe answering (althowghe
yt deserved none) is page 177. and he could not be ignorante / but I referred
him in the answer / to the seventh article.

Unto the first part off the last Section page 47. I answer nothing. For
answer unto the later part towching the place of Timothe (whereby he would
prove that men may offer them selves to the ministry) I will refer the
reder to the treactise off the discipline off ^he church lately set forth /
where this is answered at large. Unto the four next sections I answer nothing
/ saving that where in the second sec^ pa. 5^ he says that master Calvin in
his book against the Anabaptists affirmethe / that the church as towching
the external policy can not be perfect: I do assure my selffe that (as in
other places) so here / he has untruely said off Master Calvin. And yt
cannot b^ unknown but in Moses and the Apostl^^ times / there was a perfect
patru^ of the owtwarde gouernernment off the churches / both given off the
lord and received off the churches. neither can there be any part of the
owtwarde government off the church / assigned by the answerer / which draws
any such impossibility with yt as he imagines. And if he say / that there
were faults committed against those perfect patrones: that is not to the
purpose. For the faults off particular persons do no more overthrow the
perfection off the government which was received: then the faults off the
officers in our church against the laws theroff / are to be imputed unto the
laws them selves whereby that government stands. And as for the examples off
the churches off Corinthe and Galatia which he alleges: they rather make
against him. For that disorder which the Apostle charge them with / being a
slyding back / and falling away from that estate wherein they were first off
all set by the Apostell: argues that there was a time / when the contrary off
those disorders had place in their churches.

In the next section he alleges diverse examples to prove / that enemies one
with another conspire against the trewthe, which no man do which / and where
I showed that the churches fri^des / may do some things which some of the
churches enemies do / against him (which in that the admonitors do certain
things with the Papiste and Anabaptists / would give to understand / that
they are conspired with the^): he answerethe that the admonitors conspire with
the enemies off the church in things which are against the church, which
is a manifest begging off that which is in controversy. Towching that which I
said he has tawght / that there is no commandment in the scripture to put
heretics to death: althowghe he deny that ever he did so: yet beside that he
mainteineth the same in the second treatise (where he leaves yt in the
liberty off the magistrate whether he will do yt or no / and rejects all
the laws off God provided in that behalf as Iewis he: there be moo witnesses
off this / then his bare denial is hable to bear down. to whose knowledge I
will so report me in this behalf / that if they confirm not the same: I
refuse not to bear the blame off that report. where he says there is no
cause that he should be better thought of emonge the papists, which teach
and practice the contrary: although the Papists abuse this doctrine to the
horrible murder off the church / yet the doctrine is the doctrine off god /
and not the Papists: and you by staying the course off yt / nourishe them to
the day off slawghter / and shedding off the blood off the saints off god /
which is their feast / and which they so greatly delight in / and long
after. In althat which follows unto the first tractate / which beginneeth
page 62. there is nothing worth the answer. And as for that whole tractate /
because yt pertains to the question off lordeshipp / and dominion off the
Archebishopps over the bishops / and off the Bishopps over the rest off the
Ministers: yt shall be referred to the beginning off the 8. Tractate / where
the answerer shall receive his reply

What authority the church has in making off orders.
Chapter 1. page 77.
THe plaster vvherwithe the answerer would heal his unskillfulness in the
expounding off tollerating in the church. by these words placing in the
church, will not clean. For to let pas the meanig off the admonition (which
he should have showed if he maintain his answer by yt / and not as he doothe
(contrary to all law of disputation) bid me prove that their meaning was not
so as he supposes) I say to let that pas: yt appears by bis plain words
/ that this exposition was not framed in regard off the meaning off the
admonition / but for that he knew not what difference there was between
placinge in the church, and tollerating in the church. For himselffe
confesses that this is the principal ground of their book / that those
things only should be placed in the church / which the lord himself in
his word com^aundethe. and ascribing this judgment unto them he afterward
expounds / that to be as much as if they should have said: that nothing
should be tolerated, etc. yff this be their principal ground that nothing be
placed, etc, (as the A. confessethe:) and placing in the church is not the
same that tollerating in the church (as he doothe also confess:) yt must
follow that the principal ground off the admonition / was not (as he says)
that nothing should be tolerated in the church not commanded by the word.
And his words do discharge the admonition off any such assertion. For in
that he says / that their meaning was (so far as he could gather) that
nothing should be placed, etc. yt is manifest that in saying now that they
mente that nothing should be tolerated, etc. he charge them farther / then
he was then hable to gather off their book.

Afterward he chargethe me / with an unadvised and a popish assertion / for
that I say: that many things are commanded in the scripture which are not
expressed in yt. He neded not to have travailed far / to have seen how far I
am from popery in in this point: if he would have but considered / the
words which follow in the same division: that god has set before us in his
word, a perfect patron off his church. But I was at least ouerseene in
this kind off speech. Alas if he would understand his grammar / and
acknowledge that which simple scholars off the gram^er school do well know /
that their is difference between expressed and contained, between expressed
and included, between expressed and implied, between expressed and gathered:
He would never have troubled the reader with such folies. And as for that
which I set down / I did yt upon Good grounds. For who is there which
knows not / that these things / that there is one essence and three persons
in the godheade / that there is in our Savior Christ one parson and two
natures: are not expressed / but only contained in the word off God?

And if proof must be had off things (which is to great shame for one that
cariethe the title off a divine to be ignorant off) let the answerer know /
that learned divines speak afte this sort / Their words be these. Off the
father, of the Acta Ratilboncusia.
Son, and holy ghost, there is one nature one essence and three persons: In
Christ our lord there be two natures and one person, and many other things
which the catholic church doothe receive, rather laid out by the
interpretation Quam ipsaru^ scripturaru^ verbis expressa ipsis tamen scripturae
verbis implicida.
off the Scriptures / then expressed in the words off the Scripture. Here the
answerer may learn / that certain off the cheiff pillars off our Religion / by
the Judgment off this council are not expressed in the word off God / and
yet notwithstanding both contained in the word off God / and commanded to be
believed.

And where he says that he cou^ntethe that expressed in the scripture when yt
is either in manifest words contained, or theroff gathe red by necessary
collection: I answer / that I suppose / that there was never writer / holy nor
profane / that ever spoke so: and that yt byddethe defiance both to de
vinitie / and humanity / being forged (as yt is to be feared) contrary to his
own knowledge / only that he might give some color unto that absurdytie /
which he would so gladlye fasten on me. I say that it is against his own
knowledge: forasmuch as in his former book / and even in the next division /
(which is in the 78 / page off this his later book) he confessethe this
difference off being expressed in the word / and gathered off it / which is
the same in effect which I have said. For he says that nothing owght to be
tolerated in the churche' etc. onles yt be expressly contained in the word off
god or may manifestly thereof be gathered. Here he plainly opposes as member
off one division / expressly contained, and manifestly gathered: now in this
later book clean contrarily / he makes gathered to be a part of expressed.
And in an other place off his former book / (as it appears in the 24. page
off his book) he says: and none off these circumstances are commanded in
the scripture, or by necessary collection theroff may be gathered. Where he
supposes some thing necessary to salvation / which is not commanded /
namely which may be necessarylie gathered of the scripture. And if those
words commanded in the scriptures (which are general) will not contain all that which is necessary (as his division teaches:) how much les will these
words / expressed in the scriptures, compass them? and if commanded and
forbidden be all one with expressed (as he here affirms): then did he
absurdely to make gathered off the scriptures / to be an opposite member unto
commanded. That which I said off the argument off authority off a man / to
be neither good affirmatively / nor negatiuely / farther then to induce
thereader into somelikinge / or mislikinge / and not to have force to compel:
is apparaunt unto al which have any sparcke of judgment. That which is broug^
out off Aristotle / is to no purpose: and it makes also against the A.
Forasmuch as where Aristotle says / that credit is to be given to him that
is cunninge: he speaks off things / which have a likelihoode / and may be
disputed off on both sides: and not of things / which are to be received
without gainesaying. And I merueile that the A. will not see / that amongst
men / the cunningest in any profession / have in diverse things been off those
which followed them justly found fauls with. And if he will both stick to
Aristotle / and interpret^ him as he does / that a man ought to believe every
one, in that as to and profession where in he is conninge: then every learned
Divine in his profession / is to be believed whatsoever he says. Which being
absurd / and saying it has been before showed / that an argument of the
authority of man affirmatively is not good: let us hold that for somuche as
man / cannot come (through his infirmity) unto the perfection of any thing /
(which reason being assigned of me / is untouched of the A.) and forasmuch as
the gifts off god / are given in measure / and not in perfection: that an
argument off ^he authority off man / can not enforcevs / and that it is proper
unto the Aposties / and Prophets / whom the Lord had chosen to be his
notaries / and whose hands he helds continually / to be without the hazard
off error.

To the places which I alleged owte off the word off god / to prove that an
argument drawn of the authority off the scripture negatiuely / is good: he
answers / that the examples which I bring / be of things of great
importance / and forbidden in other places of the Scripture. I grant they are
so / and that makes much against him: for that the Lord having this
advantage against the Israelites / off charginge them that they had done
contrary unto his commandment / chose rather to say after this sort / that
they had done that which he had not commanded, thereby to teach his to hang
upon his mowthe. And the answerer owght to have considered / that the reason
is general which the prophets use: which otherwise should be no reason at
all. And it may be showed / that the same manner off argument / has been
used in things which are not off the substance off salvation or damnation /
and wheroff there was no commandment to the contrary. In Iosuah / the
children of Israel are charged by the Prophet / that they asked not counsel
off the mouth off the lord / when they entered into covenant with 9. Iosuah 14.
the Gabeonites: and yet that covenant was not made contrary unto any
com^aundeme^t of god. For howsoever yt seems to some / that upon the words
off Moses / they owght to have been put to death / being of those nations
which dwelte in the inheritance off the people off god: yet if yt be
considered what the causes were / why they might not enter in to league with
them (which was / lest they dwellinge amongst them should draw them to a
false worship of god:) yt will not be Deuteronomy. 20.
hard to understand / but that with condition off yelding themselves / both
to the subjection of the Jews / and to their institution in the Religion of
god (as these did) they might be received.

There was in deed difference between these nations / which dwelled in the
land off the inheritance off the children of Israel / and which dwelt round
abowte them. For where the Jews might make league with the nations round
abowte them / withowt any their submission unto Religion: they could not do
so with the Cananites / etc. And where in other nations after peace refused /
the children off Israel having taken a city / owght to keep a live women and
children in these either resistinge them / or not submitting themselves unto the
service of god / it was not lawful to spare either weme^ or children. But that
it was simply unlawful for the^ / to make league with them with any condition
/ I think yt can not be showed. for the^ Iosue and the princes should have
done evil / to have kept their oath with them / after they had understood
their frawde / cosidering that all oaths made against the com^aundement of god
/ are to be broken. And if it be said / that Iosue and the princes did evil in
keeping their oath: the approbation off that fact is apparent in an other place
/ where the 1. Sam. 21.
vengeance for the lord / fell upon all Israel by famyn / and upon the
housse off Saul particulerly / by executing those off his family: because the
gabeonites / had been (contrary to the tenure of the oath made with the^) put
to death. And unless this 2. Iosue
be admitted / we shall be compelled to condemn the spies / which entered into
league with Rachab the Harlot: and Salomo^ / 1. Reg. 9:
which received the Amorytes / that voluntaryly yielded the^ selves unto his
obedience / and withal unto the obedience off the lord / as it may appear
in the books off Esra / and Nehemias: where their posterity (which are there
called the sons off the servants of Solomon) having of old time / grow ne
into one body off the church off god with the children of Israel: join
them^elues with the^ in the restoring of the temple. 2. Sam. 7. 7.
Wheruppon the A. may understand / that the Scripture reasonethe negatiuely
against the Israelites / in a thing wheroff there was no commandment to the
contrary.

Moreover we read / that when David had taken this counsel / to build a
temple unto the lord: albeit the lord had 1. Chron. 17. 6.
revealed before in his word / that there should be such a standing place /
where the arc off the couenante / and the service off god should have a
certain abydinge: and albeit there was no word off god / which forbad David
to build the temple: yet the lord (with commendation off his good affection /
and zeal he had to the advancement off his glory) concludes against David
his resolution to build the temple with this reason: namely / that he had
given no commandment off this / who should build yt.

Where he would ground this answer / upon the words off Zuinglius: yt is
manifest that Zuinglius reproves the Anabaptists / not for reasoning
negatiuely off the authority off the scripture / but that they reasoned
negatiuely off an act / or an example. And there is great difference between
them that say / it is no contained / or it can not be concluded off any place
in the scripture: therefore yt is unlawful / and between the Anabaptists /
which reason that therefore the baptism off children is unlawful because it
is not found in the Scriptures / that the Apostles did babtize any children.
Whereas if they had reasoned thus / that the baptism off young children was
unlawful / forasmuch as yt was not commanded in the scriptures: althowghe
the ground off their reason had been false: yet their conclusion had been
fast and sure. And therefore if the answerer would have delte trewly / he
should not have fathered this answer of Zuinglius / which has no such
thing) but off the Papists whose proper defense this is against those /
which manifie the sufficiency of the word off God / as that which gives
men address / unto all things which are to be done.

Master Harding reprochethe the Bishopp off Salusbery In the 29. division of
the first Article.
/ with this kind off reasoning / which the answerer obiectethe against us
so often / unto whom the Bishopp answers. The Atgument Master Hearding
meanethe and not very plainly utters is the argument off authority
negatiuely: which is taken to be good, when soever proof is taken off godds
word and is used not only by us, but also by many of the catholic fathers.
And there alleges how Saint Paul in the 3. Gal. dispureth negatiuely off the
authority off the scripture / for that the Apostel upon the words off Moses
in thy seed and not seades, concludes that our savior Christ was
understood. likewise he show the how Origin / reasons after the same
sort. And a little after / shows the reason why the argument off authority
off of the scripture negatiuelie / is good / namely / for that the word off
God is perfect. In another place unto Master Harding In the defense off the
Apology 5. part ca. 15. division 1.
casting him in the teethe / with the negative Arguments: he alleges places
owte of Ireneus / Chrysostom / Loo / which reasoned negatiuely of the
authority of the scripture The places which he alleges / be very full / and
plain in generality / withowt any such restraincte as the A. imagines / as
they are there to be seen.

Whereas he says / that the reason that God could give a perfect patron off
the church / therefore he has so done / doothe no more follow then in there
all presence off the Sacrament: he doothe but trifle with his reader. For I
reason not off the bare power off God / but have joined his will with his
power. For my words be / that the Lord determining to set before our eyes a
perfect form off his church, is both hable to do yt, and has done yt.
Where yt is euidente unto all men / that I ground my reason not only off the
ability off the lord / but upon his determination: not only off that which
he could do / but off that he has done.

Division 2. page 79.
Unto that wherein he was towched / for his unskillfulness in dividing / in that
both matters off government / and matters of faith (which he deuideth / and
by dividing opposethe) meet so friendly together in the government of the
Pope: he answerthe not. And yet having nothing to answer / he finds him self
the talk / of a whole sheet of paper. For first off all / how ridiculous is
it that he says / he did not put a case but an example? Then / whether
perteines it / that he settethe down / what the Papists say off the pope,
what the pope doothe himselffe? That also which he affirmethe in so good
earnest / that no government owght to be received / direcly against the word
off God: that he repeatethe / and repeateth again / his negative argument of
the popes supremacy: are they not all strey spreaches / fraied out of there
wits / carrying not the weight of a fether / to the proof off any thing in
controversy: having no knot / either with the cause / or one of them with
another?

Likewise the distinctions off Ceremonies / and government / off substantial
and accidental / of external and spiritual / are altogether unprofitable /
brought to avoid his apparent ignorance in dividing. Likewise his dalying in
his questions what government I mean (which is apparent in the discourse off
all our books off boothe sides) also his groping at none days / by questions
what it mente by matters necessary to salvation, which is expressed off me in
the very next diusio^ / and again in the third chap. 2 division. Afterward
/ when he sets him selffe to prove / that there is no one find off
government certain and unvariable in the church: let yt be observed / how
loosely and childishelie he doothe yt. For beside the first reason / which is
a begging of that which is in question and the later reason / drawn of the
authority of master Gwalier whereof he can have no advantage / unless (with
master Gwalter) he will affirm that excommunication is not necessary / nor yet
convenient under a Christien magistrate: all the rest of his authorities /
drawn owte of M. Calvin / the heluetian confession / Bullinger / are quite
beside the cause. For they are to prove / that there may be a church withowte
excommunication. As thowghe the question were / what things the church (of
those which be prescribed by the word off God) may want / and yet be the
church of god: and not / what things yt owght to have by the prescripte of
the word off God. Or as thowghe the question were / how sick the church
might be / and yet live: how meimed / and yet not slain: and not what are the
means / which the lord has appointed / for a whole and wholesome
constitution off the body of the church. And if excommunication or the one
form off government were not necessary for the church / because the church
which wants them / may be the church: by the same reason a man may say /
that the holy sacrament of the supper of the lord / is not necessary for the
church: seeing that in that company / where the word of god is only
preached and received / there is the church off god. And hereof also the
practice is to be seen in some places / where the magistrate (according to the
churches / the preaching off the word off god) for certain occasisions / will
not accord / the ministering off the supper. Last off all / M. Beza showing the
true marks of the church / adds to the two former / the discipline framed
according to the word / con. 5. 7. so that whatsoever necessity comes unto
the word and Sacraments in that they are notes / the same comes also to the
discipline by M. Bezaes Judgment. Where he quarrelleth with me / as thowghe I
had concluded off particulars only: beside that he owght to know / that man
may conclude a particular / either affirmatively or negatiuely in any figure /
not only off particulars but off singulars: he must understand / that a
particular instance overthrows him / which opposes matter of ceremonies /
and government / unto matters off faith / and salvation / generally and
withowt exception. His accusation against me (for calling the holy
Sacraments ceremonies) considering that kind off speech / is received
amongst the divines / and I had no further occasion to speak off them / then
to show they were ceremonies: is utterly unworthy any answer.

To the third Division page 81. The Answerer broileth things together off the
infinite mercy off god / and of repentance in a moment / of his unsearchable
judgments / having neither head nor foot in his talk. And althowghe he
would seem to say somewhat against me: yet in deed he confirms that which I
have set down. For when he says / that the doctrine of free will being
damnable of it selffe / does not prejudice the mercy off God. if he mean
that the merry off God embraces him that being infected with that error /
does by no especial repentance call it back (as that which is unknown unto
him:) then he fully agreethe with me. If he mean that upon special
repentance / and change off mind in that point / he obtain mercy: he
speaks truly / but to no purpose off that matter which we have in hand.

Therefore to bring some light unto those things / which the A. with his
disorder / darkeneth: it is to be understood / that first off all every
transgression off the law / be it never 6. Romans
so little off it selffe and in the own nature / is damnable. Secondly it is
to be observed / that no sin unto those which are throwghe faith grafted
into the body of Christ / can bring 8. Romans
damnation: as also withowt faith (I speak off those which have
understanding) there is none which brings not certain death / the mercy
off god (although never so infinite) being shut up against all unbelievers.
Which I therefore add / because the D. speaks so confusedly off the
infinitenes off Gods mercy. In the third place / it must be seen / what
faults utterly destroy the faith which is in Christ. For it is clear / that
those that do not pull up the roots / and raze the foundations of faith: can
by no means shut the kingdom of heaven / against those which are infected
with them: althowg he they do never come to the knowledge off them. Wherein I
think that no man off any Judgment / will deny that errors not in the
hearers only / but also in the teachers / may be such as do not destroy
the foundation. And this thing may be 1. Cor. 3. 12. Col. 3. 19. 2, Pet. 2. 1.
easelie showed / by diverse places off scripture / where this distinction off
errors (which destroy the foundations / and which do not: which hold the head
/ and which do not: which are deadly / and which are not:) may be easily
gathered.

It remains only to see / whether the erorr off fre will be amongst them
which do not raze the foundations (as I have alleged) or no. And when as one
which mainteineth fre will / may hold the fre remission off sins in the
grace off god / and likewise hold / that that grace is showed unto him for
Christ's sake (these being the growndes off our salvation) it must needs
follow / that fre will does not raze the foundations. For there is no
necessity / that he who says that the spirit off God / by the new birthe
has given him power to die to sin / and to live unto righteousness: should
also affirm / that it is given him off merit. In the opinion that S. Peter
had of his own strenght and ability to die for Christ / Math. 26. ^3. 35.
entangled (as it may seem) with ignorance off this point off Religion /
touching the bondage off man's will: he ceased not therefore / to have a true and
iustifyinge faith in the son off God / whereunto our savior Christ himself
had given testimony. And if their were not sufficient hold in this example
off Peter / against the A: yet in the greek doctors / and some also off the
latin / (as in Jerome especially / which did not by one act or two as Peter /
but by arguments and open sayings / declare there liking of fre will) this is
manifest. for dare the. A. say / of all the^ that they believed not the fre
remission off sins For Jesus Christ's sake / or held not the foundation of
religion / all that time that they taught in the church of god / and held
that opinion? And if he grant that they had faith: then I conclude that even
then / when they held fre will / they held the foundations. which is not so
in the example off beleuinge / that the mass is a sacrifice for the quick and
the dead / which he vnskilfullie comparethe with this error off free will:
consideringe that that over throws / and turnethe vppside down the material
cause off our salvation / which is the sacrifice off the son off god / that
he once for ever in his own person / offered for the sins off the world. And
therefore that error can not be / in any in whom there is faith.

I brought three reasons off comparison / to prove that the word off god is a
rule to square out / whatsoever thing is to be done in the orderinge off the
church: and the A. in calling them bare words / has made a quick dispatche
off them / sauinge that his marginall note / does keep the wont off untrue
surmisinge. which upon that I compare the government / with chains and
bracelets / says: that I account yt more pretiouse / then the doctrine. As
if the apparel which clothethe the nakedness / were not always more
necessary / and sometime also more preciouse / then those jewels. And if I had
not this defense: yet if I had fallen upon an adversary which had not been
disposed to trifle / the law off comparisons / (which exacteth not likelihood
in all things / but only in that where in the co^pariso^ is made) would have
cleared this marge^t.

To the Division 4. page 84. The Admonition said / that nothing ought to be
established in the church, which is not commanded by the word off God: the
A offended hewith / condemned this saying: the reply shewethe / how the
saying of the A. is maintenable / namely for that though there be not express
words for every thing / which may be established: yet there are general
commandments / whereby all things which can fall into any Ecclesiastical
consultation / are to be directed. The A. (to maintain his sodeine / and
unadvised condemnation) says: that in those things which are varied by time
/ and other circumstances / and whereoff there is no precise determination in
the word off god: yt is enoughe that they be not against the word of God. So
that this is the difference between the Adm. and him: they will have those
things not only not to be against the word / but to be grounded upon the
word: and he saiethe / it is enough they be not against the word. Wherein if
there were no diversity / the Ans. is in fault: which in his greedines off
findinge fault / condemns that in the Adm. which he is constreined to allow
off. But in deed they are not all one. For albeit it can not be / but that
which is not agreeable unto the word off God / is against the word off God:
and off the otherside / that which is not against the word off God / is
agreeable unto yt: yet he that so says / that certain things must be done
not against the word / that he will not also accord / that they should be
done according to the word: gyuethe thereby to understand / that there is
some star or light off reason / or learning or other help / whereby some act
may be well done / and acceptably unto God / in which the word off God was
shut out / and not called to counsel: as that which either could not / or
need not / give any direction in that behalf. Now in this later boocke / and
in this division he says: that nothing ought to be done in the church, but
according to the true meaning off the word. And afterward says / that he
agreethe unto this sentence off mine: that in making orders, and ceremonies
off the church, it is not lavvfull to do what men list: but they are
bovvnde to follow the general rules off the scripture / that are given to be
a squire / whereby those are to be squared out. And thus in the end the A. is
constreined / to yield him self to that / which he has before found fault
with. for if nothing may be done in making orders off the church / but
according to the general rules off the scripture / and those general rules
be commandments: it folowethe / that nothing may be done in makinges
orders for the church / but according to the commandment off God. Which is
that which the Adm. did set down.

And whereas he would make the reader believe / that we have given back / in
that we confess certain orders may be established in the church / which are
not expressed in the word off God: I have showed / how the Adm. is very
untruly charged with that sentence: there being neither the same / nor the
value off those words to be found in it. This therefore being agreed on off
both sides: we might have here shut up these controversies / sauinge that the
A. holdinge this doctrine in words / does notwithstanding in deed continue
the siedge against it: in that all those places / which I have alleged for
proof off it / he doothe by shameful and open corruptions / essaye to
ouerthowe.

And to the first place / which is that the wisdom of god in his word /
doothe teach men every good way / and therefore 2. Prove.
the way which ought to be taken in the establishement of orders / and
ceremonies in the church: he asks me in great scorn / what that makes to
the purpose? in deed to prove that which he untruly / and contrary to my
plain words / in his answer to al my arguments surmiseth to be my purpose
(that is / that no law ought to be made in the church / which is not
expressed in the word) I say to prove this / I grant it is not sufficient:
but to prove that all things owght to be done in the church / not only not
against the com^aundement / but also according to the commandment of God
(which was that which I propounded / and he denied) it is more sufficient /
then he is hable to answer. His answer also / which supposes this sentence
directed unto princes and magistrates (only belike in that he says my son)
is uttered withowte all judgment: consideringe that Solomon / by that title
speaks unto all the children off god / of what calling soever they be / as
it is manifest by the writer to the Hebrews. 12. 5.


To the next argument / grounded upon the authority off Saint Paul / (which
is / nothing can be done to the glory 1. Cor 10. 1. Tim. 4.
off God / withowt ebedience: all things done withowt the Testymonye off the
word off God / are withowt obedience: therefore nothing done withowt the
Testymonye off the word off God / can be done to the Glory off God) to this
argument / which he calls undigested: he answers by repetition off my
words / and that Saint Paul^ meaning is / that nothing be done against the
word. Which how absurd an answer it is / when both that is the question /
and I have expressly urged the Testimonye off the word off God to be required
/ let all men Judge.

The next argument / which he says is evil framed / is apparent. Wheresoever
faith is wantinge / there is sin: in every action not commanded / faith is
wantinge: therefore in every action not commanded / there is sin. To this be
answers: that the words off Saint Paul (not to be 14. Romans
off faith) signify that we ought to do nothing / against our conscience.
Which both is very absurd / and overthrows the sense off the Apostle. For
having showed / that he which doothe any thing doubtingly / is condemned: he
assigns immediately / this to be the reason / because he does it not off
faith. So that the Apostle calls that done not off faith / which is done
doubtingly: But he is said to do against conscience / which having his
knowledge / and persuasion settled / goes against yt.

And where he says / that the words going before (which are Blessed is he
that condemns not him selffe, in the thing which he allovvethe) do prove
that sense off his: it is spoken withowt all consideration off the place For
how comes yt to pass / that he rather referrethe these words off Saint
Paul not to be off faith, to this sentence / which is farther removed: then
to that off doing with dowbte / which goes immediately before / yea wherewith
it is coupled in the same verse / with a conjunction causall? And althowghe
the reason sometime be referred / unto that which goethe farther off: yet that
is both rarely / and then / when by no means yt can agree with that / which
goes immediately before. Which can not be here / considering especially /
that it could not be unknown / but that he which does against his conscience
/ sins / whereby the Apostle should need make any proof of it. but off him
which doothe a thing staggering and waueringe / there might be some dowbte /
whether he sinned. and therefore the Apostle having said / that he is condemned
in so doing: addethe this reason / for that he does it not of faith, which
being sin / is therefore damnable.

Where he says / that if a man should do nothing wheroff he has not
assurance by the word off God, that he does well: that thereby should be
overthrown Christian liberty in indifferent things: the fault is / in his
want off understanding. For even those things that are indifferent / and may
be done / have their fredome grounded off the word off God: so that unless
the word off the lord / either in general or especial words / had determined
off the free use off them: there could have been no lawful use off them at
all. And when he seethe / that S. Paul speaks here off civil / private /
and indifferent actions / as off eating this or that kind of meat (then the
which their can be nothing more indifferent:) he might easily have seen / that
the sentence off the Apostle / reaches even to his case / off taking up a
straw. For if this rule be off indifferent things / and not off all: I would
gladly know off him / what indifferent things it is given off / and off what
not. And the same also I require off him in the other general rule / off doing
all things to the glory off god. For if that reach unto all indifferent
things it must needs comprise also this action of his. Which if it do /
then as no man can glorify God / but by obedience / and here is no obedience /
but where there is a word: it must follow / that their is a word.

And semethe it so strange a thing unto him / that a man should not take up a
straw / but for some purpose / and for some good purpose? or will he not give
the lord leave / to require off a Christian man / endewed with the spirit off
God / as much / as the heathen require off one / which is only endued with
reason / that he should do nothing / wheroff he has not some end / and that
in all his doings whether public / or private / at home / or abroad /
whether with him self / or with an other / he owght to have regard / whether
that which he does / be done in duty or no? And if the taking up off a
straw / be done to good end / either off helping him self / or others /
regard of profit / or pleasure / or what else: it has testimony off the
word off God. And if it have not an end / and a Good end: will not the A.
give the lord leave to condemn that in his infinite wisdom / which men by the
light off a little wisdom / do account folishe? or will he be so injurious to
the justice off god / that he may not judge that to be sin / which they
say is done against duty? What also? that some even off those heathen men /
have tawght / that nothing owght to be done / wheroff thou dowbtest whether
Cie. 1. off.
it be right or wrong. Whereby it appears / that even those which had no
knowledge of the word off God: did see mutche of the equity of this / which
the Apostle requires of a Christian man: and that the chiefest difference is /
that where they sent men for the difference off good and evil / to the light
off reason / in such things: the Apostle sends them / to the scoole of
Christ in his word / which only is hable thoroughe faith / to give them
assurance / and resolution in their doings.

And although to maintain his former unadvisedness he had rather say / that
men should do nothing but which they believe Calvin upon the cpistle, and
Insti. l. 3. ca. 15. s. 5.
not to displease god, then with the godly learned to say / that they ought to
do nothing / which they are not assuredly persuaded of / that it pleases
God: yet even this / which he says off beleuinge that it does not displease
God, I would know off him / Where he can fetch the ground off / but in the
word off God. For if he do believe / that it does not displease God / and
belief be not but in respect of the word off god: it must follow / that he
has some word off God / which tellethe him / that that does not displease
the Lord.

And where he accusethe this doctrine / of bringing-men to dispere: he does it
wrong. For when doubtinge is the way to dispere / against which this
doctrine offrethe the re^medie it must needs be / that it brings comfort /
and joy / to the conscience off man.

The reason which I assigned / why it is necessary to have the word off God /
goo before us in all our actions (namely for that we can not otherwise be
assured / that they please God): he does not once touch. His second
signification of these words / not to be of faith, that is not to be an
article of faith: if it had any grace in it / yet it is merely idle in this
place / and help the no more / to the understanding of the place of Saint Paul
now in hand / then smoke does the eyes. And where in the end he says /
that these places do prove as much for all cyuill actions / as for
ecclesiastical: and that I can no more prove by these / that a certain form
off discipline is appoincted in the Scripture / then that every civil action
is precisely commanded to be done without any change: I grant it: neither
did I allege them therefore / but was driven into this disputacion / only by
occasion before alleged in the beginning off this division / and manifestly
expressed in the next.

7. Division page 86.
WHere as I alleged / that in making ceremonies and orders off the church /
this owght to be observed / which 1. Cor. 10.
saint Paul requires / that they offend none / but especially that they
offend not the church off God: the first exception off the answerer is / that
this rule prescribes the duty unto private men, and not generally unto the
church. As though the rule were not general / or this thing were prescribed
unto them / in respect of that they were private / and not in respect off
being Christians / whether private / or public: in which case that which is
commaun^ded to one ^s commanded to ahor as if the Lord were so careful in
private offenses / and careless in public. And if offense ought to be taken
heed off in things done withowt many witnesses / withowte all countenance
off authority / and once only: how much more owght yt to be taken heed off /
in the orders off the church / which have so many lookers on / so great
continuance / and such force off authority to strike yt deeper in?

His second exception is / that by this means the orders off the church,
should be subject to one or two men's liking, or misliking. which answer
proceeds off two foul an oversight / and want off understanding off the
word offense, For Saint Paul by offense / doothe not mean displeasure / or
discontement: but that whereby / occasion is given to any / of sin and
transgression off the law off God / which may as well be with alowance / as
disalowance / when all are pleased with that which is done / as when they are
displeased. And therefore in that signification which Saint Paul and our savior
Christ before him take this word offense / the church owghte to Mat. 5. 29.
provide / that there be no offense given to one alone.

His third exception / that I added this word especially to the text, is a
mere cavil. For althowghe I used that word / more then is in the text: yet I
both kept the meaning / and laid y^ more open unto the simple reader. And
where he says / that the Apostell would have men more careful off offending
those which are not yet come to the church, then those which be off yt: yt is
altogether untrue / and not only against the meaning off the Apostle / but
against the general rule off love: wherein these degrees are assigned / that we
(leuing all men) should especially love those / which are members off the same
body with us. Whereupon yt follows / that the fruictes off love (wheroff this
is one off the principal / that we ^iue no occasion off offense) owght rather
to be performed toward them off the church / then toward strangers. And y^
being certain which S. Paul says / that we must do Good unto all Gal. 6.
but especially to those which are off the how should of faith: yt must
needs follow off the contrary / that we owght not to do hurt unto any / but
especially unto those / which are off the howshoulde off faith. And this
degree doothe our Savior Christ him self note / when he thundering against
offenses / addethe this as an increase / and an higher stepp in syn^e: if be yt
done against one of those which believe in him. 18. Mat. 6
And where he says / that strangers may be so withdrawn, whereas there can
be no such fear off those which are alredie members off the church: he
speaks both contrary to all experience / and directly contrary to the
Apostell / which disputing in this case 1. Cor. 8. 11. Romans 14. 15. 20.
of offense / says that the weak brother perishes throwghe these offenses.

Last off all (yff he require authority) Oecumenius / a man myche liked of
the answerer / thi^cketh that he had an especial care / to those that be
already members of the church: and Bucer has a long treatise / wherein he
proves / that if either the Papists / or those that are members off the
church must be offended: that yt is more agreeable / to provide against the
offense off the church / then off the papists. Bucer upon the 18. of S. Math.


The second rule he aloweth / but admittethe no competent Judges of yt / but
such as made the orders: as the papists / which (alowing off the Scriptures)
take them selves only able / to judge off the sense off them. And if there
were but some few as he says / where as there are many thowsansandes / and
those all private men / where there be which have charge: yet I would know of
the A. whether the spirit off God / is tied so either to multitude / or to
authority: that both a few / and private / may not epsy faults in the
orders / which have been devised by many and public persons.

To the third rule / that all should be done unto edifying: he says that
yt can not be applied to all things generally used in 1. Cor. 14.
the church, but to prayers, tounges, etc. specified in that chapter, as if it
were not the ordinary of the Apostell / to prove the particulers / by the
general / and so to conclude / that the exercises off praing / singinge etc.
should be done to edifying / because all things must so be done. And where
he would seem / to ^ye the Signification / off edifying / only unto
instruction in the church: yt is manifest that the Apostell / carrying yt also
unto things indifferent / will have this to be the rule / off our private
actions / myche more off such public actions / as I have before declared. And
the words which saint Paul uses / do not require / that ceremonies Romans
14. 19.
and orders of the church should edifye (as he surmisethe): yt is sufficient
to come under this rule off the Apostle / that they tend to edifyinge: and he
can not be ignorant / that yt is one thing to build / and another thing to
tend to building.

For the 4 rule / which is that they be done to the glory of God / he will
acknowledge yt to be no rule / to direct ceremonies Romans 14.
by / because yt is a rule to guide all actions whatsoever. which is a very
strange argument / that because yt is a rule to guide all actions: therefore yt
is no rule to direct the churches. And yff this be a sufficient cause off
refusing yt as impertinent to this purpose: then that rule (which he off these
four does only allwe / as of that only which he him selffe browght) must
also be judged impertinent to this purpose / and so thruste owte off the doors
with her follows. For there is nothing whatsoever a man does / whether
privately or publicly in matters either civil / or Ecclesiastical: but he
owght to keep this rule / that yt be done in order and in comelines.

Where upon my words / And yet so left to the order off the church, that it
do nothing against the rules aforesaid, he notes that I am contrary unto my
self, and contrary unto the the Adm. Why does he note not the co^trarietye?
Are these contrary? Yt is not enough, that the orders off the church be not
against the word, onles they be grovvnded upon the word: and this / that
they are so left to the order off the church, that yt / do nothing contrary to
the rules aforesaid? Declaring my mind at large before / I have in this last
sentence / put less then was in the other: but there is nothing contrary. I
never dissented from him in that he says / the church may in making orders,
do nothing against the word: but in this / that he by rejecting the Admonition
/ denies that they ought to be cut out according to the word and commandment
off God: I both did / and do still dissent from him.

The article off the Duche church / as yt is set down off M. Beza / we do
fully agree with: which is / that we ovvght 24. Epist.
to esteem things indifferent, by the circumstance off time, place, and
person, weighed by the skoles off the word off God. There are diverse things
besides in this division / that are nothing to the purpose / and unworthy any
answer. And amongst others / what an intolerable mockery off the reader is
yt / that where yt has been showed / that the words off the Admonition / not
commanded in the scripture, owght to be taken for that / which is either
particularly / or in the general commanded: he notwithstanding says / that
peradventure we may shift yt, in saying that they meant, either generally, or
particularly. Wherein in stead that he should have proved / that they meant not
so: he makes a paraduenture off that / which has been before in so many
words disputed.

Division 6. page 89.
IN that you wound up the lords day / with other things which you
accounte merely indifferent neither set any mark in the foreheade off it /
whereby we might understand that you had any other estimation off it then off
the rest: al men do see / that I had Good cause to charge you as I did. And
even now yowr answer which you make / is expressly against that which you have
written before. For you affirm that the lords day is in the number off those
which not to observe / or once to call in question / is mere madness. But in
your former book / after recital of the lords day / and other things which
you accounte indifferente: you close up which this sentence / that there is
none so simple, which vnderstandethe not, that the church has authority in
those matters. If yt be mere madness for the church not to observe the lords
day: how has the church authority in that case? And if yt may not once
move question off it: how can yt take order in yt? your manner off speech /
whereby you would goo between these two sentences / and help to set at one
such manifest contrarieties / are absurd: for you say / that the continuance
off the lords day so long, doothe prove yt necessary to be observed: and
yet add / that yt may be altered upon great and especial considerations.
whereas if it be necessary to be observed / it may not be altered: And if yt
may be altered / then it is not necessary. Whereby appearethe how trewly I
gathered off your words / which you can not avoid withowte such senseles
speeches.

Against that which I said off Ecclesiastical discipline / instituted in the
18 / off S. Matthew for contemners and neglecters off the word / and common
prayers: yt is said / and said with great words / that that place is to be
understood off secret and particular faults, and not off open, and known.
Whereas yt is more then manifest / that if the scripture gives authority to
reprehende private faults: yt doothe myche more authorize to rebuke public
faults. And if those faults / which are done against one man: miche more
those which are done against the whole church. And if those which are done
against the profit off men: myche more against those / which are done
against the glory off God. And if upon refusal off Admonition / in those
particular and secret cases / he will have the church proceed to
excommunication: how myche more will he / that that proceeding be observed in
these open faults? And yt is to childishe / thus continually to stumble at
this: that the words off the scripture should have no farther reach / then
to that special case wheroff express mention is made in the text: and to
leave no place to arguments off like / of more to the les / off les to the
more / of contraries etc. and therbie to cut off all meditation off the word
of God / to destroy a great part off the use off teachinge in the church.
Albeit in folowinge his own interpretation / the contemners or neglecters off
the word and prayers / may well be subject to this rule / (for it may come
to pas that one may contemn the word / etc. And yet in that manner as it
shall be known wne only unto one what opinion he norishethe of them) yet
because that is not always / let us see further / what unskillfulness it is
which the A. doothe so greatly accuse in this allegatio^.

Saint Paul grounding him self upon this place off our 1. Cor. 5.
Savior / doubted not to draw forth the authority he had to excommunicate /
against the incestuous man / which was notoriously known to have offended the
whole congregation / and Hymineus / which had corrupted the puretie off the
doctrine. 2 Timothy 2. 18. 1. Tim. 2. 20.
And if the A. say trewly / that that doctrine off our Savior Christ
touching excommunication / may be carried no farther then to that case off
private and secret injuries: then Saint Paul drew the sword / and tawght to
draw yt / where yt owght not. And althowghe there be no mention made off the
admonitions: yet they must be off necessity presupposed / forasmiche as it
was not lawful / to have proceeded to that extremity off cuttinge off by
excommunication: if the offenders had left any place to admonitions / and
would have suffered themselves to have been cured by gentler medicines. What
also that Saint Paul upon the public admonition which he 2. Cor. 13.
gave unto certain offenders / menaceth them that if they admit not his
admonitions / and reprehensions / he will not spare them: doothe he not in
those words give them the threat off excommunication? And if he do* then yt
is clear / that those admonitions being public / were off public / and
known faults / whereby folowethe that this rule off admonishing and
reprehending / are forerunners unto excommunication / even in public faults.
And as he here fights against a manifest trewthe: so he has himselffe for
adversary: which affirms Page 667.
/ that against an heretic / both these two admonititions which our savior
Christ speakethe of / and the excommunication afterward / owghte to be
practiced, oneles he will say / that an heretic which is known to one only
/ owght so to be handled and that he which is notoriously known / owght to be
free from that censure. The place of M Calvin / is altogeter from the purpose,
for I do not say that private admonitions ought to be applied unto public
offenses / the Apostell of the^ gives order that such offenders should be
rebuked openly. 1. Tim. 5.
Only I said / that for contempt / and neglecte off the words (I might have
said for every fault that tends either to the hurt of the neighbor / or
to the hinderaunce off the glory off God) there be prescribed in the word off
God / admonitions / and reprehensions / and if those will not serve /
excommunications: but whether the admonitions and reprehensions should be
private or public (that thing hanging upon the quality and kind of the
fault) I affirmed nothing.

Now let us see / what revel he makes with the civil Discipline / appointed by
the law of God: Where before he can 8. sect pa. 5. off his book.
give one answer / he must ask three questions: the first is answered before
in the beginning / the last is handled afterward in the 6. Chapter and 5.
division. And as for that part of the second question which with other his
sainges following surmise that I would have the negltcte of the word punished
by death: yt is directly against my express words / which (having showed the
punishementes / that should be executed upon contemners) add that there are
other punishementes for those / which neglecte the word etc. And as to that
part off his question / which is whether contemners off the word owght to be
put to death: yt is as his other questions be / of things not only affirmed
/ and set down / but disputed off both parts. For this is that which we
plainly affirm / and bring arguments to prove. And when he that despises
the word of God / despises God himself: the equity of this must needs
appear / unto all those in whom there is but a corn off the zeal and love
of the glory off God / or rather in who^ there is not some pleasure / to see
the glory of God trodden under feet. But he says / that the place off Moses
off putting Idolaters unto death, makes nothing to prove this. The reason 22.
Exo.
whereof he assignethe to be: because contemners / are not Idolaters. This is
his ordinary fault / that he can not understand / that if an Idolater owght
to die: miche more a contemner of the word. For contempt (althowghe yt be not
in an action / which doothe utterly ouerturne the service of God / as
Idolatry: but in one which staineth / or cracketh yt only / as is the breach
off the Sabbothe) is yet showed to be so displeasante unto the lord / and so
detestable: that that which off yt self / was not deadly / only by this
circumstance of contempt / was punished with present death / which may
appear in him that gathered sticks on the Sabothe day. The breach off the
sabothe day / was not simply punishable by Number. 15. 30. 31. and 32.
death / as Idolatry was / myche les so small a breach / by the gathering
off a few sticks: yet because yt was done (as the scripture says) in a
high hand / that is to say proudly and contemptuously: the lord commanded
/ that he should be put to death / and sets that down for a generalle
law. How myche more then / shall he which despisethe the word off God /
(which is the rule off the whole body off the service off God / and off that
true rest From our own works and from sin / whereoff that bodily rest /
was a figure) be punished with death? And if because the law doothe not
say in thus many words / that a contemner shall die, yt be not lawful to
conclude / that he owght to be put to death: what will the answerer say / unto
the writer unto the hebrews which 10. Heb. 28.
says / that he that despisethe the law off Moses under two or three
witnesses / was put to death withowt mercy? For by those words yt appearethe
/ not only that a contemner of the law off Moses / owght by the law to die
(which is that which I set down:) but also that the writer upon th^^ and
such like places as I have here alleged / gathered that which is no where in
the law / found in the same words wherein he utters that sentence.

Touching the place off Deutronomy, which he says is only understood off
false witness: yt is apparent / that althowghe yt follow 19. Deuteronomy.
immediately the law off puttinge a false witness to death: yet it is a
general sentence / and has regard unto all the crimes which are capital.
for if false witnesses be put to death / and Idolaters or contemners remain:
how is the land purged off the evils which draw the wrath off God upon yt?
or how is a terror stricken into the rest whereby they may be kept from the
infection off that sin? And if no punishment / but death / be hable to give
a sound full enoughe to stricke a sufficient terror of the sin off false
witness in such a case: how myche more is yt needful / that there be as
brymme / and as audible a punishment against Idolaters / and contemners of the
word / to the ingendring of that fear in others / whereby the rest may be
kept / in the fear and true worship off the lord.

The place off the Chronicles / is not answered: for yt is more general / then
the A. takes yt: and is an exposition off Chron. 2. 15.
the law. For where the law says / that he that seruethe strange Gods
shall die: this place says / that he shall die which seekethe not the lord,
where in are comprehended not only Idolaters / but Atheistes / and mockers /
and contemners off God: which is that which I had to prove. As for that he
asks off the perpetuite off these laws / yt is afterward spoken off.

In the end he finds fault / that I (saying there are other punishementes
for such as neglecte the word of God / according to the fault) do nether
tell what they are / nor where they be to be found. I thowght that the mowthe
of his understanding had not been so narrow / but yt could easily comprehend
/ that if contempt be by the word off God to be punished by death: that the
neglecte off yt / owght not to escape the civil punishment / either in body
/ or Gods / etc. Why I did not reckon them up / I assigned sufficient cause:
in that the varying / according to the quantity off the fault / more or les:
could not be set down. And if he will see in general / what punishment
the law of God aloweth of in such cases: he may read in Esra. Where (beside
the punishment off death / against the transgressors off the law) there ^
Esra 26
be also appointed banishement / loss of Good / or imprisonement / as the
quality off the fault required. And if he say / that that was done by the
authority not off the law of God / but of a heathen prince: the answer is
easy / that yt is very like / that the commission given to Esra / and
authorized by the king / was drawn by Esra: which was a cunninge scribe in
the law of God. At the left yt is manifest / that he both accepted that /
and amongeste other things gave God ver. 27. 28
thanckes for yt: which he would never have done / oneles ^t / had been a Good
interpetation off the law in that behalffe / considering that even the civil
and politic laws / Whereby: the Jews were the^ (and in Jury especially)
governed* ought to be no other / then those which the lord had prescribed in
the law. And thus let yt be Judged / what Good cause I had to ask / what
was become off the A. judgment: when he set down, that there is no
Discipline appointed ^n the word off God, for those which shall contemn the
word off god, and common prayers.

THe answerer said / that there was not one word in the scripture off
pulpites or off sytting at the communion: in a word I showed / that there was.
And where he says the pulpit was placed in open street: That was / because
off their dwelling in tents / 2. Chro. 6
the feast vvheroff they celebrated. For otherwise yt appears / that such a
high place in the temple / owte off the which the voice off him which spoke
might be heard / was ordinary. The reason off calling the doctrine of Moses /
the chair of Moses / by a metonumie off the subject For the adiuncte: I will
leave to the reader to judge of. for my judgment off them / I said / that they
are not lightly to be changed: and he dispurethe against me / as if I had
said: that yt were not lawful to change these upon any occasion. And beside
this disputing against his own fancy / and not against my words: he has
violently broken into the question / off reading and interpreting the word
off God / vvithowt any the least occasion given thereof: and has also
shamefully corrupted / the place off Nehemias / as shall be seen in the proper
place.

Here he accusethe me of falsifying his words / which have charged him with
saying / that yt is an indifferent thing to preach the word of God in
churches or howses privately or publicly: wherein he still utters his
forheade / harder then any steel. For these being his own words / that the
scripture speaks not a word of preaching or baptizing, openly or privately,
at home or in the church: doothe he not say the same that I lay unto him.
What is indifferent / if that be not / which the scripture says not a word
of / has not prescribed / has not determined / has not appointed? all
which phrases he uses / as those which signify the same thing. And when he
addethe in the end / that there is none so simple, that understands, not
that the church has authority to take order in these things: does he not
affirm the same? for the church has authority only in indifferent things
to take order. So that it is more manifest then the day / that which I have
charged him with ones / he has said twice / althowghe not in the same / yet
in as full words. And where he asks / whether yt be all one to say / the
scripture has not determined whether baptism should be ministered openly or
privately, at home or in the church, and to say / the church may make
baptism private or public: verelie they are in mine and I think in all other
indifferent judgment / all one: and if they were not / yet as I have showed /
you have said both the one / and the other.

And where you say / that I thereby give the reader to understand, that you
affirm yt is in power off the church, to apointe that there should be no
public baptism: althowghe I give no more to understand that / then that you
affirm / that it is in her power to appointe that there should be no private
baptism: yet all men see / that this is at the least the weight off your
words: that althowghe the church should abuse her power in apointing always
private baptism / yet that must be obeyed. For as when you say / that the
scripture has not determined, whether the communion should be celebrated
sitting, standing, or kneeling, baptism in fontes, basins, rivers, etc. Your
meaning is to affirm / that if the church will have the communion always
received kneeling / or baptism always ministered in basone: that so it owght
to be / and never either standing or sitting or in fontes: so in saying that
the scripture has not determined, whether the preaching off the word should
be public, or private, etc. and that the church has the ordering of this
thing, you affirm / that if the church should allwaies ordeine / that
preaching and baptizing should be private: that so yt ought to be. If you had
said / that yt had been in the churches power / according to the former rules
prescribed / to have ordered / whether preaching and administering the
Sacraments should be in the town or in the field / in a church (as they
call it) or in some one / man's house or other: I would have moved no question
against you. but when you say / that yt is in the power off the church / to
ordeine whether yt should be public / or private / I can not abide you for
even in the time of persequution / when it is preached in the house off a
private man: I have showed / that the church assembling there / the meeting is
public / whereunto you answer not a word.

Against the place I alleged out off Solomon / he excepteth Prou. 8.
that it is strangely applied, and far fetched. Solomon in the chapter before
/ had showed how the harlot / doothe lie in wait for men secrethe / and in the
night time / and so (pressed with conscience of the evil / which she goethe
abowte) shunneth the light / and sekethe secret corners. In the beginning
off this chapter / he comparethe the wisdom off God in his word / unto a
noble woman / whom he opposethe unto the Harlot: and shewethe How she off the
contrary part / doothe not lie in wait / or seek corners / or night / to
hide her selffe in / or whisper in the ears off men / but exalts her voice
and speakethe in the most open places / and corners off streates 6. Mat. 5.
where the greateste concourse off people is. whereupon it may appear / that
if the A. either will / or understanding were at home / and not far from him:
this place had been nere enowghe the purpose. For if the word must be
taught in such sort / as it may best be conveyed unto the knowledge of
most men / and lest be charged with the seeking off corners / or the cover
off the night: and yt is manifest / that that is better done / when yt is
preached publikly / then when yt is preached privately: yt must follow / that
by that saying of Solomon / yt is prescribed unto the church / that the
preaching owght to be public. And if there be not only examples off Christ /
and off his Apostles / but also a plain commandment (as I have showed) to
preach the word openly: then yt folowethe / that if the church have power to
order / whether the word should be preached publicly / or privately: yt has
power to order / contrary to the commandment of our savior Christ.

And where he says that the word off god may be taught prtuately, and that
a man may exhort privately: that is nothing to the purpose. For we speak of
the order which owght to be keepte in the exercises that concern the body off
the church / and not of the private exhortations / teachings / and admonitions
/ that either the minister owght to use toward the several persons off his
flock / or one private man toward another / or the father off a howsholde in
his family / etc. And this is so far from helping off him / that it makethe
altogether against him. For as yt is not in the churches power / to forbid
these private teachinges / admonitions / exhortations / or to ordeine that these
teachings / etc. be public / because the lord has commanded the^ to be
private: so yt is not in her power / to take away the public preaching of the
word: considering that the lord also has commanded yt. And therefore yt is
untrue / which he set down: that the scripture has not determined, whether
the word should be tawght, privately, or publicly. For by private men / yt
has determined yt should always be done privately: by publyke persons
also / yt shewethe how / and in what case / yt should be spoken privately: and
how / and in what case / publicly: contrary whereunto the church can not
determine / and if she determine a 100. times / she is not to be obeyed.

And whereas upon that / that neither the place / nor the number off Persons /
be off the substance off the words and Sacraments / he would conclude / that
it is in the power off the church / to make the preaching / and administering
off the Sacraments / public or private: he may as well say (which he said
in his former book) that yt is in the churches power to take order / whether
men and women / shall come clothed / or naked to received the Sacraments:
considering that to come either clothed / or naked / is not off the substance
off the Sacraments. Where he owght to understand / that there are diverse
things annexed / and hanging by / which being commanded by the word off god:
are no more in the churches liberty to alter / then yt is in her power to
change the day into night. Howbeit as I have showed / that the place otherwise
private / being by the order of the church appointed for the assembly off the
whole church / is for that time of the assembly public: so yt may be well
said / that the number which meet in that place which is so appointed by the
church / to hear the word off God / (how small so ever yt be) can not hinder
the publykenes off that assembly. The places quoted in the margente / to prove
private celebrating off the Sacraments: are handled in another place.

That which is alleged / owte of an article of the Such church / that
things otherwise indifferent, do after lavvfull commandment (after a
sort) change their nature: we willingly subscribe unto howbeit / with any
thing which is here in controversy / it has no knot at all / but is a
wandering sentence / which has no fellow. For yt is not debated here / what
force off authority the things have / which the church ordeineth: but the
question is altogether / what are the things which fall into the churches
order.

The next division / wherein he requires answer unto the place off the
Corinthes / off doing all things decently / and orderly: is answered in that I
have showed / that the church being bound to this commandment in making her
Ceremonies / is therbye tied / not only to place nothing in the church
against the commandment off God / but is bound even according to the
commandment / to frame her orders in indifferent things. Wherein the answerer
(althowghe he oppugneth the grounds which I used for the proof off yt) doothe
(I suppose) agree with me / and therefore there was no cause / he should have
required any answer.

Caput 2. Division 1. page 95.
IF he would have proved / that which I deny: he should have showed / that
these authorities affirmed / that the church in making laws off things /
wheroff the scripture has not precisely determined / need not to have
respect to the general commandments off the scripture before received. but
that he is not hable to do with any approved sentence. And albeit / he has
subscribed to this sentence before: yet in the end off this division / he
beginnethe to s^lyde into his former error / saying / that in matters not
prescribed in the scripture, he can not tell whether to resort, to know the
use and antiquity of them, but unto counsels, stories, and doctors. As thowge
the scripture were not the loode star unto the church / in her decrees
towching such things: and as thowghe the first churches vvhhich had not
such stories etc. had not sufficient address in the light off the word off
God / to make constitutions by. I grant the church by stories etc.
understands of their antiquity: but the knowledge of their antiquity makes
little or nothing to know / how profitable / or convenient for the church they
be: which being that only / which is looked into in there establishing / is
drawn from the scriptures / and not from antiquity. Howbeit because he
pretendith agreement in this / that there be certain things left unto the
order of the church with this co^ditio^ / that they be done according to the
general commandments off the Scripture: we will houlde him by his former
words / and will not suffer him to break from us / unless he do not only
privily nibble and bite abowte / but in manifest words eat up / his former
saying. Notwithstanding in the great plenty the A. has off places / for the
proof off this which we deny not: let yt be observed / what partly improper /
partly ungodly choice / he has made.

The first sort off Testimonies out off the ancient writers / and counsels /
are off off those which are in controversy / as whether bishopps may have
suffringanes / whether there owght to be metropolitanes / etc. Wheroff
although he bring no testimony owte off his antors / that they are in the
churches power / to order: yet he settethe them down / as thowghe there were
never question moved off them / and as if he had gained them by strong hand
off reason.

The second sort are off those things which being determined by the word
off God / off or on / are owte off the churches compass to take order in: As is
that which he recites owte of Iustine / off the deacons carrying the bread of
the holy supper off the lord, to those which were not present at the action
off the supper: and that which he alleges owte of the council of Neocesarea
/ that no man should be minister before 30. year off his age, Likewise that
which he brings owte off the Amyran council / that a minister can not s^ll
the churches rightes especially in that sense the council means / which is
for his own private profit. The first of these is contrary to the institution
/ and the last being sacrilege are simply forbidden in the word of god. The
Scripture also determining that a man off those gifts which be required off
the Minister off the word / may / and (if need require) owght to be received
unto the ministry / and showing further / that those gifts fall into younger
years then 3^. yt must needs follow / that the church determining flatly /
that none shall be received to the ministry before those years / shuttethe
the door off the ministry unto those / to whom the word off God settethe yt
open. And also / that this Council is altogether owte off place alleged:
considering that it determined not off this / as off a thing wheroff the
Scripture had not given sentence / but as off a thing unlawful by the
Scripture / and for that purpose it alledgethe the example off our Savior
Christ / which preached not before he was 30. year oulde. These things
daungerously set down off the An. as indifferent / which are not: I thought it
necessary to give the simple reader warning / that the Answ. measure wherwithe
he meteth indifferent things / is unsealed.

There is a third sort owte off Tertull. de corona militis ^d prax. and Basil.
de sancto Spiritu, Wheroff beside that diverse off them were never convenient /
some off them unlawful / they are all such as the authors do not permit to
the order of the church / but under a false clock off tradition / put the
churches neck under a servile yoke off them. And whereas he would feign save
these places owte off the fire / by saying / that although some grew in time to
superstition, and that one of his autors gave to myche unto vnwritte^
traditions: he doothe but burn his fingers / the places he can not save. For
yt behooves him to show / that certain things / not determined in the word off
God / are in the churches power: and these places (yff they prove any thing)
prove that the church / is bound off necessity to certain things / wheroff
there is no commandment in the word off God: for the which cause they are
alleged off the papists / from whom it is not unlike but they were borrowed.
Hosius de tradit.


But yet it appears, that there were things in the church, not expressed in
the word: I grant: and more then that / things contrary: but by what right
yt doothe not appear. And in deed if the answerer had light upon some
weywarde aduersarye / that would have debated this question with him: these
places would have given him great advantage / considering that both the
ceremonies / are for a great part naught / and the opinion off the necessity
off them a great deal wors. And Ieromes words also / in tying the later
churches / unto the customs off the ancient which are not against faith /
(albeit they be smoothed / by translatinge praesertim namely, and with his
exposition of matters off faith) yet even as they are set down off him /
overthrow the churches liberty in things indifferent. For althowgh they
should be inconvenient / and uncomely yet the matter off inconvenience / and
vncomelines / being (by the Ans.) no matter off faith: the church must still
be clogged with them / nether can it by that rule / shake them off.

There are a fourth sort of places owte of the auncie^te fathers / wherein he
puts the greateste confidence / and upon which he has laid greateste
weight: and therefore by hands set over against them / moves the reader to
lay sure hold on them. These places drawn owte off Ambrose upon the Ephesians.
and of Tertull de virginibus velandis. that of Ambrose being (as has been
showed) very corrupt / is also a conterfaite / as shall after be noted. The
other off Tertull / is a flat and a plain Montaniste. yt is not unknown /
that Montanus held / that there was no sufficient instruction given by the
Apostles unto the church / but that there were only certain principles off
Religion given by them being imperfect / and were afterward to be finished /
and polished / by the conforter which himself did forge. This poison
Tertullian having druncke / he left the Savor off yt in diverse places / but
in no place more brimly then in this. which may appear / by the comparisons
he uses / off likening the church off God in the Apostels time / unto a tree
whose fruicte was not blomed / and unto one which is in his base age: and the
churches after the Apostels times / throwghe reuelatio^s (such as he
imaginethe the Apostels were not hable to bear) allwaies marching forward
toward a greater ripenes in fruicte / and perfection in age. And if the D.
had been a little awakened / he might have smelt the fraud even in these words
/ which he has been ab used by. For when he imagines a another rule off
conversation / and leading of liffe of a Chirstian / then that which has been
given: he might have justly suspected the sentence: seeing the rule off
conversation / comprehended in the commandments / is unchangeable. And when
he adds / that that should be done by the grace off God / receiving increase
daily unto the end: he did not obscurely touch / the head off his error /
which is / that there shall be still unto the worlds end / greater graces off
the spirit off God given to the church generally / then has been before in
the Apostels times. Wherbie appears / that the places which the A. will have
the reader lay so fast houlde of / are thorns not to be once touched /
withowte a hedging glove in one hand / and a hatche^ in the other. We
willingly subscribe / unto the Judgment off M. Calvin alleged here.

And where the Ans. would make peradventure the reader believe / that by the
words off policy and government left to the judgment off the church,
Calvin means / to make these points in controversy at the churches
disposition: it shall appear / both by his several sentences of these things
/ that he holdethe them unchangeable / and by the exposition off M Beza his
words / the same in effect with these off Master Calvin / which comes after
to be considered.

It remains that seeing the answerer would oppress us / with the authority
off the fathers. We consider / whether there can be any fitter places browght /
for the maintenance off the Admonition / then the A. has alleged for him.
Augustine / Whether yt be question off Christ, or vvhethet yt Contr. literas
petit. lib. 3. cap. 6.
be question off his church, or off what thing soever the question be off: I
say not if we, but if an angel from heaven, shall tell us any thing beside
that you have received in the scriptures under the law, and the gospel, let
him be accursed. And lest the Answ. should restreine this general saying unto
the doctrine of the gospel / so that he would thereby shut owte the
discipline: let him hear what Cyprian says. The Cypri. in ser. de bapti. Chr.
Christian religion (says he) shall find that ovvte off this scripture,
rules off all doctrines have spronge, and that from hence doothe spring and
hither doothe return, whatsoever the Ecclesiastical discipline doothe
contain. And even Tertull himselffe / before he was imbrued with this heresy
off Montanus / gives testimony unto the discipline / in De praescript.
advers. haeret.
these words. We may not give our selves this liberty, to bring in any
thing off our will, nor choose any thing that other men bring in off their
will: we have the Apostels for autors, which them selves brought nothing off
their own will, but the discipline which they received of Christ, they
delivered faithfully unto the people. And if the sentence were any thing
worth / which he browght in towching the discipline / out off Tertull: yt
makes against him. For in that he will have that correction off the discipline
/ to have the authority of the holy ghost (speaking in his fantastical
co^forter) he declares / that it is not a thing which hangs upon the will
of mortal me^. And that in indifferent things / it is not enowghe that they be
2. lib. ad ^^xorem.
not against the word / but that they be according to the word: yt may
appear by other places / Wherehe says / that what soever pleasethe not the
lord, displeases him, and withdraw hurt is received. And in another place he
says / that the scripture denies that, which yt notes not. And to come
yet nearer / where De Monogam.
he disputes against the wearing of crown or garland (which is indifferent
off it self) to those which obiecting asked / where the scripture says that
a man might not wear a crown: he anwereth De coron militis.
by asking / where the scripture says, that they may we are. And unto the^
replying / that yt is permitted which is not for bidden: he answers / that
yt is forbidden, which is not permitted. Whereby appears / that the argument
off the scriptures negatiuely / holds / not only in the doctrine / and
Ecclesiastical discipline: but even in matters arbitrarie / and variable by
the advice off the church. Where it is not enoughe / that they be not forbidden
/ unless there be some word / which does permit the use of them: yt is not
enoughe / that the scripture speaks not against them / unless it speak for
them: and finally / where yt displeases the Lord / which pleasethe him not:
one must off necessity have the word off his mouth / to declare his pleasure.

Whether I commonly use to propounde things in controversy / in bare
affirmacions / or denials / withowt reason: and whether you apply the
scriptures / better then I: and how true yt is / that you have in yower
former book alleged more scriptures / then I did in mine (all which things
this gloss affirms) I leave yt to the Judgment off the reader.

Cap. 3. Division 1. page 100.
IN the first whole page / there is nothing to be answered: yt being showed /
that yt is not our question (which the A. does so shamefully affirm) whether
the scripture have expressed all external ceremonies / etc. In the next page /
unto me showing that the place off August. to Casulanus is against him / for
that where he would prove / that certain things are in the churches power /
the words which he alleges say / that the decrees of the forefathers / and
coustomes off the people off God are to be observed / tying the church to the
decrees / and coustomes off those which went before: he answers / that
August. gives a rule unto private men and not unto the church. Wherein he
condemns him self / off having alleged that sentence clean beside the
cause. For it is manifest / by the words immediately goinge before / that he
alleged it / to prove the authority off the church in things indifferent:
neither can yt in any other respect / have any bond with that / which he
pretends to prove. And now that yt is showed / how unfitly the place is
alleged: he shifteth his footing / and in stead off a rule towchinge the
church / he makes yt a rule for private men: and in stead off showing the
liberty off the church / he shows the bondage / that a private man is tied
by.

Where I conclude against him off that sentence off Augustine / that we ought
to follow the coustomes / and orders off the Apostels / and off the primative
churches / seeing yt is certain / that they were our forefathers / and the
people off God: and that we owght not to follow the Papists / which are
neither the people off God / nor our forefathers: to the first / off folowinge
the Apostels / he says / there were certain things convenient only for
their times / which are not to be followed. Wherein unless he mean those
things / which are in controversy / yt is nothing to the purpose: and if he
mean them / yt is a manifest begging off that / which is in demand. Unto the
second point / off not taking the Papists coustomes / and decres: he
refers me to other places. Where notwithstanding he never answers this
argument off Augustine: and so in pretense off a fitter place / he has taken a
longer day.

Where he notes me of ignorance (in that I said / I could oppose Ignatius /
and Tertull / unto August. and Ambrose / towchinge the fast upon the Lords
day) saying / that there is no difference between them, the one part speaking
off the Saturday, the other off the Sunday: I am contented to bear his charge
off ignorance. But is there any man / so forsaken off all not learning only /
but common reason / which does not understand that these propositions differ /
and fight amongst them selves / yt is a detestable thing to fast on the
Lords day: which is the Judgment off Ignatius / and Tertull: and / yt is
lavvfull to fast on the Lords day: Which is the Judgment off Augustine / set
down off him selffe? And when Ambrose / speaking not only off the Sabbothe
off the Jews / but generally / wills that whatsoever the coustome off the
church be in that behalffe off fasting, yt should be followed: does he not
manifestly overthrow his saying / which says / to fast on the Lords day is
to kill the Lord? And even in the case off the fast off the Jews Sabbothe /
which Casulanus demands counsel off / yt appears there was great
disagrrement between the ancient fathers / consideringe that in the Canons /
which are attributed unto the Apostles / 65. (...).
it was ordained / that if one were found to fast on the Lords day / or on
the Sabbothe (one only exepted): being a clerk / he should be deposed / and
being a layman / separated from the supper off the Lord. If I have off
ignorance / set the fathers together by the ears (as he says): let us see /
how with his knoweledge / he can part them / and set them at one in this
behalffe.

That the fastes which were kept / in the times off Ambrose / and Augustine /
and long before / and their allowance especially off the Lentenne fastes Were
corrupt / and prophanations off the true use off fast: if need were / as I
have in part / so yt might in more words easily be showed. That the counsel
give for the keeping of those superstitious fastes / might have place in a
stranger / and private man / which owght not to stand toward a Citisen / and
him that has charge: yt is apparent. And yet both these the Answerer would
bear down with words / and nothing but words.

Where the answ. saying that he knows nothing in the place off Augustine / or
Ambrose / towching fasting / which may not be observed withowt just offense /
may be taken either to speak of the places which I alleged / thouching merit
off fasting / or the places which him selffe alleged: I will rather esteem
(until I know the contrary) that he meant off those which he browght him
selffe / then together with the slipp off standing days off fast / he should
also fall flat by opinion / off the merit in fasting. And so I would have the
reader to take him / that there be no offense taken at this place / so
doubtfully left. Where he brings me in concluding / that because the ancient
fathers erred in some things / therefore they said true in none: my words
carry no such sense. But for so much as they erred / and even in this matter
off fast / which was in hand: they owght to have no further credit / then
their authority is waranted by the word off God / and good reason. and that
therefore the Answ. which presses their bare authority / withowte any ward off
the word of God / or assistance of good reason / either browght of him self /
or fetched from them / brings an intolerable tyranny into the church of
God. This I gave to understand / which because he durst not in plain words
gain say: he has turned my words unto another sense.

Cap. 3. Division 2 page 103.
Augustine says / that the feast of Easter, Pentecoste etc. are the statutes
off the Apostles, and commended to the churches, and adds / that they are not
contained in the scripture. Whereupon I concluded / that there is some thing
(by this reckening) commanded off God to be observed / not contained in the
scripture: and consequently / that there is no sufficient doctrine / contained
in the scripture / whereby we may be saved. To this the Doct. answers / that
yt is a pretty and sound collection. I have in deed for shortness sake / trussed
that into two or three propositions / which to put in full / and comptere
arguments / required a greater number: Howbeit the soundenes off the
collection / is apparent to all / which will open their eyes. And because the
Ans: will yeald no obedience unto the truth / unless she taking him by the
collar / have her hande^ upon his throat: the foundenes off the collection
shall thus appear unto him. What soever was decreed off the Apostles / and
commended unto the churches to be observed / is necessary: but some things
(by Aug. and the D.) not contained in the word off God / were decreed and
commended by the Apostels / unto the posterity of the churches: therefore some
things (by Aug. and the D.) not contained in the word of God / is necessary
to be observed. The first proposition is manifest / considering that the
statutes off the Apostels / are the statutes off Christ: the second is
Augustines / allowed off the D. and if both these be true / then the third
must needs be.

This being thus gathered / that which I added / that thereupon yt followed /
that there is no sufficient doctrine contained in the scriptures: is thus
concluded. That which doothe not contain all the will off God / necessary for
us to do / contains no sufficient doctrine unto salvation: but the
scripture (by Aug / and the d.) conteinethe not all the will off God /
necessary for us to do: therefore the scripture (by Aug. and the d) contains
no sufficient doctrine unto salvation. The first proposition is manifest / in
that S. Paul to deliver him selffe from the gilte off blood / toward the Act.
20.
Ephesians. alleges / that he had taught them all the will off God: the second
follows off that which Aug. and the d. allow. for if there be some thing
commanded off the Apostells / not contained in the word off God: that being
necessary / yt must follow / that some necessary thing for us to do / is not
contained in the word.

And where the A. says / that neither Aug. nor he say, that any thing not
contained in the scripture is so necessary, that it may not be altered (upon
just occasion) by such as have authority: he can not mock the world after
that sort / with fast and loose at his pleasure. For if they be statutes off
the Apostels / and commended unto the churches: what authority is there upon
earth / which can displace them which the apostels have placed? and if it be
madness (as he says afterward owte off Augustine) not to observe them / or once
to reason off them: how can they take order in them? And this answer is
overthrown / by the words off Augustine which follow immediately. But other
things (says he) which are varied by regions (as that some fast upon the
sabbothe day, some do not, etc. are at liberty to bo observed: neither is
there any better rule to a Christian man in these, then to do as the church
doothe where he comethe. Where it is manifest / that he opposes the tradition
off the Apostels / and there statutes received by tradition: unto those things
/ which are in the churches power to ordeine / and to those wherein yt is safe
for us to apply our selfs / to the order off the church. They being therefore
in this opposed / the one being in the churches power / the other are nor the
one being of that sort / that off which side soever the church determine off
them / a man may saflie obey / the other must needs be off that sort / that
if the church would otherwise ordeine of them / then the Apostels: that a man
may not safely obey. And in the next sentence / the things which he opposethe
those statutes off the Apostels unto / he calls indifferent: and thereby
gives to understand / that he took them for vnindifferent. and hitherto
pertains / that he alleges out off August. in Zuinglius name / and is Li.
4. con. Don. ca. 23.
found in his book against the Donatistes / where yt is said / that they are
to be holden as given by Apostolical authority. Which is more then if he had
said / given by the Apostels: considering that there are things given off the
Apostels as counsels / and left at the churches order to change upon
occasion as were the traditions / which M. Calvin speaks off / but they were
never left unto the church / with an Apostolical authority. Which authority is
off the higheste nature / and proceeding from the higheste court that can be.

And that this was Augustines meaning / appears manifestly by the place which
I alleged / out of his book against the donatistes. De bapt. contr.
Donatist. 5. lib. 23. ca.
Where he says / that all those things which the church houldeth
generally, are to be houlden as praeceptes off the Apostels, althovvghe they be
not written: whereunto he answers nothing. And by that place / the folly off
the answerer whereby he would tune Augustine by master Caluins wreste / is more
plainly discovered. For where he would have us think that August understood
those traditions only / which perteine to order / and polity / that may be
varied / and not unto doctrine: yt is manifest / that Augustine in that place
says / that the Apostels gave commandment, tovvching the not rebaptising
off those which were baptized by Heretics, and that the custom of off the
church in not rebaptizing, which was objected against Cyprian, had the
beginning off the Apostels tradition. Now I would know off the answerer /
whether he dare say / that this judgment off rebaptizing / be off traditions
/ which may be changed: or whether there can be any just cawse / wherefore
this may be altered? And if he dare not say this / then let him confess his
faut / and not seek to make up his breaches / by such untempered mortar.

Where I say / that thereby there is a gate opened unto the the Papists / to
bring in under the color off traditions / all their beggary: he answers /
that the Papists are rather confuted by this means / considering that the
Pope / has nether at all times / nor in all places been received. Where to let
pas / that to help him self / he adds at all times which is not in
Augustines rule: he towcheth not the point off the cause. For in that only
that it is said / that there be precepts off the Apostels unto the church /
not contained in the word of God: is pusshed at the strongest bulwarcke / which
the church has to defend yt self / against the Popish beggerie / and all
other corruptions / Which bullwarke is / that whatsoever is commanded of the
Lord unto the church / is contained in the word off God. yff this be once
shaken: there is no sufficient resistance left unto the church / against this
assaut. For although yt has some great likelihood / which has been generally
/ and from the Apostels times received: yet for somuche as yt is not impossible
for the whole church to err in some point / and to have taken up / or retained
off that which yt had before / some thing not delivered by the apostels: it can
be no sufficient bar / to withstand the corruptions offered to be brought in by
the Heretics / to say that the church has either done / or not done / so /
and so / sythe^s the Apostels times. And although we might be assured that
they are the precepts of the Apostels / which have been so generally received:
yet the door is not so close shut against corruptions / as he pretends. For
this thing standing that there are co^maundeme^ts given of the Apostels / not
contained in the word of god: they may thrust in things / which have not had
that general / and continual observation. For althowghe Aug. say / that they
are the traditio^ns of the Apostles / which are generally received: yet he
does not say that they only are / and the Heretics whose corruptions should
be repulsed in this respect / that they have not been generally nor always
received / might have an easy replye / that there is the same prejudice
against certain off the commandementes off the Apostels committed to writing:
considering that they have nether generally / nor continually been received.

Where he alleges Zuinglius / using a sentence off Augustine not much unlike
/ to confirm childrens baptism: yt is to be noted / that Zuinglins used not
that sentence / but in the confirmacion off a thing / which has certain
testimony out off the word off God / as has childrens baptism / whereit
could not be dangerous. and then yt is to be observed / that thereby is
overthrown his whole answer. For Zuinglius taking that sentence off things /
which have a necessary observation in the church off God / and can not be
changed: puts to flight his whole answer / with the defense theroff / which
supposes Augustine to have given this rule / off things indifferent. And
therefore either the A. is abused / in understanding these places off things
indifferent: or else Zuinglius / in using this for the necessity off childrens
baptism / gave his adversaries great advantage / whilst they might have
answered with the D. that that authority off the Apostels is such / as the
church upon consideration may alter. And where he alleges M. Calvin / as one
which had used that rule off Augustine: I answer / that yt is one thing / to
allow the sentence off a writer: and another thing / to take some advantage off
it when his adversary presses him with his authority. A man uses some time
that defense / provoked by the manner off assault off his ennemie / which he
would not do / if he might choose his own fight: and it might serve M.
Calvin in part / for arm our against the bare authority off Augustine urged off
the Papists / which is not of proof / against the shot off the word off God.

Where he says / that the Papists have no wicked thing, which either has
been generally observed, or whereoff he is not able to show the first author: I
answer / that it is well the church standethe not in need / off this defense
off yowres. For if the Lenten fast, (which in Augustines time had been by long
coustome received) if holy water / Epist. 119.
holy oil / the superstition off praying toward the East (which are off
those traditions / that in the place by him alleged out off lib. de spirit
sanct.
Basile / are attributed unto the Apostles) yff those I say / and such like /
be against the word off God: let him tell how he will clear the Apostels / of
being autoures off these corruptions / which are fathered of them by men off
such credit / unless he fly to this rock (which by the doctrine off
traditions he goes abowte to undermine) that is to say: that the Apostles
have left in writing / whatsoever they would have the churches observe. For
what authority soever he bring to show / who were the first inuentors of these
things / yt being humane / is counteruailed by them / which have carried them
unto the times off the Apostels.

Where upon on that I said / that all the commandementes off God, and off the
Apostels, are needful for our salvation, he makes such a terrible owtcrie /
as if all the church had been set on fire: I dowbt whether (for the vanity of
the accusation) I should vouchesafe yt of answer / which for the strong / and
bitter words / might seem to require a large defense. Howbeit let him
understand that when I speak of all the commandementes of God / and off the
Apostels: nether by the deduction off that which I handled / nor by any
Judgment / not altogether perverted / could I be thowght to mean any other
commandments / then those which perteine unto us. And if I had met with the
vainest trifler / and hawker after syllables / which can possibly be: yet the
sentence I set down / is sufficiently fenced against all his greedines / of
snapping at yt. For the Ceremonial law / and personal laws given in times
paste (being now no commandments off God / and the Apostels) can not be
comprehended under my words / off the commandementes off God, etc. And if a
man leuing the deduction off the cawse / which I had in hand / will stay in
the bare words / which I used: then even both cermoniall / and those which
were given to particular persons / albeit they be not to be done / yet are
they for our better instruction in the will off God / needful for our
salvation.

To the argument which I used / that if Augustine would have us do those
things / which the Apostels used in the churches / not committed to writing:
then much more he would have been off advise / that we should keep that /
which is committed to writing / towching their government off the church: he
answers nothing.

In the third division page 107. to that I found fault with / off the second
rule off Augustine / which is / that yt is madness, either not to keep, or to
reason off that, which is universally observed off the church: he answers /
that was a rule for Augustines time, and not for all times. Wherein / he first
condemns him self / off wandering from the cause: which to show / that some
thing may be established in our church / not commanded in the scripture /
alleges a rule that belongs not unto us. Then it is manifest / how
helpeles a shift this is / considering that the rule is general / and as
generally given / as any other the rules / which the A. comendeth unto us / out
off Augustine. Beside that I alleged / that even in August. time / yt was
wicked to give any such authority / to the decree / or custom of men / as not
to enquire into yt: which because he durst not deny / he left unanswered. And
whereas he adds / if it be not repugnant to the word: I showed that Augustine
/ could have no such meaning: which although he confess in one word /
contrary to that which he set down: yet in the same page (lest the truth
should get any victory at his hands) he does in effect deny yt. For he
says / that Aug. has sundry times in such rules, made this exception, if
they be not against faith, etc. Where yt is manifest / that this exception is
of those rules / which are diversely observed / and which he openly opposes /
unto this rule / and such as this is / off the necessary obseruacion off
things.

The place unto the Gall. was needefully opposed. For if (...).
there be commandementes off the Apostells unto the churches / and things
which yt is madness not to keep / or to enquire into / not written: there is
something necessary to salvation / which S. Paul preached not: considering /
that the whole sum off his preaching / is cowched in writing.

The place off Augustine / off abrogating ceremonies otherwise indifferent / he
answers / was not for his purpose. Howbeyt / of his purpose had been / to
have boulted out the truth: yt ^^ clear / that having this cawse in hand
whether ceremonies in them selves indifferent / owght to be removed: he would
not have dissembled yt. As for that he charge me / with leuing out off
things before / in the midst / and after / and thereof has almost filled a
whole side: it is utterly unworthy any answer / considering that I have left
nothing out / which is in controversy / nothing which I do not willingly
confess / nothing that he has any advantage by: yea I left that out /
whereby I could have taken advantage. For beside that the ceremonies with us
are in greater number / then August. allows / all men see / that they are
more urged / and the omitting off them seuerelier punished / then the breach
off the commandments off God: in which case he will have them abrogated. For
he scapeth far better / which has not preached a whole half year in his
church / then which preaching every week twice / leueth off his surplis once.
And yt is better with him / whose whole liffe / then whose capp is out off
square: which is ennemie off the cross off Christ / then which can not abide
the cross in baptism: with those which leave out some ceremony / in burying
the bodies off the dead / then with those which murder the souls off the
living. All which things / the place of Augustine giving me occasion off. I
notwithstanding for shortness sake / passed by.

The Answer to the last place off Aug. was needeles / being the same with the
third / which I subscribed unto. The answer to your conclusion / had been
superfluous: I having before declared / wherein I agree with you / and
wherein I withstand you. And whereas I lay to his charge / that he fetches
rules ovvt off the writings of me^, to square the Ceremonies by, which he
might have had in the word of god, here certain, and altogether true, which
are there uncertain, and in part untrue: he answers / that he browght the^
not for that purpose. wherein / beside that he calls the^ rules / his answer
is directly against that / which he has set down. For he (chap. 1. division
9. page 94.) making his beginning off the sentence off Saint Paul / which he
says is a rule for the church / to examine her ceremonies by pursues the
self same point unto this place. And where he says / they are meet for a
Divine to know: yt is no answer / considering that yt may be profitable / for a
Divine to know many things / which yt is dangerous to propound unto the
church / much more to propound them / as rules to grownd the churches laws
upon.

In the next division / there is nothing to be answered / or which has not
been answered before. In the next / where he says / that the private
sentences off men in their Epistels of these points, are off more credit,
then that which they have published unto the whole world: yt is a saying / meet
for such a cawse as he defends. For all understand / that men be more
soudeine in letters to their freindes / then in their books: and that they
burn more candell / and make the file off their Judgment / and understanding
pass oftener upon those writings / which they will submit to the Judgment
off all men / then to the judgment off one: upon those / which they know
shall come on the rack off their wrangling ennemies / then which shall find
rest / in the bosom of an easy and friendly interpretation: upon those / which
they think shall remain unto all posterity / then which they think shall
dye / at the least with him to whom they wrote. And therefore if there were
occasions / to move them to speak otherwise in their public writings / then
in their private: yet that turns all to the advantage off those / which
allege that which was spoken upon the house top: rather then off those /
which press that was rounded in the ear off one man. If their private
writings / vary not from their public / yt is so much better for us: which
are well assured / that the public we have alleged / stand off our side.

Where I suppose him / to attribute the order off church matters / unto the
Bishops / which he parts with the prince / and other wise men (albeit yt
will appear / that he shuts out diverse / which have interest in that
consultation:) yet he might have some cawse to complain in that behalf / and
yt was I confess / my oversight.

Unto the two next divisions / page 117 / etc. Where I have showed the places
off Deuteronomy. 4. 12. are still in force / against the error off the A. which (in
saing / that in the time of the Jews, and during that estate, yt was not
lawefull to add any thing, etc.) gives to understand / that we are not so
straightly bound unto yt at this time: he answers / that he applied that
rule, unto the law off faith, and manners* but he should have understood /
that in restraining the rule after that sort / thereby shutting out the laws
off making orders / and ceremonies off the church: he still falls into that
fault / whereoff he is accused. For having showed / that not only in things
which he calls matters off faith / and manners / but even in the variable
Ceremonies off the church / there is a word off God: yt is also true / that he
is accursed, which in making orders off the church / follows not the rule off
the laws off God / provided in that behalf. And I having showed / that the
Jews them selves had certain Ecclesiastical Ceremonies in mariadge / burial /
etc. which are not expressly commanded unto them: if they (as he confesses)
had address out off the word off God / for all their laws off what sort
soever and this curse fell off them / if in their variable laws they either
added or diminished from the word of God: yt must needs follow / that the
Christians now in their variable laws / both have a word to direct them /
and a curse for either adding / or diminishing from that word. Onles he will
say / that the Christians / in things which were a like left unto the
liberty off them / and the Jews / are les bownd to follow the prescript off
the word off God / then were the Jews: which is absurd.

In the places out off Jeremy / and Isay / yt is evident / that there is set
forth / how there shall be greater knowledge off the will off god / under the
Gospel / then under the Law. And even that which I have set down / off the
people which should be as learned under the Gospel / as the Levites / and
Priests under the law: beside that yt contains a manifest truth, and
therefore can not be to flatter the people (as he surmiseth): may be also
gathered off the 5. verse off the 56. chap. off Isaie. Where the Lord /
promising to bring the Gentiles into a better place of his temple / then the
Jews had before / does not obscurely declare / that which I said.

Unto the two next divisions page 118 / etc. for reply I say / that he
answers not to the matter. For the question is not / whether we have fewer or
more laws then they / but whether we have direction by those laws which we
have / to all things whatsoever belongs unto us to do / as they had to do
that / which apperteined unto them. To prove that there is a word off God / for
all things we have to do: I alleged / that otherwise our estate should be
worse, the^ the estate of the jews: Which the Ans. confesses to have had
direction, owte of law, in the least thing they had to do. And when yt is the
virtue off a good law / to leave as little undetermined / and withowte the
compass off the law / as can be: the A. in imagining / that we have no word
for diverse things / wherein the Jews had particular direction: presupposes
gteater perfection in the law / given unto the Jews / then in that which is
left unto us. And that this is a principal virtue off the law / may be seen /
not only by that I have showed / that a conscience well instructed / and
towched with the fear off God / seeks for the light off the word off God /
in the smallest actions: but even by common reason / the masters whereoff give
this rule / (...), that is to say / that yt greatly Aristot. ad Theode.
behooves those laws, which are well made (as much as can be) to determine
of all things, and to leave as fevve things as may be to the discretion off
the judges. Where he says / that the examples I browght off orders / which
the Jews did well observe / vvhereoff there was no express mention in the
law off God / make not to the purpose, for that, he spoke off ceremonies,
used about the worship off God: I answer / that that which I have alleged is
a manifest confutation off those words / which he has set down / nether was
there the least thing, to be done in the church, omitted in the law. For are
not these things / which I browght example off / to be done in the church:
are they not Ecclesiastical orders: yea are not part off them (which he
denies) perteining to the service off God? If these orders / off the hour for
the morning / and afternoon sacrifice / off preaching the word off God in a
place where yt may be best hard / off fasting for the better humbling off the
people before the lord in prayer / be not orders / and Ceremonies perteining to
the worshipp off God: then the daily sacrifices / preaching the word off God
/ and calling upon his name / (whereunto these belonged) are no parts off
the worshipp off God: then the which there is nothing more absurd. And verily
this is not / by iugling / or slight off hand / to deceive the eyes off the
reader: but by flat facing / to endenour to make him turn them from the
truth. That which I said / off the Jews Ecclesiastical government / by the
moral and Ceremonial law only / and not by the judicial: (as that which
may be cast down with reasons out off the word of God / which is here only
done by authority of men) I am well content it fall. So that I have no fault
to find with the Ans. in this behalf / but that the vveapon he struck this
with all / was not sharp enoughe.

Division 5. page 120 etc. Of the number off things / which the Jews had not
particulerly decided by the law / the reason is apparent / which I have
assigned: that this hyndereth not / but that there is a word / and general
commandment to direct them by / has been showed: that it is a vain cavil /
that makes doubt / whether in saying / that we have the same laws to direct
us in the service off God, which the Jews had, I mean the Ceremonial law,
or no, appears by that / which I set down (in the third division. p. 118.)
where / I receiving the moral law / for our direction / left the
Ceremonial. and of the same sort is that which he vvrangleth in / becawse I
say / the nevve Testament is a noble addition unto the old: considering that
I adding wherein / namely that it makes the old more manifest, and brings
greater light: shut out all / even the least occasion off such trifling. And
Upon 2. Tim. 3.
this manner of speech that I have used / Master Calvin which is here opposed
/ has him selff used. Where he calls in this respect / the gospel an
addition unto the law. yt remains to see / whether in the matter off the
judicial law / that which I have set down be strange / and dangerous (as
the A. surmiseth) or no.

It is not (as the A. surmiseth untruly) that the magistrate is simply bound
unto the judicial laws off Moses: but that he is bound to the equity / which
I also called the substance / and marrowe off them. In regard off which
equity / I affirmed that there are certain laws amongst the Iudicialles /
which can not be changed. And hereof I gave example / in the laws which
command / that a stubbern Idolater / blasphemer / murderer / incestuous person
/ and such like / should be put to death. For the first point / that the
equity of the iudicialls does remain / and therefore owght to be a rule / to
Call. Institu. 4. cha.
direct al laws by / to let pass the authority of M. Calvin / M. Beza / and
other writers off our time / that have written with any judgment off this
matter (which do in plain words affirm that 20. s. 15. Bez. in his book of
putting Here. to death.
there is a perpetual equity in them / and that our laws albeit they differ
in form / yet owght to retain the reason / or ground of them) I say to let
that pass: yt is to be considered / that all these laws moral / Ceremonial
/ and Judicial being the laws off God / and by his reveled will established /
must so far forth remain / as yt appears not by his will / that they are
revoked.

And seeing that the alteration which is come in this behalf / is by the
coming off our Savior Christ only: yt is to be inquired / what those laws
are / which he put end unto. Which thing may be considered / in that division
which Saint Paul uses / where he says / that our Sa. Christ came / to make
peace / first between God and men / and then between men and men: that is to
say / between Ephesians, 2.
the Jews / and Gentiles. The Ceremonial law therefore / being a law of
enimitie (which as a wall held out the Gentiles / from joining them selves unto
the Jews) was necessary amongst other cawses / in this respect / to be taken
away. The curse off the law / for the breach of any the laws of god / either
perteining to the Jews in times past or unto us now / being that which makes
the wall between the Lord and us: was for our reconciliation with his majesty
/ necessarily to be removed. Whereupon follows / first that the moral law
(as that which nether hinders our reconciliation with the Lord / not our good
agreement with men) is in as full strenght as ever it was before the coming of
our Savior Christ. For the curse off the law / beside that it is in regard
off the elect / rather fulfilled / and executed in the person off our Sa.
Christ / then abrogated: beside that also / yt has a necessary use as yet
toward the elect / not only to drive them to the faith which is in Christ
Jesus / but also to keep under the remantes of rebellion / even of them which
have already believed: and beside that the force thereoff / is daily / and
shall be for ever / execured upon the wicked: beside all this / seeing this curse
was annexed / not only to the breach off the moral law / but also off the
Ceremonial / and Judicial: there is no just cause why the moral law should
be said to be abrogated. At the least / it can not stand (which the Ans. has
very daungerously set down) that the whole law off god generally is
abrogated. For if a man will make the curse a part of all the moral law /
where yt is rather a necessary adioinct / unto the breach of the law / then a
part thereof: yet notwithstanding / that part off the moral law which stands
in commanding and forbidding / remains unshaken / and as concerning
abrogation / vntowched off our Sa. Christ.

Secondly / it follows hereuppon / that those judicial laws off Moses /
which are merely politik / and withowt all mixture off Ceremonies / must
remain / as those which hinder not / the atonement off the Jews / and Gentiles
with God / or off one off them / with an other. Beside that / it being manifest
/ that our Sa Christ came not / to dissolve any Good government off commen
wealth: he can least off all be thowght / to have comme to dissolve that which
him selffe had established. And off this point / the Ans. has two contrary
sentences: one off Musculus / which says / that the judicial law is
abrogated, the other off Beza / which is the same with that which I have
brought reasons off: that is to say / that the judicial law being given unto
the Jews, is not Beza in his former book.
yet abrogated, so that if they had any estate off common wealth, in the
Land off Canaan, they should be constreined, to use that form off government,
which was given unto them of Moses. Now albeit those laws / given unto the
Jews for that land do not bind the Gentiles in other lands / for somuche as
the diversity off the disposition of the people / and state off that country
gave occasion off some laws there / which would not have been in other places
/ and peoples: yet forsomuche as / there is in those laws a constant / and
everlasting equity / whereupon they were grounded / and the same perfecter /
and farther from error / then the forge off man's reason / (which is even in
this behalffe / shrewdly vvounded) is able to devise: yt follows / that eue^
in making politic laws / for the common wealth / Christian Magistraites owght
to propound unto them selves those laws / and in light of their equity / by a
just proportion off circunstances off person / place / etc. frame them.

Furthermore / that this equity off the Judicial law / remains not as a
counsel / which men may follow if they list / and leave at their pleasure /
but as a law / whereunto they be bound: what better proof can we have / then
the Apostle? Which after he had alleged diverse similitudes / fetched off the
common 1. Cor. 9.
use off men / to prove that a Minister off the Gospel / ought to be
maintained off the churches chardge / unto the adversary / which might except
/ that those were but humane reasons: he alleges / as the eternal law off
God / one off the Judicial laws Deu. 25. 4.
off Moses / which was / that a man should not mousell the mouth, of the ox
which tredeth ovvt the corn. Where it is manifest that he doubts not / to
bind the conscience off the Corinthes / 1. Cor. 9.
unto the equity off that law / which was Judicial. Likewise / of the
finding off the priests / in the service off the altar / commanded in the
law: he concludes / that those which preach the gospel / should live off
it. And this maintenance off the preistes / albeit in the manner off provision /
yt was ceremonial: yet as it was a reward of their service / due by men (as
the punishementes also / if they had failed in their duties) was mere
judicial. Whereupon it is brought to pass / that in those iudicialls / to
all the circumstances whereoff we are not bound: we are notwithstanding bound
to the equity.

Yt remains to show / that there are certain Judicial laws / which can not
be changed / as that a blasphemer / contemptuous / and stubborn Idolater /
etc. ought to be put to death. The doctrine which leueth this at liberty /
when they can allege no cause off this loosenes / but the coming off our
Savior Christ / and his passion / faulteth many ways. And first / yt is a
childishe error / to think that our Savior Christ came down / to exempt
men from corporal death / which the law casts upon evil doers: when as he
came not to deliver from death / which is the parting off the body from the
soul / but from that which is the separation both off body / and soul /
from the gracious presence off the lord. And if it were so / that our Sa.
Christ had borne in his own body / this civil punishment off public
offenders: yt must follow thereupon / not (which the Doctor Phansieth) that it
is in the liberty off the Magistrate, to put them to death: but that he must /
will he / nill he (yff they repent) keep them alive. For if our Sa. Christ
has answered that justice off God in his law / whereby he has commanded /
that such malefactors should be put to death: yt should be great injustice /
to require that again / in the life off the offender. So that either our Sa.
Christ / has answered that justice off God / which he requires in his law /
concerning the death of such offenders / and then yt can not be asked again /
in the body of the offender: or else he has not answered yt / and then yt
remains of necessity / to be answered in the life off the offender.

Again / this opinion is injurious unto the death / and whole appearing / off
the son of God in flesh. For where he appepeared for this cause / that he
might destroy sin / which is the 1. John ^.
worck off the Devil: the Answerer in his imagination of choice / which he
leueth to the Magistrate / towching the putting of such horrible offe^ders to
death / does at unawares as much as in him lies / make our Sa. Christ build
again that kingdom of sin / which he has destroyed. For when both in
common reason / and by the manifest word off God before alleged / the Lord
gives Deuteronomy. 19.
this blessing unto the punishment of such greiuous offenders by death / that
others not only which see / but also which hear off them / have the bridell
off fear put upon them / whereby they are withholden from the like crimes: yt
must needs follow that whosoever makes our Savior Christ / author of this
loosenes / in punishing such offenders: makes him forthwith / to lose the
bridell / whereby others are stayed / from throwing them selves down the hill
off wickedness / which was before committed. And what is / if this be not / to
make our savior Christ / a troubler off common wealths?

Moreover if our Sa. Christ by his coming / loosed these cyuill punishementes
/ and pourchased this grace off his Father / for blasphemers / etc. that if
they could find favor in the eyes off the Magistrate / they might escape the
hands off death / which the law off God adjudged them unto: how comes it to
pass / that the Apostels / to whom the Lord committed the publishing off all
that pardon / which he obtained for us / did never make mention off the
slacking of these punishements? If our Sa. Christ / had obtained this liberty
/ yt was worthy the preaching. And therefore onles the A. can show something /
out off the vvrytinges off the Apostels / to vvarrant this sanctuarye / which
he would so feign build to the support off blasphemers / murderers / etc. yt
follows / that the Apostles (by his saying) have not answered the trust
committed unto them. But if all godly minds do abhor these absurdities /
there is no cause / why they should like of this corruption off the Doctor /
vvhereupon all these depend. Na / in that the Apostell puts a sword in the
hand off 13. Romans
the Magistrates / and in the use off it makes him a Minister / and servant
off the vengeance and justice off the Lord against sin: he strikes through
this opinion / which imagines that our sa. Christ / came to hang the sword
off the Lords justice / upon the pleasure and will off men. For the
Magistrate being the Lords officer / as the Sheriff is the Magistrates: yt is
no more in his choice / to vvithold the sword / which the lord has put in his
hand to draw: then in the power off the Sherif / to stay the execution off
that judgment / which the magistrate him self has lawefully commanded.
Now seeing there is a sword in the Magistrates hand / by the doctrine off the
Apostels / and that also which the magistrate must of duty draw: I would
gladly know off the A. where that necessity can be found / if it be not in
these crimes of blasphemy / etc. Which I have set down? And if he say that S.
Paul by the sword / understands all manner off civil punishements / as well
by the pourse / as by other bodelie chastisementes / which spare the life: I
grant it / but by an used manner off speech / which notes the whole by the
part / he rather chose to utter those punishemets by the sword / the^ either by
the whip / or by the pourse. Whereby he did not only not exclude / this
necessity off punishing malefactors by death: but laid rather a streighter
bond upon the magistrate / to execute those / which committ things vvorthie
of death. Hitherto generally / of putting those to death / which commit
things against the laws remaining still in force / as they were in times
past established off the lord / in the blood off the transgressors.

Now I vvil come to the particular crimes / which I have set down. And first
for the crime off adultery / it is to be considered / that yt is a breach off
the most holy / and ancient both institution / and solemn covenant off the
Lord. Then / that it is an injury done unto the innocent part / in the most
precious possession that can be / in things perteining to this present life /
joined with dishonor / cast not only upon the person / but upon all his
children / and in a manner of al those which belong unto hi^. Thirdly / that
this fire / does not only waste the family where yt is / but makes a
breach into the common wealth / vvhilest the right of inheritance either of
lands / or offices / is oftentimes thus translated from the true inheriters:
vvhilest the children which are so begotten / having oftentimes les care / and
cost bestowed upon them in their education / become hurtefull members off the
common wealth. Whereby all men may clearly see the perpetual equity off the
law off God in the reuengement off this sin by death.

And when the lord adds this / for a reason off putting the adulterer to
death / that the evil may be taken ovvt off Israel: Leuit. 19. 29.
unto the heap off incommodities before rehearsed / for fault off exequuting
his Judgment off death / he threateneth the whole common wealth / with
mischief to fall upon yt. And the equity off this punishment by death / has
so ligthsome colors upon it / that even in this glymmering sight / which
remains in the accursed nature off men / it has vpholden it self against the
ignorance / and injustice off all which have not willingly put forth / that
sparkle which stands in the discretion of honesty. For even before this
candell light of the law off God was set up / not only the Godly (as Job)
which were in some part reformed / of the Job. 31. 11.
General blindenes: but even those which were not of the church of god / as
Abimelech the king of Gerar / and the very Cananites (as long as there was
any step off equity amongst them) did see Genesis 26. 11. Genesis 38. 24.
that the filth off this sin was such / as ought to be vvashed away with
the blood of the offenders. For vnhereas Isaac feared the assault / both of his
life / and of the chastity of Rebecka: the king ordained / that whosoever
either laid violent hand of him / or had to do with his wife / should dye.
And in that Judah / called for Thamar / to be led forth to death in the land off
Canaan / where him self was but a private man / for that she being made sure
unto a housband / plaide the harlot: he gave to understand / that the Cananites
/ which had even then filled a Good part off that measure off sin / unto the
brincke whereoff they came afterward / did notwithstanding poursne adulterers
unto death.

And when the Lord did afterward give testimony unto this punishment / by the
express words of his law: yt is manifest / that the law which God has
written / in the table off the hearts of all men / pronounces the sentence off
death against adulterers. So that onles men / will like Gyantes fight against
the light of nature / or say that our Sa. Christ / came to abolishe that
which in all times / and with all nations (not altogether spoiled off the
discretion off honesty / and dishonestie) was observed: yt follows / that the
punishment off death against adulterers / and consequently much more against
incestuous meetinges / stands in as full force now / as ever yt did / before
the coming of our Sa. Christ. And when as adultery being the least off those
faults which I have set down / is found worthy of death. Yt is easy to see /
what is the judgment off the rest.

Howbeit having spoken somewhat before / off the civil punishment off those
which offend against the service off God / and more being to be said upon
occasion afterward: that the necessary punishment off murderers by death /
may have with the rest some particular defense / let some thing be said
thereoff. First the consent off all nations (were they never so savage) in
punishing this sin with death / teaches that yt is the law of nature: which
can not be broken / nor dispensed with. yt is further to be noted / that the
causes remaining / whereupon that necessity off punishment by death / was
grownded in the law: the punishment must still remain. The Lord shows
these causes / Nomb. 35 33. 34.
of not saving the life off a murderer at any hand / first because the blood
which his hand has shed, poluteth the land, so that there can be no purgation
off yt, but in the blood off the murderer: secondly / because the Israelites,
/ which were the people of God) and thirdly / because the lord him self, had
his abode there. considering first / that the strenght of this sin^e in
polluting a land / is as great as ever it was (onles for grace / given to one
murderer / men will / call the wrath off God / upon a whole people:) the
necessity off putting murderers to death remains unshaken. Then / forasmuch
as Christian common wealths / are the people off God / amongst whom he makes
special residence: beside the common obligation / whereby all men are bound in
the law of nature / to punish a murderer by death: Christian common wealths
/ have two new bonds / whereby they are tied to a more streighter observation
/ of this severity. Last of al / as this judicial law was given of God long
before Moses: so not to be in the Genesis ^.
number off laws / corrected by the coming of our Sa. Christ: yt is manifest
by his own words / whereby he confirmed this law of God / saying / that
whosoever took up the svvord should Math. 26:
perish with the svvord. And there is no doubt / but if he had had like
occasion / to speak of other civil punishment by death / established in the
law / as he had of this / he would have brought the same confirmation of them
/ that he did off this.

The exceptions against this doctrine / are off no valwe. For if this be the
truth of God / there can be no prerogative against yt: onles he can show /
some higher court then heaven / and some chief justice above the Lord, yt is
not denied / but the punishementes by death / wherewith men have established
laws / which them selves have for their better commodity devised / may be
either mitigated or taken away / by those to whom it apperteined / nether is the
magistrate / by any thing I have set down / bound to mitigate the punishment
of thieves. for their punishment may grow / by the circumstance of place / as
in Scithia / where all things lying open to the spoil / had need to belocked
up by a streighter punisheme^t: and some times / by the disposition of the
people / lighter handed then others / as if one had to do with the
Lacedemonie^s / or some other nation / in whom that sin had taken deeper
root. And I will not deny* but even these crimes of murder / and adultery /
may vary by diverse circumstances: and therefore yt is in the discretion of the
magistrate / according to the quantity of the fault / to appoint the manner of
death / sharper or softer. But that there is any place / time / or other
circumstance / which can lessen these crimes / that they should not be worthy
of death: upon the reasons before alleged / I utterly deny.

As for the casting away / of the study / and large volumes of the law /
which he imagines to follow of this assertion: he deceives him self. For
even when these laws were fully in force / the Judges thereoff (by reason of
their shortness / comprehending many things not expressed) had matter enoughe
to occupy the greatest diligence / memory and sharpnes of wit / that could
fall into any. And if he ask our lawiers / upon what grounds the greatest
part off their houge volumes (as he calls them) stand they will answer him /
they partly stand upon the plain words off the law off Moses / and partly
off reason vncorrupt / which is the equity off the law urged off us. And
therefore although our laws / be some time in form diverse / from the laws
off Moses: yet they will never grant him (which he has / not so aduisely set
down) that our healthsome laws, be contrary to Moses laws. For both being
Good / one off them can not be contrary to the other. where he says / that we
of the clergy, should be the best judges by this means, etc. it is to open
injury / to charge us with that / which we openly renounce / and condemn in
him: which is / that in meddling in civil affairs / they put their sickle in
an other man's harvest. Notwitstanding if in establishing of laws / for the
Godly / and peaceable government off the commonwealth / there may be no
assistance of the ministry / whereby the laws should be the better compassed
/ to the equity prescribed in the word of God / and to take heed that nothing
be done against it: there is no just cawse / to uphold the Bishops presence in
the Parliament house. Where he says / that the laws which our sa. Christ made
Mat. 5. 19* towching diuorcement for adultery, had been to no purpose, if the
adulterer should off necessity be put to death: first / he may be here justly
charged with that he has untruly surmised off me / because he brings in our
sa. Christ / a maker off laws under the gospel, whereas he made none in
those places / but expounded the law of God / which he had made from the
beginning. The other refusals made by the Jews off their wives / were never
any laws / but permissions only: and therefore in there abolishement / there
was no law of God abrogated. Secondly / yt was necessary to use that
exposition / notwithstanding that the punishment of the law by death
remained. For beside that the Jews / being under the government off the
Romans had those civil punishements by death / suspended upon John 18. 31.
the pleasure off their officers / which were often corrupted: our sa. Christ
(forseing all things) did forsee / what loosenes would follow in this
behalf. And therefore as the office off a Good Doctor required / he instructed
the conscience / and taught / that albeit the Magistrate failed / in the
execution of the law / yet that the former yoke being broken / men were at
their liberty / to enter into a new contract of mariadge with other. Whereby
he met with the corrupt opinion off those / which dream that the knot of
mariadge / is not cut a sunder by adultery / duri^g the life of the parties
married. Of the autorities which are brought / to prove that the punishements by
death off the law off God / are taken away there is not one only / but Cyrill
/ which makes against this cause / yea which does not either in part / or
altogether / ouerturne his assertion.

And as for Cyrill / I can at no hand allow: the reason shall appeeare / where
the claws of this sentence are more plainly seen. Augustine in the place cited
unto Pollentius / has nothing for the Doctor. For he sets him self to
prove upon the place off S. John / that the howsband ought to forgive his wife
/ seeing our sa. Christ forgave the adulteress. Wherein / not to enter into
question / whether that be well reasoned of Augustine / or no / and to pass by
the advantage / which Erasmus authority may give / which calls that sentence
off August. a hard sentence: I answer / that yt is one thing to say / a private
man should forgive his iuiuries, (...).
and another thing to say / that the Magistrate is not bound to take aduengement
of them. A private man / may with commendation forgive the trespace against him
self / where the magistrate shall be in great fault / if he poursew not yt. And
if that place of August. perteine unto the Magistrate / and our Sa. Christ's
example prove / that the Magistrate need not punish adultery by death: yt
proves as well / that he need not punish adultery at all. For both our Sa.
Christ / forgave her f^ely / and gave no sentence of any civil punishment
against ^^r and Augu will have the howsband / freely forgive his adulterous
wife Nay the place off Augustine makes against him. for ^n that he exhorts
the howsba^d / to spare the blood or life of his wife / yt appears / that in
the church of God / in his times / this crime of adultery was punished by
death.

Musculus / albeit his manner off speech (in saying that all Moses is
abrogated) be hard: yet I would first ask him / what advantage he can take
here / for the abrogation off the Judicial / which is not the same against the
Moral. Then let it be observed / how far against the meaning of the author /
the Ans. has wrong this sentence and how he is but a snatcher at sillabels /
and a tearer of learned men's words from their meaning. The meaning off
Musculus was / that these laws abrogated as they were given by Moses / remain
notwithstanding as they contained a perpetual equity. For in the same title
off laws he writes thus. There are In the^ c. of punis. of forbidden lust.
(says he) which thinck, that Christ did abrogate the punishment,
prescribed by the law against adulterers, when he said, nether do I
condemn the, goo and sin no more. These be gaie fellows, they think not
of this, that our Sa. Christ came into the world, not to judge, or punish,
but to save sinners: and yet in the mean season, not to take away the
punishementes of the law, given of God his father, by Moses. VVhereupon he
said not symply, I condemn the not, or thou ought not to be condemned off
any, etc. And so shows / how if she had been condemned / according to the
sentence off the law: that the Lord would not have said against yt.

The like trust he has used / in alleging off M. Calvin. Which albeit he say
/ that there be certain Iudicialls / to the precise observation whereoff the
magistrate is not bound (which I did likewise set down) yet that he esteemed
certain Iudicialls unchangeable / and those especially which I have alleged: it
may appear / in that he calls it the Popish divinity, that the sentence In
his com. up John. Har. in Mo. super iudic. 7. mandati.
off our Sau. Christ / in the eight off John / brought any grace to adulterers
/ as towching the civil punisheme^t. And in an other place he says / that yt
is the common right, or law of all nations, that adulterers should be put to
death which he affirmmeh also of murderers / in the place set down by the D.)
and that yt is a sortishe imitation off our Savior, and proceeding from a
gross ignorance: Under color off the place in S. John / s. to release the
punishment of adulterers / prescribed in the law. And in an other place /
speaking off the false Prophet / which tourning Har. in c. 13. v. 5: Deuteronomy.
away the people from God / is commanded to be put to death) he says / that
law is everlasting, apperteining as well unto us now / as unto the Jews in
times past: and pincheth them which say otherwise.

As for M. Beza / which is here brought / yt is known / that even in the same
book / out of which these testimonies be cited off the Ans. he proves / that
heretics owght by virtue off the law off God given by Moses to be put to
death. Whereby appears / that all these will have certain Iudicialls / off
moses / and those especially that give sentence off death / against the crimes
which I setdowne / to be still in as full force as ever they were. Unto whom I
could add Peter Martyr / which has a long dispute off the necessary
observation / off the punishment off the law against adulterers. And as for
Hemingius / considering that he agrees / that so much remains off necessity
/ as pertains to the laws of nature: he makes nothing against me which both
have showed / and further am ready to show: that all those crimes are off
that kind / which by the law off nature / ought to receive the reward of
death. How for so much as the 8. Division off the 2. cha. in the 3. Tract.
pertains unto this matter: I will here set down the answer off yt.

8. Diuiston. pa. 149.
Here is to encounter with Zachary the Prophet / Cyrill / and such a
corrupt sentence off Cyrill / as doothe at once / both overthrow under the
law / the justice of God against sin / in the world to comme: and under
the Gospel / all manner off corporal punishementes in this world / to be
executed by men / upon those which having done evil / repent them. For yt
does not only affirm / but yt goethe a bowte to prove: that the sin
which was under the law punished by corporal death / could not be punished
off the lord / by eternal death / which as it is a wicked error (the reward
off sin being not only death off Romans 6.
the body / but off the soul also:) so the two pillars wheroff yt standethe /
are as detestable.

For the first / which is / that they have suffered punishemente fo their
sins, and received the reward off their wickedness, so that for that fault
which they so suffer for, there can be no reuengement afterward hang over
their sovvles: yt is no les despiteful to the justice of god and injurious to
the death of Christ: then the popish doctrine of supererogatio^. For if an
adulterer by suffri^g death for his crime / has a^swered the justice of god
/ so that the lord for that fault / can not take aduenge mente of his soul:
when a man suffrethe withowte cause and for righteousness sake / how owghte he
not beside his own purgacion for sin / purchase somewhat for him that
lackethe?

As for the other reason / yt is most false. For the lord, punish the one
sin / by other sins / by death in this world / and by death in the
world to come, yt is also a false ground off the Pelagian heretic /
wherwithe he would prove / that our original corruption is no sin / which
can deserve the wrath off God. And as the former part fight the for the
Papists / and for the Pelagians: so this other / standethe for the
Anabaptists / men whom the aswerer pretendethe / to have war with / but to
whom in deed / he ministrethe weapons (such as they be) to fight against
the trewthe. For if this be not Anabaptisticall / that there is no bodily
punishemente laid upon public offenders under the gospel, and that
whatsoever offense he commit, if he show tokens off repentance, he may be
delivered from bodylie punishemente: I know not what is Anabaptisme For what
murderer is there / what traitor / etc. which although he be never so
vnrepentante / and obstinate in his sin having heard tell off the answerers
gracious pardon / will not enforce himself / to show all tokens off
repentance? which if he do / the eye off men's judgment being not hable to
perce further / then to these owtwarde signs: they must have him for
repentante / althowghe he remain the same which before. And if there be one
such sentence / in all either the admonition / or my reply / so injurious to
the office off the magistrate / so pernicious unto all manner of common welthes
/ as this is: we refuse not (that I may also promise for the Admonitors) to
be taken as enemies / unto the magistrate and as ouerturners off common
welthes. For this is the sword (which S. Paul put in the magistrates hand
Romans 13.
/ to be drawn not of pleasure / but off dewtie / not against the
vnrepentante only but against the unrighteousness off those which shall
publikly offend whatsoever) either stricken clean owte of his hand: or else if
ante remain / yt is more worthy to be called the sign off the sword / then
the sword. Now if two notable errors / be hable to prove one trewthe: he
may be thowghte to have browghte something / for the iustifyinge off this
pullinge down off the wall off the common welthe. But if it must needs be
false / which has nothing to lean upon but error: I dowbte not but as the
vntrewthe of yt doothe by yt self appear: so by this so shameless defense / yt
is laid more open.

And where he says / that this sentence off Cyrill, may Minister occasion of
quarrelinge unto such as be disposed: I answer / that there can be no peace
with this sentence / but by betrayinge the trewthe: and that the vntrewthe of
yt is so apparante / that all the patched shifts which he has / shall never
be hable to hide yt. But howsoever yt be (says he) this is euidente. What:
forsooth that the quantity off sin is not to be esteemed, according to the
external punishmente. How is it euidente / by what word / or by what
sentence? yff the authority off the sentence fall: if it consistinge upon two
parts / have never a one true: yff in that very poincte for which yt is
alleged / yt is most false: where is your How so ever? you are a dangerous
adversary to deal with al / for whether the profes yowt bring be true / or
whether they be false: they fall still upon your side.

But if the heynousenes of the sin / be not to be esteemed according to the
corporal punishmente: whereby is it then to be esteemed? according (say you)
unto the commandment of god, according to the threats of god pronounced
against yt. As thowghe yt were not the commandment off God / that there
should be bodylie punishemente: and as thowghe the civil punishementes in
this world / were not part off those threats / wherwithe the lord
threatens the breakers of his law. You make therefore an opposition / where
none is: And it is all one as if you had said / the corn may not be moten
with a bushel / but with a measure. For as the busshell / is one measure: so
is the corporal punishemente / both one off the commandments / and off the
threats Prouer. 6.
of god / against open sins. Solomon prouethe Adultery to be a greater sin^e
/ then theft: for that where a thief was not / the adulterer was purswed unto
death, wherbie it is manifest / that She lomo was of this judgment / that in
open faults / committed against a godly / and honest peace: the greater
faults owght to be punished / with more greauous punishment. And if equality
of punishment in unequal faults / be injustice: how myche more is yt unjust
/ to punish greater faults / with les / and lesser with greater punishements?
And therefore that nothing should be wantinge / to prove the doctor a perfect
confounder / and tumbler of things in to the heaps of disorder: he does not
only put no difference / between the things which are separate: but in
those also which are joined together / he imagines such enemitie: as if the
one standinge / the other could not remain. And as for his reason / that we
see smaller faults punished with greater tormente: the question is not what
we see done / but what owghte to be done. I grant that one / and the same
fault / may be punished sharpelier in one contrie / then in an other: in the
same contrie also sharpelier at some time / then at an other: But I deny /
that theroff yt followethe / that in the same contrie / and at the same time /
a greater fault should be punished with light punishmente / and a lighter
with a great: which thing / saying you except against a general rule /
owght to have been showed. And the vanity off this startinge hoole / which
is sought in the diversity of contries / may partly appear / in that to
the people off the Jews / and in the country off Iewry the lord did never
make law / to punish a les fault / by a greater punishment. And yet yt is
certain / both that people and country / had some thing different from
others: and that in gyuinge laws to that people / he had respect boothe to
them and their country. whereby I conclude / that diversities off
punishementes / according to the state off the countries / may be established:
althowghe there be no such disorder committed / off punishinge small faults
grievously / and grievous faults. smallye.

And whereas he says / that he makethe the difference off the severity off
the law, and lenity off the gospel no further then in respect off the
temporal punishemente off the law: even that is the very poincte / wherein a
great part off the error off the Maniches / doothe consiste. For they were
led / to condemn the justice off God under the old Testamente: because off
the owtewarde punishementes / which were exercised / partly by the hand of
God by judgments from heaven: partly by the ministry off men / at the
commandment off the law / therefore the savor off Manichisme / is still as
hot as ever yt was.

And because I am entered into the mention off this / althowghe the answerer can
not hyrte off yt: yet the trewthe is / that even in these outward punishments
/ the dispensation off God under the law / is diverse from that which is
under the gospel. For under the scolemastershipe of the law / as he crowned
the obedience of yt / for the most part / withdraw greater abundance off
owtward blessings / then he does the obedience off his saints under the
Gospel: so did he withdraw more terrible / oftener / and more manifest
judgments / revenge the breach off yt in that time / the^ he does now. And
herein indeed is the difference which he is gropinge a bowte: but that this
should bring any diversity / in the set and ordinary punisheme^tes /
prescribed by the law: I for my part can not understand / The contrary
rather I can gather. For even as althowghe the lord does not now by owtward
blessings / give so plentiful testimony unto the obedience off the gospel /
as then off the law: yet the magistrate owghte to be as diligente / to procure
the Good off the church / as ever he was in the time off the law: even so /
althowghe the lord by bodily punishementes / doothe not so severely revenge
as he did then: yet the magistrate / may not remitte any thing therefore off
that severity / which he was wont to use. Nay more: even as the
magistrate / owghte so much more carefully procure / the owtwarde vvelfare of
the church now: as the lord vvithdrawethe his hand that ways / more now
/ then he did then: even so owghte he to keep / by so much a harder hand /
over the punishemente off sin now / then he did then: as the lord / more
rarely thundereth by his Judgments from heaven / now / then he did in the
time off the law.

And surely / if there ever had been any time / vvherin the magistrates
svvorde might have rested / and rusted in the sheathe: the time off the law /
of all had been fitteste: when the lord / did so visiblye sit in his
iudgmente seat / and him self in proper person / hold the assise / and gaile
delivery. The causes off that diversity / between the law / and the Gospel
/ which I have alleged / may be fetched from those learned men / which
handle this poincte: yt is enowghe for me / so to have helped the answerer owte
/ with that which he travailed with: that I have not only showed / how
this cause is nothing hindered / but greatly helped thereby.

Yff the plain words off the Prophet Zachary / will not serve for our
purpose: what shall become off your cause / that has never a word of the
scripture? let us then hear / why it will not serve. Because forsoothe by that
means, the parents should have power of death upon their children: and
therefore their must some other sense be sowgthe / then that which the
words do proporte. Whereunto I answer / that Moses shewinge what owghte be
Deuteronomy. 13. 9. ver.
done / agai^ste those false teachers / which go abowte secretly / to
vvithdrawe from the true worship of God: says / that allthoughe he be his
brother / his soo^e / his dawgther / or his wiffe / he shall not spare / but
fill them. Tell men owe I pray you / doothe not Moses mean there truly / and
as his words sound / that the false teacher shall die? If you dare not deny
yt: then you see / yowr reason which you here assign / is nothing worth:
for there also / yt is commanded to the father / to kill his son.

Now if you list to learn / you may perceive that by these words /
understood simply / there is no power given to one private man / to kill
another / nor for the parente (as a private man) to kill his children: but this
manner off speech / is grounded upon the law off God / vvherby yt was
provided / that the witness Deuteronomy. 17. 7. ver.
which had accused / should throw the first stone against the convicted
person. for so much therefore / as boothe Moses / and Zachary after Moses / will
have the father accuser of his own child / if the knowledge off his
inticemente to Idolatry / remain withdraw him alone: therefore also they ascribe
the killinge of the guilty person unto them / as a thing belonginge unto the
dewtie off the accuser.

But seeinge this sense please the you not / let us here what you bring. If
(says he) you will refer yt to the time of the gospel, then this is the
true meaning: if to the time off the law, then that. If al be gospel you
speak / we must needs believe you* if your words have no further
authority / then you give them by Good reason / and conference off the
scriptures: then castinge a way the sense / which has warrante off the
manyfeste words off the Scripture: you should have confirmed by substanciall
arguments / that which you have set down. The proud Sorbonistes / and
Magistri nostri off Paris / did never usurp a more absolute authority / and
more owte off rule then this is: And yt is to bring in an intolerable
Tyranny into the church off God / and lordeshippe not to be abydden. Which
when I understand off all interpretations off men / be they never so learned /
and sharp: much more off such wooden interpretations which the answerer
thruste the upon us. But tell me Good Sir / what difference is there between
yowr first interpretation / and yowr second? For if under the gospel, it be
lawful (as yowr exposition suppose the) for parents to kill there children
which shall prophecey falsely: what leave you to the Jews / wherein they differ
from the Christians? and tell me also / how you differ herin / from that
which I set down: that Idolatry ovvghte to be punished withdraw death under
the gospel?

But pardon me / I think I see yowr difference / which is / that the Jews
must do yt according to the law off Moses / and the Christians according
to the law off whom? why kept you back that? Surely if the Christians be
bound to do yt (as yowr interpretation says) they are bound to do yt by
the law off Moses: for I know no other law off precepts / but that.

There is yet another difference / which yowr words may give suspicion off:
that is / that the Christian parents should rather put them to death / then
be withdrawn by them: so that the Jews have a simple commandment to put
them to death / but the Christians have yt under condition / if they can not
otherwise keep still the true worship off God. But where / and in what shopp
is this difference coined? Whose Image / and superscription bear the yt? the
Doctors. What Paul's? no Whitgyftes. I know him not / yt is not good. For how
shall they be sure they shall not be withdrawn by him: onles they procure him
to be put to death? And althowghe they were owte off peril off being
withdrawn: how are other provided for / whom he may corrupt? And yff it
were possible that poison which he has / could not hurt any other: where is
the revenge off Godds glory / which has been dishonored by such false
teachinge / and in the maintenance vvheroff / the zeal off the children off
God / as well under the gospel as under the law / does consiste? These
differences between his interpretacions he gives incklinge off / but the folly
off them was so apparante / that he durst not lay them open.

And althowge we have already to many interpretations by one: yet here comethe
the third. And this is an allegory / which expounds killinge, confutinge.
Where first / the answerer should have remembered / that he condemned in the
Admonition allygoryinge as Papistical / (which in deed is not so much
Papisticall / as Anabaptisticall) allbeit they fetched their allegory / from
two famous men / master Hoper and Master Alasco. Here yt is Catholic in him
/ that was there Papisticall in them. then observe Good reader / how he that
challenged the Admo. For making the holy scripture a nose off wax, and me that
I make yt yt a shipmans hose: has here set up three interpretations off one
/ and the same place. Off which although never a one / can stand with a
another: yet becawse he thinkethe they all make for him / he stickethe not even
to strike him selffe / to give a prick unto the truth.

And as for master Luther / I answer with Jerome: which (albeit he did not
so well practice it him self) yet in one place of the smaller Prophets (that
comes not now to my mind) says / that to seek for an alligorie, where a
Plain and litterall sense may be had: is to seek a knotte in a rishe. Saying
therefore the scripture means here as it speaks / and calls a spade a
spade / and a figg a figg: to expound killinge confuttinge, and corporal
weapons spiritual / and heretics heresies: is by Master Luthers Good leave
/ owte off season.

Futhermore if Master Luther should by confutinge off their herysies / shut
owte the corporal punishmente off death: he has the Answ. interpretation
(which he calls the^ true meaning off the place) for enemy. So that either
master Luthers meaning was / that they should not only put them to death /
but also confute their heresies: or else yt serves as well to overthrow that /
which the answerer has set down / as that which we maintain.

But observe here I beseech you / the shamfull practice off the Answ. If
Master Calvin / or Master Gualter upon these places / had had any thing for
him / that should have been set down: if they had had nothing against him
/ he would (as h^ has done in diverse places) have used that nothing / as a
prejudice unto the truth: now he perceived they were directly against him /
he is fledd to Master Luther / to borowe this sentence off him. What if I had
alleged the authority off Master Calvin / Master Beza / Master Martyr /
Master Gwalter / and diverse others / for the confirmation off this sentence /
that heretykes owghte to be put to death now / as well as false Prophets
under the law: what if I had browghte master Caluins / and master Gualters
interpretation off this place off Zachary / expoundinge yt as I have done
(wheroff also one off them / callethe those fanticall spirits / which
contrary this doctrine) What place should Master Luthers allegory have had
/ against such an host off learned men / cominge so strongly with
substantial arguments / fetched from the simple meaning off the scriptures?
Yet all men of any reading know that this might easily have been done: if I
would have sought to prejudice yowr part / by the authority off men

I concluded only off that place off Zachary (against yowr fond
distinction) that the same severity off punishemente / that was used against
false Prophets then: owghte to be used now under the gospel / against false
teachers / comparing one parson / and circomstance with a another. As he that
has fallen away from God / and goone abowte to draw others away: to be
handled according to the law prescribed in that chap. 13. off Deuteronomy. if this
be bloody, and extreme: I am content to be so counted / with the holy
ghost: and then shall not you smell off Manichisme / but be a flat Manichean.
And althowghe in other cases off Idolatry / upon repentance liffe is given /
as in the examples off the Lenytes / fallinge away from the truth / in the
general reuolte off the people: yet in this case off willing sliding back In
the next treatise.
/ and moving others to the same: and other some cases / which are expressed
in the law / as off open / and horrible blasphemy off the name off God: I
deny that upon repentance / there owghte to follow any pardon off death /
which the Judicial law does require.

And where you say / that there is no example, from the nativity off Christ
unto this hour: first you greatly forget / how evil you entreat them which
reason negatiuely off authority: and how you cry owte upon them / which (as
you say) off a thing not done, conclude yt owghte not be done. And this
reason is yet worsse: for yt vvoulde conclude / that no Idolater repentante /
should be put to death / because there was none so handled / within a certain
space. Then you may understand / that the princes which have maintained the
gospel all this while you speak off / by whom these executions should have
been done / have been both few in number / and off small endurance off time.
And yet althowghe Constantyne the Emperor were to mylde a prince / and did as
Eusebius witnessethe / much harm in the church 4. lib. off the liffe off
Constable. 1. lib. 9. cap.
with his clemency: yet he made a law as Socrates testifiethe / that as
many as were found to have any writing off Arius should die for yt. if
that were put in execution / as is to be thowghte: the example theroff comethe
nothing behind in severity / that which is here defended.

Thirdely they did not lack / Good / and faithful admonitours to use this
severity. For one writing unto the two brethren Emperors / Constance / and
Consta^tins / shewethe that they owghte Julius firmicus Mater^us.
to punish Idolatry with all severity: and alledginge this law in 13.
Deutr. and another off the destruction off a whole city / which shall be
partaker off such slyding away / says / that they are commandments unto
the Emperors. I have read also in some storye / off Aluredus a King off
England which made a law / that whatsoever he were that went from
Christianity to Paganism / should render his liffe for yt. and not only the
new testamete / but the old also / is the store house where owte we take
our arguments / to prove the truth / and to impugn the contrary. Therefore
yt is an evil argument / to say / yt can not be showed owte off the new
Testamente, therefore yt is not true: when as a man may rather reason / that
forsomuche as yt can not be showed owte off the old testamente / therefore yt
is not true. Consideringe that there is no doctrine in the new Testamente /
which is not contained in the old: and there is somewhate in the old
Testamente / which is not to be found in the new. And yet forsomuche as I
have showed / even owte off the new Testamente / that he that killethe a man /
and takethe away his corporal liffe owghte to die: yt followethe much more /
that he which takethe a way the liffe off the soul / should die. And if yt
be meet to maintain the liffe off man / by the punishment off death: how
should the honor off God / which is more precious then all men's lives / be
with smaller punishemente established?

Therefore to close up this question / I will ad this: That the magistrates
which punish murder / and rheftes / and treasons / with other
transgressions off the second table severely / and are lose in punishinge the
breaches off the first table / begin at the wrong end: and do all one
with those / which to dry up many rivers fedd continually by one fountain
/ begin at the channels where yt deuidethe / and partethe yt self into many
arms: which as yt is an endless labor / so is this also that they Goo abowte.
For when as S. Paul teaches / that God for just revenge off the dishonor off
his name / and staininge off his glory / 1. Romans
give the men into wicked minds / to the co^mittinge of all kind off sins /
contained in the second table / be they never so horrible / and so makethe the
breach off the first table / cause off the breach off the second: yt can
not be (let the magistrate late as Good watch as he can / boothe multiply /
and aggrauate his punishme^tes as much as he can) I say yt can not be / but
where either the first table is broken / or the breach not dewly revenged
swarms off treasons / theftes / murders / adulteries / periuries / and such
like / must needs break owte in those gouernme^tes. And therefore as the
short / and easy way to dry up the channels / and rivers is to stop the
head / and fountain off all: so the only remedy of purginge the com^on
wealth off these pestilences / is to bend the force off sharp and severe
punishementes / especially against Idolaters / blasphemers / contemners of trw
Religion / and off the service off God And therefore I conclude / that those
which would have the severity of the law against Idolaters abated / do at
unawares / not only thereby utter the small price which they set / either off
Gods glory or of the salvation of their brethren: but withal declare them
selves enemies to common wealths / and off all both cyuill / and Godly
honesty of liffe.

Your conscience Master W. and the conscience of all men bear witness / that
both here / and almost every where / you wringe my words clean contrary to
my meaning: and therein I am well content the Judgment remain with the
reader. And althowghe I am fully persuaded / that there was no occasion taken
off evil by this doctrine: yet if any wear / it being the doctrine of the
holy Ghost / whosoever ever has taken occasion of evil / has without
repentance borne his punishemente: and so shall you most assuredly in that
day / wherein the mouth off wickedness shall be stopped.

Yt may not be passed by / that he in the begininge of the first of these
sections / matched the laws off the Jews / which were the laws given by God
him self / withdraw the laws of the most barbarous / and Profane Tyrant that
ever was: such is the reverence he bears to the laws of God. Note also that
where I say / that I will join withdraw him, that the transgressions off the
law under the gospel, are to be seuerelyer punished, then they were under
the law: He in pretendinge / and making a brage that he would join /
slyppethe me clean a side / and says / that he will join with me that the
magistrate is not bound to the judicial law off Moses, for the manner off
punishinge: as thowghe that were any thing like / that which I propounded.
And in that he answerethe no one word / to the two reasons which I alleged /
that is to say / for that both the knowledge off the law is greater now
then the^, and other gifts off the spirit off God, vvherby the law should
be better kept, more abundantly povvred out now then then: he does not
only slyppe a side / but turnethe his blind parts toward me.

Now to return back / to the Diuis. page 123. I leave to the judgment off
the reader / how importunate an adversary the D. is: which requires answer
of that / which has been so often answered. In the next Diuis. p. 124. seeking
to maintain his logic in dividing / and defining / he makes him selffe
pytifull / to all that ever saluted that scoole. For what an absurd saying is
yt / that becawse the definition off a general thing, agrees unto his
particular: therefore yt is the definition off the particular? As though every
thing / which were verefied of an other / were by and by the definition off
it: or as though the same could be the definition / of the general and of
the special. And what a miserable defense of his division is yt / which to
prove that his three last parts / are not contained under the first: alleges
/ that they are not all one with the first? But as I promised / I will leave
this to the learned reader: that I leese not the time / in confuting off these
tryfles. The rest off his section is answered before.

In the next / beside the sentence which I deny / and he untruly fathereth off
Zuing. that in Ceremonies, things are to be used in the church, which are not
contained in the scriptures* There is nothing / which makes any thing unto the
question. For where he says / that I mislike that of Zuing. (If they be not
repugnant to the word) I have told him before / that I never found fault with
that / but becawse he condemned the Ad. which will have the^ cast in the mould
off the word off God. And as for Master Bezaes sentence repeted here / off
discipline left in the order off the church, and that some things done off the
Apostles, are not alvvaies to be follovved off us: whereby it seemed the D.
would make the reader believe / that he means this / off the points of
discipline now debated: yff I should herein charge him with untrue dealing /
upon Master Bezaes book off Epist. Which declares in so many Epist. 11. 14.
20. 83.
places / and words / that there is a Discipline off God left unto his church
unchangeable / and precisely determined in the word off God: and how he makes
the parts thereoff / the same which the D. fights against with might / and
maine: he would paraduenture say / that he could take no notice off that /
which was not yet brought to light. But when the same book from whence he
drew these outorities / mainteneth those parts off discipline towching the
Eldershipp / the consent off the church in Eccesiasticall elections / the right
institution off Deacons / etc. as necessary / which he will have arbitrarie:
he owght to have understood / that those things which M. Beza notes / under
the name off Discipline left at the order off the church, are nothing less
then these / which he would insinuate. Which he might yet easelier have
understood / by the place which he alleges out off the Corinthes / that
leaves yt not in the churches power / either who shall govern / or what they
ought to do which must govern: but how that government which is prescribed
/ may be used most decently / in regard off circumstance off time / etc. For
even in that place / the Apostle defining off certain points of discipline /
(as that women ought not to speak in the church, etc.) declared sufficiently
/ that he meant not to leave the government off the church / in her own
disposition / and order. But what M. Beza meant by this arbitrarie Discipline /
yt shall yet better appear in the next tractate / off the Election off the
church: where this here spoken generally / shall there belaied open by example.
the rest off this Diuis. is answered.

In the next Diuis. I leave yt to the judgment off the reader page 130.
/ whether I have truly gathered off his words. As for the defense he makes
to prove / Truly and Purely all one (for so he must / if he maintain his
answer) the first reason he brings / (that a man may preach true things,
and not truly) is clean overthrown by his own answ. for to overthrow (that
which he falsely attributes unto the Adm.) that the word is not truly
preached, becawse the Ministers are not duly called: he says / that the
reason is not Good / becawse ho we wicked soever the man be which preaches,
yet he may preach the true word off God. Here either the Ans. must make to
preach true things / and to preach truly all one: or else he has not
answered to the argument he supposes the Adm. to use. The other is / for that
S. Paul uses these words in truth, for syncerely. Wherein beside the former
fault (which is the contrariety with him self) he should have learned / that
that manner off speech / is taken off the Ebrues: which as they call a lie / not
only that which is spoken / but that which is done / or imagined against the
truth: so likewise contrary. Which manner off speech not being received in our
tongue / is fondly / and out off time pretended: considering also / that the
translatio^s in our tongue (as in others) have shunned that phrase / as that
which they could not reach unto.

Tract. 2. and 3. according to the D. Off election of the minister.
Cap. 1. Diuis. 1. Off the Trial off ministers in learning and conversation.
THe reply stands upon the certain / and infallible ground Page 133.
off the word off God: which is / that the church owght not to put forward
any to the holy Ministry / without good trial off his sufficientie. Then yt is
vpholden / off the words off the text / that two were set up / and caused
to stand before the congregation. For after that saint Peter had declared /
what manner off man he owght to be / which Act. 1. 23.
should fill up the void place off Judas: immediately S. Luke shows / that
two were put up / as if he should say / consider whether these he such / or
no / as ought to chosen / and which agree with that which is required off him /
that must supplye this place. The reason wheroff was / for that all the men
which where in the church at that time: were not capable off that function /
having by no lykelyhood been with our savior Christ continually / from the
begininge off his preaching / until the day off his ascension.

And unless that S. Peter mente to subject those unto the trial off the church
/ which were to be chosen: why instructed he the church / and gave a rule to
sever / and try them by? After the church agreed / either by voice / or by
silence / that they were such as behooved: S. Peter went forward / and
conceived a prayer as followethe there in the text. And that this is the
plain / and natural order off that action: he that has but one eye / may
easily see. The scripture is short / and in a few words comprehends many
things: and touching certain points off a story / leauethe other to be
gathered off the diligent reader: sometimes which was done before / by
expressing that which was done after: other sometimes that which is done
after / by expressing that which was done before. Whereoff (yff need were) yt
is not hard / to show diverse examples: And theroff is that sentence so often
used off the Hebrew Doctors / (...) The Scripture stays yt self upon, or
presumes an understanding reader: withowt the which yt shall seem very
insufficient / that is most perfect / and vvithowt the which / a great portion
off the word of God / is lost.

And where as you say / that yt is certain that there was no trial, because
they were sufficiently known: first / yt appears not by any words in the
text / that they were sufficiently known. And considering that (as yt comethe
como^ly to pass / in a persequuted church) there were by all likelihood some /
lately come to the church they might be well unknown to the^ / althowghe they
were well known to others. The^ the question is not / whether they were
examined or no: but weather they were set up to be tried: so that if there
were a proferr off trial / althowghe no trial followed: the place is aptly
alleged. For albeit they were known to the whole company / so that there
needed no inquiry into their behavior / or other things which are in the
compass off the church / to judge of: yet that is no cause / why they should
not be offered to the examinacio^. Nether is yt reason / that the known
habylytie off some one / or two: should break an ordinary law / in the
church off God. And you that have served your self / more the^ once / or
twyce / vvithowt cause (as shall appear) off the manner of civil elections /
to overthrow the Ecclesiastical: might here by the consideration off them /
have been delivered / from this abusinge off yowr self / and others. You know
in the election off follows / and scolers / where the law commaundethe an
examination before the election althowghe the parties to be chosen be never so
sufficient / and there sufficientie never so well known / to all to vvho^ the
choice belongethe: yet the offer of themselves to be examined / is so necessary
/ that if that be not: they ca^ by no means be chosen. If therefore man's law /
in such small elections / has such force / that yt will give place to no
man's excellencye / or singularity: how much more owght the law of God /
which byddethe generally without exception / that they should be tried
which are promoted to the ministry, in so great / and weighty an election /
1. Tim. ^. ver. 10.
to keep her force?

Where you say / there was no other cause off presenting them, then that which
is expressed in the text: tell me what cause is expressed / off presentinge
them in the congregation? surely none that I read. those two which I alleged
in my reply / are gathered / but none is expressed. So that if there were no
other cause / off there presenting / then that which is expressed: there
should be none at all / and that action off the Apostles / should be to no
purpose. What express words are there in the text, contrary to this trial,
or at the lest offer off trial? the words should have been noted / the
meaning should have been beaten owte: where we need your help / there you
forsake us. where the meaning is clear / and without controversy / there
you trouble your self / and us boothe.

If yt be a rule to be followed yt must be followed wholly, says the answer.
This is very definitiuely / and magistrally said: and being a dangerous error
(as that which tends to the overthrow of the chiefest heads of Christian
religion) is notwithstanding farced / with scoffing questions in derision off
the truth. I never learned, nor I do not use / to add, or take away from the
word off God: I expound the scripture / and gather off it / which is not to
add: and in saying / that something is not to be follovved off us, I take
nothing away: for I confess yt to be so as the story reporteh. And although
that part be no example to follow: yet even now / and to the end / yt
conteinethe a profitable doctrine. But if I take away from the scripture /
because I say / that some Part of that action is not to be follovved: you do
much more / that say / nothing theroff is to be followed. I distinguishe
bewee^ne that which was for a time / and that which is perpetual: and to
distinguishe / is not to dismember. All the revelations I have / are out off the
reveled word off God: I know that this part off this action, touching the
examination / is to be followed, because yt is confermed by other places off
the scripture: the other not so / for that yt has not / the like confirmacion.
This spirit off slumber / whearwithe the lord has stricken you in that you
say / that if a rule be to be followed yt is to be observed wholely: shall
better appear when I come to yower answer / of that which is written in the 51.
and 112. pages of my former book / where this is handled.

No doubt (says he) this is an extraordinary example. As Archidamus (...).
Plut.
said to his son^e / being to venterowse / and boldhardy / either put to more
stre^ght, or take away some of this courage: so I must admonish you / that
either you would come stronger with arguments / or else goo softlier / to
these doctoral determinatio^s. Is yt without all doubt, that all things are
here extraordinary: nothing of necessity to be followed? For so you say / when
you will not have yt followed in other part / because some one is not to be
followed. What is yt not necessary / to admonish those to whom the election
off the ministers belongs: to tell them what manner a one owght to be chosen?
if that be not / yet is not this necessary: to commend the election of the
minister of the word / to the prayers of those which are present at the
election?

And where as he says / that yt being extraordinary, is not off necessity to
be followed; he should have said / that being extraordinary / yt owght not to
be followed. Now when he grants them to be such as may be used / althowghe
not necessaryly: he concludes against him self / that they are not
extraordinary. for as those things which are ordinary in the word off God /
owght to be followed: so those things that are extraordinary are by no means
of us / withowt an extraordinary spirit / to be followed: things which may
be done / or left undone / are nether ordinary / nor extraordinari / but
have a mean nature between both. But as it is in in proverb / the egle
ketcheth no flies: Master D. has greater matters in hand then these: and yet
to keep the propriety of speech / profits much / to the keeping off the
pure nes of doctrine.

But the words off master Calvin (says he) are plain. So they are in
deed / plain to show your great vntreuth / and plain to show that which I
contend for: that is / that althowghe some things are not to be followed: yet
other some things in this election / are and owghte to serve / for the
direction off the election off the ministers now. And because you shall not
abuse the reader / nether with the denial off things to be so / which are
manifest / nor guilfull escapes / wherwithe you go aboughte to defeat the
autorities which I allege: although yt be much against my will / to lenghthen
my book with translating so thick / and three fold of other men's sentences
into mine: yet being driven to yt / I had rather be somewhat troublesome to the
reader: then that yowr dishonest practices should not appear / to all that
will not willingly close there eyes against the truth. But before I cum to
master Calvin / I will set down Cyprians words which are there commended by
master Calvin. Cyprian therefore (speaking off the election of a Minister)
writethe amongst other things / thus. God commands that the preyst should
be placed before the face off the whole congregation off the Jews: that is
to 1. li. Epi. 4.
say, he does teach, and shevve, that the ordeininges off the ministers,
ovvghte not to be made, but withdraw the knowledge of the people standing by:
vvherby they being present, either their faults should be discovered, or
their virtues commended: and so it may be a just, and a lavvfull ordination,
which is by the voices, and judgments of all examined. The which after
ward according to the dyuine mastershippe, or authority, is observed in the
Acts off the Apostels: where Peter speaks unto the people, off ordeining a
bishop into Judas place. Off which place first yt appears / that the people
not only had / but ought to have to do / in the appointing off there
minister: and that not by any custom / or decree off men / but by the eternal
word off God / both in the old / and new Testament. Also / that their right
consists / both in examining the life off him which is to be chosen / and in
the approbation off him yff they like off him / or refusal if they like him
not: which Cyprian proves both by the 20. off the numbers / by this place /
and the sixte off the acts / which he also cites.

Now I come to master Calvin. After he has in the 13. section / showed that
the election off the Apostell into Judas place / is no certain rule for our
elections: he shows further whearin 4 li. 3. ca.
yt is no rule: namely / for that the election there was committed to lotte /
the vocation off an Apostell so requiring / that by the judgment off the lotte
/ as yt were by Gods own mowthe / a successor might be appointed in steed off
Judas. But in the 14. section / he shows the lord so approuethe off the
judgment off men (which he after expounds the church) that even in the
Apostels appointement / which have this prerogative that they should be
created immediately from God / the judgment off the church should not be
passed by: and to that endecitethe the 13. off the acts and 2. verse / and
this place off the first off the acts and 23. verse / and off those places
gathers a perpetual document / to establishe the discipline / and order off
the church in elections / for ever. Whearby appears / that master Caluins
mind / is not (as the doctor would make us believe) that there can nothing be
gathered out off this place / perteining to our elections.

Afterward / confuting them which upon the places off Timothy 3. cap. 15. s.
/ and Titus / gooe abowte to prove that the election off the ministers / is in
the Bishopps power, he says thus / Well therefore said CyPrian, while he
contendeth that yt comes off the authority off god, that the minister
should be chosen the people being present, in the eyes off all: and should
be by the common judgment, and testimony approved worthy, and fit. And forth
with reciting Cyprians words (before alleged) and quoting this place off the
Acts / he concludes in this sort: we have therefore (says he) that this is
the lavvfull vocation by the word off God: where those which are chosen,
are appointed by the consent and approbation off the people. Here again yt is
manifest / that Master Calvin uses this place off the Acts / to prove that
the election owghte not to be withowte the approbation / and consent off the
people. Furthermore / speaking against 4. li. 5. c. 2. s.
the popish election / for that in yt all is in the pleasure off the bishop.
He cites Leo and Cyprian / which prove that by the word off God / the church
owghte to have her interest / in the election off the minister: and many
Synodes / which do severely prohibit such elections / and if they be made /
command that they should be off none effect. Then concludes / yff these
things be trvve, there is this day in popery no canonical election, nether
by Gods, nor by any ecclesiastical law. And if there were nothing else,
how can they excuse them selves, that they have spoiled the church off her
right? And so goes forth / with confuting off the same reasons off the
Papists / which are afterward alleged off the doctor. This may be
sufficient / to let the reader understand / how the Ans. would shamefully
abuse him / with the authorytie off M. Calvin. Wherein I do not forget / that
in going abowte to prove that this place off the Acts has place in diverse
points in the ordinary election / I have together with those places /
belonginge to the examination / pressed also those which touch the election yt
selffe. Which I did pourposely that I might not be compelled / to set down
these places again a litell after: Where yt being alleged for the election /
which is here alleged for the examination / receives the same answer off the
S. which this doothe.

Unto my reason in the second Division / that if an examination page 133.
be necessary for a deacon yt is much more necessary for the minister,
(against that he said / that the fixed off the Acts, could not serve to
prove any thing, touching the ministers election, because yt was off deacons)
he answerethe not / but passethe by quietly / and makes no words. But his
other saying / that there is no mention made off any trial, he holdethe still
for good / askinge me what one word off trial is there? I answer / that
albeit there be not this word try, yet there is that which wayeth as much:
for the greake word look (...)
ovvte, can not be severed from a trial. And if S. Luke had but used the
simple verb / which in our tongue signifies consider / yet that off yt selffe
had force to have lead the chusers to a trial / off them which were to be
chosen: now vsinge the compounde / thereby he laid upon them / a greater
necessity / and a more careful diligence off trial off them. Where if the
Aposteles had not mente herby / to have called the church to a diligente search
/ and trial off those which were to be choosen: they would have contented
them selves to have said / take from amongst you, etc. And although the
whole church had knowledge off those which were the fittest to be chosen to
that office (which is both unlike / and almost impossible / saying there were
certain thowsandes off late added unto the church): yet even those which are
well known unto us / when they be to be chosen unto such great charges / are
to be inquired into a fresh. For that knowledge off a man / which is
sufficient for us to live with him in private society / and common course off
life / is not enoughe to promote him to such a dignity in the church: and
that experience off one / upon confidence wheroff we durst trust him with
our weightiest affairs / is not sufficient thereupon to commit unto him the
lords matters. So that consideringe the weighte off an ecclesiastical office
/ the manifold creuisses off man's dissimulation / with the dullnes off our
sight to epsy them: there can be no fear off too much trial / eue^ off
those which we think we know already. And therefore allthoughe the whole
church / had knowledge off those which were apt for that office: yet the
Apostels admonition / off diligent considering whom they chose (which could
not be withowt trial) was not owte off time.

Again that the Apostels give in charge unto the church / that they should
chose such as had testimony off there good behavior: pertains to the
examination / for the church in seking testimony off there good conversation
/ tried them what they where. And unless this be trial: towching the
conversation off him which is to be chosen minister / in the church of England
there is no trial at all: considering that the trial which is had / is by the
testimony off certain. So I conclude that this place off the acts / making
for the examination off the Deacon: is much more strong / for the examination
of the minister. To the next section I answer not.

Diuis. 4. What is in the beginning off the book / because you page 135.
set it not down / and I have not the book to see: I will leave to every one
to consider. Howbeit the words which I allege owte off yt / where (speaking
to the Archedeacons) he says / Take heed Pa. 25.
that the persons whom you present unto us be apre and meer^ etc. declare
that the bishope passethe his election / upon the only examination off his
Archedeacon. But yt makethe no great matter how many examine / saying the
election / and ordination hangs only upon the Bishops pleasure. And he
partly saying / that all the matter stands in the courteousie off the
Bishop: and partly (as yt seems) willinge / that that gowlfe should
swallowe up / all other men's interrestes in this election: sets him self
to prove yt.

And where as I alleged / that yt is not safe in so weighty a matter, to
commit that to the power of one, which may be with less danger done by
many: he goes about to prove / that the bishop is off all other fittest for
that matter. Wherein observe / that the D. is quyte goone from the cause. For
the question is not / whether he be off others most fytt: but whether yt be
fytt that he alone should do it. So that if he will have it a reasone
against the cause / this yt is: The bishop is more hable then any one / to
make a good examination / therefore more hable to make yt then a great sort:
more hable to make yt then any one / therefore more hable to make yt alone /
then when he has other joined with him. Which is all one / as if he should
have said: The right hand is more apt to do things then the left /
therefore yt is better they be done by yt alone / then with the help off the
left. I do not here take exception / against the long experience in these
things, which he says the bishop has: yet he cannot have it at his first
orderi^ge of ministers: and others might have yt as well as he / if the
examination were as well permitted unto the^ / as unto him. I medell not also
with the bishopes either sound learning, or ruled affections: which what they
be in some / is well known / what theye may be (consideringe that they be not
tied to the rochet) yt is easy to be considered: Let him be as well
experienced / learned / affected / as such a bishopp may be: yet has he
won nothing by all this / but that the bishopp owght not to be shute out /
in this examination.

Where he says / Surely if any one man, or mo be void off such affefections,
and thought meet to have such matters committed unto him, yt is the Bishopp: yt
had been good he had assured that Surely: with some reason: otherwise yt must
(as yt is) be holden for an vnshamfaste begging / of that which is denied. And
off the same sort is that which follows / that if he be worthy the office
off a bishope, he may safely be credited, with all things incide^t unto the
same: for this is that which lies between us: whether yt be incident to the
office off a bishop to have thonely examination off those, which are chosen
to the ministry. Which yff I could give you: I would / to be ridd off these
importunat askinges.

Y^ followethe not / because civil matters which touch the commodity off
this liffe / may be committed to one: therefore ecclesiastical also / which
concern the liffe to come / may be so hazarded. Nay for so much as ma^s
insighte into ciuille affairs / and judgment in them / is sharper then in
matters perteininge to the church: it is clear / that there ye more help
required in these / then in the other. Besides that / when as princes by taking
counsels unto them in their weighty affairs off the whole realm / and for
better deciding off private men's causes / appoincte whole be^ches off Justices
/ standing off five / or six: they do sufficiently declare thereby / how they
have the Judgment off one (be he never so wise) greatly in suspicion off error.

It is sufficient that the prouer be off moo eyes saying better then one, be
true for the most part / which is the nature off a proverb: And in making
off laws / the law giver respects what is for the most part expedie^te /
and not that which may be good some times. For otherwise it might be said /
the bishop should not meddle with the election / but his chapleine: because
yt may happen / that he is more hable to meddle in that matter / then the
bishop: It is no small owtrage you do the church off God / to accounte off
yt / as off an ignorante multitude. For unless you mean the church / when
you say / then a thousand other which be ignorant: you speak beside the
matter / seeing we do not permit either examination / or election off the
ministers to every multitude / and blind assembly: but unto those only /
which make an open / and clear profession off the trewthe. Therefore yowre
glorious / and great speeches always off the Bishops / are affectioned / and
aspire somewhether. For if they preceded off the fear off God: yt can not be /
but that fear of God / and spirit of humility / which taught you to
speak so of them: would have spoken much more reverently off the church /
whose servants they owghte to be. And when you say / or that in such matters
be far inferior to him: yff you mean ten thousand off those which be off the
church: the voice is strange / and needed some reasons to acquainte us with
yt: especially saying it touchethe (as you think) the cause. But you wander
still / and the prouer be you confute not. For let yt be / that the bishope
sees more then 10000. off the church (which proportion being more unequal
/ then that between the son / and the moon / carries with yt a sent off the
popish insolency) admit I say that the bishopes eye be so good: yet if the
church have any eye at all / that being joined with his / will see better
then his alone. And that is the meaning of the proverb / not to compare one
good eye with many bad: but to show / that that which alone i^ hable to do
somewhat / with company / and help is hable to do it better. And therefore
oneles you will have yowre bishop so full off sight / that he can leave no
thing unseen: and to have received the spirit withowt measure / which is
only proper unto our savior Christ: you have yet browghte nothing / to
show why he owghte not to have the assistaunce off others / in the examination
off the minister. S. Paul refusethe not to learn of the Romans 1. 12
church off God / in those things wherein he went as far beionde the
bishope, as any bishope can go beionde the simplest of his diocese. Apollos
was instructed / and tawghte of a power handycraftes Act. 18. 26. Socrat. 1. 8
Sozom 1. 18.
man / and his wiffe. In the counsel of Nice / a simple man / and one that
knew nothing but Jesus Christ / both ouerturned / and turned a Philosopher
/ whom all the 318. Bishopes / could not move. both S. Paul / and Apollos /
and the 318. Bishopes / were off Singular knowledge in those things / wherein
they were aided / and desired to be aided / off those which were a great deal
inferior unto them. What honey have our bishops eaten off / that they can see
so clearly / into the fitnes off a minister: that the church off God / can not
both see that which they see / and that also which they have ouerseene?
Belike yt is / because our bishopes are more sharper of Sight / then ever any
were: and our churches more ignorante then any have been before. And if the
churches were tawghte of them (wherein they are for the most part / smalliest
beholdinge unto them): as the plentiful knowledge of the church / should
have been a seal of their abundance: so what soever is said off the
ignorance / argues now the want of their knowledge / and in the end
retourneth to the weight of their condemnation. Which yff it were well
considered of him: yt seems / that for the ialousie he has over the estate
of a Lord Bishope, he would have spoken more reverently off the church.

Whereas you say that offices off greatest charge are only in the Princes
choice: Still you confute your shadow: for I speak off those elections
wherein diverse have interest / sainge that yt seldom comes to pass, that
upon one man's report off his ability which is to be chosen: all the rest
which have interest in that election, will give their voices. What word is
here / which gives occasion to speak off the princes elections / which are
made by her self alone? you have therefore picked a quarrel / to speak off the
welbestowing of offices / onles yt should be some profit unto yowr self /
which you imagined might come by sprinckling off these fair words: I see no
end of yt. sure I am / yt is no answer unto that / which yt pretends. For
my part / I will not contrary that you speak / of the good bestowing off the
offices by the prince: And I am well assured / that some of them be bestowed /
of most worthy men. But yt is good for princes / to have as it were ears off
horn / against such sweet songs as these be: and notwithstanding them / to
stire up them selves to greater warenes in the bestowing off their offices.

Therefore to let pass the offices off charge in the com^on wealth: for the
Ecclesiastical charges / which her majesty bestows / althowghe they be off
the greateste port: yet they will appear / not off the greatest charge.
unless you mean charge actiuely / that is to say great charge / and
unprofitable burden unto the church / not bearinge the church / but borne of
yt / even almost to the breakinge off her back. And those also (as I think)
are not chosen off the prince alone, but named only / and chosen off the
canons off that sea / wheroff he is to be appointed bishop / and confirmed
off the Archbishop. But let yt be here observed / that Master D. seems by
affirmation off this thing (although falsely) without saying any thing against
yt / to give the election off the bishop only unto the Prince: which if he
may do in the bishopes / which he takes head ministers: much more may he
do it / in the other ecclesiastical orders / which he accounts under the
bishope. here first I would know / wether he will stand to this / or no: or
whether having nothing to answer / he used this for a shifte. Then whether
the Bishopes will take in good part / this translation of the church right
into the hands of the civil magistrate: and whether for there te^poralties /
as it were for a mess of rise potage / they will suffer the churches
inheritance to be thus riotowsly alienated: to be offered where yt is not
asked / to be given where it is not received. And if they be content to part
from this if need be / that they may keep the other: or be content that
master D. forrewarde off his proctorshipp / should have the disposing off it
at his pleasure: then I shall have something more to say in this behalf.

The election off ministers / committed to the bishops alone / is made off
custom / that is twice a year at the least / if any come: at the entreaty
off some in authority of tentimes: and not upon any need off the church. For
when almost / is the request of such as be in authority / refused in that
election? In deed there is no extreme suit / the door is not so hard locked:
there neadeth but the liftinge up off the latche. And yt is also I grant
withowt contention, For how can the bishope contend with him sele? Unless he
and his conscience sometimes fall owte / which contention is to be wisshed /
that it were greater. And set me all the borowghes / and cities together in the
whole realm / where elections pass by voice: you shall find / they can not
all afforde / so many unworthy officers: as have swarmed ministers / from the
sole election of the most part off the bishopes in England. If yowr
affirmacio^s be so clear / that you dare com^itte the^ so barely withowte
proof / to the judgment of me^: I dare with better reason / let these go:
which are done before the son / in the conscience off all men: which the
brwte beasts them selves would witness / if they could speak.

If he be condemned off the Apostell / which judges off one 1. Cor. ^. 5
man's action before the time / that is before he sees what it i^* what great
presumption is it / thus to judge the church off God? And therefore that I be
no partaker off yowr sin / and plage / which (withowt repentance ensues): I
answer that I think they will choose the meteste: that they will follow the
lord / before the lord of the town, if the lord off the town draw not
with the Lord: that they will not do one off their neighbors pleasure, to
the dishonor off the lord / and the hurt off all them selves / and the whole
congregation: that the peace off God / not contention will be in the church
off God: that they being the church off God / and the mystical body off our
fauiour Christ / shall have an hable / and fit pastor / if they have one like
unto them selves: and so shall be like people, like pastor. And if a whole
church assembled together in the fear off God / with invocation off his name
/ be ouercaried by affection off love / or fear / to chose him that is unmeet
/ the bishope may much more / being but one man / subject to the same
passions they be: onles you can happily show some prerogative / to exempte him
from the common infection. So for any thing yet alleged / the light off
reason / rather favors the election off the minister by many / then by one.
Now let us see whether the holy scriptures / wheruppon we lay the weighte
off this election / receive any better answer.

To your answer to the ^. and sixte off the Acts / you have my replye
before. And where you add further to the first off the Acts / that Master
Beza says / that they were not presented by the multitude, but by the
Apostels only: I know not wherefore you should bring that in. For I say not
that the multitude had the presentation: yt appears manifestly / that no one
had the handlinge of that action / which strikes the bishopes sole election to
the heart: yt appears also / that the judgment / and consent of the church
was required / which is that we desire. Master Beza writes thus / Augustine
with whom this whole chapter is read very Upon the 1. Act.
corruptly, interprets this word they set up, he set up, not vvithovvt a
dangerous error, for here was nothing done off Peter, by him self as one
endevved with greater dignity: but every thing is done publicly, and by
voices off the whole church. Upon the word (...), he says thus / The Ma.
Beza upon the 14. of the acts.
strenght off this word, which is to ordeine by voices, is to be noted: that
we may know that Paul, and Barnaba^ did nothing by their own private
pleasure, nor exerciced no tyranny in the church, as the Romish Harlot does
now, and his assistants which they call ordinaries. And in other place upon
the Upon the 5. of S. Pa. to Timo. ver. 22.
words / lay not thy handee suddenly upon any, etc. That is (says he)
admit not all vvithovvt choice to any Ecclesiastical function, as much as
in the liethe. For all the authority was not in Timothy: but after the
election made by voices off the whole church (as we have said of the
election in the 14. of the Acts, and as appears by the election off
Matthias, and the Deacons) he that governed the company in the name of the
whole Eldershipe, did by the putting on off his hands, consecrate Upon the
first unto Titus.
him that was chosen. And in an other place were the apostle wills Titus /
that he should appointe elders town by town: he refers the reader to
his exposition off the place off the 5. to Timothy / and the 14. off the Acts.
And in the same chapter (owte off the which master D. has borrowed this
place) he shows / that albeit all those things are not allwaies to be
followed / which were done in the apostolical elections: notwithstanding that
they had one unchangeable end. and asking what that was he answers amongst
other this / that nether pastors, nor Deacons should be thruste upon the
flock against the will theroff. And after in the same chapter he says
plainly: that it is tyranny, that the gouuernours off the church, should be
given unto the church, vvithovvte the consent theroff: also that it belongethe
to the Presbytery / to choose the offices off the church / when they be void.
There are a number off more places to be found in hi^ / to this purpose / that
I may leave out hear it. epistle in his book of epist. (because I suppose yt
is in every man's hands) which is most clear for the deciding of this
controversy.

To come therefore to the examination off this dealinge: first in that he says
/ that it had been a dangerous error, if S. Peter had done any thing off his
own authority, withowt the assistance of other the Apostels: in that he
says / that Timothy had not, not only not the election off the ministers,
but not the ordination in his power, but that which he did / he did in the
name off the rest off the eldershipe: and in that he says / yt belongethe
chefly to the office of the elders, to choose the offices of the church, as
often as they be void: and addethe / that he never found in any Christian
church established, that kind off election which is in the power one: yt
is clear / that he utterly condemnethe (...). Imperiu^.
as altogether unwonted / as usurped / as tiran^icall / that election which is
made by the bishope alone: and that this is one of the substantial poinctes /
off a lawful Ecclesiastical election / that it be done by the Eldership.
Secondly / in that he says / yt was the unchangeable purpose off the
Apostels, to provide that the governors off the church, should not be
thruste upon the church, against her will: that Paul, and Barnabas, to
then-tente they vvoulde bring in no tyranny into the church, permitted the
election off the elders unto the voices theroff: that they bring tyranny unto
the church, which vvithovvte the consent of the multitude, at their one
pleasure, call any unto a public function in the church: yt is most
manifest / that master Beza holdethe this / for an other substantial poincte
off a lawful Ecclesiastical election in a church established / that yt be
made with the peoples co^sente. So that yt appearethe / that the election made
by the Bishope alone / receives off Master Beza two deadly wounds / as yt
were in the heart / and in the head: one / for that it is not as well done by
the authorite off the Eldershipe / as by the bishop / or pastor: an other /
because yt is not done by the consent off the church. Now what do we
require / in the election off Ecclesiastical officers / which Master Beza
does not? we require / that yt be not permitted to one, he detestethe it as
tyranny: we say / that yt ought to be done by the elder shipe, and by
consent, at the least off the people, he says / the same.

What are the things then / used in the Apostels elections / that M. Beza
says may be altered: and wheroff there is no certain rule prescribed /
which the church is allwaies bound to follow? forsouthe these things / as
may be easily gathered: that 6. Act.
where sometimes the people upon particular occasions / did first choose / and
the approbation off the governors did follow / other some times / and for the
most part / the governors went before / and directed the judgments off
the people: that in this circunstance / Act. 1. Act. 14.
the church should be at her liberty / to order / and use which off these
ways she should think most f^tte / having regard to the times / and other
circumstances / which might move to take either the one / or the other. Again
where the Grecia^s used in their elections / the cerimonie off holdinge up the
hand / to testify their liking off him that was chosen: other (as the
Romans) goinge from one side unto an other (Whereoff came / pedibus ire in
sententiam): others by silence / did approve that which was propounded: that
in these / and such like the church might use that ceremony / which is
both received in that place / and lest subject to slanderous speech. And
that which the Answ. has browghte here / does especially belong unto this:
and is given off M. Beza where he shewethe / that the manner off the Asians was
/ to testify there consent by liftinge up of hands.

But off what things so ever in the election / that rule is given: Yt can by
no means take away the election from the Eldershipe off every church / nor
the peoples consent / to put all in the Bishopes hand: Saying that (as has
been showed) he makethe these twoe substantial poinctes / off a lawful
ecclesiastical election. And if the Answ. will accord us those: we shall
soon agree for the rest. Upon all this matter I leave to the reader to
esteem / how either vncircunspectly / or unfaithfully / M. S. has not borrowed
/ but taken away whether Master Beza will / or no / his sentences to
overthrow that / which he so often times / and in so vehement words / so
plainly does establishe.

Now for your questions you pray me to answer / althowghe they come so
often / that you may aptelier be called the Questioner, then the Ansvverer,
and that I need not by any order off disputation / be driven to speak to
such flying demaundes: yet I am content / to let you use this advantage off
venting them after this sort / which you can not put in any form off argument
/ and which being a little streighte girte / shrink a way / or ever they
come to be examined. But I must pray you also that where yowr questions be no
weightier / you will be content that I answer them as shortly / as you
propownde them: Albeit I have in effect / answered them already in this
section. I say therefore / Ansvv. to his first question. 1. Act. 13. Act. 14.
Act. Act. 6. 3. and 5.
that where the Apostles in the first off the Acts / good before the rest
off the church / and direct them: that is the most convenient way / for
ordenary elections: as that which was both most used in the Apostolical
elections / and which is borne up by apparante reason: which is / that they
should show the way to others / which are likeste to know it best. And
whereas the people present first / and then the Apostels approve after: for as
much as that roose of a particular occasion / which was / for that the
Apostels dealing was somewhat suspected / as not altogether indifferent / but
to much bending to the poor off their one nation: if the like case should
fall / the like remedy may be used. beside that / that election off the Deacons
might be more safely committed unto the people / then that off the pastors: the
people being more able / to judge off their ability in disposing off the money
/ then off the knowledge required for the preaching off the word. To his second.
The casting off the lottes / for so much as yt was to this end / that the
election off an Apostle should be immediately from God / and not by any man's
voice: that consideration ceassing / the lot also in ecclesiastical elections
(howesoeuer yt seems otherwise to some) owghte to die. In the sixth off the
Acts the imposition of hands / being used in all elections by the church /
and hauig a profitable To the third.
advertisement / that he which is ordained / is set a part from the rest /
for the service off the church / and that from thence forth / he must not
serve him selffe / and his / but the church: and containing also an assurance

needs be holden still for ordenary / to be used in all elections. The prayer

now by so much more necessary then it was then / as the ability is less
now in the chusers / then yt was then: must needs be thought a pattern / to
frame owre elections by.

And where you say / there was no such thing as prayer in the (...) off the
Acts: yt is a token you have little truth in you / which will deny that
which is expressed manifestly in the text. for although S. Luke does not
declare / what were the words they used: v. 6. To his fifte.
yet there being prayer made for them there was such a thing. That in the 1.
Act. two were presented for one office / that was / that way might be made
to the divine election by lotte: that one only was taken / was becawse there
was but one place void. That in the sixte of the acres 7. were presented / was
/ becawse the church was thowght to have need off so many / for the prouysion
off their poor: that all were ordained / was for that the Apostels liked well
off them all. Be there yet any more behind? I looked when you should say /
that in the first off the acts there was a bowte six score / in the sixte
almost six thowsande: there but eleven Apostles / here twelve: there speaking
with one tongue / here with many. For the matters in controversy / that is to
say / whether the peoples consent is to be had / etc. These differences would
have served you / as well as those: and possibly if they had taken you in the
head / you would never have let them go / withowt giving some tribute to
the lengthening off your book. But in all this diversity you reckon up / there
is a perpetual harmony against the election made by one bishope: against the
ambition off the elder which thrusts owte his fellow elders: against the
church robbers / especially which bend there force / to spoil the people of
there consent / in election off their ministers. If you had showed any
diversity in this: you might have helped your cause somewhat.

To those which are bleare eide / one light seems two: and there Cap. 1. Diuis.

fore to M. D. which has the eye sight off his mind scattered / they seem to
differ which agree well together. I well remembered what I wrote, and yt has
not the weighte off a feether / to ouertourne the election off the minister by
the people. For yt followethe not because one deacon is inferior to the pastor:
therefore the whole church is inferior / to either the pastor / or the deacon:
or the deacon may not choose the pastor / therefore the whole church may not
choose him. But this had been well concluded: one deacon is inferior to the
pastor / therefore much more one of the people: and one decon can not choose a
pastor / therefore much less one off the people. Which might have been casely
considered / by proportion off the body / which S. Paul does so often
poincte owte the estate 1. Cor. 12. Romans 12.
off the church by. For set a part the head / which is our savior Christ:
and there is no one part so noble / or so necessary / but being compared
together with all the parts off the body that are under yt: it gives place /
and is inferior unto them.

And it may be showed by example / that they that in a society be equal / yea
superior unto any one in that society / are notwithstanding inferior to the
whole. Peter / and John were equal / unto any two / in the whole college off
the Apostels: and yet they were inferior to the whole company off the
Apostels. For being sent Act. 8.
off them / they must be inferior to those that sent them: and being
Ambassadors from them / they received commandment. A and. 13.
Paul / and Barnabas were by their dignity off Apostleship / superior to any
which were in the church off Antioche: and inferior to the whole church /
for the cause before alleged. Furthermore / we do not permit the choice off
the pastor to the people only / but to the choice off the eldership: so that
although the people alone / should not be superior unto the pastor / yet all
together are / which have to do in that election.

And although these things are so plain / that they could not lightly be
hydde^ from him / that has but moved his lypp to the cup of sound
divinity: yet master D. stands still amassed / merueiling as he that having
stepte many years / when he awaked / thowghte al things strange. These are
the known laws of the house where you were borne / where also you undertake
profession of Do. yt is a great fault that you are a stranger at home. The
peoples examination off their ministers especially / stands in their
behavior: And saying in the church off God / from him that cleaves wood / to
her which grindethe in the mill / there is none so ignorant / but know / and
can give reason off principal poinctes off the Christian religion: the Elders
(which be the flower off the church) can much less be so ignorant as you make
them. Naashe 1. Sam. 11.
the Amonyte / meaning to dishonor the people off God / thowghte yt reproach
enoughe to the Gilcades / if he might have put owte their right eyes / and
(althowghe a barbarous / and cruel enemy off the people off God) yet would
have satisfied him self with that; but you are not co^tente with that / onles
you put owte both their eyes / and leave them as blind / and ignorant
bussardes. These reproaches off ignorance / so oftentimes cast upon the people
off God / are not spoken with the tou^ge off Canaan / but is the proper
dialecte off the Papists / and yt is reprochefull not unto men / but unto the
son off God / whose body the church is / and whereoff he is the head.

The prophet speaking off churches which should be gathered Esa. 11. 10
under the gospel / says / that the earth shall be full of the knowledge
off God / as the waters which cover the sea: the accomplishment wheroff may
appear in all places / where there is any teaching minister / which does the
office of a faithful pastor. I could a great deal easelier / bear the
reproaches which you utter against me: but when I hear you thus rail upon
the lords host / so indefinitely speaki^ge of the churches of God / you are
intolerable. yet if I should speak against this / as often as you give
occasion: I should never have done. And if nether you will cease this
language / nor those that should look unto yt / will stope this
incircumcised mouth: I will commit the cause unto the lord / and wait for
his judgment.

Off the means of an exact examination off the ability off the pastor /
with owte the help off the lord bishop / is spoken in an other place:
where shall be examined / what the D. has to say. It has appeared how
vntrwe yt is that the Deaco^ is superior / or has more gifts the^ the rest
of the body of the church. And besides that yt shall appear in place / a
most absurd saying / that the deacon is above that elder which I mean (for
I mean the same / which S. Paul means) there was no occasion at all here to
speak / off the superiority off a deacon unto a senior. For either he owghte
to prove a deacon / above a pastor: or else he has said nothing / to that
which is in question.

In the 308 page the Bishop is auowed to be a Pastor, here he is Superior to
a Pastor, and therefore no Pastor: for there can be no comparison / but between
two things at the least: and yt is very strange / that a man should be
higher then him selffe. So that to defend these bishops / and Archebishops /
the Ans. has need have a new grammar / and a new logic: for they
transcende / and go beionde all the rules / that ever yet were heard of. I
know what is used with us, but is that a sufficient answer? is this yowr
defense off the book? I prove him to be deaco^ / and you can not deny it:
thereupon I conclude / that he is inferior to the pastor, and you say / I know
an archdeacon with us, may be minister off the word. But the Question is not
what he is / but what he may be by the word off God: for you owghte to have
showed / that a man may have the order off pastor and deacon at once. For if he
be but a deacon / and no pastor: then being inferior to the Pastor / he owghte
not by him self alone / judge of the sufficiency off a Pastor. if he be both
a Deacon / and a pastor / at once: then in stead off ministers / you bring
monsters into the church / and make off the hand and the eye / which are
two members / but one. Unless you will say / that he that is promoted from
one Ecclesiastical degree unto another: kepethe the same still which he had
before he was promoted. by which reason / the bishope / and the Archbishope
are deacons also: because they sometimes had that degree. And then yt is
required off them / that they do the offices off all those functions / the
names Wheroff they bear: for there are no idle / and void names in the
church / which can be severed from doing the duties / that those titles
require. And it is as if a man passinge from one office / or dignity in the
common wealth / unto an other / until he come to the highest: being in that
office / or dignity / should be said still to have all the under offices /
and dignities by the which he has passed. And not that only / but when a
man from private estate / is called either to office in church / or commonwealth: together with the public parson / which he has gotten / he keeps
his private estate still.

Yt has been sometimes (I grant) that either throwghe ignorance off the
institution of God / or throwghe ambition of some / which desire to have all in
their own hands / or upon some extreme necessity / the pastor has done
that which belongs to the office off a deacon / and contrariwise. But
althowghe I should grant / that one might be ordained to be both Pastor /
and Deacon (which is as monstrous in Theology / as yt is in nature / that
one / and the same should be half a man / and half a woman) yet you help
not your self that way. For in saying that he may be a minister of the word,
you confess that he may be also none / but a deacon only: whereoff also there
are examples i^ in our church. Last off all / those Archedeacons which have
the degree off a pastor in our church / do not examine by that they are
Pastors / but only in respect that they be Archedeacons. And so whether he be
pastor / or deacon together / or deacon only: the disorder remains still /
that the inferior / and he whose calling is contented with smaller gifts / is
made judge off his sufficiency which is superior / and whose calling
requirethe greater gifts. Whether the Archedeacon have the examination
committed vntho him only: I refer me unto the book off ordering ministers /
and to that which I have before alleged. Here I would have the reader mark /
that this disorder / of ordeininge ministers / at the testimony off an
Archedeacon / came from Rome: as Jerome Jerome ad Euag. Ca. 1. Diuis. 6. pa.
137.
both notethe / and confuteth.

This reason is altogether different from the second. For althowghe he were by
never so many / and never so well examined: yet were it unlawful for the
Bishop / to admit him / as this third reason does suppose / that is to say /
upon the credit of the Archedeacon, vvithovvt his own knowledge. which I
do not gather off the words off the Archedeacons presentation (as you would
make me) but off the answer of the bishop / Take heed that the persons whom
you present unto us, be apt, and meet for their godly conversation, to
exercise their ministeri devvly, to the honor off God, and edifyinge off the
church. which words whether they have that sense / which I allege: I
leave to all men to judge off. the form off the universities presentation,
helpethe you not: because there is no such answer made by them again unto
the presenter / upon which I ground my argument. and yt makes much against
you. For I dowte not / but that form of presentation / by some one of that
faculty / wheroff the presented person is / was therefore browght in: because
neither all the university / to whom he is presented / nor the vicechauncelor
/ off whom he is to be admitted / can allwaies take knowledge off his
sufficiency / for the degree he asks. As the vicechancelor being a lawier /
neither he / nor diverse other off the university / off them selves are able to
judge / whether he be meet to practice in phisike: but are driven to stay upon
the faith off the presenter, so that you likening herein the Archedeacons
presentation to the universities: do thereby confirm / that bishops admittance
is oftentimes suspended / off the trust of the Archedeacon. I would you had
that reverence of the holy scriptures / that you pretend often: we should then
pass this controuersic easily. But for the place wheroff it is 1. Tim. 3.
said I make a shipmans hoose: yt shall be seen / how trwly you have spoken.
For the declaration wheroff / I take the 10. verse off that chap. For when S.
Paul says / let them first be tried, and then minister: yt is as much as he
should say / that he should not apply them to the ministry / before they
were tried. Whereupon I conclude / that if that place command Timothe / that
he should not apply any to the ministry / before trial: the same implies
/ that he should try them. for so much as any other man's trial withowt his
own / is no trial whereupon he might proceed / to the applyinge of them to
the ministry: especially considering that otherwise / he should offend against
that which he forbids in another 1. Tim. 5. 22.
place / off sodeine laying on of hands. And if it be said / that it is to be
understood of the deacons: the answer is that if he command that off the
deacons election / much more he requirethe it in the Bishops. And whereas he
says / I am still contrary to my self: I ask him wherein? In that forsoothe
I thereby conclude / that the bishop should be the examiner. where did I ever
deny it? But if he think any thing grow unto the lord bishops / or that
therefore the bishopp alone may examine and ordeine / because I grant that he
has interest in booth he has ouercast / the sum is not so great. To show
that the same owght to be the examiners / that are the chusers / it is
sufficient to have showed it in one: the law being the same in all / which is
in one. That it can not be restreined unto Timothy alone / which S. Paul
commands him to do: and that he was no bishop / but an Evangelist: shall be
handled hereafter. You that charge me with contrariety / where there is no
coulor: must be here this second time admonished off off this fault / in this
short section. for in affirminge not once / nor twice / that those things
which touch the election is that epistle, are spoken unto Timothe alone: you
affirm that plainly / which you deny unto me / that is / that S. Paul makes
the same the ordeiners / and examiners.

Salamon says / that all the words of the mouth off god are plain to him
that will understand, and streite to them Diuis. 7. pa. 138. 8. prou. 8.
that would find knowledge: Wherefore I marvel not / if the answer (because
be would so feign have a broad way / where he may drive a sumpter horse / and
is nor content with the lords path way) find many difficulties / and
stoppes. But alas what pains he takes in liftinge at a fether. And of the
three difficulties that are here moved / two of them (which are towchinge
trial of him by sermon, or otherwise, and the fear least he should be an
hipocrite) fall as well into the bishopps choice / and examination as the
peoples.

Therefore the answer is / that that means which the Bishop may use / before
he is Minister for his trial: that also may the church. And as the hypocrisy
/ which utters not it selffe / before 1. Tim. 5. 24.
judgment given off taking him to the ministry / steineth not the
circumspection off the Bishop: no more can it blemis he the trial / off the
church.

There remains only / whether to take knowledge off him / he should come
dwell with the parish, and how long, and at whose charges, and whether before
the death off the former pastor, or after. If I should say / that the journey
he takes to the bishopp / he should bestow in goinge to the parish / and be
amongst them / what vvoulde follow? then he must be there a great while / or
ever they can have trial off him / and thereby grow charges. As who should say
/ the whole church can not take as good notice off him / as the bishop being
but one: or as thowghe the bishop can take better knowledge off his
conversation in one hour / then the whole church can do in one week. If
therefore the church / for trial off his conversation / have need to keep
him at her charges a quarter off a year: the bishop has need / to keep every
one that he will admit / in his house a whole year. Which if he should do / I
dowte not but we should have an easy disputation. And if the Bishop may
proceade to election / upon the testimony off others: why may not the
church do the same? That which was in old time touching colleges off
learning in every city: might be now much more if the Bishopes palaces /
and the Canons cloisters / which serve now to nourishe a sort off idle
seruinge / and singing men / were turned into colleges / and nourceries off
painful students.

Where you say / but admit all these impossibilities: No admit nothing:
hold all that you have / for all is to little. Whatsoever pertains to this
cause / we are (God be praised) able to get it at the swords point / I mean
off the word off God. you take me up (for if and and) In all my whole book
where have I so many / as you have in diverse pages? But what are these
dowtfull dowtes? In your first if (which is if the parish be wholy or the
most part ignorant) for parish / you should have put church / that is to say
/ the number off those which do profess the gospel off Christ. For as in the
time off persequution / when there is no Christian magistrates / the church
seuereth those / which being off the paris he / are none off the church: so
when there is a Christian magistrate / he owght to provide / that those which
are not off the church / thrust not in them seiues into such affairs / as
(because they are none off the church) they have nothing to do with. Other
wise in that point / the church should be in worse case under a Christian
magistrate / then without him: Which were absurd. So your first question is
answered / that the church off God is not ignorant / nor unable to judge off
the soundnes off Docrine.

To the second if which is of corruption off religion: I say / that if / the
corruption be such / as destreiethe the foundatio^s / as in the Arrians
(which overthrow the person off Christ) as in the Papists (which overthrow
the office off Christ): they being no church / owght to have no privilege off
the church. If the corruption touch not the heart / and bowels off Religion /
but as a scabb / feadeth off the owtward parts / to the deforming only off
the body theroff / as the churches off the Jews in times past / which
thowght the ceremonial law off meats / and drinks / and days not taken
away: and as some off the churches both Jews / and Gentiles / which thowght
it lawful to have many vviues at once: these and such life / because they take
not away the title off the church / they can not bar them from their interest
they have in choice off there minister^ / and if they choose such a one / as is
no^ fit: the magistrate is to hinder such elections / and to drive them to an
other. whereunto what you answer / shall be considered when I come to that
place.

And where you ask what if they agree not amongst them selves? Even the same
that is done in other elections: that the election be esteemed off the most
voices. And I beseech you / what is here that may not be said off all other
elections off offices in the com^on wealth / which pass by the voices off
many? So that in going about / to drive the church from this election: you
infer a necessary change / off the whole state off the common wealth. And
except the last off these questions / which is touching contention amongst
the people (which is a great deal more tolerable / then when one bishop
vvithowt resistance / sends forth such vermin amongst the people as we
have to great experience off) there is never a one / but may fall into the
election made by a bishop. For what if he be unlearned / as diverse Bishopes be
in Ireland? What if they be corrupt in religion / as some in England? What if
a gift blind their eyes / that they can be content to wink / at the manifest
faults off him which is to be admitted? What if they be ouerruled off some
noble man / of whom they stand in fear / or from whom they look for some
pleasure? You will say / all these be beside the book: so are all these
which you reckon up / beside all laws of elections that ever were made /
either civil / or ecclesiastical. And it is a very unequal / and (as of one
that fears the insufficiency of his cause) altogether a cowardly match /
thus to compare the least disordered (for orderly I ca^ never call them)
elections / which the bishop makes: with the least orderly / and most
troublesome elections off the people.

And if a man should judge / off the most fittest manner of chusinge off
ministers / by the event: I am well assured / that all the Ecclesiastical
stories extant / are not able to furnishe us / of so many unworthy ministers /
chosen by all the churches throwgheowt the world / which have been since the
Apostles times: as have swarmed these few years / out of the palaces / as out
of the Troiane horse: off that small nombre off Bishops / which are in England.
Of the other side / if a man will cast his eyes into France / both in
persecution / and in peace / and from thence look into the churches of some
parts of Sauoie / and yet stretche them ow^ farther / to certain commen
wealths in Germany / and come home to our neiggbours the Scotts: and compare
generally the ministers chosen off the churches / with the most part off
those which the bishops make: (if he love not him self to much / and be not a
stubborn defender off that he has undertaken) he shall be compelled to
confess / as much difference between the one / and the other: as between
gould / and coper / or any other refuse metal. And yet their is nothing /
which the Ans. does suppose may come to pass here / which may not happen to
them all a part / and to the greatest part off them / altogether. And therefore
for any thing yet alleged / the bishops election is further off then before /
and the equity off the churches consent / in chusinge off Ecclesiastical
officers / more apparent.

For the Westmerlande Minister: I do / not here appointe any certain
parlicular rule / although I doubt not / there are many wates / which the
churches upon the persente occasion / shall be able to take: but it is answered
before in general / that what way soever the bishop may take / for his
knowledge: the same may the church. You tell me often / that it is no matter
what I think off this, or that: and I desire not / that any man should weighe
what I say / further then it has weight off the word off God. Which rule if
it be kept / in the examination of yours also / as I dowbte not it willt we
shall not need to fear any great pray you shall carry away at this meetinge.

I have showed in part / and more also will appear / how the reformed churches
agree with us. And I am assured / that he can not bring one example off any
other church which professes the gospel / where the elections off the
ministers / depend upon the pleasure of one.

Where he says / none is admitted of the bishop / which has Diu. 8 p. 1^^.
not dwelt a convenient time in his dioses: The scolers of Cambridge go
indifferently for orders (as they call them) either to Elie / or Bugden / or
Peterborowghe / and sometime to London: and I am sure they can no have dwelt in
all their dioses. Therefore either there is no such law / or it is cuill kept.
And what will you do with the Archebishopp: may he not ordeine in his
province? so that if you think the diocese so narrow a place / as all those
that dwell in yt may take sufficient trial off him that is to be ordained: yet
you answer nothing for the largeness off the province. To whom is that
singulier person borne out off time / and in a dark corner of the bishops
chapel before the rest / to whom (I say) is his ability so sufficiently
known? if to the Bishop so owght all the rest: to others off the diocese / how
can he? And vvher does the book prescribe any such rule / that for some
such singular person / there may be such a dark election? so that for any
thing that I know / it is still at the bishops pleasure. Sure I am there have
been in that sort admitted / which for any singularity that gave them any
commendation to the ministry / might have well been in the tail / with a
number of the rest.

And the end off notifyinge the day off orders (which you say is especially
/ that there may be resort thither / of such as have any thing to object
against any / that is at that time to be admitted into the ministry) is (as I
think) but a shifte / to serve this turn. the confutation vvherof may be
fetched / from the Bishopps bull / which being set up upon the church door /
as by the sound of a trumpet to gather an army (wheroff the greatest part
off of them / after the bishops hand is laid upon their heads / have power to
invade the church of God at all occasions) propounds this as the chief end
/ that if any be disposed to receive orders / he should repair to the bishop
at such time / and place. For it makes no mention as I remember / of any
such end / or at the least / that that is the principal end. And if that be
so (which I will not precisely affirm / but refer it to the reader / which
may have more assured knowledge then I can have off it) then the vntrewth off
this saying / does notably appear. for if it had been the principal cause
off the settinge up theroff / it ought so to have been propounded: at the
least / not to have been left out.

But whether it be / or no: it is manifest mockery of the people off God / and
if it should be approved off the Bishops / which is here alleged: I ca^ not
see / how they could deliver them selves / from that sore accusation / off
making merchandise off the people off God / by coulorable and deceitful
words. For to omit that the bishop / was w^nt to goo to every church which
had a pastor or bishopp / to be ordained (as I am able to prove) and not all
the churches to come unto him: and to let the inconvenience pass / how the
churches throwghowt the whole diocese can be lodged / especially oftentimes in
a little village / where the Bishopp gives his orders: and to let pass that the
bill which is set up upon the church door / is in the latin tongue / whereby
they can make no preparation / not understanding the sound off the trompet: I
say / to let all these pass: what should the churches do there / to have
trial off the sufficiency off the ministers / which have already an
incumbent? for the Bishops do as well give orders / when the places are full:
as when they are not. And what should those which want do there? when they
know not / whether they shall have one of that creation / or of some before:
one made in that diocese / or in an other.

And if so be they were (which they can not be) sure that they should have one
off them / there being peradventure four / or five which want: either they
must enquire into the sufficiency off 40. 50. yea a hundredth sometimes (which
is impossible): or else they may be deceived. For the Patron / and the bishop
are not tied nether will be / unto these which they have made inquiry off:
but will choose which they list of all that nombre / which has passed
throwghe the bishops hands. And if there were no moo made / then they wanted:
yet when they have not been conversant in that part off the diocese / vvher
the void / and vvidowe churches be: how can they stand up against those /
which they neuersawe / nor heard of before? Therefore if there had been any
truth meant by this pretense: the Bishop should first have have known / what
they be which would enter the Ministry / and so give the churches which
want / warning to enquire by such a day / of such / and such as be suitors
/ and vvoers unto them. So that by these / and many other considerations /
which I leave to every ons estimation with him self: it appears / what
reverence he has of the church / which dare offer such a broken vizard / to
hide from their knowledge / the disorder off the bishops election.

Where you say / that he must off necessity be admitted into the ministry,
before they can give any judgment of his ability in teaching etc. In deed I
hear you speak sentences / and looked for some arguments for the
confirmation off that / which condemns the order off diverse churches / which
for better trial off their ministers / give them some piece off scripture to
interpret. They have been moved with some reason: and will you cast yt away
with a word. But the order of trying his gift off expounding / is good / and
for the most part necessary. For althowghe yt may be perceived by
questioning shortly with him / what his understanding is in the mystery off
Christ: yet his utterance / disposition / and memory (gifts necessary for a
minister) can not be tried / but by such a proof or by long acquaintance with
him: which can be seldom between the ordeiners / and him that is to be
ordained. And if in well ordered cities / there is no man admitted to set up
in any mystery / unless he have offered to the Masters off the company /
some work for a masterpeece / and declaration that he has skill / in that he
will open his shop for: how much more in the ministry off God / owght it to
be provided / that before he be allowed to work / in the great mystery off
our salvation / and lay hand to the framyng of the silver vessels of the
church off God: the masters off the company especially (which are the Elders
off the church) being best able to judge / owght to have trial / how he
handles the goulden hammer off the word off God.

But if M. D. which at other times loses the cord off lawful vocation / will
here to pinche me with all / girde it so straight: I answer / that neither he
which is to be admitted / does it withowt vocation / being thereunto called by
those which have to do in the election: nether do they admit him / withowt
warrant of the word of God. For the lord in com^aunding to take a sufficient
trial of his abitilie / and that precisely before he be admitted: does in that
1. Tim.. 3. 2. 10.
commandment include / all things that pertain thereto. For as when any
peace off grownd is given unto one / there is also a way to come unto it /
granted withal / althowghe the same be not mentioned: so the lord in giving
to his church / power to try his ministers / can not by any means bethowght /
to have hedged up the way / which leads nearest unto that trial. And beside
the reason heroff out off the word off God / joined with the practice off
diverse churches: We have plain examples in the scripture p. 4. ^^*
as I have showed in my former book. And how does not the A. here condemn
manifestly / the exercise of common place used in the universities / wherein
young men (that they might he better prepared for the ministry) do
interpret in there courses the scriptures / which have no admittance or
ordination unto the ministry? I will let you pass here / with this
contrariety with yowr selffe / that you grant to every minister the rule off
his flock / which deni it so stoutly in other places / where you give it to
the Bishops / and Archbishops. If you had found such a one in me: you would
have made such hue and cry / sufficient to have raised a whole country. But
I will not press your contrarieties / but where they be pregnant. And so I
leave it to the judgment off the indifferent reader / how well the answerer
has maintained the wantes off the book / which were by me in this behalffe
assigned.

Their words are to be seen / my reply / and your answer: let the world
judge what forehead there is in him / which says / they Diuis 9. pa. 140.
condemn all as evil, and as unlearned: lest I spend more words in prouinge /
that it is light at noone days. There is more likelehoode / that for want of
just trial / they might be thowght to deny a lawful calling / to those
which are admitted by the common order. But it follows not theroff / that
they say / there are none lawfully admitted / for the cause before alleged.
And it is unreasonable / you 1. sect. 38. pa.
should charge them with that which I write / or with that the second
admonition vvriteth. Touching the nombre off sufficient ministers in France /
I wrote that which I received: wether it be true or no / it may easily be
known of those / which will enquire off it.

Take you good leave / to speak all good off the university: it shall be my
recreation / after your importunate barkinges. yt is my daily prayer it may
goo well with her / and althowghe I be from her. yet I carried some of her
boweles with me: so that whether there be in her / either just cause of joy /
or sorrow: I have them in com^on with her. I can take no exception unto yowr
450. university preachers / not having the register of the university. but
you did warely say / known preachers, and not godly preachers: for some of
those / have troubled the university / and other places with popish leaven of
pargatorie / free will / and Abraham's besome cut out by a larger measure / then
ever our savior Christ taught. But to le^ the corruption off some / and the
inhabilitie off other some / with the so rare preachinge off certain (that as
at the appearinge off a comete / or blasinge starr / or some other notable
change in the heavens: so at their preaching / there may be fear off some
calamity to come) to let all those go / to help to make up this garlond off
450. you owght not have forgotten to subducte / those which are taken away by
death / those which are thrust out off the ministry / and musled by the
bishops / those which are mued in cloisters / those which beside the necessary
use off the university / remain / there / and those which having charges in
the country / lurk there. These being subducted / except the accomptes do
rise better then you show: I fear me / that I may cut of from the number of
2000. hable ministers in the whole church of England / which I assigned before:
as many as you take from that nombre / which I reported to be in France. And
alas what are these five loves / and 2. fishes to so many thousand churches. So
that if you had not done it at unawares / and had not had an other end / then
is false out: we should have had to thank you for this levy of ministers /
which the university has bred / as that which stre^gtheneth the fewnes off
hable ministers / which I assigned.

M. D. hand is still on his halfepennie / and as Plautus Euclio / he suspecteth
every man for his treasure: and by putting his hand so often to the sore /
when he is not touched: he declares plainly / what is the grief. The fear
of spoil off the churches goods, is not vvithowt cause: But there was no
cause to suspecte it in the Innes off court, which off their yearly exhibitions
/ given to maintain there studies / have erected up three divinity lectures:
more for any thing I know / then all the bishops have done. Therefore you evil
requite this liberality / with such suspicions. If the Centurion deserved
praise / for building a Synagoge / and is Luke 7.
commended by the holy Ghost to all posterity / for his liberality in
prouidinge a place for the preachinge off the word: then they for there
liberality / in prouidinge for the minister him self / deserved a better
gratulation then this. If they had thrown in somewhat into the Corban / and
botomlesse bag / it should have been counted to them for great liberality:
But this aid which the church gets by increase off godly / and hable
Ministers / receives little thanck. But the hatred off this cause drove you
headlonge upon them: as your aduertismentes which follow do declare. As
there are some among them that favor this cawse: so there are some / that like
not off it. And yet seeing they have joined together / yea (which is very
strange) made great suit unto the Bishops / that they might of there own
charges provide such / as in seruinge off them might discharge that / which
the bishop has charged him self with: your suspicion off spoilinge the
church, might have had a fitter lighting place / then upon the Innes off
court. Thus much against your disordered suspicion / not altogether from my
purpose: for it shall serve to show / whereupon I conceived so good hope of them
/ and off other the gentry off the realm / which have in diverse places made
the same contribution. If any have forsaken the ministry withowt just cause /
they are guilty off a horrible fault: but I see you accounte them forsakers off
the Ministry / which you have thrust out: such is your equity to vvhipp
them out / and for going out also. And if they hold any off your tenthes / and
would be counseled by me / they should yield them into your hands: least in
being partaker off your non residencie / they drink also off plages which
belong thereto. Diuis. 10. page 142.


Where you say / I have not answered: in deed if your one man be wise / and
godly / and the hundredth fools / and wicked: I have said nothing / nor mean
not now to do / being worthier to be hissed out / then to be answered. You
say / that the 16. Acts* shows how well Timothy ^er. 2.
was thowght off: a noble interpretation. This is allwaies your fashion /
either to corrupt the places of the scripture: or else to tell that which no
man dowbteth of. But for what cause does S. Luke tell / that he was so well
thowght of? does he not show in the next ver. to be the same which I have
alleged? And therefore Master Beza regardinge the meaning of S. Luke / adds
the word (therefore) declaringe for what cause that testimonial was given. This
is your reason / S. Luke shows how well Timothy was thowght off: therefore yt
is untrue that S. Paul to cut of all occasion off evil speech, received him
not, but upon commenmendation off the brethren both in Listra, and Iconium. I
do not say that S. Paul would not have received him / unless that every
singular person had given testimony unto him / which was in those places. but
I showed how circunspecte S. Paul was / in taking any into any part off the
ministry: and how it is not to be thowght / that he would have upon the
Testimony off one / proceeded unto any election / seeing that in one which he
him self was not ignorant what he was / to avoid the evil speech off some /
he was careful to have the testimony off the church.

As it ca^ not be proved* that he would not have received him, if all had not
consemed thereto: so may it easily be showed / that if the most part had not
liked of him / he would not have taken him. For besides that it was against S.
Paul's manner / to do any thing off his own private authority in the church
off God: it had not been advisedly done / to have procured the testimony off
the church / for the admitting off him into his company / if the church not
consentinge / he would have taken him, for that would have bred a great flame
off displeasure / between the church / and S. Paul: and should have been
always shot in the mouth off the adversaries / against the authority of
Timothes ministry / yea off Paul's also unto whom he was ioyined / for that
he had received one / disaproued of the Christians them selves. All which he
might (by your judgment) easily have avoided / if either he would have rested
in his own knowledge off him: or else have addressed him self to some one for
his testimony / and not to have hazarded the alienatio^ of the church / by
com^ittinge the allowa^ce of Tim. unto their testimonial.

But mine argument is nothing worth, because it is drawn off an act off the
Apostle. If this be true / S. Luke was evil advised / to in title his book the
act. or deeds of the apostles. For it is as much in the ans. language / as a
book of deeds / which christian me^ are not bound to follow. and yet it was
not withowt cause / that when there are contained in that book / both the
doctrine / and deeds of the Apost. S. Lu. as off the greater part / entitled
his book / the deeds or acts of the apostles. wherefore does he in the
begin^ing of that book / repeating the sum^e of his gospel / by that
transition / or passage Act. 1. ve. 12. 3.
make one body of them both / and bind them as it were in one volume? was it
not to give the same authority unto the one / a^ to the other: to show that
the church had wanted so much / of a perfect direction / as it wanted of that
story? Wherefore does he in the begin^inge / show that our Sau. Christ
instructed the^ / with the commandments thowchinge his kingdom? was it not
to teach us / that whatsoever they did in buildi^ge of the church: they did it
not of there own heads / but by his authority? And if a co^manndeme^t unto
them / be not a commandment unto us: then have we no word in the Scripture /
to warrant baptism with. For the commandment of baptisinge / was spoken to
the Apostles only / withowt any further lymytation. Finally / wherefore does
S. Luke set out the Apostles / filled with the holy Ghost? Was Act. 2.
yt only to give credyte unto there doctrine / that yt should be beliued: and
not unto there Acts / that they should be followed? yes assuredly / unto there
acres / that they should of every one / according to his vocation (where they
may) be followed.

For the further confirmation wheroff / yt is to be considered what S. Paul
vvrote unto Tymothe. Whom he instructynge / 2 Epist. 3. 10. verse.
how he should behave him selffe / toward the troublers off the church: does
not only call him to the regard off his doctrine / but also his conduite / or
manner off doing. Whereby he meant to note / his order / and manner off doing in
the church off God / and publykly: for yt could be smally otherwise to the
purpose / off that wherefore yt is alleged. Sanct Paul's pryuate doings /
could give Tymothy little instruction how he should behave him self / toward
the troublers off the Church. To the Phillippians also he callethe the
Bishops / Deacons / and whole 4. Phil. 9.
church / both to doing off that which they heard / and which they had seen in
him. If therefore S. Paul / will have the churches follow that which he did
amongst them: yt is manifest / that the Acts off the Apostles / are rules for
us to follow. And unless this be admitted: I would gladly learn off M. D.
Where in all the scripture he can prove / the imposition of hands which I
think he will not deny to be necessary. And this is that / which M. Calvin
does flatly affirm / that the example off the Apostles 4. li. insti. ^. cap.
16. se^^.
in layinge on of hands / upon him which is to be ordained / coun terualleth a
commandment / and owght to be followed. And if where I have said / the doings
of the Apostles owght to be followed in the government of the churches / he ask
how: I answer / that that they did in especial cases / then is to followed /
when such cases fall: those which they did ordinarily / and generally / to be
ordinarily / and generally followed. Those things which they did in founding
off churches / and before they were established / to be in life manner used:
those which they did / when the churches were established / to be in the same
manner ordered.

And (to enter yet further into this matter) Where he says / that the
argument is nothing worth, which is drawn of the fact of the Apostle: by the
same reason he also condemns / arguments browght of the factes of our
Savior Christ / and much more / of all other holy men / and Prophets.
Whereof the scripture is full / as when our Sau. Christ / proves that it was
lawful in some case to break the corporal rest of the Sabothe / by the
example off David's Marc. 2. 26. 4. Luke 25. 26. 27,
eating of the show bread. As when he excused him self / that he did not work
his miracles in Nazareth / where he was nourished up / rather then in Capernaum
and other places: by the examples off Elias / and Elizeus / by which he tawght
that a man may attempt nothing without a vocation. all these arguments if M.
D. had had the answeringe of them: he would as it seems / have said unto our
savior Christ / that they are nothing worth.

I grant / there be some acts of our Savior Christ / and other godly men in
the scripture / which being commendable in them / would not be so in us: they
having some either extraordinary spirit / or commandment which we have
not. Off which sort / Idowbte not but Master Zuinglius mente this sentence /
which you allege: As would have been easily seen / if you had quoted the
place. I think he has been alleged / and quoted above forty times before /
and never a sentence that makes either whot / or could to the matters in
controversy / or which might once provoke me to look whether they were so / or
no: this only place was somewhat material / and here it is not quoted. But
to come again to those extraordinary factes: I say / that as the spoilinge
off the Egyptians by the Israelites at the commandment off God / and the
killinge of Cosby / and Zamry by Phinchas / throwghe the inspiration off the
spirit off God / can not let us from teachinge generally that theft is
unlawful / that the Magistrate only owght to punish public malefactors: so
those few Acts which done of our Sau. Christ / the Apostles / and other
godly men / are not to be followed off us /: can not let us to teach generally
/ that there Godly deeds which lie in us to do / owght to be followed. And as
I may reason notwithstanding those examples / that he is a thief / because he
has taken that which an other has labored for against his will / and he is a
murderer / because he has slain a malefactor / being no magistrate for that
purpose: so I may say he does well / for so our Sau. Christ did / so did the
patriarchs: and he does evil / for our Savior Christ / the Apostles / the
patriarchs did otherwise in that case. And he that shall deny this argument /
vvithowt shewinge some special / and manifest reason / Wherefore it was lawful
for the one to do that / which was not for the other: he is unworthy to be a
scholar in the divinity scooles much less Doctor. If therefore the Ans. would
have by any Good order / put me from the possession of this place: he should
have showed / that S. Paul of some special occasion / which falls not into
our ministry / used this circumspection in taking such a cloud off
witnesses / for the assurance off Timothies good behauior: or that there is
some general rule / and commandment to the contrary. But that as he has
not done: so he can not do / there being no one stepp / of any such either
particular cause / or general rule / either mentioned / or to be gathered of
that place / or of any other scripture. It must therefore be esteemed that S.
Paul did that / of a general equity / and common conue^ience / which owght to
be used in such grave / and weighty matters off the church.

Yea if M. D. Would have a little laid a side / his inordinate desire off
mainteining that which he has once written. he should have found / iuster
cause of this circumspection in our elections / then in this. For if S. Paul an
Apostel / endewed with such a gift of discretion of spirits / would not take
Timothy / which had been browght up from his cradell in the knowledge of the
Scriptures / and had lived in all commendation from his infancy / Timothe I
say / whom he had now known (as it may be very probably showed) of some
reasonable time / into company of his ministe rye / withowt such diligent
circumspection: how much less may a Bishop / in authority inferor unto him /
in gift of discerninge spirits / not to be compared. receive into the
mynistery / upon the Testymonie off one only / a man whom he has not
known before / and whatsoever he be / in knowledge of the word of God far
behind / Timothy? And yt is not to be let pass (for further answer to that
which is alleged out of Zuinglius / Of a deed, or an example to make a law)
that yt has been showed / to have been the practice of all the Apostles at
other times / in there elections: and therefore this is not of one fact to make
a rule / but off the continuull practice of the Apostles.

Moreover by defense of receiving at the testimony of one only / what does he
else / then make as easy an entrance into the highest place off the church off
God: as a man off any calling / and wisdom joined with yt / would make into
one of the least offices of his house? for surely if he have any regard unto
the good order of his house / and consider that the misbehauiour off his
serua^te / whom he will put in any trust / reaches unto the dishonor of him
self / and his whole howshold: he will never admit him whom he knows not
/ vvithowt some one man's commendation / off whom he is well assured.

But the law of God in this behalf / is most clear: which to the deciding of a
weighty matter in dowbt / requires two witnesses / and if it can be three: and
namely where the judgment is of blood / yt expressly forbids / that
judgment should pass upon Numbr. 35. Deuteronomy. 17.
the Testimonye of one. But in the judgment of a minister / where the question
is of a great number / of destruction of body / and soul / and that for ever:
shall it being dowbtfull / be given upon one ma^s testimony / how sufficient
so ever he be? Especially / seeing that there owght to be greater trial / and
more plentiful witness in the church matters / the^ in civil causes. which may
appear further / by that which S. Paul writes unto Tymothie: Where he wills
/ that he should not receive an accusacio^ against an elder / but upon two / or
there witnesses. For wherein civil causes / even off blood / the judge may
proceed unto the sentence off condemnation / upon two or three witnesses: S.
Paul will not have Tymothie / not so much as to receive an accusation /
against an elder / vvithowt 1. Tim. ^.
so many. In civil causes a man may be driven to his purgation of blood / and
to his answer / upon the accusation off one / althowghe he can not be so
condemned / vvithowte his own confession / or other trial / that falls out
after the accusation commenced: but the elder shall not be driven to answer
upon one man's Testimony.

There remains to answer that / which is alleged off Paul's receiuynge
into the company off the Apostles / by Testymonie of one. which if I should
answer as M. D. does / I would ask him how he proves / that which he says
is manifest: for yt is not expressed there / that they received him upon
Barnabas report. If I had said so / he would have charged me with arrogancy /
th^^ I dare set down that / which the holy ghost has not reveled. For it is
said he was received / but that he was out off hand received, or at Barnabas
report, it is not expressed. And if I would walk his way / I could answer /
that it might be / that they first enquired off the truth off those things /
which Barnabas testified / before they received him. But I leave this answer /
to those which think there is no light in the world / to discover such
follies: and think / that S. Lukes meaning was / to show that he was received
upon Barnabas witness.

For answer therefore I say: first / that he uses weight / and weight /
measure and measure / which being abominable before God / in biyng and selling
such base things: yt is seven fold more / in this holy traffyke off the
glorious word off God. For when we give M. D. for proof off trial in the
ministers election / that which was used in the Deacons / which is like / and
comprehended under one head: he lays in so heavy a weight / whereby he
would make us beliue / that the prose is to light / saying / that it is of the
election of deacons, and makes nothing for us. Now when he delivers us a
proof / that an election may pass by one witness / he puts in a lighter
weight / for he brings in an example off S. Paul / one not then to be chosen
/ but already chosen: Which came not to receive any authority / whereby he
might be enhabled / to do that afterward which he could not do before: but to
confer of that / which he had done before: Which came not to submit him self
to any trial / but which had as good right to try / as to be tried / to
inquire / as to be inquired upon. And that I take a^ advantage off this / that
it vvil be hard at any time to find a witness / so withowt all exception as
Barnabas / which knew Saint Paul so well off whom he witnessed / and was
known so well unto the Apostels / to whom he commended him: I think there i^
no glue so strong / as can join these together / A man which is dowbted off
may be received to talk / and confer with an other at testymonie of one:
therefore he may be received to the mynisterie / of the like Testymonie. Again
/ three Apostles may receive one to there conference / upon one man's
witness: therefore one bishopp / may receive one to teach others / upon a
syngle witness. Last off all (which is most absurd) three Apostles may at
the witness off one man / receive one that is dowbted off for a disciple / or
one off the church: therefore one Bishop may likewise receive one dowbted of /
to be a mynister of the church. for it is clear by S. Luke which says / that
S. Paul first assaied to join him self unto the church: that their
consultation was not / whether Act. 9. 26
they should receive him as an Apostle: but they feared that he was a wolf /
and went about under the color off professing the Religion of Christ / to
betray the whole church off Jerusalem. So that if they had been persuaded off
him / as off a Christian: they would have admitted him into the church /
withowt the Testymonie of Barnabas.

Touching the place of the kings 1. 12. 3^. The holy Ghost does there / lay
to Ierobohams charge / both that he made them Duis. 11. 12 pa. 143
off the basest off the people / which was a great profanation of the
Mynisterie: and that he took them not out off the tribe off Levy / which was
an other fault. For if he had taken off the wisest / and honestest families of
other tribes / he would not have said that he took the^ of the basest of the
people. And therefore that place was fitly alleged in that sense which I set
down: and you that can see no other cause, why yt should be quoted, unless yt
were to prove that the ministry should be tied to one degree, or calling: do
your selffe more injury / then a modest adversary would. For the light off
the place is such / that it will suffer no man to be ignorant / which has but
halffe an eye to see. And yet you blushe not to require in your next section /
an other answer unto it. I could have repeated my answer as you have there
twice hard together / objected the same thing: but if I be not able to
intertaine my reader / with that variety which I would: yet would I be
loathe to deceive him / and make him believe / that mutton roasted / and roasted
mutton be two several dishes. For let the reader judge / whether there be any
other difference / between that which you confess my answer unto / and that
first section in the page follovvinge / whereunto you require answer: and
with those colewortes twice sodden / you see I was content to let you goo /
as I have done withdraw a number off other your faults. To the rest I answer not.

What is the necessity off Iudicialls / I have declared. Touching Ca. 2. Di.
2. pa* 144 Eze. 44.
the not entry off the incircumcised in heart, and flesh into the sanctuary
of the lord, which the Ans. alleges to prove / that the law touching the
reiectinge off Idolatrous priests, is abolished: change the sanctuary into
church / which it be tokeneth / and incircumcision into the want off baptism
/ which was the same under the law / which this is under the gospel: and
then it is the moral / and everlasting law off God / that none which is
heathenish in mind / and vvithall professes the same / by the not receiuinge
off the holy Sacrament off baptism / should be admitted to the church off
God. And if he say / that it is not perpetual / for that incircumcision of
the flesh / is now no fault: he owght to understand / that the estate off the
church in the gospel / is shadowed out by those things / which were used
under the law: As when it is said / there shall be an altar built up unto the
lord in the midst off Aegypte, that their shall be no Canamite in all the
mountain Isa. 19 19 Zach. 14. ^^.
off God. And therefore as the remouinge off aulters out off the church / which
then were in use / and receiving in one off the nation off Canaan into the
church / which was then unlawful / derogateth nothing from the stablenes of
these laws: so the admittinge off one which is incircuncised in flesh / does
nothing diminishe the vnchaungeablenes off that law / which the Prophet
there mentions. I am well content therefore that these two be matched / and
that they die / and live together.

The other place / of entringe in clothed with linen, compared with this:
has no color off argument. For it does not follow / that because the
ceremonial law is abrogated / therefore the judicial is also. Are these your
circumstances / that declare the meaning off the place? let it be admitted that
bohte these laws / the one which goes before / the other which follows
after / are abrogated: does it follow therefore that this is also / of
rejecting idolatrous preistes From the ministry? That which is alleged by
the admonition / is the 10. verse. of 44. chapter / and althowghe one of the
places alleged by you / be the verse next going before / yet the second is the
seventh verse / after the place of the admonition. Now if it be sound reason
which you allege / all those laws in the Testament which are so placed / that
they have either a ceremonial / oriudiciall law next going before them / and
another following within the compass off 7. verses: are either quite abrogated
/ or else not perpetual. Which if it be true: fare well Moses / fare well the
Prophets / fare well the moral laws off God: they may all depart with the D.
good leave / nay for that they will not serve him / he thrusts them out.
Before he picked them here / and there: but this is an engine / to overthrow
them all at once. For I appeal to all your knowledges / which have euerreade
the law / if there be any one off the perpetual laws off God: which may not
be found in some place off the law / and Prophets so placed as this is: and
against the which this exception which the D. does so bouldly auouche / may not
be made. I could I am well assured / run throwgh all the commandments /
and by this reason hurl them every one out of the church / if yt were not
folly to labor in confutinge of such phre^sies as these are: and the thing
also were not so plain / as none of any reading in the oulde Testament / can
be ignora^te. so that his pen^e is a pe^knife to cut a sonder all the scriptures.

Touching the interpretation off the words of the Apostle / that the
ministers being tied, should execute their functions, as long as they continue
unblameable: I took the sense which was fyt for my cause / and neither against
the scope off the Apostle / nor any grammar construction. You say the greek is
/ if in trial (...).
they be found blameless. Because you tie me so fast unto the nombre of words
/ where have you this translation? or in the greek words you allege / what
have you to bear these words (in trial? or show me why I may not / as well
resolve the participle into the coniunctine mode / by the conjunction (so long
as) as by the conjunction (if): as long as I do it / neither against the
truth / nor against the purpose off the Apostle. I grant that sense true /
but why may not this also be joined: seeing both the words / and scope off the
Apostle / will bear both? you should therefore have showed / that these words
will not bear this sense / and if you show me that / yet can you not put me
from houlde of that place. For as much as yt is most justly concluded / that
if the ministers must be blameless / before they come to the ministry* they
owght much more so to be / in the execution off it: considering that falls in
execution off the ministry / are more dangerous to the church / then those
before.

Althowgh trial be made before admission / and off things past: yet is it
done in respect off the ministry that shall follow. Therefore yt agrees
well with the trial / That S. Paul should give vvarninge / that they should
no longer be suffered to Minister: then they remain such / as by trial they
were supposed to be. And where you say / that it is spoken in that place off
deacons: yt is much more off Bishops. And yff a Deacon fallinge away from the
truth / owght to be put from the charge / or honor which he had in the
church: much more a bishop. But I nothing dowbt / but that the Apostel
referred this sentence / unto both a bishop / and deacon. For having before
spoken / off them both aparte: he does here join them together / in that
which is com^on to them: ye^ belonging rather to the bishop / then to the
deacon. And it is as much as yff the Apostle should say: I have set before
thine eyes / what be the qualities / both off the bishopp / and deacon: look
now none be permitted to come unto these offices / which have not been tried
before. And that this is so / it may appear / for that the next verse /
which is thouching the qualities off wives / is not only a description / what
wives the deacons / but what wives also the Bishops / should have. Unless we
will say / that S. Paul travailed in describing off the deacons wives / and
left the bishopps wives untouched: which how yt sounds in other men's ears /
I can not tell / in mine it is absurd. Again if the 10. and 11. verses had
been to be understood off the Deacons trial / Paul and their wives only: S.
Paul would not have begone his 12. verse as he did / by a repetion of the
name off Deacons. For yt had been enoughe to have said / let them be the
husbands of one wife: now when he says (let the deacons, etc.) he declares /
that he had discontinued his proper treatise of deacons / which he resumeth
again / by that manner off expressinge the name off a deacon.

The sense which I have alleged / sounds no whit that way / that the virtue
off the word, etc. should depend off the good life off the minister. What
likelihood is there between these / a minister which has fallen into
idolatry, ovvght not to be received, althovvghe he repent, and be never so
holy: and this / that you surmise off me / that the virtue off the word, etc.
depends upon the holiness off the minister? Was the spirit off God
Anabaptisticall / which ordained this first? did he therefore forbidd the
Levites approach unto the table off the Lord / be cause he would teach men /
that the virtue off the Sacraments, depended off the holiness off the
ministers? did the churches which used and established this order / the fathers
which taught it / thereby establishe Anabaptistrie? I did not take upon me to
translate the place / neither do I use for every place which I allege / to
goo to the translations: I took (as I said) that which was for my purpose / and
which I thowght warranted / both by the words / and intent of the Apostle.
And if I should consulte / and confer all translations: could you help me
to a greek text that does translate the new Testament. Either you be a great
stranger in Greece: or you have traueiled further into it / then any man that I
have heard off. I have heard off a greek paraphrase / which is with some moo
words to bring light to the text / as off the Scoliast: and off Metaphrase
/ which is to change the proof into meter / as Nonnus did S. John: but off a
greek translation off the new Testament / I never heard. But this was not off
evil will / and therefore I easelie forgive yt you.

The rules which S. Paul gives in that chapter / are not only to teach that
he that is endued with those qualities there 1. Tim. 3.
described / owght to be chosen to the Ministry: but also teach / that those
which have them not / should not be admitted: and if if they be / should be
deposed. And this you might easily have learned (...).
by common reason / which says / that there is the same knowledge off
contraries.

S. Peter's, and S. Paul's admissions unto the Apostleshipp, was to be handled
in the next section / where I prevent these objections / and give no occasion
to speak off them here: yet they are plucked in before the time / and barely
affirmed / withowt any confutation off the reasons / which I allege. What
confusion is this / and how loathsome repetitions are these?

I say that one that has been an adulterer / should not be received into the
ministry: I prove it / for that S. Paul will not admit one to the ministry
/ that has had two vviues at once. And that it owght to be extended / not
only to the time off his choice / but also to the rest off his life: I prove
by that which is said / of the choice of the widow / where S. Paul makethe
this one 1. Tim. 5.
condition / that she should be such a one / as has had but one husband at
once / and which had not been married unto another / after an insufficient
divorce. For that that is the meaning off the Apostle (althowgh Master
Caluinfolowed an other sense) is very plentifully / and substantiallie showed
by M. Beza. Whereupon I concluded / if S. Paul would not admit her to the
lowest office in the church / which at any time had two husbands: much less
his meaning was / to admit to the cheiffest office in the church / one which
at any time had had two wives at once. This the Answerer / as thowghe he had
never feene or hard off yt / passes by: for what answers he? Forsoothe that
he dowbteth not. but the whoremonger if he repent, etc. may be admitted unto
the ministry. And if I should have answered / I doubt not the contrary: What
then? what answers he further? that S. Paul's mind is not, to seclude him
that had two wives, or has been a whoremonger, etc. I have denied it / and
have showed the reason off the contrary: he has answered nothing. For where
he afterward speaks of the widow / which be denies can be said, to have
ledd all her liffe in good works: he answers not to that / vvherin the point
off the reason liethe / which is / that she ovvght not to be admitted, which
has had more husbands at once* then one: yff that be granted unto me: it is
sufficient for the purpose / I alleged that place for.

Nether was it enowghe for you to pass by my reason / but you must most
shamefullie move suspicion unto the reader / off my favoring off the popish
bigamie. What likelihoode is there between whoredom / or having two wives at
once: with having two wines one after the death off an other / or marying a
vvidowe / which the Papists call bigamie? yff you have no fear of God before
your eyes: is there no reverence off men?

The first off your reasons / to prove that a known adulterer may be received
into the ministry: is that S. Paul by forbidding to receive unto the
ministry, one which had been a whoremonger, or which had two wives at once
should deal otherwise with them, then he was dealt with all him self. I
gave the reason off this in the section folowinge / that our Sau. Christ
(having the law in his own hand / and making no law to him selffe / but for
us) might do that which is not lawful for the church to do: which reason
being neither answered here / nor else where / owght to have stayed you from
this answer. I gave this weapon / but I turned the edge of it / and made it
flat: yt was not therefore to war withdraw all / unless you had set a new edge.

This solution / that it is not lavvfull for the church, nor for all the
churches in there elections, to do that which was lavvfull for our Savior
Christ: if it do not plainly enowghe appear / in the examples off these two
Apostles / it may be seen in the election off them all. For it is not lawful
for any Apostle / or for all the Apostles / or for all the churches joined
together / to appointe any to the mynisterie / which is not fit for the
mynisterie / at the time when he is chosen unto yt: But our Savior Christ
chose / and appointed eleven Apostles / to preach throwghe out the whole Math.
28. 19.
world / when as they had but one only tongue / off the country where they
were borne / the charge whereunto they were appointed / requiring the knowledge
off many tongues. And in this example off S. Paul's calling unto the mynisterie
/ yt is clear / that our Sau. Christ dealt otherwise / then S. Paul deaiethe
with other. For he was called to the Apostleshipp / as soon as ever he was
called to the church? which he forbiddethe by express words / 1. Tim. 3. 6.
when he warns / that he be no new plant, that is to say / lately come to
the knowledge off the truth / which is to be taken to the ministry. So that
you see S. Paul dealethe otherwise with other ministers, then he was dealt
withal himself.

The next reason is / that we read off none deposed from their ministry in
the new testament, althowghe they were found in many things guilty. is it
not lawful for us / to reason against the vnlawfullnes off a thing / for that
yt is not in none off both the testamentes / neither directly / not
indirectlie / neither expressedly / nor conteinedly: and shall you conclude
negatiuely / upon the examples only off the new Testament? The new Testament
makethe mention off notable 4. Ioh. 8. Ioh.
Harlots / and those also which were off the church / and yet yt makethe no
mention that either they received any civil / or ecclesiastical correction:
therefore (by your reason) notable Harlots / are not to be punished / either
with civil / or ecclesiastical correction.

But Christ knew Judas to be a traitor, and yet he did not depose him: so he
knew him to be a traitor / when he chose him. Therefore if this be a good
reason / that a traitor to God and the gospel should not be deposed: it has
the same force to prove / that a traitor may be chosen to the ministry.
Moreover / Judas was admitted to the lords supper / therefore if this reason
will serve to prove / that a traitor should not be deposed: yt is good to prove
/ that he may be also received to the lords table. Judas treason was as yet
hidden / there were no witnesses off it / and therefore by no law off God /
either civil / or ecclesiastical / could be proceaded against. For the law
off God in all ecclesiastical / and civil punishments / requires either
confession by the party / off the fault which is committed / or else proof
by witness.

He proceeds saying that the Scribes, and Pharisees criminous etc. are
commanded to be hard in the chair, etc. Good lord be merciful unto us /
whether will this man goo? will he have traitors unto Christ / sworn / open
/ and professed enemies unto the gospel / to have charge in the church off God
/ and not to be deposed? for whether can these examples tend else? our Savior
Christ commanded the people that they should be heard / in that they said
trewly out off the law / and that their faults should not hinder the^ / to
embrace that which they taught well. What is that to our question? this does
aptely prove / that the virtue off the word / does not depend upon the
worthynes off the minister: and thetherto it is referred. But to prove that
they owght not have been deposed from their ministry / there is not a word.
But why did our Savior Christ not depose them? And why did he will there
doctrine agreeable to the law to be received? He deposed them not for that as he
was the Minister off circumcision / he could not: having not to do that ways
/ but withdraw those that vvoulde submit themselves to his doctrine. And if he
should have given sentence off there deposition / they would not have obeyed
yt: and he had not the svvorde to compel them. This therefore remained for him
to do / that when neither the people could shake off their yoke / nor he
displace them: that as he had often given warning / off their false doctrine:
so he should will them to take heed / that neither the hatred off there evil
liffe / nor off their false doctrine drive them to mislike off that / which
was well taught. And if this be a good reason to prove / that those that be
criminouse should not be deposed / because our Savior Christ willed the people
to Ioh. 10. Matthew. 7. Luke 16. Luke 10. 25.
hear, etc: Then spiritual thieves / and murderers / corrupters off the law /
teachers off justification by works / owght not to be put out off the
ministry. For those off whom our Savior Christ spoke these things / were
such.

And as for the wicked preachers in the church off Philippos: first you are
greatly abused. For althowghe he write unto the Philpiane / yet these
preachers he there speaks off / were in the church of Rome / and not in the
church of Philip. And the^ / if I should ask you how you know / that he did
not will their ministry to be taken from them your own mouth conde^neth you.
For by your rule it is presumption / to speak any thing that the holy ghost
has not expressed. And it is not only not expressed / but it can not be
gathered. For if you think / that therefore he willed them not to be deposed /
because he was gladd / that Christ was preached by them: you deceive your
self. For he says if he were offered up and should die 2 cap. phil. 17. 18.
for confirmation of his ministry: yet he would rejoice in it, and requires
the whole church to rejoice withdraw him for yt. Would not therefore S. Paul
have escaped the Tira^tes hand / if he might lawfuly? or owght not the church
of Philippos / to have forbidden the puttinge to death off the Apostell / yff
they could have done yt? So that you see / a man may rejoice at the fruit off
an action / that an other does: which if it lay in him to let / he owght not
suffer to be done. For when as of evil doing / may come good / as we owght
to be sorry at the evil which is done: so it is lawful for us to rejoice of
the good / which has followed that evil. And this distinction off
reioycinge / S. Paul does include in these Philip. 1. cap. 18. v. (...).
words in this, which he sets down to be / in that Christ is preached. As
yff he would say / yt greueth me that the word is preached by such men / but
yet I am glad that yt is preached.

And althowghe it be hard to know / how they sought to add to S. Paul's bands
/ yet if be true that the greek Scoliast vvriteth / that they did it to this
end / that the persecutors seeing the number off the professors of Christ /
might (being more inflamed against S. Paul / as one which had sown the first
seed) the rather hasten his death: who sees not that it had been the churches
part at Rome / to have to the uttermost off their power / endeavored to have
stopped the mouth off those preachers? therefore I am well assured / that if the
godly off the church which was at Rome / could have restreyned those
preachers: they would not have suffered them / to have abused the gospel to
his streighter imprisonment / much less to the taking away off his life. And
therefore that they were not restreined / proves nothing that they owght not
by any means / so to have been: but rather argues the fewnes of the church /
which favored sincerity off the gospel / that S. Paul preached / which
fewnes also appears in an other place. ^. Tim. 4. 16.


The next reason is very strange / that every one which is a membre off the
invisible church, should be a minister off the visible. For by this means /
may be taken not only the most vnhablest in the church: but those also /
which are not yet called to the church. But your meaning is / if he be off the
church / and other things correspondent. yet one off those conditions is no
where expressed / and the other is almost thirty lines before in an other
sectio^ / and in an other case: so that it is daungerously spoken / and may
give very great occasion off offense. And I leave it to the consideration of
the tender / how often you have quarreled / where there is nothing the like
occasion / as you give by this losenes.

I will also let goo / your improper / and unwonted speech / whereby you make
one / and the same / at one / and the same time / a membre off the visible /
and invisible church. For saying the invisible church upon earth / is off
those only / which either are not called / or lie hid / and ungathered unto
any known fellowship where the word of God is preached / and the sacraments
administered: he which by repentance ioineth him selffe to the visible church
off God / can not be said to be a membre off the invisible church. For as when
the triumphant church is opposed unto the militante / one man / at one time /
can not be said to be a membre off both: so here where you oppose the visible
/ and invisible church / it can not be that he that is said / to be a membre
off the one / should be also a membre off the other. But for answer I say /
that if there were here any comparison at all / yet it halteth down right:
althowghe we owght charitably to think / that he that has given good tokens
off repentance / has trewlie repented / and therefore is of the elect church
of God: yet that foundation always remains / that when the question is of an
others man's election / God knovveth who are his. So that you can draw no
argument from 2. Tim. 2. 19.
his election / which is uncertain unto us: to conclude a certain election /
unto the ministry.

Again why do you say / he that is a membre off the invisible, may be a
minister in the visible? as thowghe the invisible church / were off some higher
nature / then the visible: or as thowghe the true members off the visible
church / did not make one mystical body off Christ with the invisible.

Therefore when all comes to all / the reason is nothing else / but he is a
membre off the church / ergo he is fit to be a minister off the church / which
is very absurd. For by this means all good order off discipline is troubled /
in house / and in common wealth. The master which has been deceived off his
servant / which he most put in trust (as for example in the office off
stewardship) if he give good tokens off repentance / must off necessity
restore him to his place. For will he seclude him from his stewardship / whom
Christ does receive into his kingdom? and shall not we think him / to be a
meet officer in his masters house / albeit he have committed adultery with
his mistres: which is a membre off the elect church off Christ? And this
reason standing / common wealths must goo vpside down. for besides that all
those laws are condemned / which debar men from certain freedoms / and
honors / which have been stained with especial vices: as he that is once
convinced off perjury / from bearing witness at any time / etc. there may
none either traitor / or murderer / be put to death / if he be repentante. For
his pardon is caselie pleaded by the Answ. rule / that if he be meet to dwell
in heaven / he is meet to remain upon earth / and if the lord give him
everlasting liffe / should we deny unto him this tra^ssitorie liffe? And not
that only / but if he had had an office before / it is meet he should be
restored to it again. If this be an absurd / and anabaptisticall kind off
reasoninge / in the discipline off the house / and government off the common
wealth: how is it not the same / in the discipline of the church?

And if you stick so hard to the example off God: it is not hard to show /
how that the lord remitting the fault unto his children upon their repentance
/ has notwithstanding kept them in sharp discipline for their faults / all
the days off their liffe / both in there own persons / and sometimes in
there childre^s / and in all that belonged unto them. so that if you will
needs tie 2, Sam. 12. 10.
the church / to the example off gods mercy / and forgiuence: that does not
only not hinder these chastismentes / and church discipline: but also
extends it further / then the church / or the common wealth may do.

The holy ghost by Iethro / prescribinge what officers should 18. Exodus
be chosen / does not only require / that they should fear God (which is to
say / be of good religion) be wise / and valiant: but also requires (...) 7.
Neh. 2.
that they be trusty, which (as appears by other places off the Scripture /
where this here commanded / was put in execution) signifies such as were
faithful / and trusty to the commonwealth / and which had of their former
life / given good arguments off there fastnes that way. Therefore if in choice
to the great / and weighty charges off the common wealth it is not enoughe
that they be of good Religion / able also for their wisdom / and courage off
mind to execute: unless they have been found faithful in that estate /
wherein they have lived before: how much more owght that to be observed / in
committing the greatest charge / that is under the son / which is the
Ministry off the word? And if in common wealths / men will commit no
great trust unto him / which has deceived the trust / which was put upon
him: how much more owght that to be observed in the church? Where as the loss
/ and danger is greater: so owght the trust to be slower / and the parties to
whom it should be committed / more unsuspected. And yet for further
confirmation he must understand / that for as much as our Savior Christ / and
S. Paul require / that a minister off the word off God should be faithful in
his office: as those to whom the choice belongs / owght to have regard to his
former sobriety / continency in liffe / and other virtues / to induce them
selves to a good persuasio^ off him / towching those virtues: so owght they
upon his former life / to gather such arguments of his faithfullnes / and
trust: as thereby they may be able to meintaine a strong / and mighty
presumption off the faithfullnes which is to come. which thing when they can
not do in one / whose vntrustines is fresh before their eyes: they can not
have sufficient testimony / to persuade their conscience / that he is of that
trust / to who^ they may com^it the church of God. For if they look upon
repentance which he professes: it comes always to mind / that countenance
/ the eyes do lie oftentimes / and mouth oftenest off all. And albeit upon
good / and likely tokens / the church owght to think it a true repentance:
yet it can not be so sure thereoff / as it is off the unfaithfulness. So that in
vveighing the repentance / which is uncertain / with the counterpoise of his
unfaithfulness / that is certain: it will be hard to conceive that strenght of
opinion / off his ^^faithfulnes / whereupon they may adventure / to put him
again in trust with the church. At the least / if there be one fit for the
Ministry / which never was stained with that fault: all men must needs
grant / that he is meeter / to satisfy the consciences off the chusers / then
the other: which the Ans. denies.

And as before I have showed / that the example of our Sau. Christ / in
putting. S. Paul / and S. Peter into the ministry / is not to be followed off
us: So upon the matter I have here alleged / it may Ioh. 2. Psalm. 139.
easelie appear why. That is to say / for as much as he knew the heart off
man / and saw their cogitations long before they were conceived: he needed
not any time to try / how they would behave them selves in their ministry /
nor any either Testimonies / or arguments of former liffe / to help his
persuasion off their fitnes thereunto. Therefore he knowing / both by the fulness
off the spirit off discretion / given him vvithowt measure / and by his divine
knowledge / how faithfully they would employe themselves in that mynistrye:
might well open the door unto those / against whom the church owghte to
keep yt shut.

If any man vvoulde here except against this answer / with the example of
Judas / which did so traitorously behave him self in his office: yt is not
worth the answer. For who knows not / that that was done / that the
Scripture might be fulfilled: and that for that cawse our Savior Christ /
forseinge the treason Ioh. 13. Act. 1.
to come / did notwithstanding give him a place in that mynisterie? So that if
they vvoulde conclude any thing off that example: they must conclude / that
the church may choose one / which yt thincketh will deceive the trust / that
is laid upon him. I could here dispute / whether althowghe he repented
trewlie / yet forsomuche as he is subject to another such fall / as well as
any other: yt were boothe less danger for him / and les hurt for the
church / to receive such an overthrow under an other captain never foiled
/ then under him / under who^ yt has already been put to flighte. But
forsomuche as yt is not so clear / and requires a longer discourse: I am
content to let that pass.

Yet that may not be omitted / that as in the refusal off a minister / which
has defiled him self with Idolatry / provision is made for the safety /
and security of the church: so an eye is had to a more plentiful fruicte /
which may redounde unto it / by him that is placed in the ministry. And
forasmuch as no small portion off that / should be by great likelihoode
turned a way / by restoring such one / as has fallen so grievously:
amongst other reasons that also has force / to hinder his restirucion. For
when S. Paul requires authority in a deacon / purchased by continual 1.
Tim. 3.
tenor / and as yt weere by an even thread / of a holy / and innocente liffe /
that he might withdraw greater liberty / and boldness execute his office: he
sufficiently declarethe / that such a fall / especially in the bishop / and
mynister / taken in the race off his ministry / makes a deep wound into
that authority / and freedom off rebukinge others / which is necessary for
him / for furtherance off hy mynistry / to retain. And as yt takes away from
his freedom in reprehending: so that which he reprehendethe / has so much
less aucthoritye with the hearer: as yt is not only not confyrmed / but
contraried by his example. And if Tymothe / being endewed with such rare
gifts off knowledge / and holiness 1. Tim. 4. 12.
off lyffe / had much a do to maintain his authority in the church /
against the contempt of his yowthe / which was no fault: he had need have
very extraordinary gifts / which can deliver his mynisterie from contempt /
ten fold more occasioned by such a fall / then by want / of a few years.
Saying therefore the wound being healed by repentance / the skarr does yet
remain in the eyes of the church / to the blemishinge of his Mynistrie: yt is
good he be taken down / and set in some les lightesome place / off the church
off God.

There was yet a third reason / which no doubt moved the churches to keep
this order: that this bar off him from the mynistrie / which had so fallen
/ might serve for example unto other mynisters / to take heed. For they
considered well / that as common wealths / so the churches of God / are
preserved by reward / and punishment: and that as in the reward off some /
other are provoked to make after those things / which are by that reward
crowned: so by the punishment off some / other are terrified from doing that
/ for which they see them dishonored. Therefore they thowghte yt unmeet / that
he which had faulted in the qualytie off a mynister / should no other wise be
disciplined / then a pryuate person: but rather as his fault exceded / so his
correction should increase. Which thing being so much commended / in
common wealths well governed: I see no cause / why yt should not be as
conueniente in the church off God: so far / and in such kind off
corrections / as are in the churches power. And therefore yt appears / that
the commandment which is given in Ezethiell / and in the book off the
kings / for the separatinge off the Leuytes from their Ministry / which had
fallen to Idolatrye: was not a law for a time / but drawn from the spring
off that equytie / which can not be changed.

And so far is yt / that the gospel has made this law void: that yt has
also confyrmed yt. for if the ministry off the law / were so gloriouse /
that yt vvoulde not be handled off those / which had once fallen from yt by
Idolatry / althowghe they did repent: how much more / owghte the mynystrie
off the gospel 2. Cor. 3.
(which so surmounteth the mynisterie off the law / as the gospel does the
law) be vntowched off such / as forsaking yt / have defiled them selves with
that sin? And if for a less fault / they were kept from a lower place in
the church: for a greater fault / should not they much more be kept from a
higher dignity? for whereas now the second time he faith / that under the
law, there were certain corporal pollutions, which made a man unclean for a
time: yt proceadethe of too great ignorance off the Scripture / either in not
knowing / in what short time those polutions might be purged: or else
assigning any cawse off the Leuytes putting forth off their ministry for
ever / for the polutions which were in so few days cleansed.

Yowr allegatio^n owte off master Calvin towching the widows / is nothing for
you / nothing to the cause. For what if he say / that the Apostell requires
that they should be benyficiall: doothe yt therefore follow / that respect
should not be had into their whole life. Yt may be easily vnstersta^ded /
that the apostel having drawn the office off a wydowe / throwghe diverse sorts
of good works / becawse yt had been to long / to recyte all: shuts up
with that clause / as if he should say / that I stand not in rehersall off
all / I will have her such / as has exercised her self in every good work.

But I desire the reader to observe the vnfaithfullnes / and open corruption
that he uses / in cyting off master Calu. For his judgment being not called
for / but answer required to the words of S. Paul / he has taken that which
serves not to the purpose / and has left owte that in the exposition of the
same verse / which is directly against that he alleges master Calvin for.
Whose words are these / There is no dovvbte, b^t there were worshipful, and
very reverent colleges, or companies off widow: upon 1* Tim. 5.
therefore Paul will have none chosen thither, but such as be commended by a
notable testimony, off their whole former life.

And whereas he asks / how could that be, when they had but one part off
their life known Christ: not to speak off the Iewishe widows / which might
have led their whole life in good / and holy worckes in deed: he must learn
/ that S. Paul does not there speak only off good works / which are the
fruictes of faith: but callethe those good works / which are cyuilly / and
in owtewarde show / and estimacion off men good. So that he requires / that
those only be chosen amongst the weomen / which were never detected off any
notable crime: but have allwaies lived in an honest / cyuill behavior
amongst their neighbors. And thus S. Luke calls those vveomen religious,
and honest, 13. Act. 50
which were moved to persequte S. Paul. There was nether true Religion / nor
honesty in them / but so he calls them / because they were so esteemed. S.
Paul also says off him selffe / when he was the enemy off Christ / that he
was before his conversion / as Phil. 3. 6.
tovvching the justice of the law, unblameable: Which must needs be
understood / off a cyuill / and owtward kind off justice / and not off any
good works / which were true fruictes off the spirit off God. Hereoff he
requires / that he that is to be chosen 1. Tim. 3. 7.
bishope / should have the Testymonie off strangers from the church: that is
to say / which lived with out breach off that cyuill honesty / which the
very heathen have in recommendation. Which Testimonye he could never have if he
were known / to be either a drunckard / or an adulterer / etc. the knowledge
off which crimes / God has written / so deeply in the heart off man / that no
ignorance off God / or sauagenes off liffe / could ever raze yt owte. So you
see S. Paul / might require a Testimony of good behauior off the whole liffe
of those / which had led put a part of yt in Christianity.

Who goes abowte to excuse S. Peter's denial? doothe he that says yt is a
great and a heinous crime, excuse it: I said / I thowghte Diuis. 3. page 146.
I should trouble you, if I put you to prove his fault to be as great as
his that slydeth from the gospel, to Idolatry, and therein abide the some
years: And I perceive I have troubled you / for you can not answer unto that
poor reason / which I in passing interlaced. To help to maintain your
vntrwth / you have here set S. Peter's fault of the last / saying / he did yt
wittingly, and willingly. For yt being done off infyrmitie / and to save his
life / althowghe yt is was not done withowte his will: yet I report me to the
use off our speech / whether this wittinge, and willing doing be not spoken of
those only / which do yt withowte any manner off compulsion / or drifte off
fear.

But therein you do him open injury / when you say / that his fault was as
greauous as any bind of idolatry. For I beseech you is not the denial off
the gospel / as great a fault / as the denial of Christ? so far therefore
the faults are equal. In denyinge twice / he is matched with a great number
off Idolaters / which at one clapp have renounced him with mouth / and
subscribed against him with their hand, and where he forsware him once / they
have forsworn him often / according to the number off dioceses / where they have
had their lyuinges / and diuersytie off times wherein such things have been
required. That warning S. Peter had a little before / by the mouth off our
Savior Christ, they had by the voice off the minister / which has the
authority off Christ. That he did almost in the presence off his master, yt
seems by that which has followed in some / they would have done / if he had
stood / and looked on.

But let that increase his fault / yet this circumstance makethe yt not so
great / that where Peter denied Christ cast down / or in time off his
humility: they have denied him risen from the dead / ascended up into heaven
/ fytting on the right hand^ off God the father in glory. I leave to be
considered / whether hitherto the fault off Saint Peter / be not only
matched / but also ouerweighed. Now for a surcrease / and ouerrunninge measure
/ S. Peter did yt to save his skin / they to save their honor: He for his liffe
/ they for their lyuinge. I speak favorably / for otherwise I might say of
some / that they did it not only to save that which they had / but to get
more unto yt. S. Peter did it pe^^^^^ly / and in a corner: they in set / and
open judgment. He only denied that he knew him / or that he was one off his
disciples / but spoke no evil off him / nor of his doctrine: they affirmed
that they knew the gospel to be nawghte / and so spoke evil both of Christ
and yt. He did yt suddenly / and at a pushe: they deliberatly / and with time
given to consulte: he althowghe he forsook his master Christ / yet he never
served the scribes / and Phariseis / which were the enemies off Christ: they
did not only forsake Christ / but served in the courts off his sworn enemy
Antechriste.

Now if their faults were in the very kind / so many ways greater then his:
it must needs follow / that the longer they spunne the thread off their
sin / then he did off his: so much more growethe unto theirs / then unto
his: and therefore what difference between hours / and years: so much between
theirs / and his. I leave to speak how S. Peter / was wakened at the voice of a
^ocke / which they were not at many voices off the son of god: he was
checked at a look off our Savior Christ: they not at his frown / and
chidinge voice.

I have spoken this / neither to excuse Saint Peter / whom I know to have
sinned heinouslie / nor to throw down the seat off mercy agayinste those /
which have thus sinned / which stands sure upon the brazen pillars off the
promises off God / to all which do repent: but to this end / that I might
show / how untrue it is / that is here so avouched off the Ans. that S.
Peter's fault was more grievous, then any kind off idolatry. and that such as
have so sinned / understanding their sin to be of a longer last / the^ S.
Peter's / might not deceive them selves in the measure.

Yt makethe nothing to the purpose that is here alleged / of the
vnchaungablenes of the mercy of god: or that owte off S. Paul to Timothy. As
if the question were / whether they which had fallen from the ministerye of
the gospel to Idolatry / should be received to mercy: or that the mercy
off God were denied unto him / to whom the ministry is denied: or as if mercy
/ and correction could not stand to gether: or as if the Levites received not
mercy / both of God / and off the church / which received not their
ministry: or as thowghe Ciprian / and other fathers / which shut the door
of the ministry against such / were not enemies unto those that denied
repentance unto the fallen / when Ciprian callethe Nonatus (author off that
error) the murderer off repentance. I marvel therefore what he means /
thus to goo abowte to abuse his reader / in seeminge to say something / when
he says nothing.

In the end he says / that these examples off our Savior Christ, are not
to be followed in all poinctes. In what poinctes to be followed? and in what to
be avoided? this was necessary to have been showed. And have you forgotten /
what you asked off me: how I knew certain things to be followed, and other
not? and how either all must page 133.
be followed, or none? and what revelation I had received to know what things
in the election off Matthias perteined to ours, and what not? how pernicious a
voice it is / / both to the church / and common wealth / that no man what
crime soever he has committed, is to be secluded from any lawful vocation
yff he repent: how licentious / how nere approaching to Anabaptisme / if I had
said nothing at all / yet has it plentiful confutation / both off reason /
and off all good policed churches / or common wealths that ever were. I have
showed general commandments to the contrary: therefore unless you can show
them repealed / by a contrary act: they are still in force. For the examples
off S. Peter and S. Paul / here tediously repeated: I have answerrd before at
lardge.

Towching the wyping a way off Ambrose example, I did it first in place:
which yowr gloss denies. For proving that no new convert / Diu. 4. p. 14^.
should be chosen to the ministry / allthowgh our Savior Christ did choose
S. Paul / Ambrose example stood in the way: and therefore I gave him in deed
the wipe / but it was with the sword off God. His choice was also / against
the allowed practice off the church / if you know whose voice this is: yester
day cathechised, to day a bishop. Where he merueilethe / that (...). ad Oc^^n.
so plain a precepte off S. Paul is not kept / and callethe them sudden,
and momentany minsters, which are so made. And albeit that some differred
their baptism, long after their conversion, and in deed to the time off
death: yet you do not show / that Ambrose was in that ^^^ber. If he were /
you fasten thereby greater ignorance upon him / then I have done: who (you
say) speak contemptuously off him. Besides it is one thing not to be
baptized, and another thing to be catechumenus. For those which were not
baptized / being sufficiently instructed / were admitted to the supper off the
lord: but in that yt is said / Ambrose was Cathecumenus, Socrat. 4. lib. 30.
is declared / that he was not yet sufficiently instructed / in the principles
of religion. Whatsoever yt is / I say yt could not be withowte great disorder
/ that a man should be chosen governor off the city / which had never
tasted off the water theroff. I know Ambrose was a notable man / and learned
in human knowledge: yet I might withowte either great disgrace / or any
contempt / say that which I said. And if this were the place for it: I
could easily show upon how good grownde I said / that it had been safer
for the church, he had been better instructed in the scriptures, before he
occupied the place off Doctor. Whereunto I could use his own testimony /
which says / 1. lib. offi.
that he was constrained to teach / that which he himselffe had not learned.

Albeit he is constrained / to agree to that which is affirmed: Diui. 5. p:
147. Cyp. 1. li. Epist. 7.
yet for the great desire he has / to strike at me / he would wreste this
epistle owte of my hands / then the which there can be nothing more plain.
For Cyprian / reasonethe against Fortunatius challenge off his bishoppricke /
after that he had fallen to Idolatry: by the general rule / that none owghte
to be admitted unto the ministry / which had so fallen. And therefore almost
in the beginning off the Epistle / he charge him that he dare challenge unto
him the ministry, which he has betrayed: as thovvgh yt were lavvfull
after having been at the alter off the devil, to come unto the alter of god.
And after he had showed the horrible punishementes / that the lord God willed
they should be punished with / that faulted that ways: he adds / Seeing
therefore the lord threateneth such torments, and punishementes in the day
off his wrath, to such as obey the devil, and sacrifice to idols: how can
he think, that he may do the office off the minister off God, which has
obeyed, and served the pry stes off the devil? or how does he think, that
his hand can be translated to the sacrifice, and prayer off the lord: which
was captive to sacrilege, and to such a crime? Off these words and diverse
other in that epistle / yt is euide^te / that he does not therefore seclude
Fortunat. only / becawse he did not repent: but becawse yt was not lawful /
for those that had sacrificed / etc. to be restored unto their mynisterie. And
therefore he purge the him self / and his fellows in an other place / off that
he was supposed to 4. l. 2. ep.
have received Trophimus to the ministry / and otherwise then a lay man:
although yt be there declared / that Trophimus did submit him self in all
humility / unto the church.

Wherefore has he browghte in here / that there was certain time off
repentance appointed in Cyprians time, etc. doothe any body deny yt? or
makes yt any thing to his purpose? That which he he should have proved / he
to wchethe not. For against that he said / Off the examples off the primative
church, in restoringe off those unto their mynisterie, which had fallen unto
Idolatry: I have showed the use off the most ancientest times / and he
brings nothing at all / but only affirms those things / which no man
deniethe / and make nothing to the purpose.

The council off Carthage (which ordained that none might be received again
to the ministry / which had defiled him self with Idolatry) is here
rejected: the reason whereoff is also added / for that the same Concell
decreed, rebaptizing off those which were baptized by Heretics: The Ans. may
throw away the authority off a council / because of an error in yt /
withowte either scripture / Doctor / or council: when I do yt / not withowte
either all these authorities / or at the least / off the scripture: yt is cried
owte against / as an unlearned shifte, and I can not tell what. But I am
contented you shall throw a way the council off Carthage / which established
that error: yet you shall not throw away that / wherein it was agreed /
against restoring off ministers / fallen into Idolatry. How so? Because they
were decreed in several councels. For proof theroff / I allege the words off
Cyprian. And when there be other boothe many / and grievous faults / where
with 1. li. E. 4.
Basilides / and Marshal are inwrapped: such do in vain goo abowte / to
occupy the place off a bishop. Seeing yt is manifest / that such men may
not govern the church off Christ / nor offer up sacrifices unto God.
Especially when off late / boothe with us / and with all the bishops in the
world / even Cornelius also / our fellow in ministry peacable / and just /
and whom the lord vouchesafed the honor off a Martyr / decreed / that such
men might be admitted to repentance / but should notwithstanding be kept
from the honor of the clergy / or ministry. Of this place I conclude / that
forsomuche as the Council of Carthage / was provincial / as that which was
gathered off the bishops off Afric / Mauritania / and Numidia / and this
general / as that which was assembled of all the bishops of the world: that
the council wherein this was determined / is not the same which determined
rebaptization. Again at this council Cornelius was / and gave his consent:
at the other he was not / neither would ever give his co^sente. And so also is
answered / that which you cite owte of the second book off Cyprian / and
first epistle / that for so much as / the council that there is spoken off /
was in Stephanus time / the bishop off Rome: it can be by no means
understood off this council / that decreed against the restitution of the
ministers which had fallen / which was holden before his time. Therefore the
council there spoken of / was but a conference of bishops / or minsters which
were nere unto that place / where Cyprian remained. For if it had been any
solemn council / Cypr. would not first have holden that / and then after
they had decreed off matters in consultation (as yt appears in that epistle
they had) conferred with him by letters. And if he should: yet yt does
manifestly appear / by that which I have alleged / that this was decreed
long before. I will therefore wait / what advise you will take / to answer to
this Council: which was both catholic / and general / and more aunciente
then that off Nice: puttinge you also in remembrance / what a great extoller
off councels you be / when they make any thing for you.

None of the places which they alleged / declare anysuche meaning: and the
place quoted owte off Eze. manifestly declares / that they me^te of those
which had fallen from the trewthe. Besides Diu. 6. p. 148.
that al men may see / that you browght these examples of M. Luth. etc. to
prove that ministers which had fallen into Idolatry / might be restored unto
the ministry. And where they speak off king Henry's preistes / king
Edwardes / etc. Yt is apparente / that they mente not to seclude them / for
that they were king Henry's preistes: but because they were king Henry's /
and Queen Mary's preistes both / seeing they also shut forth / king
Edwardes preistes / which by no means they can be suspected to have done /
unless they had mente off those / which being ministers then / were preistes
also in Queen Mary's times. If They had said thus simply / all indifferent
judgment must needs so have expounded them: but when they expound them
selves so plainly / in these words / men for all seasons: I might well say /
as I have said / what has so blyn^ded your eyes, etc.

For his judgment off certain preachers now, massmongers in Queen Mary's
times, comparable with any in the land: I leave to speak of it. For saying he
has a several divinity from others / he must be suffered also to frame his
judgment thereafter. The sclanderous vntrwthes / that are here uttered / I
will not defile my pen with. Off the places off Deuter. and Ezechiel I have
spoken. How the judicial law / is in the power off the magistrate / is
declared / and here was no place to speak off it. Forasmuch as the question
is here / off the discipline off the church / and not off civil punishments:
and whether the church owghte to admit a minister / that has fallen unto
Idolatry. The next section / I leave to the judgment off the reader. The
next unto that / is answered before in the first tract. and 6. chap.

Philosopher, and drunken poet, etc. There is not so much as one Philosopher
/ profane / or divine / one Poet / sober / or drunken / to improve that the
gentiles, did never take oxen, serpents, fire, water, etc, to be god: or, that
they took the Images before which they fell, for vvood, stone, etc. Yff I
should allege all the places owte off them / which might be browghte to the
confirmacion off that / which I set down: yt were much more easier to find
a beginning / then an end. Howbeit / because off the shameful / and
foreheadles deali^ge off the D. off an infinite number / I will allege one /
or two: Whereby it may appear / what opinion was off these things / amongeste
the gentiles.

And to begin with Philosophers / it can not be unknown to those which
are learned / that amongeste others / Plato / and his sect / approached
neereste / to the true knowledge off god. Epist. ad Herm. In Epin. (...). Viues

And albeit he co^fessethe in diverse places one God / by whom the world was
ruled / yea and makethe mention / off the father / and off the son / which
he calls the most divine word / and has many other things / consonante
unto that which Moses vvritethe / in such sort / that he was called off some

this Philosopher did well know / that there was but one God which made
heaven / and earth: yet he taught / that diverse spirits / and men also which
had been famous upon earth / should be worshipped.

For the Poets / the saying of Virgill / all are full off Jupiter: may
declare / that the honor / and service which the Gentills did to the Images /
bestes / and other creaturs which they worshipped / was for an opinion that
they had / off the presence off Jupiter in those things / and not for the
things them selves. and there wanted not diverse amongeste them / which said
/ there was but one God / which they called Jupiter / and that Appollo /

they worshipped Jupiter. And althowghe the Egyptians / were comparable in

them, and made a law for the vvorshippinge off beasts, despised amongeste
us: not that he was ignorante off their power / but because he vvoulde
accustom the people / to the obedience off those things which were
commanded by their princes: and vvithall / meaning thereby to take a proof /
how they were affected toward the invisible thing / by things visible.
Here you hear the Philosophers / the Poctes / the Orators (which were the
Prophets off the gentiles): yet none ascribethe unto the^ such a dotage / as
to think a piece off vvood / etc. to be God.

And if this knowledge were in the grosseste Idolaters: how can such
ignorance have been in the Israelites / as he imaginethe? But I had forgotten
the boy off the grammar scoole, whom he appointethe for my scoolemaister in
this matter: whereas if ever he took heed unto the first verse off Cato / he
must needs give Si Deus est animus, etc.
witness of our side / that the gentiles took God for a spirit / and not for
a piece off wood / etc.

And this that is here spoken / off sondrie off the Idolatrous Gentiles / S.
Paul pronouncethe off them all / where he goinge abowte to prove / that all

says / that they knevve God by his creatures, but did not glorify him as

one God only. And that they imagined their Godds to be in heaven / besides
that yt is easy to gather off their gestures / in holdinge up their hands /
and castinge up their eyes unto heaven / as often as they felt the^ selfs in
any danger: may likewise appear / where the Idolaters of Listra / and Derbe
conceiving off Barnabas / and Paul as off Gods: to maintain that error off
theirs / are driven to say / that they were cum down from heaven: declaringe
thereby / Act. 14.
that the received opinion off them was: that the ordinary Gods / were in
heaven. For yt is not to be dowted / but they had the images of Jupiter / and
Mercury which they worshipped in that place: and yet they did not take them
for their Gods / but Imagined that the Gods whereof those were the Images /
were in heaven.

Now this that every dronken poet, and boy, etc. can tell to be otherwise,
let us see whether grave / learned / sober / and ancie^te divines / do not
plainly confirm. Augustine (which is here alleged / to prove that the
gentiles did take the very images them selves to be Upon the 215. Psalm. ^ part.
their gods) shewethe that the very vulgar / and grossest sort of Idolaters
/ could answer when they were rebuked of their Idolatry / and heathenishe
worship: that they worshipped not the visible image, but that which dwelled
inuisibly in it. and that they off the finer sort answered / that they neither
worshipped the image, nor any spirit in the image, but by that bodelie image
did behold the sign off that thing, which they ovvght to worship. M.
Calvin (answeringe unto the Papists objection / 1. l. Ins. 11. c. s. 9.
that their images are not taken for gods) says thus. Nether were the
Jews (says he) so unwise, that they did not remember that it was God, by
whose hand they were brovvght ovvte off Aegypte, before theye made the
calfe: yea unto Aaron sainge, that those were their gods which brovvghte
them ovvte of Aegypte, they did vvithovvte staggeringe consent, gyuinge thereby
to understand assuredly, that they vvoulde keep still the same God for their
deliverer, so that they might see him goo before them in the calfe. Nether is
it to be thovvghte that the Gentiles were so blockishe, that they did not
understand that God was some other thing, then vvood, or stone. For they
changed their images oftentimes, and yet kept the same gods still in there
mind: and their were many Images set up to one God, neither did they
therefore according to that multitude, imagine many Gods. Besides that daily
they consecrated nevve Images. and yet they thovvghte not therefore that they
made nevve Gods. And toward the end off that sectio^ he vvritethe thus:
Notwithstanding boothe the Jews were Persuaded, that under such Images
they worshipped the eternal god, the one, true lord off heaven and earth:
and the Gentiles also that by them they worshipped their gods althovvghe
false, yet which they imagined to have their abode in heaven. And in the
beginning off the tenth section: Those which deny, that this was done in
times paste, and is done in our age, lie impudentlie. And toward the latter
end off that section / unto the Papists obiecting that they do not call the
images their godds / he answerethe: Neither did either the Jews, or Gentiles
so in times paste, and yet the Prophets in every place did not cease to cast
in their teathe fornication with vvood, and stone: only for the things,
which are daily done of those, which vvil be counted Christians, that is to
say, for that they worshipped God carnally in vvood, and stone. Now take
away that which you have partly in your gloss / and partly in your text /
most untruely surmised: and show me one word in all this section / which
you have made such horrible owtecries off / that Master Calvin doothe not
speak more fully / then I.

For where in your gloss / upon my words / And who knovveth not that they
thovvghte that by them, and in them, they worshipped the God which made
heaven, and earth, you note in the mergente a gross error, making me to
affirm that all the Gentills believed, that God made heaven, and earth: you
change not your skin / still you seek advantage by falshoode. For tell me are
these all one / they thovvghte they worshipped God, which made heaven, and
earth, and they / they thowghte that God made heaven and earth? When it is
said / that the Papists think they swallowe Christ / which only sittethe
at the right hand off God: Fallac: compos:
does one affirm / that the Papists think / that Christ sittethe only at
the right hand off God? For when there are two propositions there: Wheroff
the one is / that the Gentills thowght they worshipped God / the other / that
that God made heaven / and earth: the Answ. would make them as one. But what
a veration off spirit is it / to have to do with one / which either knows
not what the valewe off a proposition is: or else knovvinge / doothe so
shamfully wrest yt?

Yet the other which he ascribethe unto me in his text / is yet farther from
honest dealinge. For he askethe me / whether jupiter, Apollo etc. were gods
which created heaven, and earth: as if I had given any occasion of that
question. He addethe / and asks / whether they were thowght to have made
heaven, and earth? To whom I have answered before / that the words importe
no such thing: neither had I either in that proposition / or in any before /
made mention off Jupiter / or Appollo / etc. And if I should answer / that
Jupiter was thowghte off some / abused by fables of the Poets / to have made
heaven / and earth: What would follow thereof? I say therefore again / that
take away your untrue additions: and there is nothing set down off me /
which Master Calvin does not precisely affirm. And that which I have set
down owte off Expos. 1. command. tit. Against. the vvorshipp off dead
saints.
Master Calvin / I could recite as fully / and as plainly owte off Master
Musculus / which I omite.

For your places which you have heaped together here / I know them well / and
had the^ before me when I wrote. You give me them in gross / withowte
applyinge: you either could frame no argument of them / or feared the answer.
I can not examine all those chapit. which you give me / oneles I would write a
whole book off that matter only. You take up the Adm. becawse they apply
not their scripturs / and frame not their arguments: yet they let not you
wander in the whole chapter / but gave one verse to speak unto. I must also
admonish you to bear more reverence unto the scripture, then to confound yt
with Baruche, and especially with the story off Bell, and the Dracon: if you
will not be admonished / I will desire the reader to take heed off such
confusion: there being as much difference between the one and the other / as
between heaven and earth / God and man.

Why? is this the proof you promise in your gloss / whereby you said / yt
should appear to be untrue that I alleged? Those great words made me
hope after some strong reasons / yff we will follow him here / he will lead
us the ready way to the popish transubstantiation. For he stickethe in the
very word / and will admit no sacramental speech / and therefore where the
arc is called (...).
the lord off hosts, the king off glory: in his divinity / yt must needs
be taken so in deed / that the arc made off wood is Psalm. 24.
very God. For in the words off the text it is expressly signified. And even
as that is / so is this a sacramental speech: whereby they having the goulden
calfe for a token / and sign of the presence of god / Exodus 32.
called yt by the name off God. now having no reason but off the papists only
/ to vvarante this opinion: off his accustomed lyberalitie / in giving that
which he can not hold / he admits for soothe that yt is metonimically
spoken yet after that by force off the trewthe / yt is vvrithen from him: he
reachethe owte his hand after yt / saying / that yt is but a conjecture. yt is
a certain trewthe M. W. and no conjecture: standinge not upon the judgment
off men / which I could allege of diverse learned / that have written of that
place: but upon vnfailible reasons / wheroff that is one which I have alleged
/ off the usual phrase off the scripture / in speaking of signs. And if it
had been lawful for them / to have likened the majesty off God unto a calfe
/ or to have had such a token off the presence off God: it had not been
unlawful / to have called yt Sacramentally / by the name off God.

Moreover forasmuch as the knowledge off God / is a habyte which god gyuethe
by little and little / throwghe teachinge / yt is impossible / that the
Israelites so well instructed / and having given also good experience before /
that they knew the true God: should so suddenly / at one instante / so many /
leese all that knowledge off God / and take a calfe to be that / which
browghte them owte off the land of Aegypte: but as yt came by litell and little
/ so it must of necessity have a time / whereby it might by little / and little
be lost. And hitherto is referred that which Master Calvin alleges / off
the consent off the people to that / which Aaron said off kepinge holy day
unto the lord: whereby they declared that they held that for good / which
Aaron said.

Further if the Israelites had taken the calfe for their God: Moses in gyuing
them yt to drink after he had bete^ it to powder / should have driven them to
a great sin / and have killed their consciences / in compellinge them to
drink that / which they were persuaded to be a piece of the true God / which
browghte them owte of Aegypte. Which thing when no man of any knowledge can
say: yt is certain that Moses did think / that the Israelites did know that
the calfe was not the true God. Beside that albeit Aaron faulted grievously /
yet it is great injury done unto him / to thinck that ever he would have
either cawsed / or consented / a calfe to be made: if he thowghte that the
Israelites would have taken that / for the true God. yea after they had
uttered that voice / These are they Gods, etc: Yt is said that Aaron saying
that / made an altar before the calfe: Which he would never have done / if
he had understood the Israelites as the D. doothe.

I had not the text before me / when I wrote / but I took the sense which I
was well assured off. Saying they both consented to Aaron saying / ye shall
keep holy day to the Lord, Exodus 32. 6.
and did so. Therefore allthowghe it be subject to the reprehension off a
cauiller: yet I altered nothing off the meaning off the place / in that I set
down / that the Israelites said, they would keep holy day to the Lord.

I put you over to the learned writers, and now I have toulde you off two /
which do in plain words / whet their styles directly against yowr
distinction. You mislike off the distinction, but you are driven to use yt: you
excuse not the papists, but you lessen their crime / and therefore you may well
be called their Patron. For yt is a precepte amongst the Rethoricians / that
if the clients fault be apparante: the advocate should confess it / and then
employe the strenghte off his wit / to cawse it seem as little as may be. And
where in the distinction of degrees off Idolatry / you say / that the Jews
did oftentimes offend in the last, and the worste, and the Papists not you
in deed say it / and say it again / but you bring nothing to prove yt
once. I could reply / that the Papists used more detestable Idolatry / then
ever did the Jews. For show me by any good authority / or reason / that the
Jews did ever think / or teach / that a dead Image off wood / and stone
should be worshipped with the honor off the holy trinity: and this
notwithstanding ^. Coun. Nic.
is tawghte off the Papists. Or show me where ever the Jews did worship /
so vile a thing / as a piece off bread: which received into the stomach /
is after cast into the privy. And as yt can not be denied / but they take
that bread for the very God / which made heaven / and earth: So I am
persuaded that yt can never be showed / that the Jews were ever so gross to
believe / that any simple creature seen with their eyes / was the living God.

The Ans. bindethe well in the end / with his therefore if they repent, etc.
Wherefore? because their Idolatry is not so great as that off the Jews? as if
their mercy / which they receive upon repentance / depended upon the
smalnes / or greatness off their Idolatry: or as if the Jews / which repented
off their Idolatry / received not mercy likewise. Verily I can see no band /
to tiethis therefore. with that which went before. yt is a weffe / not worth
the taking up. For what needed this now thrice at the least / that they are
not to be rejected owte off the church? as if any denied that. but where you
add / nor owte off the ministry: if you mean off such / as have fallen from
the gospel / and mynisterie especially / to Idolatry: I can not bear you /
it is to heavy a co^clusio^ for so weak premises: for Master D. is to much
abused / if he think that the same kaie / opens the door off the
Ministry / and the church door.

Where he snatcheth at the example of Aaron / who after that he fell / was
received into the preisthood again / which he did before in the example off S.
Paul that I browghte forth: he declares what a hongrie cause he has /
which is gladd to pull the meat out off the fire / that yt fedethe on. But
alas this helpethe not: for it is a singular example / and may not be drawn
into imitation. At which answer my think I see the D. buskell / and prepare
him self to crow / saying / that so all may be wiped whatsoever is browghte.
I will not do therefore as you / to whom yt is enowghe to say vvithowte
proof: but will show the reason / which onles you rest in / you shall have
the controversy withdraw yowr self. yowr self affirm that the law in Ezech.
and in the book of the kings, towchinge the not admittinge of the Levites to
the ministry, is a judicial law of Moses, and given to the Israelites
only: which if yt be true / yt being general / must needs comprehend the
fault off Aaron. And therefore yt follows / that the admittance off Aaron to
his ministry again / being directly contrary to the law / was by an
especial dispensation.

Moreover / Aaron being appointed to the ministry immediately / and by the
express mouth off God: I see not what man could put him owte off yt withowte
the same authority which put him in. Last off all / it is very probable /
that where yt is Deuteronomy. 9. 20.
said in an other place / that Moses stood up / and prayed for Aaron: then
Moses received answer / what should be done with Aaron / towchinge his
continuance in the ministry. Where yowr gloss in the end supposes
contrariety, saying yt settethe down none. I have not to answer. yt may be
the A. lawghed when he vvrote that / vvherby he requires sincere dealing in
the scriptures. For if this be sitting in his mouth / which corrupts in a
manner all he touches: why should not also a light housewiffe / talk of the
chastity off a grave matrone. The next diuis. belonging unto the 6. Tract.
off unpreaching ministers / shall there God vvilling be answered.

Off election off Ministers / un voices / or other consent off the people
Chap. 4. page 155.
IF Chrysostom had had any thing to say towching the election off Deacons:
he should have spoken when time was / and when that place was handled. Yet
for answer / the reader may understand / that Chrysostom. in that place makethe
comparison / between the election in the first off the Acts / and this: and
shows how the Apostels did otherwise there / then here. For there they chose
two / which they set up before the church. So that when Chrysostom. says /
the Apostels might have chosen the deacons: yt may be he means they might
have chosen them / as they did the two / Mathias / and Barsabas: In which
choice I have showed / the consent off the people was required. Yff upon Act, 1
there were but this place / which the D. cites / I would stand upon this
answer: but considering that Chrysostom. in another place / affirms that Peter
might have chosen him self (which I would not keep from the knowledge off the
reader) I will not deny but that Chrysostom. might have here the meaning the D.
supposes. Whereto as I can by no means agree / upon the reasons both before /
and after alleged so the D. is not helped. For when Chryso. commends Peter
that he did all things by the advice off the church, nothing off his own
authority, nothing with dominion: When he adds also that the same was to
avoid contention, up. Act. 1. up. Act. 6
and that nether he nor the rest off the Apostles should be thovvght to choose
off favor: he declares sufficiently that there is no bishop of that either
authority / or holiness off life / which in making the election without
consent of the church / does not both lay him self / and his ministry
open to suspicio^ of parcialitle: and give occasion off pernicious debates in
the church.

He should also understand / that this proportion is uneven / and that if yt
were granted which he desyrethe: yet he is not where he would be. For if it
were lawful / for the Apostels endued with extraordinary gifts off
discretion off spirits / to choose: yt follows not therefore that one Bishopp
may do so. And because yt was lawful for the 12. Apostels / to choose them
with whom they were daily conuersante: therefore it is lawful for one
bishop to choose those / which he never see / nor knew before?

Before I goo any further / yt is to be observed / that althowghe 2. Diu. p.
156.
the Ans. hold owte in the defense off this cawse / off election by the
Bishope / certain words of learned me^ / racked from their meaning / and
contrary to the continual practice off the authors: yet the trwthe is / that
as this assertion is the Papists / and Papists against the Protestants: so
all his principal both arguments / and solutions have been word for word /
ministered unto him owte off the books / off the ranckeste enemies off the
trwthe. Phigius li. 2. Hier. c. 2. 9. Phigius 5 li. Hierar. Phigius countro.
16. Hosius de legit. iud. rerum Eccles. Phigius l. 5. Hierar. Ecclesias. cap.
9. Diu. 2. p. 156.
Yff the reader will see this question diducted at large / between the
catholics / and the papists: let him read Hosius / and Phigius / in these
books which I have noted. I will only note the places whence the Ans.
arguments are fetched / with his startinge holes vvherwithe he vvoulde abuse
the world. And first off all Marsilius a Catholic / whom the lord had
stirred up to maintain the trwthe off the Gospel / About the time off Pope
John the 12. disputinge against the sole election off the bishope: uses this
reason which we have here in hand / namely / that forasmuch as the
church chose here Deacons / as it appearethe in the Acts: therefore yt owghte
much more choose her mynisters. This reason Phigius (as the D) derideth: no
more hable to answer yt then he.

The manifest words off the text are / that Paul / and Barnabas ordained
elders by voces / neither is there any learned, and godly man browghte / or as
Iam persuaded can be browghte / that ever denied that the churches were in
election off their ministers / joined with Paul / and Barn. That Zuingl. says
/ some were called to the ministry off the word, by the Apostels only: what
is yt to prove / that Paul / and Barnabas did here in this place ordeine
myinisters / withowte the voices off the church? yt is well therefore M Zuing.
has expressed / which the D. has unfaithfully holden back: who
translatinge whole pages to no purpose / could not here aforde us one poor
sentence / off the length off two lines. The other half off the sentence is
this: As (says he) when Act. 8. 14.
by the decree off the Apostels, Peter and John were sent unto Samaria.

Marcke I beseech you / what manner of election this was. The Apostels chose
two / but such as were approved mynisters before: what is this to prove / that
the byshope may choose those / which were never approved / or chosen unto the
ministry? The Apostels chose them to go an embassage / which should be
ended in a few days: and what is that to prove / that a bishop may choose
to a perpetual function? The Apostels did yt withowte the consent off that
church / unto which that matter did not belong: what is that to prove / that
the bishope may choose a minister / withowte the consent off that church /
which that election does concern? for that election belonged not / unto the
church of Jerusalem where they were: if yt had there is no doubt but the
Apostels would not have done yt / withowte the co^sente thereof.

I leave here to speak of the difference of bishop / and Apostel / off twelve /
and one: which being observed in the former section / needs no rehersall.
And as this makes nothing for the election off the bishope: so yt makes
against that / for the which this place is browghte. For if master Zuing.
had been off that judgment / that Paul / and Barnabas did by them selves
choose / withowte the church: he would likely have browghte that example /
co^sideringe that this can not be properly called any election to the Mynistrie
/ which was off those which were ministers before.

But that you may yet better know the D. unfaithful dealinge / joined with
shameless bouldnes off alleging authoritice: I will set down Master Zwinglius
judgment in this cause / which he utters in diverse places off that book /
owte off which the D. has alleged this: but most manifestly / within les
then a dowsen lines of the place / from whence he rent this. Having inueighed
against the Popish election / both for that in yt one bishop has all the
power / and for the unworthiness off those which were chosen: he addethe / yt
semethe therefore, that there is nothing so agreeable to the ordinance off god,
and to Zuingl. in Eccle.
the oulde institution, as that all the whole church off the faithful
amongeste a people, together withdraw certain learned, and godly bishopes, ad
other faithful me^ having skill in things, should choose a pastor. and a
little after / Let therefore these provvde bishops, and folish Abbats goo shake
their ears, for yt is conueniente that the right off the election, should be
in the power off the church off the faithful, instructed by the counsels off
learned men. for as that matter ovvghte not to be in the power of one: so
ovvghte not the rude, and unlearned multitude, challenge unto yt self alone, so
great vveighte off the election, etc.

Let us now see whether the Ans. be any faithfuller in alledginge Master
Bullinger. First who denies / that Paul / and Barnabas did choose elders /
and ministers there? When we give unto them the gouernmente / and direction off
the action / there is no reasonable man can Imagine / that we shut them owte off
the election. But if you think / that because master Bullinger says / they
chose, therefore he affirmethe / that they chose alone / and withowte the
church: these words can by no means prove yt / his judgment in other places
quite overthrows yt. hear therefore what M. Bull. writes: Those which
think (meaning In the 4. Sermon. off off the 5. decade, Tit. 1, 1, Tim, 5.
the papists) that the bishops, and Archbishop have power to make ministers
use these places of the scripture, Therefore I left the at Crete, that thou
mighteste appointe elders town by town: and again, take heed thou lay
not thy hands rashely of any: but we answer, that the Apostels did not use
any tyranny in the churches, nor to have them selves alone, done these
things which perteined either to the election, or ordination, other men in
the church shut ovvte. For the Apostels, and elders did create bishops, and
elders in the church: but communicatinge their counsel withdraw the churches,
yea and withdraw the consent and approving off the people: which does appear
plainly, by the election, and ordination off Mathias, etc. And there citinge
how Moses did communicate the choice off the magistrates with the people. he
adds / And so no dovvbte did blessed Titus, althovvghe he had heard thou
shalt appoincte elders in Creta: yet understood, that nothing was permitted
him to do privately, vvithovvte the advice off the church.

And because this place is cited also / to prove that Master Bullinger should
think / that the Election 14. Acts / should be made by Barnabas / and Paul:
let the Doctor hear what master Bullinger writethe in the page before /
saying / That the lord from the beginning gave authority to the church, to
choose, and ordeine fit ministers, has been shevved before in the second
sermon off this decade, by the example off the most eldeste churches in the
world Jerusalem, and Antioche: vvheroff the one did not only ordeine seven
Deacons, but also Matthias the Apostle, the other did set aparte to the
ministry, the two notable Apostels off Christ Paul and Barnabas: whereunto
is added, that the churches off the gentills being instructed, or directed off
Paul, and Barnabas, did choose by voices elders, or governors off the church.
Where also he quoteth the same place off the Acts / which is here in
question. These was I constrained good reader to set down / that thou mighteste
understand / that the weapons wherwithe the D. fightethe against this cawse /
are not (as he falsely pretends) drawn from the Iosu. 5. 3. Deuteronomy. 1. 15 Act
15. 22 and 16. 4.
godly writers / but ministered unto him by some owte off the armorie off the
papists / whose they only be. The places which I alleged / prove first
that yt is usual in the scripture / to ascribe that to the principal in an
action / which is commen to them with other: then that althowghe S. Luke /
had made no mention off the election off the church / but only said / that
Barnabas / and Paul chose: yet thereby could not be concluded / that the
church had no intereste in the election / but only this / that Paul / and
Barnabas were the chief in that action. Yff that be ascribed unto Iosue /
which he procured only / and laid no hand unto: how much more may yt be
ascribed unto Paul / and Barn. which they both procured / and had some doing
in? and therefore that example of al is most apt / for that wherefore it is
alleged. I perceive there is nothing so clear / which the D. will not
essaie to darcken: seeing he says / that yt rather appears, that the people
permitted the election off those governors, to Moses. The contrary wheroff
manifestly appearethe. for after that in the 9. verse / Moses had bydd them
choose governors: in the next verse he says / that the people accepted that
commaundmente / and thowght off yt as a thing equal. Therefore it is most
vntrwe / that they returned yt into Moses hands again: for then they would
have answered / that yt was not meet for him / to commit the election unto
them / but rather for the wisdom wherein he excelled / to do yt him self.

And where the D. reasons off the 15. verse / upon the words I took, etc.
that phrase does rather overthrow his purpose / then confirm yt: for it
semethe to have a relation / to the gyuinge / and presentinge of those which
they they had chosen. And the very same Phrase is used afterward in the 23.
verse. of the spies which were sent to spy the land: which notwithstanding
were not only sent off Moses / but off the people also / as appears in the
22. verse / and in the book off numbers: where the lord doothe not 13. Number.
verse. 3.
only attribute / this sendinge off spies / unto Moises: but unto the people.
Moses gave no further authority unto them: then they which in
ecclesiastical elections / ordeine those which were chosen before / and
confirm the elections which are made. Therefore as those ordinations exclude
not the authority off election: so this confirmation off Moses / did not
devour that power off election / which he had gyued them: but their elections
/ and his confirmation / made up a full creation of those governors. Towchinge
the false accusation off pushing at the magistrate / I have answered.

Those verses off the 22. and 23. off the 25. Acts which you allege / show
who bore the swate / in the making of that decree: But yet in that the letters
were written in the churches / and not only in the Apostels / and Elders
names: and for that the decree ver. 23. ver. 25.
is ascribed unto them / by whom the letters are subscribed: yt is manifest /
that that consent / and subscription off the people / occupied some rowme in
that decree. Nether is that alleged owte of M. Calu. any thing against that
I said / that the people had to do in yt / and gave consent: but gives
as much to the church as I / in saying / the church committed the matter unto
the decision of the Apostels, and Doctors: as thowghe it belo^ged unto the
church / and the church / had put yt over unto them. Yt is enoughe for me /
that the churches subscription was there / and that not for a cyphre. Therefore
althowghe S. Luke / for shortness sake did call yt the decree off the Apostels /
and Elders: yet S. Paul which gave them to the churches / and which in other
places stands so much upon the authority off the churches / to stop the
mowthe off the contentious: did not (by all likelihood) omyt the authority off
the church / to give them the more grace with the churches / unto the which
he delivered them.

The Ans. which will prove nothing him self / but off whom we must take
all most althinges at his bare word / has notwithstanding a great grace in
settinge me to prove all things / Institut. li. 4. ca. 3. s. 15. The former
decade. Liuy 2. lib. ab vrbe. Liu. 3. li. ab vrbe. Diui. 3. p. 158.
be they never so manifest. Let him then understand / that this which he
requirethe proof off / is confirmed by the authority off master Call. and
master Bulling. The manner off speech also is in Liuy: where the consul is
said to set up an other consul / into the place off him which was dead: when
he did yt not by his own authority only / but by voices off the Senate / and
people.

If the Answ. could have first given his reader a drink off the river off
forgetfulness, to have made him forgette what he owghte to prove / peradventure
this talk off his might have some end: but if he carry in mind that he
has to prove / that almost al ecclesiastical writers do affirm, the word
liftihg up of hands to be used in the scriptures, for the solemn manner off
ordeining ministers (...).
by imposition off hands, and not for the election by voices: I say if he
carry this in mind / he shall perceive easily / how idle for the most part /
this talk is. And verily all these authorities here browghte / are either
vain: or directly against him selffe: or in sufficient to prove that / which
he undertakes. For to what purpose are here alleged / two places owte off
master Calvin / two Canons given to the Apostels / and the Testimony off
Jerome? They prove that lftiing up off hands, is taken in ecclesiastical
writers (...).
for imposition off hands / which is confessed by me in plain words: But to
the perfourmance off your promise / that almost all the ecclesiastical
writers affirm, that this word is so taken in scripture: yet there is not one
syllable. In this rank also off idle testimonies / is that whole section off
master Gualter. For I confessed him to think / that the word was so taken:
but yet so that withal / he joins the election off the people by voices:
Which the Answ. would by that signification off the word / overthrow. So
that all these browght in off the D. look another way / then he would have
them.

That the Canons attributed unto the Apostels / make not to prove the sole
election off a bishop / shallbe discussed after: here it is only sufficient
to have showed / that they make not to prove that which the Ans. alleged them
for. Wherein I marvel also what he means / to ask leave of me that yt may
be as lawful for him to use them, as it is for me: as if I had used them
otherwise / the^ I owght. I never used them as the natural canons of the
Apostels / I have showed that they are not / nor can not be theirs: but as the
Canons off other Councels where amongst the bad / there are found some good.
And I never used them / but where I confirmed by Testimony off the word off
God / that which I bring them witness for. Therefore this phrase being used
thrice / or four times / withowte all occasion: argues him to be a vain
trifler / which becawse he has nothing to answer / gives him self the
bridle to forge / and surmise all manner off vntrwthes. And where by this
preface / yt seems the man would have stricken this matter / as dead as a
door nail: yet having leave to use them / he has not so much as once come
near unto the matter * only he has gained some few lines / to increase his
confused heap.

The next rank is of those / which are not only not profitable / but
directly hurtefull unto his cause. In which number is the witness off Master
Bull. that word which signifies lifting up of hands, is so placed that we
may understand, either that they were chosen by voice off the people, or
ordained by laying on off hands: especially if he had added the four next
words / I think both were done Whereby appearethe that Master Bullingers
opinion is / that both the churches chose by voices / and the Apostels laid
on their hands / which directly ouerthrowethe the Answ. For his answer is
such / that onles the word do only signify there the ceremony off
imposition off hands / and not the election by voices: yt goethe to the
grownd. therefore Master Bulling. saying / that boothe were done in this
place: there could be no flatter testimony against him / then yt.

And where he cyteth Master Bullinger / that he is elected In 5. sect. 159.
page
by common suffrages off the People, which is chosen by the testimony off
the best: I know good reader thou merueileste / not / that it comethe owte
off time / for that is his ordenarie: but do thou not marvel / what
mystical rethoricke has separated so far a sonder / this sentence from the
other which he before alleged? Leave to marvel / there is no great art in
it / but there In the same diuis. 2. se. p. 158 I thinck both were done.
is some craft. For if thou give heed unto him / yt may appear yt was only
to cover the treachery which he used / in taking both that which goethe
before / and that which comes after: leuing quite owte those words by me
alleged / which stand in the myiddest off those two sentences / marringe his
whole marcket. And becawse yt would have to palpably appeared / if he had
done yt in one / and the same place: he makethe the^ to come as it were
strangers owte off two several countries / that dwell hard together.

For the sentence it self / what would he trow you conclude? That the bishope
must have the election? if it be not that / I know not wherefore yt is
browghte. If he mean to use yt therun to: then must off necessity Master
Bullinger speak thus / that he is elected by the common suffrages off the
people / which is approved by the testimony off the best bishops. Do you
lawghe at these things / when the D. is in so good earneste? Saying he sees
that both the testimony off the Scripture / and writers oulde / and new
(Papists only excepted) give intereste off election unto the people: yet
rather then yt should fall from the bishopps / he makes a metamorphosis / and
change off the Bishops into the people. The meaning off Master Bullinger
(if any could be so ignora^te as not to understand) is / that the faithful
only have intereste in the election off the church: and that the Papists
have not / nor owghte not to have to do in it / nether any other heretics /
and scismatickes from the church. Whatsoever yt be / yt can be by no means
drawn to prejudice the churches interest / which he does so plainly both
here / and else where affirm.

And where yt is supposed / that the church has leave to oppose against him
that is to be elected: I have showed how manifest mockery yt is / off the
church off God. As for that which is said off master Bulling. and Master
Calvin jointly / that they have affirmed off the signification off the word as
much as he: yt is a manifest vntrwthe. For master Calvin never affirmed /
that the scripture ever used that word, to note the ceremony off layinge on
off hands. Off M. Bullinger yt has been before spoken.

There follows in this second rank Oecunemius / whose testimony is so
flat against the Ans. signification off the word lifting up off hands, and
therefore also against the sole election off the bishop: as a clearer could
not be required. His words be these / yt is to be noted, that the disciples
withdraw fasting, and (...).
prayers did make elections by voices. Now saying by the word disciples Saint
Luke / and the Scoliast followinge him / continually throwghe the story of the
Acts / note the people which believed: it is manifest that the Scoliaste
does both conclude upon this place / that the people did choose: and
co^cludethe yt also of the word / lifting up off hands. Whether in
attributinge the same word unto Paul / and Barnab. he mean thereby the
ceremony off imposition off hands: I will not (as in a thing not worth the
travail) stand. yt is enowghe for me to have showed / how this testimony
makethe directly against that / which the Doctor affirms: that is to say /
that the word lifting up off hands signifiethe in this place off the Acts /
only the ceremony off layinge on off hands. For if it signify both the
election by voices / and the ceremony off layinge on off hands: then our cawse
stands as sure / as if it only signified the election by voices.

And to this testimony off the Scoliaste agrees the same Ignatius / Ad
Philadelph. (...).
that the Ans. in his former book makes so great account off: who writes
thus / yt is meet that you as those which be the church off god, should
choose by voices yovvr bishopp. Whereby not only appears / that that author
will have the church choose her minister: but also how this word is used off
him in the proper signification / to note the election which is made by
voices. Chrysostom remains / which taking the word for the imposition off
hands / doothe not exclude the natural signification. Brentius translating
Chrysostom. had followed that sense I set down: if the D. can confute him by the
greek example / he is worthy off credit.

Let us now see what the Ans. has to say against those reasons / whereby I show
that S. Luke by lifting up off hands, meant properly the election by voices. I
may not (says he) teach the holy ghost to speak: God forbid I should go
abowte yt. But shall not he which made the mouth speak / and he which
teaches all other to speak properly / speak properly him self? I do not
therefore teach the holy ghost to speak, which apply his words to make them
agree with the things they signify: but yowr opinion supposes want off
knowledge off the tongue in the holy ghost / which would have him signify
layinge down / by liftinge up. And where you say I trifle, becawse he that
lays on his hands, must first lift them up, or ever he can lay them on:
who trifleth in this poincte let all judge. For who does not understand /
that the name is usually given off the principal / and nearest action
wherwithe it is done: and not off those actions which are far off /
accidental / or for the cause / and sake off the principal. And yt is all on
/ as if a man should call the taking off a knife into his hand / cuttinge off
bread: because he that cutteth bread / must before take the knife into his
hand.

How be it / if there were the same manner off layinge on off hands in the
primitive church / which is in popery / and with us / where he that is
chosen kneeleth on his knees / to receive the bishopps layinge on off hands:
yt is so far from any need to lift up his hand / or ever he can lay yt on:
that onles he carry his hands very unmannerly / like a pair off hanging
sleeves: he must let them down / or ever he can can lay them on the head
off him which is chosen. Therefore althowghe an other might use this poor
shifte: yet you which have undertaken to defend whatsoever the bishops
generally do in their elections / have (if I should deal hardly with you)
lost this advantage.

Yt is nothing with the A. that the 70. interpreters off the old Testament /
nor that S Paul / and Luke him selffe / utter the layinge on off hands by
other words. These are bare conjectures being alleged against him: but ye
shall hear by and by / where he has not half such a reason / the great
bell go with certainly, and manifestly. Howbeit althowghe these seem bare
conjectures to him: yt must needs have weighte with those / that have their
senses well acquainted with the holy scripture. For they know that the writers
off the new testament / frame them selves unto the manner off speech off the
oulde / when they speak off the same things: and for the gentiles sake which
had knowledge off the translation of the seventy interpreters / they keep them
so carefully to that: that sometimes they use it / althowgh yt be not in every
poincte so just / and so answerable unto the trewthe of the Hebrew / as might
have been. Which thing done off all those especially / which labored in
the tillage off the gentills / amongeste whom S. Luke (S. Paul's Companion)
was: whosoever considers must needs confess / that this conjecture is not
so bare as he makes yt.

I ask yff any man can reasonably think / that in one and the same ceremony
/ commen as well unto us off the New Testament / as those off the oulde / Saint
Luke would leave both the manner of speech of the Hebrews / and the words
off the 70 interpreters: to take a strange phrase from the one / and diverse
words from the other? or whether he would leave the phrase / and words which
the Jews / and gentiles were acquainted with: to use a phrase which the Jews
never hard of / and a word which was in that signification / unknown unto
the Gentiles? off all which when there is no one / which has not force to
persuade this sentence: so the last is such / that yt leuethe no place unto
any resistance. For when the holy ghost speaks with the tongues off men / and
to their understanding: if by this word lifting up off hands, he had
signified a layinge on of hands: he could not have been understood /
saying that word was of no such signification in that tongue.

And where he says / I oppose my bare conjectures, to improve so many learned
men's judgments: I have showed how he has over toulde. I have no where
reasoned against you / as if you should affirm that by that word, the
laying of on hands, should be me^te. Therefore if you had spared that cauil /
you might have been clear of two more errors which you are fallen into / by
affirminge partly / that S. Luke by the word lifting up off hands, signifies
the whole solemnity of creatinge ministers (which can not be true / saying he
expresses two other parts off yt / which are prayer / and fasting) partly in
affirminge / that he does in the words off laying on off hands all ways
understand, the bare layinge on off hands only: when as in two off those
places (...). 9. Act. 17. 19 Act. 6. 8. Act. 15.
which I have alleged / it may appear / that by those words is noted / not
only the puttinge on off hands: but also the prayers which were made / for
the receiuinge off the gifts off the holy ghost. Which thing expressed in an
other place to have been done by Peter / and John / we must esteem observed /
at othertymes.

If I had not browghte the place off the Acts / the A. had 10. Act. 41.
had nothing to say / to that I alleged of Saint Lukes borowinge this phrase
/ not off those which came many years after: but of those which were before.
But saying destitute off yowr own / you are entered upon my possession /
against my will / and so also that you will thruste me owte: let yt be
sufficient / that you have eased yowr self here a while. I say therefore /
that this place makes against you / in that this word in that place /
signifies not a layinge on off hands upon the heads off the chosen: Luke 6.
13. Math. 28. 19.
but a chusinge by voices / consideringe that we read plainly / that he chose
his Apostels by voice.

Let us hear now how it makes against us. First becawse the word is not
there taken, for liftinge up off hands: but for appoinctinge and ordeining.
As who should say yt is not usual unto the scripture / and to all speeches /
by figure in one part to note the whole: and therefore S. Luke by that one
form off election / passed by the ceremony off liftinge up off hands /
notethe this election which was made by voce / off our Savior Christ. yt
may be also applied unto other electio^s / wherein by goinge from one side to
another / or by writing his voice in a table / the consent off the chuser is
uttered. So does the scripture by bonds / and chain / 2. Tim. 1. 16. Act.
28. 16. and 30:
which are particular kinds off restrainte: note all manner off restraincte
off liberty / althowghe a man have nether bonds / nor chains a bowte him. So
that that which is so often said in the gospel simply / off our Savior
Christ's choosing his Apostels: S. Luke did here in figure / not without great
grace utter.

Where you say / that by this means yt signifies not to ordeine by suffrages:
in deed in this place yt can not / consideringe that our Savior Christ was
but one. But where you vvoulde conclude Act. 14.
thereof / that Paul, and Barnabas by their voices only chose the ministers,
and elders: Yt is further a sunder / then ever you can set together. here you
must be admonished / that where the most off yowr witnesses did forsake you
before: you beheere forsaken off them all. For there is never a one off the
new vvriters especially / named of us both: but upon that place off the Aces
/ has in plain words approved the election by the church.

Secondly the person off our Savior Christ which chose / with whom none
might be joined in commission / and the person off the Apostels / which
could not be chosen of any but off God: did sufficiently off them selves /
withowte further addition / argue the sole election off our Savior Christ.
But in the 14. Acts / saying nether the Apostels which did choose / were
such as might not be accompanied off the church / nor the Mynisters that
were chosen off such degree / as might not likewise fall into the choice off
the church: and consideringe also that all the elections off the ministry
spoken off before / in which the Apostels had to do / were by consent of
the church: yt is clear that if S. Lukes meaning had been / to tie this
election as streighte unto Pau. and Barn. as the other to our Sau. Christ: he
would have put in words which might as clearly have declared that meaning
in this / as the circumstances of the persons do in the other.

Thirdly if this word which notethe the choice by voices / should be
restreined unto Paul / and Barnabas: then also the word which declares
that they prayed should only be restreined (...).
unto them: for as that is given unto them / so is this. Now if it be absurd
to say / that in those public prayers Paul / and Barnabas only prayed: yt
is as absurd to say / that they only chose: and the same may be said off
fasting. For that which followethe (...)
with fastinges, is all one as if he had said / fasting, sauinge only that
S. Luke for elegancy sake / and to a void the multitude of participles
coming so thick / turned the verb into the nowne. so that for so much as
Paul / and Barnabas did not only fast / but the church also: yt must
follow that they chose not only / but the church with them. Therefore as S.
Luke in saying that Paul / and Barnabas prayed, and fasted, means not that
they prayed and fasted only / but that they went before the rest / in
governing those Ecclesiastical actions: even so in saying that they chose by
voices, he means not that they chose alone withowte the church / but that
they guyded / and directed the judgments off the church. Last off all /
saying that all the twelve to Act. 1. Act. 6.
gether / would not enterprise to do any thing off their private authority /
vvithowte consent of the church: much les can yt be thowghte / that Paul /
and Barnab. would attempt yt.

Hereto make an end of this dispute / I will answer that which is brought off
this word p. 163. And first I deny that ever I said / that this word by it
self, withowte ioininge any thing unto yt, signifies election off many by
voices. for yt can not signify any thing / unless yt be joined with
something. These words (off the churches) althowghe they declare of whom
the election was made: 2. Cor. 8. 19.
yet they are not added to note the manner of the election / as the word Act.
14. but to give credit unto the ambassadors / with the churches unto which
they went / that they might safely commit their money unto them / for the
behoufe of the church off Jerusalem. Therefore it is nothing you allege /
that this addicio^ off the churches had been needles, if the word liftinge up
off hands, had signified off it selffe an election by voices. For Saint Paul
should not have to the full / advanced their credit with the churches: if he
had given only to understand / that they were chosen by voices of many:
considering that they were chosen / not only by the voices of many men: but by
the voices off many churches. Wheruppon I conclude / that S. Luke Act. 14. used
that word as the Grecians before him / for election by suffrages: and withal
put him in mind / that his certain and manifest things, have neither grownd
to stand on / nor light to show them by.

There are but two communities / one Anabaptisticall which Diuis. 4, page, 161,
makes equality off all things / which is / and ever was unlawful; the
other Christian / which provides for need of those / which have not
vvherwith to find them selves / which is / and owghte to be perpetual /
amongeste all Christians. Therefore you can not escape with this circuit of
words / for either that community in the Acts / was such as owghte to be
amongeste us / which you deny / and propounde as an absurd thing: or else
it was Anabaptisticall / which is blasphemous against the spirit off God.

Althowghe men may be good Christians withowte sellinge their lands, and
distributings of the price off them unto those which have need: yet they can
not be good Christians / if for necessary releife of the poor of the church
weroff they are / they be not content to sell (the need so requirring) even
their lands. And such was the estate of the church off Jerusalem / where
there were so many poor / and so few rich / that the want of those
which had not / with much a do was supplied by sale off lands / and
howses off them / that had such possessions. Which extreme poverty may
easily be seen in other places / where not hable to be fournished of the
rich of that church / yt was feign to be supplied by diverse other. Unto Act.
11 19 Romans 15. 25. 2. Cor. 8.
the reasons alleged owte off S. Paul / to prove that the same community is
commanded of him to all Christians: you answer not one word. Unto the
which I will ad this / that I doubt not but that which was done there /
was so far from oxtraordinarie doing: that yt was done by the
commandment of God in the law / where the lord charge the Israelites /
that there should be no beggars amongeste them For Saint Luke Deutr. 15. 4.
(...)
seems to have alluded to that place / when he says / there was no needy
amongeste them: which expresses most aptely / the Hebrew word which Moises
uses.

That which I browghte off Ananias, and Saphira, was to prove there was no
such community amongeste them as yowr answer supposed / and to glase up the
the windows of Anabaptistry / which you had opened. And surely if the
anabaptists had (as they neither have / nor can have) warrant of their
community / by this example off the most pureste / and ancientest church /
and in deed then the only church in the world / approved by all the Apostels
replenished with the spirit off God: they should have stronger houlde then
M. D. should ever be hable to pull from them. I do not think you favor the
Anabaptists community, but partly seduced off others / and partly overcaried
with the violence off yowr affections: you are unawares fallen into that errer
/ vvherby the Anabaptists grownde it.

Where I said / that all off the church did not sell their possessions: I
confess the word possession / was not so advisedly put / saying thereby is
properly signified house / and land / and those which we call immovable
goods: which Saint Luke says were sold off as many as had them. But yet
nothing falls of that for which I did alleged yt: and it is rather thereby
confirmed. For shewinge that all owners off house / and land did sell them /
and not that every one which had other goods did the like: thereby is given to
understand / that not every one which had monay / or other mouables / brought
them unto the Apostels.

The Adm. reason you are not able to stir. For if S. Paul. For avoiding
suspicion in a monay matter, did communicate the election with Diui. 5. p. 163.
2. Co. 8. 19.
the churches: why should he not to avoid suspicion, off percialitie /
ambition / and tyranny / communicate with them the election off the ministers?
Surely he was as far from suspicion off this covetous treachery with all men: as
from suspicion off these faults. And so much farther / as such excellent
wits / and learning as was in him / are easelier overcome off those other
vices / then off this pilferinge off monay: which the grosser / and unlearned
sort for the most part offend in. Na why should not S. Paul be in fear
off this monay suspicion / if he had taken upon him the election off the
ministers / shuttinge owte the churches? Do you think that those which
would have done him that injury / to think that he would have turned the
church money unto his Act. 20. 34.
own use (which often times with his own hand erned both his own living /
and others too / which refused the wages which he might justly have challenged)
would not also have suspected him off the same fault / if he had chosen the
ministers at his pleasure / withowte consent off the church? Or do you not
think that there are many / which suspecte diverse off the Bishopps that
way: which say that for a dishe of fruicte of the goulde^ gaiffe / they lease
owte / and make all manner off merchandise of the Lords orchardes: that he
which has no gift in his heart / yet if he have a gift in his hand /
need no other keie to open the church door / and enter into a benefyce? If
therefore for the auoidinge of suspicio^ of corruption by moneie / it was
needeful for Saint Paul / to communicate the election off such ministers with
the church: how much more was yt needful / for the auoidinge off both the
suspicion off that vice / and diverse others / he should do the like in the
ordinary ministers? And if that where needful in S. Paul / for vpholdinge
off his honest estimation to the greater fruicte off the gospel: I say as I
said / what Archbishop shall dare take upon him the making off a minister,
vvithovvte consent off the church? For if Saint Paul's innocence of life /
which (as the diamonte a peble stone) might shame all the Archbishoppes that
live this day / had need off this aid: they must off necessirie run into
suspicion off all those vices / which contemninge the judgment off the
churches / make such elections off their own authority.

Where you say / that Saint Paul might have chosen them him self, if he
would: I say that it is untrue / and a manifest begginge of that in
controversy. And to say so is as much / as if you had said: he might have
hazarded his good estimacion if he would / and left it at the curteousye off
quarellers / which sowghte every occasion of speakinge evil of his ministry
Beside that you must understand / that in the gouernmente of the churches /
the Apostels were governed by the spirit of God: whose counsel when this
was / it was no more lawful for him to refuse yt / the^ to disobey the lord.
Touching the vntrewth he charge me with / in that I said / In his 3. Tr. 1.
c. d. 4.
the church chose 1. Act. it is before answered. And it is a vain quarrel of
the A. that there was no election off the church, becawse an Apostel may not
be chosen by men. As thowghe I had not set down before / when I spoke off that
election / that I mean not the choice / which was made off one owte off those
two: but the choice off those two owte of the whole church: not that choice
which determined / the Apostellshipp / but which determined / who they should
stand for the Apostelship. And if no election of the church can be said to
have been in the first off the Acts / because an Apostell can not be chosen
off any / but off God alone: then can not the Apostels (which the D. affirms)
be said to have chosen Matthias and Barnabas / owte of the rest off the
church.

In the 1. 2. 3. sections off this division / he has filled up almost Diu.
6. p. 164.
a whole side / wherein there is nothing at all / which either is not gone
before / or comes not after / and so grossly repeted / withowte either new
coat / or new color: that I marvel he is not ashamed. For the places Act.
1. 6. 14. for that also Cor. 8. 2. I have replied before: to the other /
answer shall be made in their places. Now then to begin^e with the falsifyinge
you charge me with / I say that althowghe I have not given you the same
words: yet I have given you the same weighte / and I acknowledge you for no M.
of the tongue / by whose authority I should be bound / to the same words which
you use. I have not taken you / as you do me at the worste: but I have given
yowr words a fauorabler meaning / then they deserve / because I perceived
that you mente to comprehend Cyprians times / althowgh yowr words even to
Cyprians time, would not so well bear it. yt is disputed whether this word
until, or unto, does shut owte / or shut in the time wheroff it is spoken:
but there was never I think any / that dowbted whether that saying in common
speech / might be stretched owte / beyond that time whereunto it is
particularly applied. Notwithstanding yowr words are yet more restreintiue.
For yt restreineth more to say / even to such a time: then to say simply /
until such a time. for that increase off the word even, makethe the wall off
separation higher.

But now he seethe the vntrwthe off this saying / he castethe yt upon
Master Musc. and he must bear the weighte off yt. But such most gross
ignorance off the estate off the primitive church / was far from him. And
Master Musc. clears him self off it well. For when he says / that the
election of the minister by the voices off the church, endured unto Cyprians
time: he means not as the D. to put difference between the elections made by
the people / and the bishopp: but shewethe only a difference / between
elections made by consent off the people / withowte the magistrate: and
between the elections made by the consent of the people / with the
confirmation off the Magistrate. And that this is his meaning / yt may easily
appear. For pursuinge the proof of that election by the church without the
magistrate / alleging certain Canons thus he concludes. After this sort
therefore were the Elders, bishops, and deacons in times paste Muscu. de elect.
and ord. Min.
chosen: which fashion they still retained, until the time off Christian
magistrates, whose consent unto the election off the bishops, was required.
Therefore this absurdity being the Ans. own / he must be content to bear
yt.

Yt makethe no matter that this form of election, was not in some few
churches off the world in Cyprians time: nether is it marvel. althowghe in
some places at that time / they had departed from the institution of the
Apostolical church. If it be proved that Cyprian teachethe / that it owghte
to be so / and that it is Gods ordinance: if all the churches had declined from
yt / as there were very few: Cyprian must needs by that sentence / disalowe
them. Althowghe I must also admonish you / that if those few examples in
Cyprians time could prejudice the trwthe: yet yowr bishops election is not
confirmed thereby. for it might be done by the eldershipe of the church / by
assembly off many bishops. most vnlikeste is yt off all other / that it was
done at the pleasure off one bishope. Let us therefore come to examine Cyprians
judgment / and see whether I have reported trwly of him.

First / as a trewante loathe to go to scoole / seeks the furthest way: so
the A. afraid off the light off Ciprians words / makethe entrance into this
sentence by half a score lines / which might have been in one. Here good
reader as the A callethe for thy diligence / so if thowe give a little heed:
thou shalt see such open / and violente peruertinge / as could not be done
withowte crack off conscience.

First therefore let us hold that (which I think is accorded off both
parts) that Cyprians purpose is to withdraw the people / from communicatinge
with the ministry off those / which had fallen from the gospel unto
Idolatry. To the confirmation vvheroff when he had alleged / the greuousnes
off that crime: he addethe / especially saying the people have power to choose
vvorthie, and to refuse unworthy ministers. As if he should say / if it
were not in yowr power / to refuse those unworthy ministers / you might have
some excuse: or if being in yowr power to refuse the unworthy / you had not
also power to choose another worthy / you might have likewise somewhat for
excuse. For you might allege peradventure / that it were better to keep him
still / then to be with owte altogether / or to have a another as evil / or
worse then he. but saying you have both power to refuse the vnworthly / and to
a choose a another: there must needs befaulte. That this is the meaning off
Cyprian / and his argument wherewith he calls them back / from
communicatinge with the ministry off those which had fallen: all which can
set the nominative case / and verb together / must needs understand.

Now let us see whether the exposition off the Ans. will lib. 1. Ep. 4:
maintain this saying. To accord him and Cyprian / we must first expound
these words to have power to choose, and to have power to refuse, to be to
stand by while they be chosen, or refused. Which master D. gatherethe belike
/ becawse Cyprian says / the election must be had the people being
present. In deed it appearethe the manner was then / that he that was to be
chosen / was before them: but is it a good reason / that Cyprian would have
the people present at the election / therefore he vvoulde not have them to
choose? saying he had said im^ediatly before / that they had power to choose. Yt
is well therefore / that he added / that yt owghte to be done by their
judgment: so that if the church judged him not meet / he owghte not to be
minister. And further adds (which the D. is afraid of / and which he
shamfully deniethe in state words) by their voices.

The examples out off the Acts wherewith he bringethe light Diui. 1. p. 133.
unto that which he thawghte / are touched before: and amongst others by the
election off the Deaco^s / which becawse the D. can not deny / but it was by
the church: he has left yt clean forth. and yet most plainly he shows
this by example of an election / which was lately made in the church whereunto
he vvritethe: saying / which we see to have been done withdraw you, in the
ordeininge off our fellow in office Sabinus: thar the bishopric should be
given him, by the voice off the whole brother hood and by the judgment off
those bishopps which were present, and which had written unto you off
him, etc.

Thus therforey may be reasoned / that was the ordinance off God which Cyp.
taught to have been practiced by those examples (for he still coupleth them
together with his doctrine given before / and grounded owte of the book of
numbers): But he taught that in these examples the people were not only
present at the choice / but also gave their voices: therefore it was Gods
ordinance / not only that that the people should be present / but also that
they should choose.

And here yt is again to be observed / that this is another off the popish
shifts. for unto Luther (which alleges that the people owghte to choose
there minister / lest the church should Pig. hierarch. 2. lib 9. cap. 5 li.
10. c. 16. contr. Hos. 1. li. de legit. iudic.
despise / or has him which is thruste upon it / vvhilest it might not
have him whom yt desired) Pighius answers that the meaning off those words
be / that the people should be present / and bear witness: and the same
answer is made by other Papists / to other testimonies which are browghte.
This by the way that it may be known / from whence the Ans. provision
comethe.

Now to proceed: Where he says / that the people had no voices in Eleazars
election: I ask him how he prouethe that. If he answer because it is not
mentioned in the scripture / he has answered him self more then twenty
times / when he says / that it is an evil argument to reason negatiuely off
the scriptures. Let him now take this answer / That there was no like
necessity off examininge Eleazars ministry by voices / as there is off other
ecclesiastical electione: forsomuche as he was chosen by the voice off God /
which 20. Nom. 25.
could not be deceived. But Cyprian did well see / that if the lord vvoulde
not have the judgment off the church passed by in those / which he him self
had chosen by his voice from heaven: much les vvoulde he have / any minister
thruste upon the church against her will / in elections which are made by
men / withowte such special direction.

Now as this interpretation off the A. is directly against the words off
Cyprian / directly against his meaning showed forth by practice / and
examples: so does yt directly overthrow the whole scope / which Cyprian
alleges those words for: which is / that he might thereby vvithdrawe the
churches / from communicatinge with the ministry of those which had fallen
/ saying they might both put them owte / and choose other in their places. For
if he mente the church should stand by to see who were chosen / and to
obiecte against him if need required (albeit not thus much was ever observed
of our bishops) tell me who are they Cyprian me^t should choose? magistrate
there was none / The eldershippe the D. dare not say / for he trembles at the
very name of it: I dare say his meaning is / to gratify the bishop with
this morsel / but yt will choke him if he swallowe yt. Yt is the portion off a
number / and therefore if it could be carried from the church: It must come
unto the bishops that dwell round abowte that church / where the election is
to be made. And if the election / and deprivation by Cyprians mind / be in
their hands: how has the people power to choose / and refuse? For if they
would / they could neither deprive the present incumbente / nor depriuinge
him choose another. Any off these things overthrows Cyprians drifte / and
armeth the people with replies against his exhortacion: namely that they
communicated with their poluted minister / becawse yt is not in them to depose
him / but in the Bishops round abowte: yt is not in them to choose another /
but in the Bishopps. Therefore his reprehension / and exhortation should have
been directed against the bishopps / and not against them. And so it is
manifest / both by the words / and whole drifte off Cyprian: that his
judgment was / that by the ordinance off God in Ecclesiastical elections /
the consent / and judgment off the church is necessary.

The Cuckoe is here come again: for look the D. book / Diuis. 7. pa. 167.
pa. 136. s. 3. 4. and pa. 163 sec. 1.
and you shall see either the same words / or at least the same matter withowte
any addition / Which are here in the 1. 2. 3. 4. sect. off this diuis. In the
164. and 165. page sect. 1. 2. You have yt set before you almost all again.
This is not Colewortes twice / but thrice sodden. Yt behooves that he imagine a
great famine of learned writings / that dare thus abuse the cares / and
leisure off his reader.

Touching the variety of Electio^s / which he cites out of M. Calvin / onles
as unnatural weomen do their children conceived in adultry / he purpose to
make away with his cause: I know not what he should mean / to offer yt thus
into the hands off her enemies. For he writes thus in that place alleged. In
oulde time Inst. li. 4. ca. 4. s. 10
there was none received, not so much as in to the number off clerks,
vvithovvte the consent off the people: so that Cyprian doothe diligently
excuse him self, that he had appoincted Autelius a reader vvithovvte advise
off the church. And so rehersing Cyprians words / after he addethe: But
becavvse in those smaller exercises, there was no great danger, for that both
they were in daily trial, and the function was not great: the consent off
the people ceased to be asked. And by those small exercises yt must needs be
/ he means the Acoluthes / the Exorcistes / and the Readers: which may
appear to have been in 1. l. Epi. 3. 3 li. 22 4. li. 7. Inst. 4. li. 4. c.
10. s.
Cyprians time by his Epistles. And may yet better appear / whereas Master
Calvin (shewinge the cause / why the people was not so careful in that behalf
off retaininge their right) says / For there was none made subdeacon,
which under that severity off discipline that was then, had not given long
experience off him selffe in the clerkshipp: and after he was tried in the
subdeaconshippe, he was made deacon. So that yt is manifest / that by the
order off Clerks there he means those / which were under the degree of a
subdeacon.

He says also / that afterward the people did permit the judgment, and
choice off other orders likewise unto the bishope, and elders, except the
bishoppricke, or when any nevve elders were appoincted. where first yt
makethe directly against you / that in times paste not so much as a poor
Exorciste / or reader was chosen / withowte the consent off the people.
Secondly / that he says Cyprian did excuse him self unto the people / that
he had chosen Aurelius: implyinge thereby that althowghe he had some reason / to
lead him to do so: yet he was in the peoples danger. Thirdly / that yt was
the peoples right / in that they permitted this power unto others. Fourthly /
that this right was given to the elders / and not to the bishop alone / as
you would have yt. Last of all / that both the choice of the bishop / and
elder remained in the power off the people. Wherefore you vntrwly report / when
you say / that the people committed the choice unto the bishopes, and elders:
except yt were in the election off the bishop. For althowghe he say so /
immediately after he addethe. Except peradventure nevve elders were appoincted
to the parishes: for then the multitude off the place, must namely consent.
And after he says / Althovvghe in the elders alvvaies the consent off the
cytisens was required. Hitherto appears / that all the elections Inst. li.
4. cap. 5. sc. 3.
were made by consent off the people: if otherwise / by their curteousie / or
(as master Calvin in an other place note the) negligence.

Where the D. adds / And some times only the minister did first choose,
and then offer those whom he had choosen to the magistrate, who ratyfied the
election if he liked it, if not chose other, etc: In deed here is an election
withowte the consent off the people / but what is that and caetera? belike
some stranger / which pertains not to this matter. Mark then again good
reader / that if this were his own doing: there was never such a clypper off
koine / as he of the writings off Godly men. For yt follows even in the same
sentence / wherein the whole weighte off the cause does consiste / Then the
matter was brovvghte to the multitude, which althovvghe it were not bound
unto those foreiudgeme^ts: yet thereby was hable to make the les tumulte. or if
the people did begin, that was only to know whom they did most desire:
And when the peoples voices were heard, then in the end the clergy chose.
So that nether the clerks could set in the ministry, vvho^ they listed: nor
it was not necessary to obeie the folishe desires off the people. Could
there be any plainer words / then that the people was not bound by that
both the elders / and the magistrate had done / but were yet at their choice
/ if they liked not the chosen? After Master Calvin says / that this manner
off election by the ministers, magistrates, and people was in force in pope
Gregory's time: and like to have continued long after.

Off yowr Canons here alleged one only excepted / which makes nothing for
you: the rest make directly against you. For the canon attributed to the
Apostels yt is there said / that if a bishop chosen unto a church, do not
receive yt: he shall be separated from the communion, until he take yt But if
it be throvvghe the naughtines off the people, which will not receive him:
then he shall remain bishop still, and the clergy shall be separated from the
communion, because they tavvght their people no better to obeie. Where
appearethe / that the bishop could not enter / onles the people were
willinge. And where the cano^ would have him bishop still: yt means that he
should retain the name of a bishop / because he was put by withowte his
fault. Which thing was granted to Miletius / to vvho^ the Council Socr. 1.
9. cap* Theodor. ^. lib. 9. c.
of Nice in the Synodall Epistle / gave the naked name of a bishop.

In the Ancyran Council which you allege / there is the same: sauinge only
that yt is more directly against you. For there the Council willethe the
bishopp appoincted unto a church / if it will not receive him to return unto
his old place of eldershipp / where he was before. The self same does the
Canon Which you allege owte off the Council of Antioche / confirm. So that
these three Canons can tell the bishop / apoincted by other bishopps off the
province / no other remedy if he be refused off the people: but to quiet him
self and return to his oulde place off Eldershipp. And that you may know
how contrary always master Calu. is / unto the Ans. observe that off the
same Council off Antioche / and no dowbte of the same Canon / which the D.
gathers / that the church has nothing to do in the election: Master
Calvin gathers / that the Council ordained, that none should be thruste
lib. 4. Instit. c. 4. sect. 11.
upon the people against their will.

The 12. Canon off the Council of Laodicea / in saying that a bishop ovvghte
not to be appoincted to the gouermente off the church, beside the judgment
off the Metropolytan, and other bishopps hard by: gyuethe to understand /
that as they had a stroke in that election / so there were other that had to do
beside them. For otherwise yt would not have spoken so koldly off yt: For it
says not / that the Metrapolitaine / and other Bishops / should only
appoincte a bishop: no not so much as that they should appoint / but only
that the Bishop should not be appointed / without them.

The 13. Canon / which provides that it should not be permitted unto the
people, to make election off the minister: agrethe well with the 16. Canon off
the Council off Antioche. Which as it vvoulde not have a bishopp put upon the
churches otherwise froward / without their consent (as has been showed): so
will it not / that those which the churches had chosen without the iudgemen
off the bishops round abowte / should stand in force. And if either
Master Calvin / or Master Beza have any credit with you / you have their
interpretation / that the meaning off the Council was not / to shut owte
the consent off the Call. Inst: 4. li. 4. c. sec. 12. and upon the 14. Act.
Beza confess. ca. 5. Art. 35.
church: but only to provide / that the ministers / and elders should have
direction / as best hable to judge off the fitnes of him that should be
chosen. If they have no credit with you / yet whether ye w^l^ or no yt may
manifestly be showed / that the canons meaning was not to shut owte the
people / by other Councels / off Nice / off Constantinople / off Toled / off
Cartage / alleged in the former book. Wheroff some goinge before / and some
coming hard after / with such clear testimony off the peoples consent in
the election: decleare sufficiently / that the Council of Laodicea cannot be
thowghte / to have had any such meaning / as you suppose. but that there be
no controversy / I will add to the^ the testimony off such / whereby shall
appear / not only what the iudgmente off those Councels are: but what was
both the custome^ off the churches / and the judgment off other Councels from
time / to time in this behalf. In the Council off Paris yt was thus decreed /
2. Tom. Council. can. 8.
And because in certain things the oulde custom is neglected, and the
decrees off the Canons are broken: yt is our decree that according to the old
custom, the Canons off the decrees be observed. Let none be ordained bishop,
against the will off the cytisens: but he whom the election off the people,
and off the clerks with most full consent has required. Nether by the
commandment off the prince, nether by any other condition, let him be thruste
in against the will off the Metrapolitane, and other the bishops of the
same province. Orleans canon 10. 11.
In an other Council / Let yt not be lavvfull to get any bishopric by
rewards, or by other procurement: but by the will off the king, according
to the election off the clergy, and off the people, as it is contained in the
ancient canons, that the bishop should be ordained by consent of the
clergy, and of the metrapolita^, or him that he will appoincte, together
with the bishops of the same province. And after / Besides this according as
the old canons have decreed, no bishopp may be given unto the people against
their will: nether by oppression of mighty men, which is detestable, let the
cytisens, or clergy be drawn to give their consent. And thus much for
answer to yowr Councels.

To fetch a commandment out off the book off numbers, is to fetch yt out
off the higheste court off heaven: And I was not constreined unto it / for off
more then half a score reasons brewghte / whether one off them be once moved
by you / I leave it to be judged. This commandment pinched you so / that
albeit you pretend lawghter: yet I dowbte not but yt is Yt is an her be which
he that eats dies, but yet makes the countenance and show of one
Sardons lawghter / that is to say / from the teethe owtwarde. where you say
/ there is no word which signifies an election: yt is yowr old boldness / off
denying that which is as clear / as the none days. Where also you say / that
it speakinge off layinge on off hands, can make nothing for the election off
the church: I beseech you sir how do you prove / that Timothe has the choice
of ministers? is it not by these words / which lavvgheth. Pa. 160.
that he is bidden not to lay on his hands? and have you not said / that by
the layinge on off hands / the whole solemnity off creatinge ministers is
understood? this is fast and lose / and not only as Teconius said / that
that we will is holy: but when we Aug 2. li. cont. Lit. Pet. 13 c.
will / and as long as we will. Belike the laying on off hands signifies
nothing / or if it do / and not the consent off the people: Why doothe not
the Answ. tell us what?

And where he goes abowte to find some difference in this / and that which I
say off the layinge on of hands by the Eldershippe / and heroff besides the
peintinge off his mergente / speaks ones / twice / and the third time /
according to his old manner of repeticio^s: He purposely as seems / passes
by my answer to that objection / that not the people, but certain that is to
say the elders in the name off the people, did lay on their hands: as it is
to be seen in other places / where the governors in the Leuit. 4. 15.
name off all the people / lay on their hands upon the sacrifice for sin.
Where you will me to speak in good earneste: If I had only to do with such
a trifler / I would either answer nothing / or else as such a one is worthy:
but because I have to do with the church off God / for judgment off the
judicial / and Ceremonial law / and for proof off yowr untrue dealing: I
refer my selffe to In his 2. Tract. p. 120.
that I have said before.

Yff this I have alleged off layinge on off hands upon the ordained / be a
Ceremonial law / which took end by the coming off our Savior Christ:
then the Apostels were injurious unto his death / that translated that
Ceremony from the Jews under the law / into the church under the Gospel.
Therefore in this poincte you have to do with the Apostles / and not with me.
For as under the law the gouernoures / and the people consentinge into one
action / testified the same by layinge on off hands off the governors only:
so under the Gospel the elders / and people consentinge in the election off
one / do testify it by layinge on off hands off the Elders only.

Where you vvoulde prove yt abrogated / because yt yt is joined with other
things, which are abrogated: I have showed how that In 1. 3. P. 144.
is an engyne / to wreste owte off the hands off the church / all the moral
laws that ever were written. Where you say / there could be no election
off the people in the leuytes, for that God had chosen them: You might have
understood / that althowghe the tribe of Leuy only were used to the
ministry / yet all that tribe / was not applied that ways: but as many as
were thowghte enoughe to supply that office / and those also not at all
adventure / but by choice according to their ability. I fear not Master W.
the judgment off the greateste enemies I have / and friends you have / in
this cause: but that their own consciences shall witness withdraw me / off my
faithful alledginge off the scriptures, and off yowr either notable ignorance
/ or very evil conscience.

And in these iestes off yowres / and accusations off my byndinge men unto the
Ceremonial law / and bringinge them to Iudaisme, and fetchinge off a mandatum
out off the ceremonial law: Were you not a fraide by my sides / to thruste
thorowghe Cyprian? Who fetches his proof for the election off the ministry
by the Nom. 20. chap.
voice off the people / owte off the book off nombers / where mention is made
also off the preistes garments which was ceremonial. Or were you not
afraid thus to handle Master Calvin? His proof is fetched out off Leuiticus /
whose special argument 4. li. insti. 3. ca. s. 15.
is to handell ceremonies and might not I fetch a commandment out off
nombers / which has an other scope? He only upon that it was commanded /
that Moses should bring the Levites before the congregation, concluded that
the peoples consent ovvghte to be had, in the ministers choice: and was yt not
lawful for me having the same ground / and further also the commandment
that the people should lay on their hands / to conclude as much? He took
his place from thence / where nether in the chapiters before / nor in that owte
of the which he fetches this there is any thing but ceremonial: And was it
not lawful for me to take this sentence / becawse other things in this chap.
were ceremonial / but that I must needs be thus iested on / and my
discretion so greatly required / in handlinge the scripture? Therefore I say
that I citing this place am no more Jewish / then the Apostels / then Cyprian /
then Calvin.

Where I alleged for the establishing off that which he calls a mandatum
out off the ceremonial law, that the grovvnd of childrens baptism, stands
upon the ceremony off Circumcision: He answering that circumcision was a figure
off baptism, but that the Leuiticall priesthood was no figure off the
Ministry off the Gospel, is deceived. For certain things in the Ministry
off the law / were figures off things in the Ministry off the Gospel: as
their anointinge / signified that none may be admitted unto the 8. Leuit.
ministry off the Gospel / but those which have gifts meet for that
purpose / as our Savior Christ him selffe owte off Esai expounds yt. Even
their sacrifices (which off all other things are 4. Lu. 18.
furthest from the ministry of the gospel) shadowed out the mortyfyinge off
sin / by the sword off the word off God: that the mynisters might offer
the people unto God / an acceptable sacrifice throwgh Jesus Christ / as
appears by Saint Paul. And Romans 15. 16.
the laws off the leuiticall priesthood / are not only figures off our
ministry: but often times also / rules to direct yt by. therefore as off that
Aaron took not upon him the preisthood / before he was called off God / the
writer unto the Hebrews concluded / Heb. 5. 4.
the calling off our Savior Christ to his preisthood / so far different
from the preisthood off Aaron: so we conclude / that no man may put his foot
into the ministry / oneles he be called. These arguments if Master W. answer
be good / are avoided with a floute / that they be a mandatum owte off the
books off Leuiticus, and Nombers: that they carry us to Iudaisme, etc.

Yt is well the D. has not to do with the Anabaptists. For he is like
enowgh to betraie that cawse / which having so sure grounds in the
scripture* is here by him laid open / to their mockery. For he says / that
the 28. off S. Matthew is a general ground to prove the baptism off
Children: When our Savior Christ speaks there only off those which were
off discretion / as appears by that he bids them baptize those / whom they
have made scolers off Christ by their doctrine. And therefore for so much as
the Apostels could not teach children / nor could not make them disciples by
teachinge before their baptism: yt is manifest that he speaks not there off
childrens baptism. And this might he have learned for his use / in the same
book off Zuinglius / out of which he has taken so many things to no
purpose. And it is not only De baptismo. 2. Tom.
Master Zuinglius answer / but other learned men's which have had to do
with that sect. As for the promise alleged / that god is our God, and the
God of our seed, albeit that be the ground / whereupon the holy sacrament
off Baptism is ministered unto infantes: yet yt is not sufficient / without
addinge the commandment off God / touching the circumcision off young
children. For if the lord having given that promise unto Abraham / had
commanded no circumcision at all / or had only commanded yt to be given / to
those off discretion: yt had not been lawful for Abraham to have circumcised
his infantes / yet they should have remained under the promise. So that
whether You will / or no: we must come to reason from circumcision unto
baptism. Neither is that you allege / of Circumcision to have been a figure
off baptism, sufficient to deliver you out off the nets / vvherwith you
snare yowr self. For albeit yt be a figure off baptism: yet yt is aceremonie
/ and a principal part off the ceremonial law: and yowr answer is general
against all reasoninge from the ceremonial law / unto that which is
established under the gospel. Therefore I uphold still / that yovvr answers
here, and in other places / tend to spoil us off diverse pillars, and
principal buttresses off our religion.

Where he says / he condemnethe not other churches, which have Diuis. 8. page
169.
appoincted other orders of electing pastors: I report me to the reader /
whether the words be general / and whether the reasons he alleges for that
purpose / be likewise. Nether can the D. show any reason why in Geneua / why
in whole Dominions in Germany / Why in Scotland / in France also in the
time off their peace / this order off election by the consent off the people /
should be good / and pernicious in England. Which notwithstanding owghte to
have been showed / if there be any.

I expounded the word ovvght, as reason vvheroff the law is founded / and
experience which is often times the interpreter Cap. 5. page 170.
off the law / tawgte me / to show that where the consent off all can not
be had* there the thing should pass / by the most part of those which
have intereste. And where you affirm / that lawiers do say, that that
sentence is to be understood of compartners, or iointe tenantes in some
house, or possession, and not off the interest off bodies politic: I am well
content they be interpreters of the law which they profess / and therefore
if that be showed me / I will rest in that interpretation. But the reason
assigned / that it seldom comes to pas that they will all consent / semethe
not so strong: consideringe that there is not so great violence done unto the
words off the law / which may not be found in other places / if by the word
all, the most part be understood. Especially when allthowghe all do not
agree: yet all have had free voice in that matter.

And where you say / that even that law admits diverse exceptions: that is
not material. For I lay not so much weighte of this sentence / as thowghe
the cause should rise / and fall with it. I mente that as much credit might
grow unto the cause by this / as by a proverb which is true For the most
part: off which kind off reasons not only orators / but the scripture yt
self diverse times uses. And therefore if I gain by this law / that the
ordinary choice off ministers / owght to be by the people: I has at I looked
for. But yt is to be observed / that where the A found fault with me / for
mitigatinge the necessity off the word ought, by this exception if it may
be: he notwithstanding alleges four exceptions, whereby the necessity which
he says that word imports / is quite overthrown. And if those conditions
be true: then be like I did well understand the word ought, the
understanding wheroff he can not aforde me. Yt is well you be no lawier. For
you that are so liberal off a dinners talk / as to tell us off Many
together, and Many senerally, with so many exceptions to so small purpose: if
you had been studied that Pluribus vt vniuer sis, pluribus vt sin gulis.
ways / would have troubled us all. for then yt is like we should have had
always Caesar / for Christ / and Paul the lawier / for Saint Paul the
Apostell.

But mark what a trymme way he has found / to prove that the whole
parish chooses when / the bishopp only chusethe: that they are willinge to
have him / whom they are compelled whether they will or no / to receive. Yea
and not only that / but that every minister is chosen by the whole realm,
that is to say by those which never saw him / nor heard off him. But has he
forgotten first that it is our controversy / whether the parliament have done
well / in establishing off such an order off making ministers and whether
this egg off the bishops election / laid in propery / could by the sitting
upon off the Parliament (although never so godly) leese the poisoned nature it
had before. If that be not agreed / this devise that the people choose when the
bishop, bebecause yt was so ordained by all estates) serves not. This liberty
as has been showed / is a piece off the liberties which Christ has purchased
unto his churches / by the sheddinge off his precious blood: wherein they owght
to have stood / and which is no more lawful for them to alienate / or set over
to others: then to give away the inheritance of the kingdom of heaven /
whereunto this is annexed.

Moreover we speak off an election / wherein consent is to be given / as often
as the church is destitute off a minister: and he off consent ones given for
ever. We off an election which is passed / by all the howsholders off every
church: he off that which was passed / by a few burgeses in the whole
realm. We off a free election: and he off an election wherein yt is by yowr
leave / against yowr will. Now the Papists may clap their hands / for
against all the arguments that Master Calvin / Beza / Bullinger / Zuinglius
/ and others bring to prove / that the church ought to have right in the
election off their minister / and that yt belongs not to one bishopp to
choose a minister: they may answer / that the bishop chooses not but the church
/ yea the whole realm. For the prince / and the people / and the whole land
have given that power unto the Pope / and the pope to him: so that whatsoever
is done in that election by the bishop / is done by the people. But see how
I forget my self / which allege this unto him as a great absurdity / whose
case in this question / is all one with the Papists: yet even with him / it
shall be sufficient to untie the band, which we have bound our selves with,
onles he will have the election still continewe in the Popes hands.

And indeed he calls us here / to the consideration off our sins: whereby
we have thus prodigally wasted / and given into the hands of strangers / the
liberties which were bowght with so great a price. And we have better cawse to
think the earnestlier off them / for somuche as the Answ. lawgheth us to
scorn / and would make us believe that we consent to elections when we are
a sleep / that we choose those / whom we refuse: and so other eatinge the
kernels / he makes us not a diner / but a feast with the shells.

To all these accusations off the A. whereby he charge the Diuis. 2. page 101.
civil elections off bodies politic / if I should answer that The disorder
off the bishops election is such, the peace with Satan / and sin / and
contention with all goodness that has / and daily does issue by them into all
the parts off the Realm / so horrible / the ambition of the person standinge
in election so shameless / the corruption off some / the partial affection off
others to their kinsfolk, their servants / their servants free^ds / the
carelesnes of others / in some the wa^te of sufficient knowledge / in other
some of sincerity / and pureness of doctrine / to be short in all the want of
dew consyderatio^ of weightynes of that ministry / is so apparante: that as
that manner off election for necessary cawses / is altered in the best ordered
churches in Europe / so it is desired to be altered, in the church of England
/ by those which be wise, godly, and learned, and by those which love the
godly quietness, and prosperity off the church: and that experience cries
that those are the worthiest ministers / most apteste to set forth the glory
off God / must profitableste for the church / which are chosen with the
consent of the people: I say if I should answer thus / I dowte not but all
the world will witness with me / that I have iuster cause thus to speak off
the bishops elections off ministers: then the A. has to speak so
slanderously / off civil elections made by consent in towns / and cities.
God be praised this cause off discipline we maintain / has been / and by
Gods grace shall be vpholden / without towche off any lawful estate / or form
off government off commen wealth: but yt appears that the Answ. can not
maintain his cawse / without open oppugninge off one off them. And therefore to
keep the bishop in his throne / down must go all elections by many / and
by the same reason all trialls off controversies by many / all determinations
/ and judgments by many / and in a word the whole estate almost off our
commen wealth / must be removed. You ac^e us off confoundinge the commen
wealth / which you are never hable to prove: here you are taken in the very
act doing / not by conclusion / or implication / but by a flatt / and direct
affirmation. I dowbte not that wise men do see yowr folly / which being so
unskillful of the government of the church / the knowledge vvherof you do
profess: will take upon you as Phormio unto Haniball / to prescribe what
form of gouernemente / must be used in the commen wealth. And if it were
not beside my profession / I could show that it agrees most both with the
definition of a cytisen / which those give which handell this matter / and
with the practice off the best governed cities / that the cytisens should
have this intereste off choice off their Majors / and Bailifes: confirmed by
experience off dangerous seditions / and seperatio^s from the common wealth /
which have happened by abridginge the people off this / and such liberties.
But for somuche as yt belongethe not unto a divine / to meddle with those / but
to content him self with what form off gouernemente soever (so it be
lawful) thowght good to those / to whom the orderinge of that doothe perteine:
I leave to speak of that matter. But a man may smell the D. far off. For
this is put in for defense off that spoil / which he / and others by untrue
surmises / most unnaturally made in the university / when to the end the
Idleness / covetousness / and ambition of certain might be the more secure / and
without check they by their long / and crooked talones / seized upon the
authority off the University Senate.

But because he casts so scornefully away / those reasons which are
alleged by me: I would know what he will answer to Master Martyr / who
uses the same reason I have here / saying that it is no marvel, that the
church has this right to Upon 1. Cor. 16.
choose her ministers: saying the civil laws do give this power to
incorporate towns, to choose their Physicions, and Scolemaisters.

Where he says / that the multitude is for the most part ignorant, careless,
and oftentimes evil disposed, and commonly led by affection, hatred, fear,
etc. There is no vice which any one off the church is subject unto / but the
bishopp is subject unto the same. Nether i^ there any affection enemy unto a
good election / wheroff the bishop is not liker to be ouercomed: then either
the whole church / or the greateste part theroff.

What need this goinge abowte the bushe? I speak off the visible church /
called by the preaching off the gospel: not off those whose calling is yet
hydden / and folded up in Gods election. And of those I say / not as you (for
what can you else do:) untruely report / that they can not err in choosing
their pastor: but that they are not such: ignorant dottrels / as you would
make us believe / and such as have no taste to discern between good and bad /
holy and unholy. And this knowledge / and discretion off good and evil / is
not only in those which are effectually called: but in those also which have
only the outward calling / without the spirit off sanctification / and
adoption off the children off God. So that the pretense off such ignorance as
you speak off / can not fall into any which are off the visible church off
God. The D. could not hale in the corrupt interpretation off the pope in this
place / to help to make up his answer / but he must ascribe a notable
vntrewthe unto me / that I should go abowte to prove, that the church can
not err in the election off the minister. Where have I pretended any such
thing? or what need have I to prove that? As if I could no otherwise drive
the bishopp from this sole election / onles I could prove that the people can
not err in their election: Or as if bishops elections were without danger
off error / so that he which will change them / must be driven to seek for
such electors / as no error can take hold off. And if any bars were
strong enowghe / to keep yowr tongue from this untrue dealinge: my words which
follow by and by after / wherein I confess the church may err, had been
sufficient to restrain yt.

Against my reasons here be bare words / that the pastors are Diuis. 3. pa.
172.
never the worse loved, that are thruste upon them. I could have as well as
you alleged the experience in other places / if all men could have seen yt:
and have referred them to the manifold fi^tes in law between the pastor / and
the people in our churches. How often shall I tell him that the papists are
not the church / nor off the church off Christ: and therefore not to be
suffered / to have to do with the election off the minister? this needed he not
to have asked / if he had had his (to be short) which he repeteth so often /
in any commendation. He asks / whether men allwaies continue in love, off
those whom they have chosen. yt is easier to continue love / where love is:
then both to fall into love of him whom they could not away with / and also
to continue the course off that love still. And if the not seruinge off their
affections, breed hatered toward him whom they love: yt will much more make
yt flame against him / against whom yt was before kindled.

But still the A. imagines off the church as off dogs / and which
receiuinge meat at the hand off their pastor / turn again Mat. 7. 6.
upon him / and re^t him: and not as sheep which hear the voice off their
pastor. And althowghe there be some hypocrites vhhich do so: yet all the
church does not so. And therefore for their sakes / 10* John. 4.
and for the giuinge the deeper root off love in their hearts toward the
pastor: yt is meet that this way off free consent should be taken. As for
the Hypocrites / when they shall cease to love their pastors / for rebukinge
their faults: that shall be to the increase of gods glory. For So Much as they
are by so much more inexcusable before God: as they have refused his
admonition / whom they them selves chose for that purpose. And not that only /
but the hatred conceived off that dewtie off the minister / shall be bridled /
and holden in rather by ^^e remembrance off the judgment / which he once in
token off good will gave off him. For even the earthely / and natural man has
this in him / that whom he has once loved: him if he hate afterward / onles
yt be for some thing apparently worthy off hatred / he will be loathe to utter
it. And althowghe for that his manners please him not / he can not love him yet
lest he should appear inconstante / and deceived in his choice: he will
pretend to love him still. So that the consent off the church in the
election of the ministry / being profitable unto the godly / and those
which are true sheep / that their love may abound toward their minister
/ and in respect off the Hypocrites / and goats / that they may be more
inexcusable before God / and less hurtefull to men: these reasons stand still
untouched off the A.

Yt is an easy thing for M. D. Which neither proves / Diuis. 4. page 173.
nor improueth any thing by scripture / to ask by what scripture prove, that
if the parish choose an unfit minister: the ministers, and elders of the
churches should advertise, etc. The scripture I prove yt by is / that Saint
Paul when he teaches that all the faithful are members off one mystical
body off Christ / which owghte to have a mutual Romans 12. 12. 1. Cor.
care one off an other: laid the foundations off this polity. for as in the
body off one particular church / every faithful man compared with an other in
the same / is a member one off a another: so in a more general body off a
whole Realm / every particular church compared with other / is likewise
member of them. therefore as nature teaches my hand to help the disorder
which is in another part of my body: so the spirit of God owte of his word
/ throwghe a fellow feelinge teachetche one church to stretche owte her hand
/ to put a way as yt can / the evil which yt seethe approach unto another.
And therefore when the scripture wills Romans 15. 14. 3. Heb. 13.
that one should admonish another / it is not only a commandment to every
singular man / toward his fellow: but also to one whole company / toward
another society.

And off this care extended so far that one church has 2. Cori. 8. 23.
sent to admonish another / we have example in the epistle to the Corinthes:
where the Macedonian churches sent their ambassadors with Saint Paul's
Epistle / both to move the Corinthians to liberality toward the poor / and
to receive that which was given by the church unto their use. And this may
serve to prove / that one church owght to admonish a another: and therefore
also those which are next / as those which are fitteste for that purpose.

That from the admonition off the churches, yt is meet to come to synodes, if
the judgment off the churches be contemned: may beshewed Math. 18.
by proportion / from the place of our Savior Christ in Saint Matthew. For as
when one brother is not moved with the admonition of two / or three / the
matter must be referred unto the church / to see whether the majesty of it
will move him / whom the authority off two or three would not: even so it is
meet that the church / that makes light off the judgment off two or three
churches / should be pressed with the judgments off the diocese or province
/ as shall be in that behalffe advised. And if I were in this poincte destitute
off the word off God: yet the naked examples off the reformed churches / owght
to weighe down a popish custom.

And that the magistrate owghte to lay to his hand, if the admonitions take
not place: it is manifest by the reason which is alleged. I have looked
master Zuinglius Ecclesiast over, and over again. The sum wheroff is / that
none should take upon him any ministry / which is not called of some church
/ and of the ministers nere abowte / contrary to the practice off the
anabaptists: which entered into all churches / and sometime put the pastor
beside the pulpet / from which whether you / or we be further / let the
reader judge.

Where you say / that I forgett my selffe which suppose now the church may
err, that said before yt was spiritual, and judges all things: if you could
forget this untrue dealinge / I remembered my self well enowghe. These cauilles
which come so often / without any color off truth / are utterly unworthy off
answer: but as I have said in another place / require rather a censor / then a
disputer. Howbeit becawse there is nothing so unsavory / which some taste
may not be abused by. I have answered yt before.

There is nothing so easy which is not hard / to him that is unwilling. And
therefore the A as Salomons sluggard, says prou 22. 13.
that the Lion whose delighte is in the foreste / and in the wilderness / is in
the high streat, or in the burse: that is to say / makes difficulties where
none is. And as this partly comes of his unwillingness: so diverse of these
questions (if he do not dissemble) come of want off knowledge / not only of
the gouernemente of the churches now / but off all aunciete times. For he
asks / who shall complain off the fault committed in the election, to the
churches by? if the elders to whom that care especially apperteineth / do
not: others owght who^ that disorder offends. There needs no calling
together, and therefore no danger off tumulte, disorder, confusion, charges,
parts taking, runninge up and down, loss off time, offense, quarrels: yt is
enowghe that yt be done by the eldership off the churches and if were needful
to have the churches / whole consent: it might be done in ordinary meetinge
for the service of god / without any of those things which the D. imagines.
The churches may admonish by their several / or common letters emo^geste
the^. But ask me not who shall carry the letter / what he shall have for his
pains / whether he shall ride / or go a foot: which you might as well / as
those fond questions which you have moved.

It is meet the provincial Synodes be certain / and standinge / as often
also as may be conveniently: and it was ordained as I think in one of the
Africane Councels / that their should be at the least / two or three every
year. So there shall be as spedie provision off a pastor for the church / in
such cases off difference: as now when they be without a pastor six whole
months. For the questions who shall summon the Synodes, and in what place
they shall be holden: they perteine not to this question / onles the A. will
have no Synodes at all. for if he admit them: the sum^oner / and the place
which are meet for the assemble generally / and for the decidinge off all
causes which fall into the consideracion off the Synod / are meet also for
this cause. And where he asks what if the prince do not his duty: then yt
is as if there were no godly magistrate / then yt is with them as if such a
disorder should happen under an unchristian prince: and then the people shall
perish in their sins / but their blood shall be required at his hand. But
still the A. seethe not how he reasons against him self. For if none of
the bishops off the foresaid parishes / none off the elders / neither those
bishops and elders which emongeste the rest / and in the name off all are
chosen as the flowers out of the province / and sent to the Synod / nor the
magistrate / I say if none off all these / nor all these together do their
duty: how shall we think that the bishopp will do it? And if he do yt in
appoinctinge a fit bishopp for the parish / and the parish will not admit
him / but take one which is unmeet off their own choice: what remedy has he
/ when he is forsaken off the magistrate? Thus as shortly as I could / I have
answered this legion off questions: and if my answer in speakinge off things
so commen / be tedious: take thy self good reader unto the A. which merueileth
at them / as if they came out off India.

Where he says / I thus appointe the Prince a good office: I have showed that
the scripture appoints yt / and not I: and it is the most honorable office
which the Prince can have / to see the churches be kept in good order: nether
takes yt any thing from the royal estate that he must obey / and serve the
lord. And where he says / by this means the Prince must stand, and look
on all this while, and in the end lay to his hand: I answer / that whereas
these ways off admonition by the churches / and Synod are sent before his
authority: yt serves not only for the ease off the magistrate / whilst that
after this sort oftentimes / the difference is ended before it come to him:
but also agrees better with the manner off Physic / which owght to be used in
such diseases. For that which may be conveniently won with a word /
should not be gotten by the sword: and that which may begotten to be done
with conscience / should not be essaied by compulsion. Yowr slander (that we
give no more to the cyuill magistrate, then the papists) so often repeted / is
already / and god willing shall be more / apparante. Yt is also a notable / and
an impudente slander / that the Magistrate must only at the commandment of
the seniors, execute such laws as they have devised: where as we hold / that
if all the bishopes / and elders in the realm / would decree unlawful things
/ the Prince owght to make them void: and that he may / and owght to punish
all ecclesiastical persons / which walk disorderly. Likewise yt is a fond
dream / of surcharginge the Prince with these matters: as thowgh the Princes
authority / necessarily derived unto diverse in every shire / for other
affairs off government / may not likewise depart also this care unto them.

Therefore if you have no better exceptio^s then these: I am not afraied / still
to commit my reasons to the judgment / not only of the godly / which rest in
authority of the word / but even off the wise / and reasonable man / which
makes his account of likelihoodes.

These high words / that he remembers no learned writer new nor Chap. 6. pa.
165.
oulde, which denies that there were few professors of the gospel in the
Apostels times, in respect off those profess now: what have they beside a
crake? And in respect off the oulde writers / yt is absurdly said. For how
could they compare the number of the professors of our times, with those which
were in the primitive churches / onles they should prophecy: saying they were
dead long before? And makes yt for you / if the new writers do not deny
this? If it he no good reason from the scripture negatiuely, in those things
which yt professes to speak off: is it good from other vvriters / and from
one part off them / in things which they make no profession of* I looked
therefore you should have browghtesome / which by affirming that you say:
might if not make it true / yet at the least seem true. I could off yowr
challenge take occasion / to bring all the peregrination off Saint Paul /
declared in the Act. Epistles / and especially in the 15. Romans drawn to my
hand / by which appears that he for his part only / had caused the Gospel
to sound in more then half off the world. I could also fetch in Eusebius. and
Jerome / which testify what the other Apostels did Lib. 3. c. r Iero. ad
Marcell.
for their part. I propounded that which I said without proof, because the
things are manifestly known / and such as can not be denied: you affirm
withowte all proof that in controversy / and wheruppon yowr cause in yowr
judgment depends / that no one part off the world, no one city, no one
the least town, received the gospel wholly in the Apostles time.

If I should suffer you to go away with this great / and ungrounded sainge:
yet thereby can not be concluded / that there are more Christians now in a
part off Europe, then was throwghoute the world in the Apostles time. But I
require proof of that you set down so precisely / not only because I think
you can not warrant yt by any: but also because I have somewhat to except
against Act. 8.
yt. For yt may appear that Samaria did wholly receive the gospel. For beside
that yt is recited / that with one accord the multitudes gave heed unto that
Philipp said: S. Luke declaringe in the 10. and 11. verses / that all that
were in Samaria from the little to the great / were bewitched with the
inchaunmentes off Simon: adds in the 12. verse / that when they believed they
were baptized. This having relation unto that which goes before / which is
that all were abused by the magycian: yt follows that the whole city
received the gospel. Whereunto may be referred 9. Luke 53. 4. Ioh. 9.
the emulation between Jerusalem / and Samaria: whereby yt came to pass that
the gospel thruste out off Jerusalem / was both easelier / and more generally
received in Samaria. Likewise that yt is said in the 13. verse / that even
Simon him self off al Act. 8:
other most untoward / believed: and that in the 14. ver. that Samaria had
received the word off God, and not many in Samaria / Act. 14. 1 and 21. and 17
4.
as he speaks off other places / where the Gospel was but in part received.
If one except / that it is not like every singular person turned / at the
preaching off Philip: I answer that in such straight signification of all /
there shall be at this day found no kingdom / and almost no city which
has received the gospel. But if the whole profession off the gospel / be
esteemed off that which is done by the body / and state of the city: yt
seems that the words off Saint Luke will bear owte / a whole / and
general profession at the least off the most part / which you deny. And if
it be true that Eusebius. vvriteth / we have a manifest testimony off the whole
receiving off the gospel in the 2. li. 1. ca.
city off the Edissens / which was won unto the Gospel by the preachinge
off Thaddeus / sent to king Agbarus by Thomas the Apostell: off whom yt is
written / that he browght all to the knowledge of the gospel / and that the
whole city of the Edissens, having at that time given her name unto the
profession off Christ, so continued unto the time wherein Eusebius vvrote.

Where you vvoulde seem to say some great matter / when you add not at
Jerusalem: yt is as much as if you should say / that no town received the
gospel / because Jerusalem the most murderinge town in the whole world /
did not: whose rebellion / and for it destruction / being foretold off our
Sau. Christ / must needs follow. For touching the Apostles abode there / it
was not for the hope off any plentiful harvest to be reaped in that city: But
partly for that the Jews / unto whom they were sent to preach first / had
their concourse thither from all corners of the world: partly to fulfill the
prophecye / off the sound of the gospel from Syon / into all parts of the
world: and thirdly to prepare a readier passage / for his heavy judgments to
Esa. 23.
come upon that city.

That also also which you add / that the tenthe part off the inhabitans off
Ephesus, Antioche, and Rome, was not Christian in the Apostles times: is only
said / and it is much for you to speak so largely off the tenthe / not hable
to prove the fyueth / or third. And althowghe yt can not be certainly known /
what number of beleuers were at these places: yet it may be by all likelihood
showed / that it is vntrwe especially off the two first. Of Antioche we read
/ that when they which were scattered by persecution moved in Act. 11. 20. 21.
Jerusalem / preached there: the hand off the Lord was with them, and a
great number beleuinge turned unto the lord. And in the 24. verse yt is said
/ that at the preachinge off Barnabas / there was a great multitude added unto
the lord. And yet in the 26. verse yt is declared / that afterward Barnabas
procuringe Saint Paul's coming thither / they both together abiding there by
the space off one whole year / tavvght a great multitude. Here is mention off
three great multitudes / which at several times were turned unto the lord in
that city: and how dare you yet say / that al these were not the tenth part?
Of Ephesus also it is written / that the fruicte off S. Paul's preaching there
by the space of two years / was so great / that the books off those which
had exercised curiouse / and unlawful arts / were bourned in the sight off
all men: which could not be done without great danger unto the church /
onles the greatest part off Act. 19. 19. ibid. 27.
the city had believed. Which may yet more appear / for so much as Demetrius
the siluersmythe / affirms that the art of making shrines, and Dianas
temple, was in danger to be set at nothing.

And as the A. is to narrow / in esteming the fruicte of the Apostles preaching
/ accompanied with such power off miracles / and diversities off gifts off
the holy ghost / whereby were gathered greater nombers off professors off the
gospel / then now by the simple preaching off the word: so in his account
off the number off professors off the Gospel now / he is marueilously lauishe.
For where are those whole contreis, nations, and kingdoms which profess
Christ? If he take in the Papists to make up his reckuinge / they will not be
received. For we speak off the church off Christ / and off those which
embrace the gospel: and so himself had put yt in his answer to the
admonition. The papists therefore / which pretendinge the name of Christ /
persequute the gospel / are the Synagogue off Satan / and must in this
accounte off Christians / be shut owte: howsoever by changing off the
professors off the gospel, into those which profess Christ, you would seem
to wind them in The mixture which was in the Apostels times / off professors
off the gospel / with those which were professed enemies unto yt / being yet
in those kingdoms you speak of: you are so far from shewinge / that the
multitude off professors off the gospel in Europe / is greater now then yt was
in then in all Asia / Afric / and Europe: that you do not so much as show
/ that the number off Christians in Europe yt self / is now greater then in
time off the Apostles.

When it is said / that the whole church assembled for election: all men know
that thereby is mente / that particular company off professors off the gospel
/ which dwellinge nighe together / make one assembly: and therefore that you
write off the impossibility, off gathering all the church scattered throwgh
out the whole world into one place, is but a mere daliance. You say / they
might well meet withowte confusion in the Apostles times, which can not be
nows: the reason you assign / in the fewnes in one place off the professors
then, and multitude now. Althowghe yt be granted that there are more now in
the cities / then were then: and that be given you too / that the multitude
owghte to change the form off elections (neither wheroff you are hable to
show): yet yt still fallethe owte against you. For allbeit there be more
professors in a city then were: yt follows not / that there are more
belonginge unto one assembly / then there were the^. Wherein I will go no
further / the^ to the example of the church / which you allege to have chosen
the deacons: where could hardly be less then six thowsande persons / seeing
that at the second sermon of Saint Peter / there being five thowsande / it
is affirmed afterward that multitudes 4. Act. 4. 5. Act. 14.
off men / and weomen were added. Now where shall you have lightly in the
cities which profess the gospel / one only church of so many thousand
persons? considering that for the greater commodity of meeting / and governing
the whole mass off Christians in one city / yt is divided into several
churches / as it were flocks into several feedinges. And if you vvoulde have
proved any thing / you should not have considered how the number off
Christians are increased in their cities: but how they are increased in their
churches. And so you should have found that by your own reason / the
elections in the time off persequution / owghte rather to have been made by one
/ and the electio^s now / by many: saying in persequuted churches / for vva^te
off the commodity off dividing them selves into proportionable assemblies: the
number being more / the danger off tumulte / and confusion / must by yowr
own saying be greater.

You say yt is a very good reason / that because the church was under the
cross, therefore yt was few in number in comparison: but you answer not the
authority which I alleged / touching the Exo: 1. 12.
increase off the children of Israel / more under the cross / then in
prosperity. The reason you add / off many hypocrites in the peace of the
church, has small force. For that there are in persequuted churches many
hypocrites / may appear by the Israelites / which dred in persequution / made
often rebellions in the wilderness: likewise by the complaints off S. Paul /
that al sought their own not Phi. 2. 21. 2. Tim. 1. 15.
Christ's / that al were turned from him.

That one example only / is hable to overthrow that which you put so
generally: yet yowr one example off London, is not hable to confirm your
purpose: yt serves you therefore for a pinche at the city / and for no reason
off yowr cawse. And albeit the backslyding from the Gospel / was throwgh the
realm very horrible in Queen Mary's days: yet there is no cause to pick
London owte as the worste / saying there were great nombers there / which with
hasarde off all they had / and of their lives / frequented assemblies where
the word off God was truly preached / and the Sacraments purely administered:
the like meetinges being rarely found in other places / no (to our own shame
be yt spoken) not in the university / where of most right / they should have
been.

What gain you by that the church was diminished in Jerusalem? saying the
decrease of one church / was the increase off diverse other / whereunto those
off Jerusalem adioined them selves. Therefore you conclude not well / in sainge
that particular churches by persecutions are diminished, because one church
off Jerusalem was so: no more the^ you can say / that a man has a white head
/ because he has one white hear on his head. but I may rather say / that
by persequution the particular churches are increased / for somuche as Samaria
/ and other churches were by that flight of Jerusalem / partly adorned with
teachers / partly augmented in disciples. And thereby is confirmed that I have
set down / off the merueilous spawne off the church under the cross: both
becawse every one driven from Jerusalem / was as good seed which browght his
hundredth / or fifty fold: and for that after Jerusalem was delivered of that
birthe / she conceived again / and browghtforthe (as may appear) a greater
number then before. 21. Act. 20


What are my words vverby I affirm / that the churches in time off
persecution meet often, and keep together? yt is that I precisely deny.
Verily this is too homely rhetoric / to affirm I say / that which I
manifestly deny. And althowghe it be more clearer then the son^e / that a
smaller number may better know one a another / then a great: those which dwell
nere one to a another / then that dwell far of / and scattered: those which
meet oftener / then which meet seldomer: yet the A. dowbteth not to say /
that the contrary of this is a known trwthe. Where he alleges for proof /
the often conference, and trial off every one before they be received: For the
first / yt may be easelie understood / that saying yt is dangerous for
them to meet together / godly polity doothe teach them / to break their
companies as soon as they may conveniently. And therefore the public action
ended / off preaching / prayinge / and receiving the Sacraments: the
conference which may be / and is commonly in the churches peace / one withdraw
another / throwghe fear off the danger / which may come off being seen man
it together / is cut off. As for the knowledge by trial off those which are
received into the church / if he knew that yt comethe only off the report
off two / or three / which give testimony off those which are to be received:
and that yt extends not to any understanding given to the church / off his
gifts either of teaching / or government / but only that he is a faithful
man: I say if he knew these things / or knowing the^ would acknowledge them:
there should be no cause upon confidence off that trial / to fasten such
knowledge one of a another, in a church persequuted.

Before I further answer the D. reason / touching the change Diuis. 2. page 177.
Hosius de Sacram. ordinis cap. 54.
of the manners of the Christians in times off peace / from that they were
under persequution: understand good reader / that this is the very reason off
the archpapist Hosius / against the election off the church: which affirms
that there is greater gravity / and constantie in the Christians under
persequution / and therefore that this manner off election by the bishop / was
browght in. now to Hosius / and the D. I answer / that when wickedness breaks
into open actions / then they are no more Hypocrites / but openly wicked / and
such as owght not only be taken heed off: but without speedy amendment /
removed. I grant yt is no shame to the churches to have Hypocrites / for
as much as the judgment off man can not discern them / and off them and none
Math. 13. 29.
other is the parable off tares / which forbids weeding until the day off
harvest: and they are only those which can not be rooted owte. But to say
that beside those which are corrupt in religion, yt is full off dronkardes,
whoremongers, etc. Yt is more then ever S. Paul reproched any the most
diffigured churches / he wrote unto. For how many such persons as be found
in her: so many botches has she / which do not only stain her beauty / but
put her in hazard off her liffe. And if Saint Paul for one unclean 1. Cor.
5. 2
person / thowght that all the Corinthians had good cause of mourning: ryuers
off tears in every man's head / are not sufficient for us to bewail / the
estate which Master D. tells us we be in: which by his saying / have few
sober / few chaste / etc.

I leave to the reader how evil the three places off Saint Matthew / are
patched up together: and how there is never a one off them / which proves
that he takes in hand / that there be in the church open offenders / which
can not be rooted owte. I give warning only to the simple reader / that the
A. being deceived in interpretation off the parable off the sower / do not
also deceive him. For there is nothing les meant / then that where one hearethe
the word profitably, three do the contrary, which is both courious / and
uncomfortable: only he shows / that off four kinds off hearers / one only
receives fruict: but off the number off those which hear fruictfully / or
otherwise / not a word. And it may be for any thing our Savior Christ
sets down / that in some places / that one sort of men which hear with
fruict are more in number / then all the other three which hear without
fruict. If we should say that there is no church where such faults be /
or that for such faults we should make a departure from the church: these
charges off Anabaptistrie which sound so often / and so full in your mouth^ /
might have place. But that it is an Anabap^istic^l cauil to say / that the
multitude and swarm off known / and open faults / argue want off good
government / and wholesome discipline in the church: you are never able to
show / nether yowr self by argument / nor owte of Master Bull. or any other
godly writer. Shall there be no end off this unfaithful dealing? Where in a
syllable is yt said / that the gospel can not be syncerely preached where
great corruption off manners does appear: yet whilst you confute this / You
vvoulde make men believe that we affirm yt.

When I say there be no known drunkardes / or whoremongers in the church: I
speak off that which should be / unto which meaning the tenure off my
disputacion would have led you / if you had been willinge to follow. For you
opposinge that for a bar unto the peoples election / theffecte off my answer
was: that yt is not meet to take advantage off this / that there be many such
dronkardes / and whore mongers: saying they both may / and owghte either be
browght to repentance / and so are none such as they were / or thruste owte of
the church / and so not hinder the election. This my meaning was clear / and
the man^er of speech if it had been simply considered / withowt circumstances
restraining to this meaning / is such / as the scripture does admit. As when
Paul says / that the churchs of God have no coustome 1. Cor. 11. 16.
to co^tende: he sets forth not that which always comes to pas but what
owghte to be always. For it may be that contention may co^tinew in a church
many years: and yet it not cease to be the church of God. The prosperity of
the Gospel / sheilded by authority of the Christian magistrate / draws by
no necessity with it / such abundance of wicked as you suppose. for
althowghe hypocrisy may be more then under persequution / yet known
wickedness / of whoredom / dronkennes / etc. may be easilier purged out Psa.
101. 8. Pro. 20. 8.
off the church / under a Christian magistrate. So that the swarm off such
wickedness under the Christian magistate / more then when there was none / is
not the fault off the time / but off the gouerners off church / or commen
wealth / or both. As for hypocrites / I have showed that there is not so
great danger in them: consideringe that their owteward doings are the same
with the children off God / and the difference is only in the heart. Which
althowghe you deny: yet my reason drawn of the nature off an hypocrite / you
do quite pass by.

That which you call the prosperity, might well be called Diuis. 3. page
178.
the cross / and whip of the gospel: if it drew such a tail off sin /
as you suppose. For if under a Christian Magistrate / either always / or for
the most part / not only the number off hypocrites / but of barefaced / and
known wicked / should be multiplied: and not that only / but the good them
selves should wax worse: that time might peradventure after a sort / be
called the prosperity of those which profess the gospel: but how the gospel
may be said the^ to prosper / which is so many ways plucked down / I can
not understand. And this is clean contrary to the fruictes of peace / which
the scripture declares. The Prophet as soon as he Nah. 1. ca. 15.
had spoken of peace / which should be published amongst the Jews: adds
that Judah should then keep her solemn feasts, perform her vows, because
the wicked enemy off the church, was cut off. Whereby he doothe not only
show / that the end off the peace of the church / is to serve god more wholly
then before: but also that the peace gave them more commodity off seruinge off
God / then they could have in time of persequution. And if you reply that so
it should be / but it is not: the answer is / if it be not so / yt is throwghe
the great / and inexcusable fault off all / and gouernoures especially:
which having more means to intertaine all godliness / suffer it to go to
vvracke.

But that peace off it self is an aid to godly increase / and confirmacion
off the church: yt is manifest / by that all the churches in Jury, Galile,
and Samaria, being in peace were edified, Act. 9. 31.
and vvalking in the fear off God, were multiplied. Now if they in the time
off peace multiplied / having no further aid of the magistrate / then that he
hurt them not: what condemnation shall yt be / if our churches which have
assistance off the magistrate / cannot uphold them in that fear off God / but
they must fall into such riote / as the A. supposes? And if multiplying off
open wickedness / and decrease of former godliness were so general / and so
incident to the peace off the gospel / as you pretend: there is no cause why
we should pray so earnestly / and often for it / nai rather there should
be good cause / off praying against it. For when it is given us of God /
partly for our ease / and especially for the glory of God in increase of all
virtue: the chief part which is the glory off God / being by you shut
owte: there is no cause why we should pray for the other. Yowr reason of
having a better fealinge in the time off persequution, then in the peace of
the gospel, is very insufficie^te: especially to that you use it unto / off
prouinge greater plentithe off knowledge in time off persequution / then in
peace. considering that those wicked which never were in persequution / nor
have that spirit which is often times sharpened / and quickedned by
persequution: know notwithstanding the mysteries of God / as the children of
God them selves. And althowghe the persequution should give some advancement
to knowledge that ways: yet it hinders more otherways / in that it lets
the often meetinges to hear the word of God / vvherby knowledge is bredd: in
that also poverty (where with it is continually yoked) draws many cares for
this present life / for them / and theirs. Likewise continual fear they be in
/ even duringe the time of their meetinges for the word off God (enemy unto
the understanding / and puttinge to flighte the powers of the mind / vvherwith
knowledge is gotten) and also the often / and soudein shiftinges from place /
to place: must needs be a let to that tainment off knowledge / in the word
off God. Where you call upon answer unto your reason: you have it / that the
time off peace drawethe no more ignorance in the professors off the gospel /
then the time of persequution: and therefore the difference between these times
in that poincte / to be evil assigned. I alleged also / that the elections
off the bishops were so evil and of so unfit persons / that althowgh the
election off the church should swerve much: yet it can hardly choose worse
/ then the bishopes do / whereunto you answer not.

The distinction of being of the church, and in the church, I browghte / and
allowed of it: yet as thowgh you had browght Diuis. 4. page 179.
it / and I refused it / you labor in confirmation of it. But that which
needs yowr help / and for proof whereof I ask some testimony of scripture
/ that Idolaters, and papists are in the church, is not proved. As for
dronkardes / and whoremongers / 2c. Yt is spoken off before: close papists /
and Atheistes which dissemble their wickedness / are in the number off
Hipocrites / and therefore must be holden to be in the church / until the Lord
discover them. For professed Papists / and Atheistes / which never made
profession off the gospel / it is not needful to wait for the sentence off
excomnnication to cut them of / saying they were never of the church. If
notwithstanding their professed enemitie unto the gospel, they should be
accounted off the church, because they agree to hear the word and receive the
sacrament with us: then a Turcke / or a Jew professinge his Turkisme / or
Iudaisme / if he be contented to hear the word / and receive the Sacrament /
is so also to be accoumpted. Which if it be absurd / it can be no good reason
to say / that they owghte therefore to be holden off the church / because they
are in some respects content to he are the word / and receive the
Sacraments.

And I vvoulde gladly learn / where the Lord has willed us / so to cast
away the use of our judgment / that when men make open profession that they
are members off the body of the Pope / which is Antchriste / yet we must
accounte off them as off members off Christ: or how this is to judge justly.
You 7. Ioh. 14.
are very unfaithful in reporting my words continually. I nether say / that
Hypocrites only are in the church, and not of yt: and the place in the margent
/ I allege to another purpose then 1. Cor. 5. 12.
you affirm / that is / to prove that the papists / and Idolaters being
vvithowte / have not to do with the church / nor the church with them. where
you would prove by those words / if any brother be an Idolater, that
Idolaters may be in the church: you must understand / first that it is one
case off him that has given his name to the gospel / and afterward slydeth
from that profession to Idolatry: and another of him which never gave it /
but has been from his infancy an Idolater. For althowghe the first can not
be severed from the church / withowt solemn sentence of excommunication /
because by a public profession off the trwth / he was once received into the
body thereof: yet there is not like reason off him / which was never so settled.
And this difference Saint Paul does make / when he gives leave to a
Christian to 1. Cor. 5. 11.
have to do with an Idolater of the world / that is which has not been of
the church: and yet will not suffer him to have to do with one / which is
famously known (for so the the word signifies) (...).
to be a brother. Wheruppon follows / that forsomuche as our Idolaters
professinge their popery still / are not / nor can not be famously known for
professors off the gospel: this place of S. Paul opens no door for them /
to enter into the church.

Furthermore yt must be observed / what kind off Idolatry yt is / which
Saint Paul says may fall into a brother / and yet he retain the name of
brother. This appears upon the discourse 1. Cor. 8. and 10.
he makes in that Epistle / to have been only a sittinge down to eat at the
feast of Idolaters / made in honor of their Idols / withowt any honor done
to idols by sacrifice / or bodily worship / and vvithowt any conscience of
that meat more then of other. Which althowghe he prove a spice of Idolatry:
yet was yt one of the leasie / and lighteste kinds / and such as holdinge still
the foundacione off Christianity / could not vvithowt obstinacy in it / cut
from the church. Whereby fall the owte / that the papists which in their
Idolatry raze the foundations of true religion / can not by that place / come
into any accounte off the church off God.

For the first place off Master Calvin / that there are in the Church
contemners off God, and which live dissolutely: if the S. had added the next
words that such ovvght with all diligence to be taken away by
excommunication: he might have been as hamed / to allege this sentence to so
small purpose. The other that Saint Paul means the absteining from a
disordered 1. Cor. 5. 11.
brother off private society / and not of the public communion: yt is true
in deed but to no purpose. For withal he confesses / that the other owght to
be severed from the communion. But forasmuch as it is not in the power of a
private man to excommunicate / that perteining (as he says) unto whole body
off the church / by whose consent yt owght to be done / and yet in his power
to keep him self from his private society: he concludes against the Anabapt.
which absteined from the holy communion if any living offensiuely were received
/ that it followed not because S. Paul would have one abstain from private
familiarity / therefore he would have him abstain from the communion. Which is
no part off our question / and is too shamefully alleged / considering that
the place making nothing to this question / strikes starcke dead another off
his cawses / towching the sole excommunication of the bishopp. And althowghe it
be owte off place / yet having gotten the book / yt shall not be unprofitable
/ to admonish the reader off the S. unfaithful dealing in his former
allegations off Master Calvin / for where pa. 81. he to conclude that the
discipline is not of the substantial notes of the church / alleges a
sentence out off this book: beside that I have showed how evil he concludes
off his words / it is to be noted that in the same book he affirmethe
precisely / that the discipline is required to the substance off the church
only he denies that which the Anabaptist. held / that there was no church
/ where there was no excommunication. Likewise pa. 90. where he would make us
believe / that excommunication 19. Math is not by Master Calvin judgment
understood off public offenses / May. Caluins declares only that those
private admonitions / do not belong unto public offenses: but that those
public offenders ought to be excommunicated / if they rest not in the
churches Judgment / and consequently first complainned of to the church
(Which are two off the Ecclesiastical censures / mentioned in that place off
S. Matthew) he does more then once or twice affirm. Now leuing the D. in his
threchery let us return. if al were trwe you allege here (as they are very
vntrwe) yet they help not. For you will not deny / but dronkardes /
whoremongers / papists / etc. owghte either to be driven to repentance / or
owte off the church: which whether soever come to pass / takes away the
inconvenience you allege / against the election off the church. So that onles
you mean to nourishe them in the church / as bandogges to keep owte this
election: this bar against it / is easily removed.

It is appointed unto the magistrate by the word off God / that he should not
only provide that his subjects live paceably / one with another: but also
and that especially / to see that they 2. Tim. 2. 2.
having the trwe knowledge of God / may serve him as he has prescribed. This
way off gathering them to the next parishes / seemed unto me fitteste to be
used in that case: if you can show better / mine shall give place. Only
therefore I made mention of it / to show that the impossibility which you so
often cast in the teeth of the reformacion / can have no place: if they
continewe incorrigible / I have before showed that yt is the commandment of
God unto the magistrate / to use cutting / and burning / and nether to suffer
God to be dishonored in them / nor the rest off his subjects infected. If
they can be discerned for dogs or swine, which are not only filthy (in
which regard I called dronkardes / etc. Swine) but also tread the word
under their feet: then I grant / he which has that judgment off them
assured by the testimony of the spirit of God / owghte not to teach them.
But this comes owte of time. For I made no mention off dogs / and the name
off swine I gave not to the papists / but to filthy livers: and yt
ouerturneth yowr purpose: for if they may not hear the word / much less
can they be off the church. The preventing off an objection / is no digression:
whether yt be frivolous, the judgment shall be with the reader.

I took the likeliest signification off yowr word established: Diuis. 5. pa.
181.
which is / surely grounded withowte remove / and which has all the parts
off a church: now I see that by (established) you mean allowed by the
magistrate. Althowghe I have showed before by story / that there were churches
then / which had maintenance of the magistrate: yet as in a matter that nether
hurts me / not helps you / I will not strive. speak of the church visible /
standing off good / and evil / of the owtwarde government of the church /
which stands in administering off the word / and Sacraments / and exercise
of all parts off church discipline: and that I have showed to have all her
parts / althowghe not all her ornaments. Which I did not withowt reason
annexed / against which comes nothing but a bare affertion / and a charge
off ignorance off that distinction, which I my self did first propounde.
towchinge this that the cyuill magistrate is not the head off the church / yt
falls into the question of the Archbishop / where it shall be (god willing)
handled.

That he says that the state off the church was in the Apostles time
popular: by his own judgment (which gives the name unto the form of
government, of that part which most rulethe) is vntrwe. for the State off the
best, did bear the greateste rule: considering that there were matters
belonginge unto the church done by the eldershipp / whereat the people were not
/ nor could not by any conuenience be present / yet there was nothing in
which the peoples Judgment was required / wherein the Eldershipp was not both
present / and president. And this saying off the D. that the people in the
Apostels times, had to do almost in every thing: is directly contrary to
that he has before discoursed. For to the Admo. and me opposing the places off
the Acts / where Act. 1. 14: 15.
things were done either by voice / or consent off the church: his answer has
been / that the church had nothing to do there / but only in the election
off the Deacons / and that popularitie he Act. 6.
affirms to have been / not in respect that the church was under
persequution / as here in this place: but for a special cause off contention /
then in the church. Now I would gladly know of Master D. What are those
places off scripture / whereby he will prove that the most things in
government / were done by consent off the people: if those places we hau^e
alleged / do not prove yt. That which you ad / off the conuenience that
nothing should be done in the church, withowte the consent, and knowledge of
the magistrate: yowr addition takes nothing from the consent of the church.
For the magistrates consent / and the churches are not at war: but one may /
has / and does stand well with the other. Because the recytall of a 100.
differences is unprofitable: I leave yt in the readers judgment / how trwly /
and withowte brag, or figure I have spoken. But if for a 100. there were
1000. yet yowr cause should be never the better / onles you can show / that
those differences pull with them / a necessity off change off the form off
election: which you nether do / nor can.

That one church should admonish another, and that there are Diuis. 6. Page

many Hypocrites under persequution, is before showed. Off wicked ministers
which had their followers / and lovers in the churches of God / which
notwithstanding kepinge the profession off the gospel / were in danger off
the laws of the contreis where they dwelte / is spoken off almost throwghe
all the epistles off Saint Paul. yea yt may appear throwgh owte the whole
course of the ecclesiastical stories / that many churches of Heretics partly
Arians / partly Nestorians / and especially of the Nouatians / were persequuted
/ and banished of heathen Emperors / together with the catholic church of
Christ. And it appears plainly / by that which has been of both parts
alleged owte of Cypr. that certain churches abowte him / did choose unmeet
ministers. Therefore Master D. does wounderfully forget him self / when he
says / that yt is not like that the church in persequution will choose an
unmeet, or wicked mynister or that they which suffer persequution for the
gospel, do yt allwaies off conscience, or off good conscience / wheroff the
question is. And if he will admit none off these proses / yet if he stand
unto his exposition off the parable of the sower in the 13. of Saint Matthew /
for so much as (according to his saying) for one in the church which hears
profitablie, three do the contrary: yt must follow that even in the
persequuted church / there must be thrice as many evil / as good. Onles
peradventure he will say / that our S. Christ spoke that off the estate off
the church in time off the civil magistrate / which was spoken off the whole
estate off the church / unto the worlds end: and especially to that present
church / which was under the cross.

Is it true which you here affirm? can yt not be otherwise in the time off
persequution, but that church offices must be chosen by common consent? How
comes then to pass / that you deny the election Acts 1. and 14. to have
been made with the consent off the church? How happens yt that you affirm /
that Timothe. and Titus off their own authorities, withowt the consent either
off eldershipp / or people appoincted ministers unto the churches, in Ephesus,
and Creata? that in Cyprians times (which were times of persequution) the
election was made in some places vvithowt the people? verily he had need be a
very kun^ing ioiner / which should set the^ together for the impossibility
which you imagine / yt is not such but that if the commodity of the church /
and the institution off God had so suffered: the churches would have submitted
them selves / and their voices in their elections / unto the order of one. And
besides that christian humility / and love off advancing the trwth for which
they had forsaken all / would have let them to that submission there was
Ecclesiastical discipline to drive them unto it. Onles they would rather
quittethe church / which lightness doothe not agree with the zeal / which you
(for yowr advantage) ascribe unto a persequuted church.

Here he denies that he has said, that the consent off the church in Cap.
6. Diu. 7. p. 184. etc.
the choice off the minister, can not stand with the time off the Christian
magistrate. All the reasons which he alleged are to prove / that the election
under a Christian magistrate / can nor be safelye / and conveniently committed
unto the church: and eue^ here he says / it is in these times pernicious, and
hurtful. But that which can not be safely / and conveniently done / owghte
not be done: much les that which is pernicious / and hurtful. Therefore if
you think as you speak / you think as I have said: that the churches
election can not stand / with the time of A Christian magistrate. And your salve
wherewith you would plaster yt / that the civil magistrate may ordeine so if
he list, is nothing worth. For if it be dangerous / if yt be inconvenient (as
you say) to commit the election to the church: he owgte not althowge he
would / give it into her hands.

Where you conclude that yt was in power off the civil magistrate to order
that matter / because the Emperors made laws off the election, which they
would not have done, yff yt had been ordered by the word off God: you are to
far wide. For we read that Aza made a law / that who soever did not seek
the Lord / should die. Chron. 2. 15. 13.
And there are laws made with us that men shall hear the word off God / and
receive the sacraments: and yet these things are commanded of God / and
unchangeable: nether is yt at the pleasure off any magistrate to order them
otherwise. If the reasons which Musc. brings for conformacion off the
election off the church / can be answered / then I will leave them / and
follow his authority: otherwise I accounte that althowghe he wrastel with it
with his left hand / yet he vpholdeth yt with his right.

T. C. concealed nothing subtilely, in leaving out that the ministers ovvght to
be blameles: he left owte that which made nothing either for / or against the
purpose. If the A. had considered what I prove out of this place: either he
should have omitted this / or spoken yt against his conscience. For I
propounded only / that the election off the church / was both in the times
of the Christian magistrate / and confirmed by them: and the D. can not deny /
but this place proves that fully. whether it be according to the doctrine of
the Apostles / or no: I showed before. Therefore this disputation is with your
self / and with nothing which I set down. And if I had so set it down /
whether the decree off the Emperor would have borne yt out / considering that
the sentence which I left / owghte to be shut in a parenthesis: I leave yt
unto the judgment of the reader. As for the reasons which are used for that
purpose / the one that he would have said decre^, and not we decree: is
answered before. The Other of propounding three, out of which one should be
known not practiced at any time by the Apostles: is not sufficient to prove /
that the Emperor did not set before him / their example: seeing that in the
principal poinctes / and causes off the election (amongst which the chusers
are the efficient) he kept him selffe unto the election of the Apostles. Yea
if it be well considered / yt shall be easily perceived / that he stuck too
curiously / and precisely unto the election Acts 1. whilst as there were two
set up / of which one should be taken: so in a grater multitude he would have
three / out of which he would draw one. And althowgh the imitacion of the
doctrine off the Apostles / were only as you would have yt / that the most
pure should be taken: yet you can not deny / but the Emperor took this to be
the best way / to have most incorrupt ministers: that the election should be
made by the inhabitants off the city. Howbeit because I propounded only to
prove / that elections by the church have been confirmed by Emperors: I will
not strive with him in this point / because I will stop up the holes as much
as may be / whereat he breaks out always / from that which is in question.

Yt were an evil interpretation / to expound the inhabitants off the city /
the chief off the city: especially considering that the decree of other
Emperors which followed / ordained that the minister should be chosen by all
the people. And considering that the Nouelles in latin / are corrupt in many
places: yt is unreasonable to expound the Code / and other laws by them /
especially with such open violence. And yt may be that the translator in steed
off the heads of families / put the heads off the city: but for this also I
will not strive. What either against my cause / or for yowres / conclude you off
that the Metropolitan ordained one off the three, which were chosen after that
sort? Likewise what gain you / if (which is untrue / or very doutefull as that
which has authority off both sides) a man should accord you / that Charles
the great, was Emperor of the French, and not off the Duch? These are nothing
but baits to draw from the cause / which you would so feign shifte yowr hands
of. The shelter also you seek in those words (according to the canons off that
diocese) will not hold out the whether. For although it might be thereby
gathered / that there were several Ceremonies in the elections off the
dioceses: yet it is plain by his words / that the elections were throvvgh
ovvt, made by the church: which is that we desire.

Because you busy yowr self so much to prove / that this was not decreed by
authority of the word of God / althowgh yt be not that which I took in hand
to prove: yet the words off that decree prove yt fully. And albeyt he said
not according to the rules of the Apostles, yet he says that in effect. For in
saing that the church should use that election in the name, and authority off
god: what is yt else / but that god has so ordained: And in that he calls yt
the honor of the church, which he gives not him self / but assenteth unto: he
declares yt incident to the church. And what a reason is this / The Emperor for
bad that any man should spoil the churches of their elections: therefore it
was in the Emperors power, to take away the election from the churches? Which
is in this division for fear of forgetting / four times repeted: and unworthy
once to be confuted / as I have before declared. And as that which the A.
alleges off the rest of the decree / makes nothing to prove / that the
election off the church is in the Emperors power: so that which im^ediatly
follows / which he hydeth in (etc.) does manifestly prove / that he held yt
for grounded of the word off God / that the churches should have the election
off their mynisters. For he adds / Because we have been tavvght by the holy
fathers, that this thing (that is to say the taking away off the election
from the church / as the D. himself expounds yt) is most grievous sin. If
therefore it be grievous sin to spoil the church 1. John. 3. 4.
of this honor / and sin is defined the breach of the law off god: yt
follows that the Emperor took yt for a law of God / that the church should
choose her minister.

And if I had been bente upon that poincte: I could have cited diverse
testimonies / which Illyricus uses / whereby this off the unchangeable
necessity off the election by the church / is confirmed. Lib. 4. instit ca. 4.
sect. 11. 5. cha. 2. se.
As that Leo the first affirms / that no reason suffers that he should be
bishop, which is not chosen by the people: alleged / and pressed against the
Papists off Master Calvin to the same purpose. Which place how violently /
and unfaithfully yt is wrested off the D. in the end of this treatise shall be
considered. Also that he alleges off Leo the fourth / and Celestine which
confirmed the same ordinance with this testimony. it is not convenient, and
yt is against reason yt should be otherwise. Likewise out off the epistles
off the Archbishop off Reins in France / who diverse times uses this saying
/ he ovvght to be chosen of all, whom all must give obedience unto. Last off
all a whole treatise out of the second book of Cusanus: which proves of
diverse places out off the scripture / Cyprian / and canon Law: that yt is no
constitution off men / but the law off God / that the minister should be
chosen off the church: and that whosoever does not enter into the church by
that means, enters not in by the door, but is a these and a murderer. These I
would have browght at large / if I had not contented my self with proofs out
of the scripture / for the necessity off yt: which I here have shortly set
down / because I see the D. more afraied off the judgment off the ancient
church / then of the scripture. so that althowgh yt be a slender buckler to
shild him self / that the constitutions in that behalf make no mention off
any grownd out off the word of god (whereas he should rather have showed that
they protested in their laws off the indifferency / against the necessity
off it): yet even that buckler also is by diverse Testymonies / taken from him.

Yt is a poor falsifying off Platina, which is nothing but change Diuis. 8.
page 186. 187.
of one word for another / without any gain at al. For the Emperors
co^mendacion serves me as well / to prove that the election of the church was
allowed of / and confirmed of the civil magistrate: as if he had commanded yt.
The second place off Platina proves nothing les / then that it was in the
Emperors power to change the election: saying that he nether made / nor
altered any form off Election / but only off two Elections by the people /
maintained that which was lawful. Saying also Platina / supposes no right
off making the election in the Emperor / but by the resignation off the
Bishopp: if that place prove any thing / or the other after alleged owte off
Bale / and Barnes: they prove that yt was in the Bishops hand / to order yt
at his pleasure. Which how vntrwe yt is / may be considered off that which
has been before spoken / against the sole election off the Bishopp: and off
that which is here confessed / that the Bishopp of Rome began to usurp, that
which belonged not unto him. For if he encroched upon the Emperors right: no
marvel althowgh he brake in upon the possession off the church.

Where he says / yt is to be noted that the liberty for the people to choose,
was granted by Charles the great: note also tha^ that note / is worth
nothing. For where he would have yt seem / that he was the first that gave
that liberty: he is confuted manifestly by the words off Charles / a little
before alleged: who speaks of that election / as of a thing accustomed of
old / and does not make any new law thereof / but gives his assent unto
those which were made. The words you ascribe to me (that the election
pertains not to the Emperor) I have not: I kept the very words of Platina
/ and nether added / nor took away from them. Where you would seem to
confirm out of Platina in the life of John the 13. by the word (creating)
that the Emperor chose Leo: yt is but an abusing of the reader. For Platina in
the next chapter saving one / where he speaks of Leos election / declares
that that creation was nothing else / but a confirmacion of the election made
by the people / and clergy.

Therefore I said the Emperors permitted the elections Diuis. 9. page 187.
unto the churches, because by power / and violence they might have taken them
from them: wherefore yt followethe not / that he might withowt breach off
Gods law, take them from the church. When yt is said in the stories / that
the Emperous permitted unto the churches the exercise off their religion: may
yt thereby be concluded / that it was at their pleasure / to have without
offense of God restrained them of that liberty? verily I am ashamed to confute
/ which the D. is not ashamed to obiecte. Yet the testimonies alleged / make
no mention of this word (permission) whereby this advantage (if yt were any)
should betaken.

You might easelie have forgiven me this fault / where the injury which I do
is a against my self. For where I might have 10. Diuis. page 188.
used the authorie off the Centuries / to the utter reiection off the canon off
the council off Laodicea; I used yt only to bring the canon into suspicion /
whether yt were made then or no. If I had had the book before me / you might
well think I would not have done my self that wrong. As for the Canon I have
showed both by the conference off other councels / and authority / of Calvin
/ and Beza / that yt can not be understood to seclude the people from the
election / but tends only to the directing In the 4. cap 7. di. pa. 193.
of them / by the foreiudgemente of the elders. And whereas to the authority
off Calu. which I allege out of the Acts / he opposes his authority in the
Institutio^s: besides that fault which he reprocheth me with / off opposinge
the authors unto them selves: the untruth off it is showed in the former place
/ neither can the A. have excuse off his most unfaithful dealing. For as well
in the edition he follows / as in the later: this judgment touching the canon
/ is not once / but twice set down / not simply / but with confirmacion off
the decree off Leo the first / and that in the same section / out off which he
has fetched these words. If he will still speak against the son / and deny
that which he does so plainly affirm / touching the use off the churches
election only in the Apostel^ times, and times off persequution: I can do no
more / but leave it to the judgment off the reader / referring him to the
places where he says / that this election endured unto Cyprians times, and to
his whole disputation whereby he goes about to prove / that this election can
by no means be convenient for the prosperity off the gospel.

The exception he makes against the peace off the church / in the time off
Constantine / because Maxentius, and Lycinius persequuted yt, is nothing to the
purpose. For Albeit the churches under them / were in persequution: yet those
under Constantine were quiet. And even under Licinius the church was at quiet
for a time. Eusebius. 9. lib: 9. ca.
For Constantine, and Lycinius made a most perfect, and full decree for the
peace off the church: and by their letters sent to Maximinus (which was then
the persequutor in the East) procured peace there. So that the peace was
general throwgh the churches. And althowgh that peace was in certain parts
broken of: yet yt appears / that both Lycinius Maxentius / and Maximinus
being taken away / Constantine obtained dominion 1. li. Socr. 1 cap. 1. Theod.
cap. 1. Diuis. 11. page 189. Theod. 1. lib. ca. 8.
over the whole empire / and pourchased peace unto the whole church.

When the Nicene Council allows not off the election off the clergy / unless
the person chosen be both worthy / and likewise chosen by the people: can there
be any plainer words invented / to confirm that I have set down? And where
he would darken so clear a light / by words which say that those things
belonged peculiarly to Aegypte, and to the church of Alexandria, as if this
order off election by the church / were not holden good in other places: he
does but as a man which has made shipwreck / snatcheth at every thing he can
lay hold off / at all adventure. For Ariu^ heresy bearing sway in those
parts / drove the council to enter into certain peculiar considerations off
them: but that the election off the church / was a peculiar thing unto those
provinces / yt is too absurd. For what wisdom off the council should yt be
/ to permit that unto the people in those places / which were most corrupt
with Arianisme: if other places of the world / which were sounder then they
/ had not that privilege? And if the foresaied words / cause this condition
so that the people choose, to be a peculiar thing unto those places: then yt
follows / that the other condition which is joined with yt / was likewise /
that he which was chosen should be meet to be chosen: which no man that has
not lost his senses / will ever say. So that we still have the council off
Nice / confirming absolutely the election off the church. As for Grineus he
makes nothing to this matter. for the right off the clergy, shuts not out
the churches. Diuis. 12. page 190: li. 9. c. 14.


The words off the tripartite story / are as I have alleged / and the words
of Theodoret have nothing to the contrary: only the D. must say something.
Thouching the next division I leave yt to be judged / whether I have showed
that which the A. says I have not.

It is never a whit the better / althowgh those you allege / 14 Diuis. pa. 101.
and all the world should allow of that sentence you bring forth / under
Ambroses credit. I used no contempt toward Ambrose / nether have I so much
as rejected him: only that sentence as blasphemns against the government off
the Apostels / Idetested / and yt owght to have been maintained by confutation
off reasones I alleged / and not by bare authority. For if that had been
enoughe to wype away that place: I had a great deal more manifester against
yt / then you be hable to allege for yt. For Upon the 4. Ephesians.
of that place off Ambrose Calvin writes thus. As for those things which are
read in the commentaries off Ambrose, they are too childis he, and unworthy
of Ambr. And you do but coulor this matter with the names off Georgius / etc.
Which what they say / I report me to those that have the books to see:
assured notwithstanding / that if they had any thing for you / you would have
made them speak.

If you would have done symply / you should have named 3. li Eccl. Hier. c. 7.
Pighius / who proves diversity of government off the church / as you do by
this counterfaite place of Amb. As for the shifte wherewith the D. Would help
it / that yt was permitted to al me^ to preach, and minister the sacraments,
but not withowt a calling: yt is spoken witthowt reason. For what needed there
/ or how can there be a calling / when all were used to the service of the
ministry? Seeing that calling is a seperatio^ from other by election / and
election is choice of some / with leuinge off other some: And the church of
Christ is a body standing off many members / and not all an eye / or 1. Cor.
12* 14.
any other one member. And for that there were many in the time off the
Apostles / which had not either knowledge / or dexterity to teach: yt can not
be said without making the Apostles / Authors of horrible confusion / that
they called all men to the ministry off the word / and sacraments. That
which is browght out off Bull. and Sleidan / is but filling up of paper. For
they condemn not the Anabaptists / because they chose their ministers: but
that they excluded the authority of the magistrate.

Your reproaches here are answered. I gave you as ready a way to find those
testimonies / as I had given me. If you took Diu. 15. p. 193.
yt owte off Musculus yowr self / then might have noted the place: if you had
yt of others / you should have named yowr collector / as I did mine. Here is
occasion taken to repeat / and translate a great deal out of Musculus / but
nothing to purpose. For I deny not / but that he is off Judgment / that a man
constrained by corruption off times / may depart from the Apostolical
election shuttinge out the people: but I deny that that is warranted by
substantial arguments. Beside I have showed / that here in words against us
/ in his reasons he stands for us. Which shall best be vnsterstanded / in
that the D. being not hable to lift the whole / has mangled them / and
snatched here and there a word: if peradventure untwisted he might deal with
them / which otherwise he could not break. For where I cited out off Musculus
that yt is a boundage unto the church, to have their minister thruste upon yt
vvithovvt choice off the people: he answers / that subjection to magistrates
is no bondage: wherein he touches nether heaven / nor earth. For he should have
answered as unto Musculus / and not as unto me: considering that I alleged
that out off him / off whom he has taken all his reasons. And therefore the
note off Anabaptisme, which he markethe all those with / that say yt is
bondage unto the church, to have their pastor thrust upon them: lights
upon Musculus / which thus speaks / and affirms yt constantly.

Then his answer is abegging off that in question / when he says / that
subjection in lawful matters is no bondage: yt being in question whether yt
be lawful for the magistrate / to take away the election from the church. To
that also out of Musculus / that the minister chosen by the church may rule
with a good conscience / and the people obey unto him / easelier / then when
he comes in against their will: and thervppon concluded / that forasmuch as
that manner of election is to be followed / which makes most to assure the
mynisters conscience of his calling / and that the people should be more
obedient unto his doctrine / therefore that only was to be holden: his answer
is / that he may be assured otherwise, and that the people otherwise will
obey. which if yt were true / as yt is not / is not sufficient: for that he is
not so easelie assured / nor they so easily obey.

And where as he says / that he which is assured off an inward calling, need
not to doubt of his owtward: you should understand that the assurance of the
inward calling / depends a great part of the owtward. for allbeyt the sprite
of God works that assurance: yet he works by the owtward means of the
judgment of the elders / and off the church / touching his aptnes for the
ministry: whileste he considers / that that calling is not the calling off
men / but off God throwgh the ministry of men. Nether is there any one
(excepe those which are called extraordinaryly) which can have assurance off
any inward calling / but by the means off owtwarde. For if he were assured that
God had called him / without the calling off men; he owght to obey his voice /
althowgh men would not call him. So that this not distinction / but separation
off the knowledge off an inward calling / from the owtward / is not only
absurd: but confirms the Anabaptists / which boste off an inward calling /
where no calling off the church went before.

That he adds / if yt be according to the form of that church where he is
called: is but a begging off the question. For it being in question whether
every calling that any church uses / be lawful / and seeing the minister can
not be assured off his owtward calling / oneles yt be lawful: it follows
that he which presumes one / must needs presume the other. Upon Musculus
saying / that the thrustinge off the minister upon the church without her
election, draws bondage, etc. and the D affirming / that such elections are
meet for the church, under the christian Magistrate: I concluded that thereby
great injury was done to the Christian Magistrate / given off God not only
to preserve / but to increase the churches liberty. To all which first the
D. answers / that he gives nothing to the magistrate but which belongs
unto him, and that yt is the magistrates right to use that kind of appoincting
off ministers, which he thincketh good: which is a gross begging off that in
controversy.

Secondly he says / that the pastors had never better cause to obey their
pastors, never les cause to complain off bondage, and co^straint, then now
when the pastors are chosen without the consent off the churches: which as it
is barely said / has no reason to lean upon / is confuted by common sense:
so it is directly contrary to that Musculus his author / affirms in the
words before alleged. Only for the matter off liberty / he alleges that
the true liberty of the church, consists in liberty of conscience, and
freedom from false doctrine: whereunto I answer / that it consists in them /
but not only. for to use assemblies for the ministering of the word / and
Sacraments / etc. is a liberty of the church: And they are not mine / but
Musc. words: which calls the election by the church / a liberty, and the
other a bondage of the church. I imagine not the corrupt estate to be in the
laws, and gou^ernment off the Christian magistrate: but contrariwise give that
virtue to his godly government / that the estate off religion may be easelie
pure with him: which can be hardly / or not without great danger / pure
without him. You if not in words / yet in deed / make the government off the
christian magistrate, always fraught with dronkardes, Idolaters, whoremo^gers
/ Atheistes / etc. pa. 176. and 178.
which was not so before he entered: which is nothing else / then to make him
Lord of misrule / and in steed of a noursing father / a fosterer of sin:
which is the injury I complain off.

Where you say / that it is commendation unto the magistrate to correct such
disordered persons: you say well / but smally to the purpose / smally to your
advantage. For if the church has by benefit of the Christian magistrate /
besides her own censures / his help off civil punishments for repressing
sin: she having better means to weed out the wicked the^ be fore / may be
more easily discharged of those unprofitable burdens. I have not therefore
tra^sferred the faults off men unto the government: but you have laid to my
charge / that which your felfe fault in / and I before confuted. The form off
election in the Apostles time, is not changed by the magistrates confirmacion.
For beside that that is properly no part off the election / but a thing which
follows yt: this right off confirmacion of elections / was in the Apostles.
times. And although the practice was not general / yet there being even in in
their times some Christian magistrates / as appears by that which has been
spoken: there can be small doubt / but this form off election had in certain
places / even during the Apostles times / his approbation. If it had not / yet
the form theroff is no more changed thereby: then the form of preaching / and
administering the Sacraments / when the magistrate did not allow of them /
differs from that which is now / when he mainteineth them. so appears that
the magistrates co^firmatio^ / stands without breach of the Apostical form
of election: which he denies.

These trifling questions here / albeit most unworthy / yet are In the 4. diu.
p. 163
answered almost all before. And if there were a legion more / they are not
only confuted / in that this manner off election by the church confirmed by
the magistrate / has been used more then ^00. years together: but also by the
D. own words / whereby he leaves yt in the princes pleasure / so to order yt
still. For if there were such inco^ueniences / and absurdities as he imagines:
how has the practice continued so long / been thowght good by so many good
Emperors / and so many learned men in all those ages? Or if all they were a
sleap / or of so short sight / that they could not see these inconveniences /
which the D. has espied: how comes yt to pass / that he leaves yt in the
magistrates pleasure / to establishe this order encombred with such
inconveniences, and absurdities?

For the chalenges whereby he would give to understand / that I have not
faithfully alleged Musculus: the first is / that I affirm that he went
about to defend the election used where he was by this, that it approached to
the election of the primative church, which he says is untrue. But the reason
wherewith I confirm yt / that Muscu. says yt vavs made not by one minister,
but by all, by the voices of the Senate, where some number off the people
were: He touches not. The second that I call the choice off the minister by
the church the Apostolical form: yet they are not my words / but Musculus
his authors / which calls yt In the title of the Minist.
the oulde, the fytteste, the divine, the Apostolical, and lavvfull election.

Where he says / that Musculus does not call the other elections, forced: I
would gladly know / what difference there is between forced, and thruste
upon. For Musculus in the same title / makes Obtrudi.
all one a mynister thruste upon the church / and a minister which is not
chosen off the church / in these words. The form off election used in the
Apostles times, is conformable to the liberty, and privilege off the church,
vvherof Cyprian made mention: and that form off choice, vvherby men began to
be thrust upon the people off Christ being not chosen off yt, does agree to
a church which is not free, but subject to bondage. Hitherto yt has
appeared that although Musc. Judgment be not wholly for us: yet the reasons
which he alleges for this cause / are such as can not be shaken. Now I
will further show / that as there is some disagreement between ours / and his
Judgment: so there is further distance / between him Titulo de Ministr. elect.
and the D.

First therefore he says / that as the election by the church endured until
the time off Christian magistrates: so the election made by the church / and
confirmed by the christian magistrate / endured until that time / that the
bishop off Rome having wrong owte / both from the Emperor / and the people
their right in the election / took it all to him self. The D. denies this
stoutly. Secondarily Musculus makes the disorders off electio^s by chusinge
unmeet persons / or by corruption throwghe gifts / or parciall favor / to
begin then especially: when the election taken from the people / came into the
bishop of Rome / and his suffragans hands. The D. clean contrary / that
these disorders were especially / in the elections by the people: and best
avoided / when the election is called to the will / and beck off one bishop.
Thirdly Musc. makes yt an unlawful form off election / when yt is made of
the prince: but master D. says / that yt is in the princes power to make
election off ministers him self if he will / or commit yt to others if he
list. Fourthly Musc. helpinge him self off the authority off Jerome / says
that there was no election in popery: becawse they were made without the
knowledge off the people / and condemns also the election of the bishopes
made by the Canons / for the same cause. But M. D. says yt is a most
convenient / and sufficient election: which notwithstanding in that poincte /
is all one with the election in popery. Last off all / wherein (lies a great
weight of this controversy) he does not say simply / that this form off
choice by the church is unmeet / and inconvenient for this age off he church:
but that it could not be by and by / and out of hand restored: and after a
little / that it could not be in all churches / by and by restored. Whereby he
gyuethe to understand / that in some places yt might be forthwith restored: and
in other / all men owght endeavor to bring yt in again / withal convenient
speed. So appears that although Musculus be pretended: yet Pigghius / and
Hosius be his storers.

Here comes to show the manner off the election off the Tigurine church /
whereon the D. hears him self so much: which page 139. Bull. upon 1. Tim. 4.
(as Bullinger whom he cyteth for his author reports) is this. After he had
showed that in all lawful ministeries off the word / there is required that
with innocence of life / he should be learned / then chosen according to the
word off God / thirdly after he is chosen / and presented to the church / have
imposition of hands: he adds / Heruppon the Tigurine church, having taken
her leave off the inordinate ordination off the popish bishop, chooses off
the learned, and off the ministers, off the Senators, and off the council off
the 220. that is to say off the common people: which out off the learnedest,
and honestest deacons, should present certain that are to be made Bishops,
unto the Senate, and people. Off which when the Senate, and people have
chosen one: they send him unto the church over which he is set, and with him
a counseiller which does commend him unto his church. Then the chiefest off
the bishops off that city, or other place where this nevve bishop must be,
makes a Sermon, and in public prayer made off the church in this behalf,
layinge on his hands, commends the church unto him. Wherein how many things
are fauouringe our cause / and openly fighting against the D. upon that I have
before noted / of the election of the churches of Berne / I leave to be
considered.

ALthowghe the D. (as his use is) speaks off one thing so Cap. 7. Diuis. 1.
page 197.
often / and that in the same division / and with spaces put between / so that
yt is hard to give answer with any convenient understanding off the reader:
yet I will as well as I can / refer his scattered sayings to certain
heads. Wheroff the first is / that he did not mean to prove by these places
off Timothe, and Titus, that the election belonged unto one man: Wheruppon he
charge me / with wilful deprauinge off his answer. Yt must be therefore
considered / if we may hold this wett eele by the mouth. The Adm. says /
in the primitive church no minister was placed in the congregation but by
consent off the people, but now that authority is given to the bishops
hands alone: the D. answers by the place off Timothe / and Titus. Now this
being a commandment / and by his judgment both directed only to Tim. and
Tit. and to them as bishops: yt follows that he has taught / that Saint
Paul commands that they / and in them all bishops / should only choose.
Whereby are condemned all election by the church / as those which have intruded
upon the bishops possession.

Where he says / that the Adm. does coulorably affirm, by these words
thautoritie is given to the bishopp alone, etc. that the right off orderinge
ministers does at no hand apperteine unto the bishopp: I would know what word
there is here / where this coulor is to be seen: and what light he is able
to give us / to make yt appear. The other sentence wherewith he would prove yt
/ follows after / nether was he come unto yt. If he did therefore confute
that: it is as strange as if a man should shut off / and spend his
arrows / or ever he come within the reach off his enemy. And I think there
is no example off such confutation / onles he had coupled that place with this
/ and comparinge them together / set upon them both at ones. beside that it is
Absurd / that where the Adm. here spoke off the election: he answers off
admission.

Here comes to be considered the A. dealinge in the end off the book / where
(charged with vnfaithfullnes for that as in this pa. 796.
place / he would have in synuated / that the Adm. would have the people choose
only) to prove him self giltles / he alleges a place of the Adm. wherein yt
is said / Then the election was made by commen consent off the whole church.
To this answer I rep^lied / that it was his oversight / that he took the
people which is but a part of the church / to be al one with the church which
is the whole / co^teininge as well governors of the church / as the people, in
which reply the D. cries owte off manifest falsification. Why so? forsooth
because I left owte this word whole: that is to say / because I spared him /
and kept back a piece of his folly / and that with disadvantage off that
which I pretended to prove. For the word church simply set down / does
comprehended as well the governors / as the people: how much more does it
comprehend them / when this word whole is added? And if it were falsely
concluded off him against the Adm. that they would have the ministers to be
called / allowed / and placed off the people / because they said / that the
election was made by commen consent off the church: how much more is yt falsely
concluded of these words off the Adm. the election was made by consent off
the whole church? Thus appears that the D. together with his divinity /
seems to have lost his commen sense: yt is time therefore to carry him owte
off the schole to some other place / if peradventure by some sharper
discipline / he might gather up him self again.

In the same place also / upon that I showed that in proper speech / the church
/ and people differed / having there declared that difference to be / in that
the church is the whole / and the people a part theroff* this complainer off
falsificatio^ says / that I seem to separate the people from the election of
the ministers, for that I will not have the word church in the Adm. comprehend
the people: which is manifestly against that I set down. For I precisely
reprehended him for that upon the word church, used off the Admon. he would
have maintained his false insinuation against them / that the election should
perteine to the people only: consideringe that the word church cited off him /
was the whole: and the people one part / and necessarily comprehended under
it. This is not only falsifyinge / but flat facynge.

Now to return back / I ask what he needed twife in this division / in so
many / and grievous words complain off corrupt dealinge? saying him self
flatly affirms / as much as I say of him / and otherwise ca^ not maintain
his cause. The truth is / that he absteined then from the words electinge, and
only, because he saw he had nothing to maintain them: which now by my
reply / he was driven to put down / or else to forsake his cawse. Wherein as he
dissenteth from the trwth: so he is driven to have a new combat with him self
/ in that he here makes yt indifferent / and at the discretion of the church
in time of persequution / to make elections either by one / or by the multitude:
which is contrary to that he has before in these words. Lastly in time of
Diuis. 6. pa. 183.
persequution when they have no magistrate, they be all equal, nether is one
bound to obey another by any civil law: none has cheiff, and especial care
over the rest, as magistrate to compel: wherefore yt can not be otherwise
then, but that such offices should be chosen by common consent. Where he
alleges Zuing. and Bull. out of place / and contrary to the title of his
chap. to prove the calling of certain by one Apostle: In diui. 2. page 156.
because they be Evangelists which we have no use off / and for that I have
showed / that they both are clearly of this Judgment / that the minister owght
to be chosen with consent off the church: I will not much busy my self with
this matter. But althowgh the Apostles did send these Evangelists off their
Embassages / to know how the churches did / and such like things as required
no tariance / nor execution off any set ministry in the churches whereunto they
where sent: yet that they ever set them to rule any congregation by their
private authority / is not to be esteemed. wheroff this is an apparent reason /
that Timothe was not set over the church off Ephesus by Saint Paul only /
saying that Paul confesses that he received imposition off hands / 1. Tim.
4. 14.
by the eldership. The Other also here mentioned being Evangelists / it is like
the order used in one / was in the other. Nether do the words I left the at
Creta, prove it. for he does not say / that he ordained him: and if he had /
yet it must be understood / that he did ordeine him as he had done in other
churches / with consent off the church.

And that this is not my judgment / yt may appear by that I have alleged
out off Calvin / and Musculus / in the former book / and Bez. in this. nether
could Bull. be thought to have here Pa. 40. Diuis. 4. Pa. 135. Diuisi. 2. page
156.
such meani^g / as the D. gives him: that the Apostles alone should set over
the churches ministers / as appears by that I have alleged. So that onles he
will make Bullinger contrary unto him selffe: these words that Paul / and
Peter called certain / can not be understood off placinge them over any
congregation / no further then being chief in that action / they directed the
judgment of the churches. there remains zuinglius / which I marvel the D.
will charge me with / saying he himselffe will not stand to him / in the place
which he has alleged. For that which he has left out / off Mathias chosen
by the whole church: is directly against that / which he has in diverse
places before affirmed.

After many vain words against the reply unto the places off Timothe / as
that it is against thauthoritie off learned writers, against the whole course
off the Epistell, against the circunstance off the place: he alleges that
the most off the precepts contained in that epistell, do properly perteine
unto Timothe, as he is a bishop. Which is vntrwe / especially in that sense he
takes a bishop / which the Apostels never knew off: for there shall be scarce
two sentences found in the whole epistle / which agree not to every pastor. And
set aside those which concern teachinge / there are very few not commen with
him / unto an elder which only governs. Beside diverse belonging unto the
whole church / as well as unto him: and some rather to other parts off the
church / then unto him, yet if the most should properly belong unto him:
how can he prove that the sentence off not layinge one off hands rashly /
does onele belong unto him? he has cyted many to prove that Saint Paul says
/ yt does belong unto the bishop, which is not denied: but that yt does only
belong by this place off Saint Paul / which is denied / he has not one. Nay
diverse off his authors here alleged / have the contrary off that he
pretends to prove by them. For Bull. I have said. Calu. denyinge that either
Paul / or Timothe did any thing in elections / withowt the consent off the
church / towching the bare ceremony off layinge on the hands / he dowteth
whether yt were done by one / or many. And Jerome althowgh he say / that the
ordinacion belonged to the bishop yet I have showed in the former book / that
he confesses that that was by no order of God / or rule of the Apostles (by
which he confesses that the bishopps were equal unto the rest of the elders)
but only by constitution off men. Therefore he is vntrwely cited / to confirm
that by this place off the Apostell / the bishop has either the election / or
ordination unto him selffe.

As for Chrysostom / and Oecumenius / unto whom is added Beza page 226. Where
this is repeted: I answer at ones / that yt seems violent that the Apostle
vsinge the word eldershipe / should shut forth those / which were properly
called elders. And where I alleged page 226. that Chrysostom meant not by
those words / to put a distinction between elders by age / and office: I was
deceived. The occasion was / because he does so in the same epistle / where he
had no more cause then here: and not lokinge upon the the place when I wrote
/ I took one for another. But yt is to be noted / that their interpretation is
directly against the D. for Chrysostom affirms / that the Bishops off
Acts 20. 28. Upon 1. Timo. 4:
Ephesus (which appear to have been diverse in the Acts) did lay on their
hands: and Beza / that all those which had the mynistrie off the word, are
meant by the word presbitery: So that by their judgment / one only did not
ordeine, nor lay on hands: both which the D. affirms. As for the other
sentence off Chrysostom / with Theophilacte / althowgh Paul left unto Tite
to do those things which were joined with most honor: yt follows not / that
he left them to be done otherwise / then himself did them.

But he does to much abuse his reader / which would make him believe that he
drew this from the godly writers / which he has from professed enemies off
the trwth. For these are the reasons off Pighius / which to prove that the
bishopp only should Li. 2. Hierar. eccle. ca. 3. and 9. and 5. li. ca. 10 and
controuer. 16
choose / and not the church / alleged these two places off Tite / and Timothe
which the Answerer has. Thus the first reason off the D. with all the
authorities wherewith he has walled yt / is gone to the ground. for as for
Ambrose testimony / yt makes nether whot / nor kolde: no man dowteth but that
Timothe owght to be circumspecte, in ordeininge ministers.

The second reason is / that if the election off a bishop had off necessytie
perteined unto the people: the^ S. Paul would not have written to Timothe of
yt, but unto the churches as well as unto him. As though there were not many
things in those epistles / necessay for the churches to do: or as though they
inscribed unto Titus / and Timothe / are not written for the instruction of the
whole church / even in that very sentence off imposition off hands. For when
Saint Paul tawght / that Timothe might not lay on his hands rashly: he
tawght the whole churches / that they should not choose any rashely. What is I
beseech you in Saint Lukes two books / dedicated unto Theopilus: which does not
as well perteine unto all sorts off men in the church / as unto him? That the
holy ghost therefore intituleth his books sometimes unto particular persons /
was not that the Doctrine contained in them / should more perteine unto them /
then unto others: but either because he would lift up their head above the
rest / or for some other particular In the argument upon the epistles.
circumstance..

And in Master Caluines judgment / they were both written rather for
instruction off other in the church / then for Timothe / and Titus. For there
being great resistance made unto those young men / off diverse in the churches
off Ephesus / and Crete: the Apostle to supporte them against their
adversaries / and to gird them with more authority / so entitled their
epistles: that they might know that those things they did / and tawght /
they nether did / nor taught of them selves / but by his commandment. As
therefore all things contained in these Epistles / were to be known off Timothe
/ and Titus: so were they all to be known off every one in those churches. And
as there are things in them / the exercise wheroff concerned Timothe / and
Titus only: so there are other / the exercise wheroff / did at no hand
apperteine to any off them.

As for the circumstance off the place, which he says is against my reply:
he shows none. But there is a manifest circumstance against him / which the
Apostle by and by adds / keep they self pure, and communicate not with the
faults off other, as if he 1. Tim. 5. 22.
should say / althowghe thou canste not hinder the ordeining off insufficient
officers of the church: yet keep they self pure. Moreover if this writing unto
Timothe alone / that he should lay hands off none rashely / should give him
alone authority to ordeine / and elect pastors: then yt should follow / that
not only the church / and elders off Ephesus / but the Bishopes which were
there together with Timothe / should have been shut owte. Act. 20.
which if the D. dare not say / beside that this hold is gone: he must
recante the sole election / and ordination by Timothe.

You may easily put me owte off dowbte, off: that which I never dowbted / and
which I have somewhere confessed: that by the ceremony off layinge on off
hands, the whole form off orderinge is understood. But off that you should
prove / that in that place off Saint Paul it is so understood (althowghe yt
is not that / which can hurt our cause) you bring not so much / as may
induce unto any the least suspicio^. Your reason that he did elect, because
he did appoincte: is to simple. For albeit to choose be to appointe: yet every
one which appoints / chooses not: no more then yt follows / that because
every man lives: therefore every thing that lives / is a man. And I would
gladly understand / by what masters off our tongue you can prove / that these
two words to appoincte / and to ordeine / differ. If they be all one / why
seek you advantage in the one / which you can not find in the other? But if
it be absurd / to say that ordeininge is nothing else but to call, to choose,
and to appoincte: yt is as absurd / that to appoincte is nothing else / but to
call / to choose / and to ordeine.

I am well content you expound the place unto Timothe, off puttinge on of
hands / by that unto Titus, of appoincting town by town. For I dowbte not
but that which the eldershippe does / or one in the name off the eldershippe
after the election / is therefore called appointinge / or ordeininge to the
ministry / because yt is a solemn inuestinge / and puttinge him in
possession off that / whereunto he was before chosen. Althowghe Call. be directly
against him in this question / whose judgment is / that yt does nether belong
unto the bishop to choose him self alone / nor yet (...). Chrysostom. Oecume.
Beza. Bulling. (...) Upon the fourth c. 1. Timot.
to ordeine by him self alone: yet to help to overthrow the right
signification of Presbytery / he is content to follow him / at the least
dowting: leauinge so many both old / and new / which all take that word for
a company off those which govern the church. And it is certain that those
forms off nownes / are used to signify either a society: or else the place
where a society meets. And Calvin him selffe interpretinge that place /
where he had better occasion to consider of it / seems to have retracted his
judgment: for thus he writes. They which do here take this word
(presbytery) for a novvne collectiue, and for the college of elders, in my
judgment think well. Althovvghe all things considered, I grant an other
sense will not evil agree: that is, that yt be the name off the office.

Yff those words as I appoincted the, be referred as yowr learned interpreters
will have them / by laying on off hands, and prayer: they Tit. 1.
help you nothing. And therefore I will not strive abowte yt. Where you say /
Musculus meaning is not much otherwise, meaning thereby to conclude / that he
mente not to bar Timothe / and Titus off their sole election: let his words
then be judge. Having showed how Mathias / and the Deacons were chosen by the
church: he says / there is no doubt but the Apostles kept that manner of
ordeininge. and alledginge the example of the election Tit. elect* Ministe^*
off the 14. off the Acts / headdeth / therefore after fasting, and prayinge
(which was wont to be done, in the congregation off the faithful) they
ordained elders, which were first chosen of the faithful. And this form
off electinge, and ordeininge elders, and bishops, the Apostle commended unto
his fellow workman Titus, and Timothe saying, for this cause I left the at
Crete, etc. for who vvoulde believe that he ordained, that Titus should do
otherwise, then both he, and the rest off the Apostles were accoustomed to
do. And althowghe these words declare so plainly / that Titus and Timothe
chose not them selves alone / but by consent off the churches / as more fuller
could hardly be devised: yet to put all out off dowbte / that he mente that
Timothe / and Titus conformed themselves to the examples off the Apostles / in
the churches election joined together with theirs: he does immediately add this
conclusion. Therefore both by the example, and ordinance off the Apostle in the
primitive church, elders, pastors, bishops, and Deacons were in the
Ecclesiastical meetinges chosen off the people, by lifting up off hands.
Where the reader may consider what trwth he has to look for at the D. hands:
which denies things that have so manifest / and so easy confutation.

And where he says / that herin althowghe he has left Calvin, yet he has
followed the judgment of other learned men: he may see that he has not left
Calvin only / but Muscul. Bulling. and Zuing. As for his learned men, I think
verily that Pighius / Hosius / and others off that stamp excepted / he is not
hable to allege one / to confirm that Titus / and Timothe had only the
election off the ministers. For those alleged / to prove that Timothe / and
Titus did ordeine / are nothing to the purpose: considering no man denies
that: but that they ordained alone / was to be showed. And ^^ he had showed
that they alone ordained / which he shall never do: yet is not the election
off the people thereby shut owte: forsomuche as election / and ordination are
several things.

What either godliness / or honesty is in him / which dare so bare faced deny /
things so openly vntrwe: I will leave to be judged Diuis. 2. Pa. 202.
of that which is said / towching that the election does not belong unto the
bishop alone / but unto the church. Here I will show that not so much as the
ordination / can by the testimony of thauncient fathers / or councelles agree
unto one bishop only: which is another poinct that he would have the reader
believe / and therefore owght either to have showed yt / or else to have holde^ his
peace: seeing none ever denied / that the bishop has to do in the ordinacion.
First yt appears in Cyprian / that both in the province where he was / and
in all other prouincs almost / the next 1. lib. 4. Epist.
bishopps off that place where there was a minister to be chosen / came to
ordeine him whom the people chose. The great council off Nice / decreed that
he should be ordained off all the bishopps off the province / at the least of
three. Moreover August. shows / that when the Donatistes accused Cycilian /
for that being chief bishop off the Province off Carthage / he waited not
lib. cont. Donat. post. coll. cap. 5.
to be ordained off the chief bishop off Numidia: the Catholics did answer
/ that it was the coustome of the Catholic church / that the bishop of Number.
should not ordeine the bishop of Carthage / but the bishops which were next.
And in an other place of the same book / he shows that yt was the coustome
that 12. bishops should be at the ordination off him / which was chosen
bishop / and pastor off any church. Which appears in the same book to have
been observed / in the ordination off Cycilian.

And that yt may appear / that this was by continual consent / and Harmony
off Counsels decreed against the ordination by one bishop: that one place
off Theodoret if there were no more / might suffice / where he says / that
Euagrius came to 1. lib. ca. 23.
the office off a bishop unlawfully / because only Paulinus ordained him /
contrary to the tenure off many canons which provided that they should not be
ordained / but by all the bishops off the province / or at the least by
three. Thus yt appears that by all antiquity / not only the election made
by one bishope alone / but the ordinacion also is flatly condemned / as
unlawful / and contrary to the coustome of the Catholic church / and old
Councelles* whereby is manifest how vain yt is / which is cited out off Calvin
/ and others / to prove that because the Metrapolitane ordained / therefore he
ordained alone.

You answer not to the difference I show to have been / between your bishop /
and Ieromes* you tell that I took my word (only) out off Illyricus / as you
did your word off (excellinge) which is vntrw. For I gathered yt out off
Ieromes manifest words / which denies that the bishop differs from an
elder / but in ordinacion: not knowing whether Illyricus has that word or no.
Nether are you helped by the college election. Because that there is great
difference / between the liberty which may be used in Cyuill elections / and
in Ecclesiastical / confirmed even by placinge off bishops with us / whose
ordeiners are not also choosers. I have showed how the election / and
ordination are done off diverse: and the next diuis. handles that matter /
nether is there any thing in yowr manifold questions / to the contrary: then
all which one only reason had been a great deal better. Nether forget I my
self one whit / in that I alleged out off the counsels off Carthage / and
Toledo: where the ordination is given to the bishops, but no word that the
election belongs unto them. Howbeit because I see you having not to answer /
seek startinge holes: I will not suffer you to run owte thither / nether
will I make yr any question between us / whether the bishop may both choose /
and ordeyne* yt shall be enowgh for us / that he can not elect alone / and
withowt the church / nor ordeine alone withowt other ministers.

T. C. has many ouersyghtes, because the D. does not / or will not see / what
he sets down. You had to prove that the election belongs to the bishop:
to conclude that you bring / that he ordained. Thereunto I answered that yt
follows not / but rather the contrary / that he ordained / therefore he chose
not. I said not symplye that the contrary followed / but rather the contrary.
Your example of the virtues, is altogether unlike / they being so ^^ncked that
he that has one / has al four: which is not in election / and ordination by
your own testimony / confessing that the election may be the peoples / but
not the ordination. The example off the foot, and hand, declares manifestly
that I reasoned against that false conclusion off yours / which upon that the
bishop did ordeine / would needs have yt follow / that he also elected. You
get no advantage in that the word off election / is sometimes taken for
ordination / and contrariwise. For althowghe the words be confounded: yet the
things remain still separated. And if you think that the right off election
is gotten to the bishop / because in steed off saying the bishop ordained / yt
is said the bishop chose: it follows that when in steed of saying the people
chose / yt is said the people ordained / the people also gain the right off
ordinacion. And if you should gain yt / yet be you never the nerer your
purpose / unless you be hable to show / that the bishop alone / withowt the
church did choose / or withowt the college off elders / and other bishops did
ordeine. Therefore in making so great account off this / yowr hookie is
greater then yowr harveste.

Here be vain quarrels against the quotacion / because yt is Diuis. 3. page
204.
said the gloss upon the Act. and not the ordinary gloss: all which
return upon Illyricus. Belyke to avoid the place which says precisely /
that the people owghte to choose / whereunto the D. answers not a word:
althowgh it be warranted by example off the Apostles / and directly to the
cause / which is that the Bishops ordination / owght not to shut out the
peothe peoples election. The D. upon the conjunction disjunctive / ad Rust. mom
would prove Jerome falsified. For that in so much as he says / if either the
people, or the bishop choose thee to be of the clergy, he would conclude /
that the bishope did choose withowt the people. But he should remember / that
if thereby the bishops election be established / withowt the people: by the
same reason the peoples election off the minister is established / withowt the
bishop. If he dare not say that / then let him understand / that I have
faithfully followed the meaning off Jerome / and that this word (or) is not
always a note off separation. Which that it may yet more clearly appear / I
will show the like manner off speech off Leo the first / whose words are, no
reason suffers that they should be counted amongst the bishopes, which
Did. 62.
are nether chosen of the clergy, nether desired of the people, nether
consecrated of the Metrapolitane with the conprouinciall bishops. Here
althowgh the bishop use a disjunctive / as if it should be sufficient to
have any off these / and not all together: yet yt appears both by the decrees
off other (Which foundinge them selves off those words / have decreed that the
people owght to choose with the clergy) and plainly by his words after / that
he mente they should all be joined together. For he adds / when the
question shall be to choose the chief priest (which he called before the
Bishop) let him be preferred whom the consent off the clergy, and people
shall require: and after shows the reason / why the peoples consent owght to
be had.

I grant that I took Musculus words / for Ieromes: yet if that make to the
purpose / I had redd the place. And Jerome Ierom. epistola ad Pam. aduers.
error.
himselffe / in an other place / has a sentence not much unlike. For in a
epistell against the bishope off Jerusalem / he reprocheth him that he
despised the laity deacons / and elders / for that he could in one hour as
himself boasted / make a thowsande clearkes, whereby appears the corruption
which Muscu. speaks of / and which is now used with us / off making so
many at a clappe at the bishopps pleasure only / both the people / and the
elders being neglected: to have been in those times / and yet not to have
gotten such footinge / nether to have been so universally done / but that the
bishops which used that manner / were thereby subject to shamfull reproach.
And how comes yt to pass / that you send Musculus here without all answer?
Which does both flatly condemn all such odinacions / which are made off the
bishop before election off the church and brings Jerome for his warrante /
referring Jerome (which says / there was no election off mynisters at all)
unto that the bishop did appoincte ad Nepo.
whom he lifted / vvithowt the consent off the church. As for the place you
cite owte off that epistle: yt makes not to purpose. For it is not denied
that the bishope has to do in the choice off the minister: but that he alone
has to do.

How Cyprian is wholly ours in this cause / has been showed: Diuis. 4. pa 205.
this exception also is answered. only here it is to be added / that in the
epistle out of which the D. cyteth this example of Aurelius / yt is expressly
said / that Cyp. did not choose him reader of his own authority / but by
authority of his fellow ministers which were present at that time. That he says
here / and alleges after out of Diuis. 2. pa. 212.
Gratians gloss / that the peoples intereste in elections, consists in
bearinge wittnes off the good conversation of the ministers: beside that yt is
a popish shifte (as I have showed) sufficiently before confuted / Diuis. 6.
pa. 164.
yt has no ground in the word testimony, wherout he would pull yt. For by
a figure off metonymy he notes the peoples voice: because by giuinge it / they
gave also testimony what they the wght off him. Where it is to be noted / that
the D. gives no more to the church off God / then S. Paul gives to
strangers from 1. Tim. 3. 7. Epi. 100.
yt / of whom he wills that the bishop shall have a good report.

There follows the open violence done unto August. words. Where first let
the reader observe again / that this wresting of the example of Eradius /
against the election of the church / was taken from Pighius / as appears
manifestly. But for answer Contr. 16
unto Pigbius / and the D. it must be understood / how for that election of
Eradius to be bishop after August. decease / there were assembled two bishopes
besides August. 6. Elders beside Eradius / with the rest of the clergy / and
people. For what purpose all these / if it were in Augustines power to choose
only? After yt appears that Augustine did call the people to have there
consent / because he had experience off trouble / and discontentement of the
people off Millen: for that Seuerus the bishop there / did appoincte his
successor before his death / withowte speakinge any thing theroff unto them:
which could not be avoided off Augustine / if he mente to choose any against
the will off the people. For yt had been better for him to have appoincted one
as Sever us did / vvithowte communicatinge the matter unto them: then in
communicatinge yt / to take one against their wills. Again where the D.
upon those words I will have Eradius my successor, would have that
Augustine only had the election off him: he is confuted by and by after with
his own words / I say that I will have him, because I know that you
will have him. And after he wills that the public notories / should as
well note their voices, as his will in this matter: that (says he) your
consentes fall not to the ground, or become void. Whereunto also pertain /
the subscriptions of them which followed. Which althowgh the D. says are
referred only unto the peticion off Augustine, to be discharged off the
hearing off civil matters: yet the words sound otherwise. For when he
required their subscription to those Acts: yt is clear that he must be
understood / to have spoken off both those matters. otherwise he would have
required subscription to that Act / and not unto the Acts.

And where in the end for an other reason he adds / Augustine was appointed
bishope, when Valerius bishope off Hippo was a live: I see not how it makes
for him one word. For if he think that Valerius off his Authority did it / he
is utterly deceived: seeing Possidonius Possidonius in the life of Augu. Epis.
225.
writes / that Valerius spoke unto the people / to provide / and to ordeine an
elder off the city / and shows how he was ordained by the consent off all
the people. Which thing yff it were not more lighter then the none days / off
this Epistle off August. yet yt might appear by other / as where he declares
/ that Pinianns was ordained off the people / elder off the church / against
his will. more might be alleged / but these shall suffyse. Sauinge that I must
put Master D. in remembrance / how he merueilously forgets him self. For
grauntinge me before / that Page 191.
the council off Carthage whereat Augustine was present / decreed that the
election should be made by the commen consent off the people / clerks / and
bishopes in the same province: he must here needs confess / that either
Augustine did there join together in election with the church / and the
clergy (as they term them): or that he brake the order off the Council /
which could not be vvithowt his fault / although the election off the church
had been (as the D. esteems yt) but a thing indifferent. And the truth is /
yt appears that August. had in that election / an express regard unto the
decree off the council: which caused him beside the eldership off the church /
and people / to send for two other bishops / to be assistants. Whereupon the
reader may see / how there is no light off words so clear / which Phighius /
and the Ans. misled / will not give th^nser to darcken.

Besides that Ambrose calls yt a divine election which is made by the church
/ which he could not onles yt were by the institution off God: the whole
discourse off the Epistle teaches / that the election off the people is there
accounted off / as necessary. For when the church off Vercella did linger the
time in not choosing a bishop / when it was also infected with Heretics:
why did not Amb. at least by way off Lapse, take the election unto him self /
but vvriteth unto them / reprehending them that they did not ask for a bishop
/ as other churches were wont to do?

Gregor. Nazienz. speaking there off diverse elections / vvherin still the
people bore one part / and that withowt controlement: In the or. upon the death
off his father.
speaks more for that election in that one place / then the D. has hitherto
/ or in the residue of his treatise is able to show. And where he might seem
to have somewhat nipped at it / in showing how at certain elections some off
the people were contentious: he heals that even in the next sentence to this
/ saying that at that time it was to be feared, lest he ovvght to judge the
popular regiment better ordered, then their own: and after makes mention off
the corruption off those / which were fellow elders with his father. but
observe I pray you again the D. faith fulness / which expounds the word
churches, the clergy. Where learned he thus to expound? Let it be that as in
the scripture sometime / so in the ancient fathers the eldership off a church
/ is called by the name off church: where can he ever show that the eldership /
or as he terms it the clergy / of one only church / vvherof Greg. speaks /
is called by the name off churches? In steed therefore that he should have
translated / both the richer, and they off great authority in the church, were
clean from that evil: he has translated / the churches that is to say the
clergy, etc taking the nominative plural / for the genitive syngular. Which
although in the latin tongue / if one take not heed unto the sense / may
deceive: yet when the D. had the Greek (which has (...)
off the church) before him / as it seems by cyting the greek in the same
place / by and by after: either he understood it not / or willingly perverted
the meaning. So I leave to the reader / whether I have reasoned to the
purpose, or no: and whether you besides words / have any thing at all.

As in certain other places / so in this / in steed off that I Diuis. 5. Pa
207.
should have taken the quotacion which came after / I taking the quotacion in
my paper book which went before / was deceived: and for the 6. and 7. of
Socrates / set down the 6. and 7. of Eusebius. This verily is the error which
the D. makes so great triumphs of. For the first off the places / it
appears how Chrysostom. Socr. 6. 2. ca.
(there called John / elder of the church of Antioche) was chosen bishop of
Constantinople by co^me^ voice of all both people, and clergy: and how he had
his election ratified / by the Emperor Arcadius. For the seventh book / yt
appears that Chrysanthus Lib. 7. ca. 12.
was chosen bishop off Costantinople / by the people. And when as Sabbatius
(because Chrysanthus hid himself / and would have none off the bishopric) gat
certain bishops to ordeine him into yt: the story shows / how the people
sowght Chrysanthus out / and put out Sabbatius. diverse other examples there be
/ which I leave: as I would also have done these / if it had not been to have
showed / the vain triumphs off the D.

And where he says / that there is nothing in those 6. and 7. of Eusebius. which
makes mention of any election by the people, but in one only, which he goes
about to wipe a way: that thou may know the D. changes not his skin / I
will note them in a word. To leave therefore the election made by revelation /
where he says the election was Lib. 7. ca. 30.
made by the ministers, and pastors: yt is manifest that the churches had to
do in the electio^s. For in the indorceme^t of the letters / whereby an other
was appointed at Antioche / into Samosatenus room: as well authority off the
churches is pretended / as off the bishops / elders / and deacons. Where also
he would clude the other place / first because it was a miracle, then for that
by the word brethren, it is not certain whether the people were noted: for the
first / Euse. 6. 10
yt may appear how vain yt is / seeing the story says / the brethren came
together to choose a bishop. The miracle therefore which came unlooked for off
them / and after they were assembled / was to direct them in their election /
and not to authorize them to choose. For authority they had before: else they
would not have come together for that purpose. As for the other / it is a
boldness too insufferable / withowt showing any one example / and contrary both
unto the phrase off the scripture / and aucient fathers / showed in my former
book / and off Eusebius him self / as may appear page 88. Eus 7. l. c. 11.
and 24. Diuis. 6. pa. 209.
diverse times in some one chapter.

In all these sentences / set down owte of Eusebius. there is not a word for the
D. nor against us. The D. co^sesseth that Origin tawght being a lay man in
the church publicly: he can not deny if he would / but that he tawght by the
appointment off bishops. These two being put / what follows but that in
those days / he was counted a lay man / which took upon him the ministry
upon the bishops appoinctinge only? And that he abuse not his reader with
such rouinge treatises / my reason I will set down in a few words. That
appointement unto the ministry / which was thowght not to inhable to be
minister / was thowght insufficient: but the appointement off the bishops only
/ was thowght not to inhable to be minister (for Origene that had that
appoinctement / and authority / was still coumpted a lay man): therefore that
authority only / was then thowght insufficient. Eusebius therefore giuinge me
this houlde / which the D. is driven whether he will or no to confess* there
is wherewith to uphold that I have said. For if the bishops appointment off
Origin to preach / did not give him any degree in the (...). Ordinatione^

ministry for what cawse did it not / except yt be it at I have assigned? his
tra^slatio^ of Euse. words / when he was yet not ordained minister (wherein
another point off this matter stands) is not warra^ted. For by this means /
he must take one of his words / which properly signifies the choice by
lifting up / and used sometimes of eccesiasticall writers / for laying on of
hands / for a degree: which has no example. Likewise he must take the other /
which I have showed to signify the company of all the governors off the
church / for the office off one only elder: which wants proof. Beside that
Muscul. which translateth yt / seems to have followed the sense I have: where
if he had followed the D. he would have done otherwise. For in steed of he had
not appoinctme^t of the eldership, he would have said the degree of an elder.
Where Ordine^ pre^^yteratus.
he alleges / that Demetrius suffered him to teach at Alexandria, when he was
a lay man, belike thereby to prove / that the reprehension of Demetrius / was
not to be regarded / which did himself that he found fault with in other: yt
makes nothing to this question. For yt is enowghe to that in hand / that yt
is confessed both by Demetrius / and Eusebius (Which takes the defense off
those / whom Demetrius rebuked) that Origene was a lay man / althowghe
appoincted to the preachinge off the word / by the Bishops. Whether yt be
lawful for a lay man to teach the word off God in public place / is an
other question.

The next sect. I leave to the iudgmente of the reader. Of this Chap. 8. the
1. diui. pa 21.
great heap which follows / the most part have been brought before / some
four times at the least: they have been thresshed / and there is no yield /
it shall be seen that the rest / are no better then their fellows. the places
off scripture alleged here / are all answered saving only that of the Acts
13. which is borrowed of Hosius: who uses this place / against the choice by
the church. De Sacramento or dinis 54: cap.
For answer whereunto I say / that it is nor question there off such election /
as we spoke off: that being the election off God / and not off the church. I
for my part rather think / that it was the voice off God by the Prophets /
or one off the prophets: and for proof allege the story in the Crome. which
may be co^me^tary to this. For as the church the^ in distress / by public
prayer / and 2 20 cap: 3. 13. 14. 15. verse.
fast / received comfort throwghe a Prophet / whom the Lord suddenly in the
myddeste off the congregation / raised amongeste them: even so the church off
Antioche being in great distress / and fear off ruin off the church off God
/ partly by the sword / and famine / partly by contentions / and serchinge
remedy by puhlike prayer / and fast: received by a Prophet which the lord
stirred up amongeste them this oracle / whereby he showed them a singular
means / not only to maintain / but to amplify the borders off the kingdom
off Christ. If the S. will not receive this interpretation / but take the holy
ghost to have sounded immediately from heaven: yet it helps him nothing / there
was no place left for any election / but needs must Paul / and Bar. besent.

If therefore the bishop have the spirit off prophecy at any time / whereby he
may have such a certain / and infallible direction / as this was / we will
les stick with him for his sole election: If not / yt is in vain to allege
this example: sauinge that it makes much against him. For if the lord would
have the approbation off the whole company of Doctors / and elders in that
election which him self had made / and where there was no danger off error:
how much more owghte the bishops election / which has so many banks both
off ignorance / and evil conscience / to put him from the way of a good
election / be sustained by the judgment off others. And yt is vntrwe that it
is plain, that the church was here shut forth. For althowgh yt was nether in
the ministers power / nor the peoples / to change this election: yet the fast
there mentioned being general / and the accoumpte off their embassage / and
success thereof being afterward made 14. Act. 27.
unto the church: yt is not unlike but in the approbation which that election
could admit / the church also had her part. That which is here added owte
off Beza / which the D. would have so diligently noted: is but to waste
paper. For we hold that it is most conueniente / the people should have
the ministers / and elders go before / and direct them in their elections.
But yt is most directly against the D. For thereby appears that Beza is off
that mind / that althowgh the people be ignorant / and intractable: yet they
owght not to be cut of from ecclesiastical electio^s / but directed / and
called to some moderation.

Off that which remains in this division / the canons called 2: Diuis. page
212.
the Apostels / that off Antioche / Eusebius / and others which speak off
ordeining / make nothing to this question which is off election: consideringe
that yt has been showed / not only that ordinacion differs from election:
but also that the counsels from time to time / have confirmed the election by
the churches. So that if there have been any elections made by the Bishopes
alone: they have been directly contrary to the tenure of the councelles. In the
council off Nice (althowgh his boldness be greater / then in the other canons)
having changed the words off the council / and in steed off ordinacion /
put election: yet has he no more warrant off the words off that canon / then
off the others. And albeit the general answer is more then sufficient / to
resist such naked assertions: yet even in this council / it is manifestly to
beshewed / that that cano^ is to be understood of ordinacion / as it is
distinguished from election. For in the letters which the Synod off
Constantinople / wrote unto the council holden at Rome / yt is thus written.
Touching the care off the Theodo. li. 5. ca. 9.
government off every church, you know that the oulde decree, and
appointement of the fathers off the Nicene council, has prevailed from time
to time: that the inhabitants in every province, taking to them if they will,
and if yt be profitable, those which are next adioining, should make the
elections. According to the tenure vvherof understand you, that the residue of
the churches with us, are governed. Whereupon we have in our general
council, set our bishopp off Constantinople Nectarius, in the sight off the
Emperor Theodosius, and clergy off that city, the whole city giving their
voices thereunto. And so goes forward with the election off the bishop off
Antioche / and confirmacion off the bishop off Jerusalem. Where yt appears
manifestly / not only that the ordinacion given by that canon to the bishop /
did not shut out the election off the people: but that yt implied necessarily /
an election by the people / and clergy joined with yt. For the Synod says /
that those elections which were made by consent of the church / were made
according to the decree off the Nicene council. And if it should be as the D.
pretends / that the council off Nice meant to give the whole interest off
election unto the bishops / and to take yt from the church: then could not
that council have said / that Lib 2. Histor. tripart. (...). Did. 67.
they made the Nicene council the squire off their elections / when they
admitted the suffrages off the people. And that there be no doubt heroff / I
will set down the words off the council off Nice / which are these. Let the
people choose, and the bishop approve, and seal up the election with them.

For Gratians distincions with his gloss: first them selves give me defense
enough / against all the force wherewith they assail this cause: as when he
says / that the other priests under degree off a bishop, may be ordained off
their own bishop, so that both the citisens, and the rest off the priests
give their assent. And the gloss upon the second canon off that distinction /
saying / the Bishop alone may give the degree unto priests: adds / alone
that is to say, vvithovvt other bishopps. Then I In catal. test. veritatis.
could oppose the authority off Illyricus: which shows plainly / that the
words cited out off the 63. distinction by the D. be a mere lie off Gratian.
Howbeit I will not give either Gratian / or his gloss that honor / as once to
vouchesafe him off any answer in the church of God. And that thou may know
good reader / what manner of man he was / of whom the D. plunged seeks help
/ with commendation also of his interpretation / even where it is condemned
off protestants writers off our time / as here thou see / and further shall
appear: I will in a word advertise the.

That whether he were the brother off Lombard / tharchepiller of Antichrists
seat / borne with a third brother of a strompet (as they write which cover the
shame of his birth) or Lombardes bastard / conceined by a Nun / which by
revelation accompanied her self with Lombard: whether so ever I say he
were off these / this is certain / that in gatheringe the canons off the
councelles / he endeavored by might / and maine / to make them agree with the
Patron off the adulterous church off Rome. Therefore in going about / to
reconcile thee gouernemente off the elder churches off Christ / with that
vpstarte Synagogue off Antechriste / as yt were to make accord between the
owl / and the raven: there is no kind of false dealinge / nether in addinge /
changinge / dimynishinge / false interpretinge / nor other corruptions / and
that contrary to the clear light off words / controrolmente off records
extante to confute him / wherein he has not carried away the bell of
vnshamfastnes / from all that ever wrote before him / or in his time. Off these
corruptions there are almost as many both vvitnesses / and gath erers off our
own cotrey men / and of others: as have at any time been exercised in this
field off confutation / off the popish religion. As for his glossers / as the
Popes hired servants / such as flattered for a cruste off bread / saying yea
to his yea / and nay to his nay: they shall go to gether with their master.
And let even this place of the D. before a sey off the glosses impudency / in
expounding Leos words. For where Leo speakinge of election / sets forth the
intereste Tom 1. Council. Epist. Leonis primi 82. and 90. Diuis. 2. page 264.
Diuis. 4. page 205.
of the churches with all these words / that the minister ovvghte to be chosen
by the consent off the people, by the voices off the people, by their good
vvilles, and that none be ordained which they desire not, which they vvishe
not for, which they require not: all these words this good gloss brings me
unto this / that the people should only give testimony off his good
behavior, which is before confuted. And if he say here that I deal not
equally / which bar him off that authority that I have sometimes used my
self* he owghte to remember that a foreine testimony / and witness off an
enemy is glorious / and that I having war in these questions off the
discipline / not only with him / but with the Papists / might with
commendation strike the^ things with their own sword / which he (having
herin the same cause which they have) can not do.

That which is gathered off Ambroses election / owte off Theodorete / is most
vntrwe* for yt is manifest / that Ambrose was chosen by the whole church off
Mylane / and never a word to prove / that the Bishops had the right off
election: but the contrary by the words / and circumstances off the story.
And whereas upon the bishops offer unto the Emperor to appointe one / the D.
would make the intereste of election / a runninge / and walkinge right:
first as the emperors gave unto the bishops / things which were unmeet
for them: so yt was no marvel if the bishops sometimes offered unto the
Emperors / Theod. lib. 4. ca. 5.
that which perteined not unto them. Which may well appear there by the
answer off the good Emperor / which refused yt as a thing which he had not
to do with / and unmeet for him. Secondly yt is very like / that for the
diversities of judgments which were emongeste the people / the bishops
perceiuinge that they should run into displeasure off one off the parties /
would have been glad to shifte off that evil will / and lay yt on the
Emperor / which was better hable to bear it. last of all / they offered the
Emperor that / which he willed them to do: which when yt was to ordeine
only / as the issue declared / and not to choose / the churches election can be
by no means prejudiced / in that offer off the bishops. As for Chrysostomes 3.
book de Sacerdotio, beside that I doubt not but if yt had any thing of
Valewe for you / you would allege yt: yt is the same authority which Hosius
De Sacr. ordinis.
alleges / and alleges in gross (as the D. does) against the churches
election.

To the D. first reason against the churches election / which stands in
that there have been great contentions, and diversity off Diuis. 3. page 213.
minds amongeste the churches: I answer / that the Apostles when there fell a
contention / and a iarr amongst those off the church / never entered into any
such deliberation / off cuttinge away Act. 6.
the churches liberty: contrariwise they esteemed the neareste way to heal
up the breach / to give them some thing more in that election off Deacons /
then was ordinary. For where they were accustomed to show the way in other
elections / and by ripenes off their judgment help the weakness off the
People / there they suffering the church to go before / followed with their
approbation. And not only in respect off that election / but if a man will
consider the whole estate off the primative church in the Apostles time: it
shall appear plainly / that if there were ever good cause / to take away the
churches election throwgh contentions / and diversities off minds / that was
in the Apostles times. For the churches off God then / almost throwghowt the
world standinge of Jews / and gentiles / and there being such a natural hate
between those two peoples / as whatsoever the one would / the other commenly
vvoulde not / and contrariwise: if the Apostles had judged that for reason /
which the D. estemeth high vvisdome: they should never have permitted any
election unto the churches. For albeit the knittinge off both those peoples
into one profession off the gospel / did mortefy that deadly hatred / which
was naturally in the^: yet notwithstanding yt appears by diverse places off
the scripture / that there were such remnantes Act. 15. 24. Romans 14. 15.
Ephesians. 2
off that hatred left / that nether the Apostles them selves which were so
wise peace makers / and so kunninge tiers off love knotes / nor yet the
ministers / and elders which had received the first fruictes off the spirit
off God / could keep them from most dangerous contencions. And Master
Zuinglius off whom the D. would seem to receive some succor in this cause /
even when their churches were most dangerously infected with Anabaptistry /
Ecclesiastes.
and many nourished it in wardly which durst not utter it openly: teaches
that this form off choice by the church / was to be kept. Nether is it to
be passed by / that Basil notes Basil. Epist. 58.
that one Anthimus / in choosinge a bishop withowt the churches voices / filled
all Armenia with sedition. Whereunto add the testimony off Chrysostom: where
he askinge why Peter communicated the election withdraw the Disciples, answers
/ lest the Upon Act. 1^
matter should be turned into a bravvle, and have fallen to a contention.
When he assigns the cause off contention (clean contrary to the D.) that
the election was not communicated with the church.

Secondarily if the churches elections should be taken away / because off
co^tentions which happen in them: Monarchies which often have declyned into
tyra^nie / and been abused to oppression off the subjects / should have had
an end long a go: and other such most lawful / and necessary aides off
this present life / owghte to be taken away / as those which are abused. And
to come to ecclesiastical affairs / councelles by the D. reason owght to have
no place in the churches off Christ / off which it is said / Nazianz. Ep. 42.
ad Procop. Bas. 102. Epist.
that there was never seen good issue of them: and that throwgh merueilous
ambition / and desire off contention in them / things ovvte off order were
not remedied, but made worse.

Thirdly the examples off the contentions which the D. has heaped up to
gether / beside that they are in part not off the church with yt self / but
off the church with hererickes / which is her commendation / as in the election
off Ambrose: beside that also it is noted specially / that the people off
Alexandria was off a Mutinous / and stirring nature / and therefore unjustly
objected against the whole estate of the church: beside this I say / these
examples alleged by the Answ. are so far from weakeninge the churches
election / that they make yt stronger. For notwithstanding those contentions
had / under both Christian magistrates / and Bishops: there was not only no
counseill taken / to bar the churches off their election: but were (as has
been showed) counsels from time to time / to ratify yt. And if the Emperors
/ and Bishops had not thowght yt necessary / that the churches should have
intereste in their elections / or had thowght (as the D.) that both the
churches were put in hasarde of false teachers / and the commenwealth off
vprores / by reason off popular elections: yt had been great folly / or madness
rather / to have suffered that which they might have so easelie remedied. Which
opinion off the necessity off the churches interest / as yt has appeared by
diverse examples before alleged: so may it clearly be seen / in the letters
off the good Emperor Constantine / to the Cytisens off Nicomedia. which
althowghe they had chosen to his great grief / Theodo. li. 1. c. 19.
one Eusebius Bishop: does not therefore take away the election from them /
but moves to a new. And albeit they had abused their right / in choosing such
a one as was an Arian / a runnigate from his former bishoppricke / a railer of
the Emperor: yet he confesses still / that yt belonged unto them / to make a
hew election.

Fourthly / what will he say to that / that the people bridled the rage of the
scribes / and pharisees against the truth / and ministers Math. 21. 26. Act. 5.
26. Sozo. li. 7 ca. 7. Theodo. li. 2. ca. 7.
theroff / in that they were a fraide off them? that the Bishop off the church
being an Arrian / the people have been for the most part Catholic? That also
the Emperor has displaced the catholic bishop / chosen by the church / and
placed an Arian? Which disorders being often committed by the Bishops / may
by the D. rule / as well deprive them of their intereste in ordering / and
confirming / as the people in chosing. What also that the evil disposition off
the people / has for the most part proceeded off the moving off their evil
governors? So that people diverse times good / when the rulers were naught /
has been seldom naught / when their governors were good. besides all this /
there are other faults off Symonie / off choice off most dissolute / and most
unlearned ministers / wherewith the sole election off the bishops is so infamous
/ and the churches election scarsly to be touched with: that many contentions
off the people / would draw les blould off the church / then the choice
only off one such blind / and lame minister / as many off the assemblies off
the bishops for that purpose / send forth by whole armies.

Last all / as in other reasons before I have showed / that the D. defendinge
the same cause which the Papists / uses the very self same armor /
bournished by the names off Zuinglius / Insti. lib. 4. c. 5. se. 2. 3.
Calvin / Beza / etc. so here he has the very self same reason / which the
Papists used for the bishops sole election / whereunto Calvin makes answer.
For unto the Papists saying / that the people were shut forth because off
the contentions / and tumultes which happened often times: he answers
confessing there were such motions / and sturres / but that the taking away
off the churches election / was browght in for a remedy against those sturres /
he affirms to be a plain lie. and shows that there were other ways to
meet with those disorders / as to punish them which should move any tumult.
And so goes forward in shewinge the true cawse off the falling away off this
liberty / from the church. To all the rest off his reasons I have answered
before at large / sauinge that he has embossed owte this last / with a
sentence Hosius li. de legit. iudic rerum eccl.
off Chrysostom upon John / drawn from Hosius: who uses this testimony
against the election of the church. Where both Hosius / and the Ans. should
have learned / to have put a difference between a confused multitude, and the
church off God. For I would ask off Hosius (how shamles so ever he be)
whether he dare define the church off God / which is the spouse / and body off
Christ / to be a certain thing full off tumulte, and sturres, consistinge,
ad rashly compacted for the most part of folly, etc. and yet either the answer
is not afraied to say / that this is the difinition / that is to say the very
nature / and unchangeable property of the church off God: or else if he
understand yt of some other company / he has said nothing against the
election off the church. And verily I can not see / how he could speak more
vilely / of the most disordred rowte / off most godles people: then he seems
to do off that assembly / which being indewed with the wisdom of the most
higheste / he calls a thing consistinge off folies: and which being the
pillar off truth he lykeneth unto waves off the sea. By which symilitude the
scripture sets forth the estate of the reprobate / or at least off the
wicked which have as yet no Iam. 1. 6.
society with our Savior.

Therefore to conclude / saying that the election off the church in her
ministers / has ground out off the word off God / both in commandment /
and continual practice / both in the old Testamente / and in the new:
consydering also it has allowance off commen reason / the approbacion off all
times after the Apostles / as long as there was any sincerity / in peace and
perquution / both by counsels / and Emperors decrees / both by godly writers
ancient / and off our time: and considering he has not so much as browghte an
example to the contrary / owte off any auror / and if he could yet the same
is condemned / not only by the word off god / but by continual good harmony
off counsels / one in the neck of another diverse 100 years: and forasmuch as
the Ans. has this question of election by the bishope only / commen with the
Papists / and has had both sword / and buckler ministered him owte off the
most grosseste Papists: I conclude / that both the church owghte to have her
consent in the election off her ministers: and that the sole authority / off
bishops creating ministers / is unlawful.

Unto this question off election / and ordination belongs the 2. chapter of
the 4. tract. of ceremonies in ordeining: off which the 2. Division being
answered / and the first / and third unworthy of answer / there remains only
the fowrth. Against that he alleges / that the bishop might as well say
receive the holy ghost to the ministers made by him, as to use the words off
the Lords supper, Page 228.
I replied that there was a commandment for the one, and not for the other:
whereunto he says / that there is no special commandment, Which is no
answer. For if the general commandment off kepinge that whole institution /
do comprehend this being aparte theroff / then the argument stands. That
he brings off the minister, saying withowt inconvenience This is my body,
and in recital off the commandments, thou shalt have no other god but me:
is nothing worth / saying the inconvenience is taken away by preface / off God
spoke these words: Christ took bread, etc. The place of Timothe with
Master Caluins exposition / is utterly impertinent. For it is not question
whether God does give his gifts to them which he calls / or no: but whether
he gives them by this means / of saying receive, etc. where he says / that
the Apostels when they laid on their hands, likely used these words: it is
vntrwe / considering that Saint Luke / pursuing the least of those ceremonies
which were used / made no mention off it / being in the D. judgment /
worthiest off all other to be followed. And if they had used yt / yet yt
followed not that the bishops may do it: considering that it was proper only
to the Apostles / to give the gifts off the holy ghost / by layinge on off
hands.

Where he says / that Christ commaundinge the sea to be quiet, and breathing
upon his disciples, confirmed his divinity: I answer that he did the same /
in commanding to receive the holy ghost / which otherwise he would have
prayed for / as at other times when he gave testimony off his humanity.
Calvin althowgh he use not the same 4. lib. Instit. 19. c. 29. sect. Ioh. 11.
43. Mat. 9. 5.
example / yet uses the like when he compares the imitation off these words /
receive the holy ghost, with those being said to Lazarus dead in his grave /
come forth, and to the Palseie man / rise, and walk. And his breathing being
the Sacrament off those words receive the holy ghost: they must off
necessity be referred to the same end. So that if our Savior would declare
his deuinity by one: it was his mind to do the same by the other. And if
because he instituted a minister by those words / they are to be used: then
the breathing also must lykwise / considering that he used that / for the
confirmacion off the words. Where he says / they contain a perpetual
promise, off the presence off the spirit, with those which Christ shall call:
even so does the commaundinge off the sea / etc. to be quiet / contain a
perpetual promise / that the wind / and sea should rise / and fall / for the
profit off those which be the Lords. But as there is no promise / that that
shall be in abating their rage / so foundainly as our Savior Christ did: so
there is no word / that the Lord will give his spirit / by pronouncing off
this sentence.

The bishop (says he) has no meaning to command. Nether had the Papists:
but why he should speak one thing / and mean another / he can show no
reason. therefore our fault being in this poincte / the same with the
Papists: has the same Censure off writers / inueighing against this
unadvised imitacion. That which is said / that if any patron off calling is to
be followed, our savior Christ's owghte: is a gross begging of that in
controversy / and then apparently refuted / in that our Savior Christ gave
new names in his ordination / sent forth two by two / commanded Mar. 3. 16.
17. Luke 10. 1. Matt. 10. 10.
they should carry no weapon / etc. which can have no place in our ordinacions.
Where I alleged that the reason was not one in these words / and in the words
off the supper / in that the minister does not command that the bread be the
body / but says yt is: he answers nothing.

Tract. 3. and 4. according to the D. That all ordinary Ministeries / are
annexed to a certain place.
THe A. in heaping up certain differences / between the office off an Apostle /
and Pastor / answers nothing to the Diuis. 1: page ^16.
matter. Yff this be true which is set down / that they be like in this / that
a certain church is to a pastor / or a minister / which the twelfth place was
then amongst the Apostels: the reason off the Adm. is maintained. For then as
it was not lawful for them / to have proceeded unto a new election / if Judas
had not fallen from his ministry: so it is not lawful to ordeine Pastors /
so long as the place is full. likewise if the Apostels would not undertake any
election / but where they had the light / and guide off the word off God / to
show them the way / not only what manner a one / but when he should be
chosen: much less is it lawefull for the Bishops. The first off these being
so clear as the A. durst not plainly deny / he does notwithstanding pushe at
privily / saying / that Paul, and Barnabas were added above the nombre off
twelve. But he should have known / that they were added by the Lord / and not
by the church: where he should have showed that the Apostels / etc. chose the
thirtenth Apostle. And we deny not but the Lord may now (if yt seem good
unto him) choose some Minister / which has no certain place.

That which he obiecteth off Epaphroditus / etc. to be Apostels / such as we
speak off: is an absurd begging off that which is in question. Where against
the second point he says / that there is no such thing in the Election off
the Pastors, as that in their election, the scripture should be fulfilled, etc.
allthoughe there be not so particular a word / as off chusinge one into Judas
place / yet there is a certain rule / in obedience whereoff the scripture is
daily fulfilled. And so falls also his other exception / which supposes that
off one example, we make a general rule. Considering that we crave no further
help off that example / then the same was compassed by the word off God. The
A. grauntinge the distinction Diuis. 2. Pa 217.
off ordinary / and extraordinary Ministeries / and yet denying that it can
be warranted by the scriptures poursueth his former train / off shrincking the
scriptures. Saying yt follows thereuppon / that some truth in Divinity /
cannot be warranted by the word off God. The question moved off the Elders /
is out off place: the answer whereunto shall be differred / unto the proper
treatise. The absurd speeches which he has here / and in the next Division off
Apostels / Evangelists / and Prophets / come to be examined in the answer to
his third chap.

Here first he trifleth with his reader / whilst he supposes Diuis. 4. page
229.
that I ground the function off Elders / upon the 4. off the Ephesians. and that
Iesteme that place a perfect rule of Ecclesiastical functions, when as not
only I have no syllable sounding that way: but have declared the contrary /
in that by a long discourse in the question off the Archbishop / I have showed
that that place is only of the Ministeries / occupied in the word. That which
he speaks here off ouerseing shepherdes / and watchmen / belongs to the 6.
Division where yt is repeated. That off one shepherd having many flocks /
belongs to the question off having many benefices. Yt remains to maintain
that part off the Division / which sets down the Doctor off the church / as
a several member from a Pastor. Which may appear by that the Apostle places
them both to the Romans / and Ephesians. as diverse. To. 12. 7. Ephesians. 4. 11
beside that the gifts differing / whereby those functions are executed / and
there being apt to teach / and therefore meet for the office off a Doctor /
which have no grace in exhortacion / or moving the affections off the hearers /
and therefore not so fit to be Pastors: yt must follow / that the functions be
diverse.

And where the Ans. opposes unto us the judgment off one / or two: it is
easy to show / not only more authorities off private men / but the use off
the Elder churches / even from the Apostels time: Epecially in Alexandria /
where the distinction off the Bishop / and Doctor off the church / is so often
observed by the ecclesiastical story: also the coustome continued in
cathedral churches (as they are called) wherefrom time to time beside the
Bishop / has been a reader. And if these were not distinguished: the^ must it
needs follow / which in an other place the A. denies / that there were
ordinarily two Bishops in one church / considering that beside the Elders / and
him which they commonly called the bishopp / there was also a Doctor. Nether
ought it to be any hinderance to this distinction / that Saint Paul coupleth
the Pastor, and Doctor together, where as he sundred the rest that go before,
by this word Some. For the conjunction does not couple them in signification
/ but makes them only couples off the liberality off Christ / toward his
church. Especially considering that both this conjunction And, is oftentimes a
note to couple several members off one division: and the Apostel would rather
have said or Doctors, then and Doctors, if he had meant to make them all one.
But all this had not needed / if the Ans. would have stood by his former
word / in the writing entitled The Doctors book. For in saying / there that
the Apostle in the Epistle to the Corint. speaks only off Apostels,
Prophets, and Doctors, Leaving out Evangelists, and yet Evangelists, and
pastors necessary: he does manifestly confess / that these functions differ
between them selves. Nether can he say / that he spoke there according to my
sense. For I had not then either spoken / or written any word off that matter.

Thus in that he is called the Doctor off such a church / in page 234.
part is answered the question how yt can be showed, that he is tied to a
certain church. And for further answer / when as admitting that there is
such an office / he can not deny but the institution off it / is amongst
other spoken of unto Titus: all those mynisteries being appointed to a certain
town / and congregation / yt follows 1. Tit. 5.
that that office is likewise. Moreover considering that exhortation / and
doctrine be necessary for the interteinement off a church in the trwe service
off God: in that S. Paul parting these between 12. Romans 7. 8.
the Pastor / and Doctor / and placing the office off the Pastor especially in
exhortation / ascribes that off teaching principally to the Doctor: yt
follows that the Pastor being tied unto a place / the Doctor must also.
whereby is likewise answered his other question / how it can be proved, that the
doctor was given in aid off page 234.
the pastor. for the pastor being by the ba^des of his vocation / especially
tied unto exhortation: a supply of teaching being needful / it must be
fetched at his hands / whose proper profession that is. Last off all / herby
appears / what an abuse yt is in the university / that they are created
doctors which not only do not the office / but have not so much as a
certain place assigned to teach in: which amongst other / are the two
principal things I mislike / as unlawful. Where in the end off his book he
says / that it Page 781.
were cofusion, and Barbarism to take away such degrees: he does shameful
injury to diverse reformed churches in Sauoy / and Swisserland: where all kind
of learning / and good behavior flourishing / those degrees are not. But it is
to be noted that together with the churches / Musculus especially has his part
in this charge off Barbarism, etc. The churches not having the other degrees
in arts / which are indifferent / give no sentence off the Doctorshipp: but
Musc. does plainly declare his misliking. For having spoken against the popish
Doctors / he adds: wherefore I have Upon 1: Cor. 12.
often merueiled, what diverse notable ministers off Christ mean, that they
glory so much off the title off an university Doctorship: as though any
authority came to their doctrine thereby. Where it is known that those whom he
meant / were modest / gloriyng no further / then that as a means to draw more
credit to their ministry / they received it: which Muscul to wcheth them for.
Therefore onles he had been driven headlong / he would at least have left his
degrees indifferent: and not such as withowt which / no godly honesty / nor
civility can stand.

In the next division his answer is insufficient. For the reason against
reading Ministers / is not only because they are appoincted to no certain
place: but for that they are utterly without all ministry / and whether ever
they shall be or no / yt hangs either off their own / or off their patrones
pleasure. So that if either he forthincking him self / like the shop better
then the church: or the patron will keep the door shut against such
insufficient men / which the bishopp opened so wide: or (as sometime falls
out) they can not agree of their market: yt comet to pass that he is made a
Minister / which either can not / or will not / not only not fulfill / but not
so much as lay hand off that ministry / whereunto he was appointed. Contrary
unto the rule off Saint 1. Timo. 3. 10.
Paul / that leueth not this in choice: but commands precisely / that if
after trial they be found blameles / they should exercise their ministry.

To prove that there may be a rouing ministry / and some which may have the
walk of a whole province / here is first alleged Diuis. 6. page 220.
that the Apostels visited the places where there were several Pastors.
Whereunto the answer is / that that function off the Apostels was extraordinary
(as shall appear) and therefore at no hand to be drawn unto our times.
Secondly is brought the example of Darius / which beside 120. gouernoures set
over the several provinces, made three other to ouersee the^. Whereunto I
answer / that the Lord has in assigning offices off the commen wealth / left
the liberty unto men / which he has not done in offices off the church. The
reason whereoff is manifest: considering that they both are off greater
sufficiency to ordeine offices / for the commodities of this life / then for
those off the life to come: and the error in appointing of them / is not so
dangerous. Eusebius shows how Lib. 4. de vit. Constant.
Constantine invented new degrees off honor / to pleasure those which were
about him. This not being forbidden in civil government / I think the A.
dare not say it is lawful to be done in the government off the church.

Hereby also is answered the surmise off kings which being called sheapherds,
should by this means have their dominions restreined unto the government off
one city. For the scripture having not determined / whether there should be a
Prince over every city / as it has that every assembly should have a pastor:
and the enmities / and assaults against the civil estate / not being so great
/ and dangerous as against the spiritual: yt can by no means follow / that
the tying off the Minister unto one church / should enclose the Princes
aucoritie in the circuit off one city. But it is to be observed / that both
the D. reasons / off the Apostels visiting / and of Darius policy / lead to
Rome. For yt follows upon them / that one may have oversight of all the
Ministers: seeing that both every off the Apostels / had authority to visit any
church through the world / and even off those three which were over the
governors off 120. provinces / Daniel was the chief. And albeit we leave no
place / either to those rouing / or owtgrowne ministeries: yet the sheapherds /
and watchme^ want not therefore their overseers, considering that the
Ecclesiastical Senate / does not only watch over the body off the church: but
every one off them over an other / and especially over the mynister. off these
also as every one in brotherly equality ought to admonish: so iontly they
have authority not only to admonish / but by Ecclesiastical censures to
chastise the default off their minister. If they also fail / the Synodail
assemblies have interest / as I have before alleged. And if the fault be such
as requires cyuill punishment: the Magistrate is the watchman / appointed off
God for that purpose.

Where he says that a similitude makes a matter plain, but proves not: when
I added / they were arguments drawn off the nature off things / whereunto the
Ministers are likened / and are for the most part used by the holy ghost
himself: I prevented that objection / whereunto the S. says nothing. But if
they prove nothing / because they were similitudes: then his answers to
overthrow them / being bare similitudes / and in things wherein they be
compared most unlike / are insufficient. The rest off the second section off
this division / which is almost a whole side / is perteining to the question
off Residence / and off having two benefices. Unto these arguments which I
used / as how they should know his voice, when they can not hear yt?
acknovvledge him, when they can not know him: follow him when they can not
see him go before? or how he should heal their diseases, when he can not
possibly know them? he answers Diuis. 7. page 222. 1. Tit. 5. Act. 14. 23.
not a word.

That S. Paul in commanding to appoint Elders throwghe every city / meant
every company off the faithful / rising unto a nombre convenient to meet in
one assembly: yt is manifest by the place off Saint Luke / where yt is said /
that elders were ordained thorowghout every congregation. Whereunto albeit the
Ans. could say nothing / yet in pressing the word city / he shows his good
will. Unto this yt may be added / that the scripture uses oftentimes for
shortness sake / by a city to comprehend as well towns / and villages / as the
great cities. For where Saint Matthew has city / or town / S. Luke has
city only: and in Mat. 10. 11. Luk 10. 8.
diverse places off the tenth of Saint Matthew. 9 and 10. off Luke / the precepts
given off the Apostels behavior in the cities / are necessarily understood
off other places. Likewise that both M. Beza / and Erasmus reformed herein the
old translatour / changing his translation off city by city (as that which
attained not fully to the meaning off the Apostle) into a more general speech
/ off town by town. This shall yet better appear / in the 3. cha. 8.
Tract. where it shall be showed / how the institution off God is / that a Bishop
should be not off a diocese (such as ours) or province / but off a particular
church. Which treatise I would have drawn hither / as unto the proper place /
but that these places are so entangled with the question off the Dominion off
the Bishop / that I could not without too great trouble off the reader / sever
yt. Where he says that Saint Paul commanding to appoint Ministers to certain
places, did not thereby forbid Titus to make Ministers having no certain
place: he should understand / that S. Paul knew he had to do with one / which
had learned well that lesson off the law off God / Thou shall only do that
which I command the. And it is shameful injury done to Titus / once to
think that he made kinds off Ministeries / whereof he had no commission by
the Apostle. The rest is nothing / but a manifest begging off that which is in
question.

Where I alleged the council off Calcedon / that none should be ordained
losely / but unto some special congregation: the D. being at a bay / and
having no place to escape / comes upon me with open mouth / and will bear
the reader in hand / that I have falsified the Council, and why? forsooth
becawse I have left out these words, Or in the place off Martyrs burial, or
in monastery. I left them out in deed / because we have no use off (...).
them. Howbeit what syllable is there here / which helps him / or in all the
canon which he has set down? That the council men^ not, that a man must off
necessity be ordained to a certain place, but that he should have some stay off
living: is directly contrary to the counsels words / which expresses the
first plainly / and off the later speaks nor a word. The reasons used have
not so much as any sense / and are drawn first from the filthy puddle off
Popish divinity / that there be eccesiasticall ministeries withowt cure / and
places not neding any pastoral charge: whereas if those monasteries etc. were
lawful assemblies / every ecclesiastical ministry was as necessary for them
/ as for other. Afterward they are drawn from a shameless corruption off the
councels words / by sworn ennemies off all good order in the church: which to
overthrow a plain meaning / have interpreted vvithovvt having some title,
withowt having some possession, or living.

And that I have set down the true meaning off this council / may easily
appear by an other: which forbad this wandering from city to city. For
Theodoret reprehending Eusebius Theod. 1. 19.
bishop off Nicomedia / for leaving his own church to be bishop in an other:
alleges a canon whereby yt was ordained / that none either bishop, or elder
should go from city to city. Whereby appears / they had all certain places.
Yea the D. Denis shall give testymony unto us in this behalf / whose words be:
we have appoincted to every elder his proper parish, and church 1. Tom. conc.
Epis. ad Sever.
yeard, and ordeine that every one keep his own right, so that none enter
into the bounds off an other parish: but every one content him self with his
own, and so govern the church committed unto him, that he may give account,
etc. But that this shameful: facing off the D. may be manifest / I will set
down Caluins judgment off this canon / whereby shall better appear who has
used most faith herein / he or I. Speaking against the Popish making off
ministers / he says: But it was ordained in Inst. 4. li. ca. 5. se. 4.
the council off Calcedon, that there should be no absolute ordeining off
ministers, that is to say, onles there were a place assigned, where the
ordained might exercise his charge. Here is the same sense / and exposition off
the council which I have followed / as full in every point. now let us hear
out off what school the D. exposition comes. He adds a little after: But
our Romish masters, which think nothing to be cared for but the belly,
first interpret a title, a sufficient revenue vvherby he may be able to live,
whether left off his freindes, or by some benefice. Therefore ordeining a
priest, or Deacon if he able to live, they give him the degree: not regarding
where he should exercise his ministry. But who will ever admit, that the
little which the council requires, is a yearly revenue to maintain himself
with? And after showing other frauds / Sect. 5.
whereby they have deluded other counsels / which confirmed this / he adds is
yt not alvvaies absurd, to ordein an elder, to whom there is no place
appointed? whereby appears not only Calu. judgment off this question: but
how impudent a corruption off the council / he estemeth this / which the D. so
greatly allows.

The council off Vrbane owght to make the D. blush: and the corruptions which
he to so small purpose / charge his book with / cause it to speak so loud
/ that the very deaf ears owght to hear. For this divinity off the later
popery which he mainteineth / being condemned off the former: has thereby a
brand of corruption / whereby it may be known. Consydering that popery give
still from evil to worse / and that it was not able to put this order off the
church to flight: until yt approaching unto her full age / had gotten greater
strenght off wickedness. What Jerome has of this matter / I have showed. In the
next Division beside this question / whether yt be convenient for a minister to
take wages, which can live off his own / which I will not enter into / there
is nothing but bare repetition / and open petition of that in controversy. The
next chap. of Ceremonies in ordeining, is answered before.

That functions off Apostels / Evangelists / and Prophets are not ordinary.
Chap 3. page 229.
TO thend it may be better understood / that the D. has here in maintenance
of his Anabaptisticall dream / so confusedly turned upon heaps: I will first
maintain the arguments which I have set down: after answer unto his reasons
taken out of the scripture: thirdly show how impudently he has abused the
authority / both of elder / and later writers / to cover this phrenesie. Which
shall be done so much the shorter / as he is unworthy any answer at all. First
to nip at the distinction off ordinary / and extraordinary functions / received
off all which have but a sparkle off judgment / he says / that the gift off
foretelling things to come, was for the time wherein yt was, ordinary. Which
beside that yt is senseles / yt being ordinary in this part / which is done by
a settled order / and rule appointed off God unto his church: yt is also from
the purpose / consideringe / that the question is not off an ordinary function
/ in the beginning off the Gospel: but off the gospel symply / which reaches
to the whole estate off the church / under the Gospel. Therefore forasmuch as
he can not deny / but such Prophets (if any were) should now be
extraordinary: the distinction stands.

After to that I set down off the word Apostel, extended in the proper
signification to all Ministers that are sent, which the knowledge of the Greek
word might have led him to / he opposes Diuis. 2. pa. 230.
Calvin / which says / in the proper signification it only comprehends the
nombre off 12. Wherein he declares himself but a trifler. For onles he be at
defiance with his grammar: he shall be constreined will he nill be / to confess
it to be true which I have set down. That which Master Calvin says / is not
contrary: considering that where I spoke off the general use off the word /
he spoke of the use off it in the new Testament / where it is most usually
taken in that sense. As for that he says / it is the proper signification: he
means not the natural as I meant / and expressed: but the particular / in
which sense proper is also taken / which appears in that he calls the other
general. Upon Philip. 2. page 231.


Where I assigned a proper note off an Apostell, to be called immediately off
God: he sets him self to confute it / when a little before he had statly
confessed / that yt is a thing proper unto the Apostels, to be called off God
immediately. His first exception is of Matthias, page 229.
which he says was not so chosen: which is utterly untrue: where he says also
that I confess the same: that is an open untruth. For page 132.
I showed that the election out off those two / was permitted unto lot that
thereby the Lord might from heaven / declare whom he would have to be an
Apostell. So that the church chose no Apostle / but only chose two off the
which one was taken by the Lord / to be an Apostle. His other exception is off
Barnabas, which being an Apostle (as he says) appears by the 11. off the
Acts, not to have been called immediately: where there is not a word which
confirms that / and therefore he durst not note the place / whereoff he
gathered yt. Where he says it can not be proved by the scripture, that he was
so called: he beggeth the thing in controversy / not able to answer the
reasons alleged. For where he says / that S. Paul does not say that he saw
Christ to prove that he was an Apostel, but to prove that he was not inferior
to other Apostels: he is manifestly confuted both by the words going before /
and following after. For having propounded this for his question / am I not an
Apostell, 1. Cor. 9 12.
and not as he says / am I inferior to any Apostel: he adds for a reason /
have I not seen Christ. And in the next words that follow / if I be not an
Apostell unto others, yet I am to you, he declares that the estate off the
question is there / whether he were an Apostel / or no. To that I alleged off
the protestants / proving that the Pope can not be Peter's successor, because
there is no succession into the office off an Apostell: he aswereth not.

To that I alleged off Epaphroditus called an Apostel, not in respect of the
ministry of the word, but as sent with relief Diuis. 3. pa 231.
unto Saint Paul: he patcheth out an answer almost of as many coulors / as he
alleges autorities. out off the Centuries / that he was an Apostel in that
sense that Paul, and the rest off the Apostels were. Which beside that yt is
false (they only affirming that he was an Apostel) is clean contrary to that
he alleges out off Calvin / that it is taken there generally, for any sent to
preach: and therefore it can not be taken in that signification off Apostels /
in which the 12 and Paul. yt is contrary also to that out off Ambrose / which
saying that he was therefore called an Apostel, because he was sent off Paul:
confirms in part that which I have set down / that he was called an Apostle
/ not in respect off any dignity off ministry / above others Ministers off
the word: but only in that he was sent. Finally contrary to that alleged out
of Theodoret / which so calls him an Apostle: that forthwith also he makes
him to be a Bishop. When as if he be a Bishop / he can not be such an Apostell
as the 12. considering that they be two several members off the ministers off
the Gospel / differing by the D. own confession / at the least in the place
of exercise off their mystery: the bishop having an especial bond to his
Bishopric / and the Apostel preaching Where he thincketh need

Where he says also that it confirms his side, that he is called the
Apostell off the Philippians, and other the Apostels off the churches, for that
thereby it may appear, that one may be Apostel off a kingdom, or off a
province: he dalieth with his reader. For in that place I alleged out off the
2. Corinthes 8. the Apostels off the churches are not so called / in respect
off any ministry off the word / but off the alms which they were sent with.
And beside that the church off the Philip. was nether province nor kingedome /
but a particular church: Epaphroditus is not called their Apostel / in that he
was sent off Saint Paul unto them: but in that the Philip. sent him to Saint
Paul: as the words which follow immediately after / observed off Master Beza
do declare. So that if that place prove 2. Phil. 25.
an Apostel: yt proves one sent / not to a province / or kingedome / but unto
one singular person only. But who would voutsafe an answer / to such
scrapinges?

Against that I alleged to prove / that Iunias / and Adronicus were no
Apostels / for that a man may be famous amongst Diuis. 4. page 232.
the Apostels / and yet no Apostel: he opposes Martyr, that seems to doubt
whether the words will bear that sense: which I leave to the readers
judgment. The other reason that S. Paul calls them kinsfolk / and fellow
prisoners / and not fellow laborers / which his use is when he speaks of
those / which have any ministry of the gospel: he towcheth not. He has
raked up to no no purpose a number off bare opinions / which I will not
wrestell with: considering that nothing thereby falls from our cause. For if
both Epaphroditus / and these be Apostels / such as Paul / and Barnab. I refer
my self to that where I have showed / that that function is ceased. If in the
general signification / for that they are sent to preach: yt makes nothing to
the question / seeing the D. must show that there is an ordinary particular
function off Apostelship / severed from the office off a Pastor / Evangelist /
and Prophet. Where he says / he alleged them to prove that some now may
preach, which have no certain clear: I could not thinck himso forsaken off all
judgment / that he would make such a conclusion: howbeit I trust now he has
his answer.

That I alleged the Apostels declaring that they would not have this order
continued in the church, in that they renewed not that order of Apostels, as
they were taken away by death: he answers / first that the scripture does
not express it. As if S. Luke which so diligently described the election off
Matthias / would have quit ouerleaped this / if there had been any. And
considering that they had not such cause to draw them to a new consultation
of a new Apostel / as in the 1. Act. which was an express word / off taking
an other into the room off Judas: it is manifest that they attempted no such
thing after. So that alththough yt be not expressed: yet it is contained in
scripture / that there was no consultation off an other Apostel. If not / how
is he (as he says) persuaded / that there was none chosen into their places?
or how knows he / that it was not necessary? will he still have his
persuasions in divinity / without the word? without which they are no
persuasions / but idle phansies. After he asks who ever said, that there
must be twelve Apostels, nether more nor less? as though my reason tended to
that. But if the Apostels did not vphould that small number off twelve / which
the Lord instituted: yt proves that their mind was / not to choose about that
number. And if they would not continue 12. to gather the ^2. tribes off Israel
/ scattered thoroughe the whole world: they meant not that there should be a
greater number / to gather those which were scattered in one Island,

To that I alleged off Ambrose / which says / that he would not take upon
him the estate of an Apostel: he answers / that Diuis. 72 page 234.
he said so, to abase him self, because in an other place, he chalengeth not
the circumspection off a pastor. will he never wake out off this sleep? for to
let pass that not to acknowledge the grace of God bestowed on him / is a fault
/ as to challenge that which he has not received: and not to enter here into
his ability / of doing the office of a Pastor: does he not see that the cawse
off not taking upon him the estate off an Apostel / is assigned not in his
disablenes / but in that which the greatest wit / learning / and godliness off
those times / could not come unto / that is to say / that none could challenge
Ad Trall. and al.
the office off an Apostell, but he whom the son off God him self had
chosen? He might as well say / that it is a point off great modesty for a man to
profess / that he cannot clyme up into heaven / withowt a ladder. Nether is
this Ambrose judgment only / but Ignatius: which in those epistles that the
D. will have rightly borne / says that he will not command them any thing,
as an Apostell. In deed Euse. 7. lib. 31.
Nouatus a runnegate / August: Tom. 6. catal. heresi.
Manes a Phranticke / Orthodoxo. in vit. eius.
Martial a coleprophet / Epist. Bonif. ad Lanfr.
Romish Augustine / the Anabaptists off our time / and such brambels have
entitled them selves by the name off Apostels / and taken upon them to ordeine
others: but all that have had together with piety / any spark off judgment /
have beside their heresies condemned also this frenzy. Lib. Epist. 2.
Cyprian reprocheth Nouatus / that he sent forth new Apostels. Cont. epist.
fundam. and l. 1. de Act. cum Felice,
August. presses the Manicheans once / or twice: which said / they were
Apostels / and demands what scripture they could show / to show themselves
Apostels. Whereby he declares that he esteemed no other Apostels / then which
had particular testimony off the scripture: which thing he never laid to the
charge off other orders off the Manichean Ministers. Zuingl. Ecclesias.
Zuinglius also charge the Anabaptists / as well for that they took upon
them the office: as also for that they challenged the name / off Apostel.

But the D. seeing his folly laid open to the derision off young children /
has in favor off his Apostels / and Prophets / invented a new distinction.
For where I alleged certain proper marks off the Prophets / as foretelling
things to come / and Apostels / as immediate calling from God / seeing off
Christ / embassadge into the whole world / which not falling into any function
now in use / prove that they are ceased: he aswereth / that Page 229. 231.
218.
Prophets, and Apostels in such respects are ceased, but continue still as
towching preaching the gospel. Then which what can be more bluntly spoken? For
yt as much as if one should say / that a beast is a man / although not in
respect that it has a natural capacity off reason / and speech: yet in that
it lives / and has sense as a man. For as a man / and a beast being both
living things / are severed one from an other by their properties / and
special differences (as they be called off the Logicians): even so Apost.
Prophets / Evangelists / Pastors / Doctors / being all preachers off the
Gospel / are severed by that wherein they differ / one from an other. And as
he can be no man which has none off those differences / whereby a man is
severed from other living things: so he can not be Prophet / or Apostel /
which has nothing whereby he may differ / from a Pastor / Doctor / or
Evangelist. Yt is also too childishe / that he understands not how the
difference off a thing (which is the substantial form) being taken away / the
thing it self can not remain.

Therefore if the D. will have Apostels / Prophets / and Evangelists remain:
he must show how both every one off those / now differ from them selves /
and from the functions off Pastor / and Doctor. In which behalf he has been
hacking / but his tools will not enter. For this new Apostels office, is
placed in preaching the word where need requires: the Prophets in an
especial gift off 129.
interpreting the scriptures: the Evangelists office being set between three
opinions / as it were three stools / either off preaching more fervently then
other, or off preaching the gospel, or off preaching symply, falls flat to
the ground. For how dare he take upon him to set up Evangelists / when as
appears here / and especially pa. 407. he knows not what their office is,
and wherein it consists? Which might have served him for a piece off
instruction / that that function is ceased. For eue^ as the Jews if they were
not altogether blinded / might understand that the Lord has taken away the
difference off clean / and unclean beasts / in that (by their own
confession) they can not come to the knowledge off meats forbidden: even so if
(as he says) the Lord has not left any exact knowledge in the scriptures of
this office / beside other reasons / he declared by this also / that his
meaning was / that it should have no continuance. Considering that there is no
office off continuance / whereoff all the parts / have not a full sight / and
manifest show in the scriptures.

But let the Answ. reap that he never sue / and not able to prove any / let
him enjoy either all / or that signification off Evangelists / which serves
his turn best. First it can not be denied / but all these three agree in
preaching off the gospel. Likewise that which the D. assigns in the
description off Apostels / that they preach where need requires, agrees unto
his Evangelists / and Prophets / both by the practice of their offices in the
scripture: and by the D. own confession / especially in Evangelists / whose
ministry he appoints in going from place to place. This difference the^
remains / that Evangelists do preach with greater zeal then other, the
Prophets with greater dexterity off interpreting. Wherein first he is a small
friend off the Apostels. Whom contrary to their Ephesians. 4. 11. Cor. 1. 12. 28.
institution / he has thrust down under the degree off Prophets / and
Evangelists / which having certain gifts off Zeal / and dexterity off
interpreting above them: must needs have the upper hand. Secondly he has
given a check to the Prophets / whom the scripture preferring before / he
places behind the Evangelist. Ephesians. 4. 11.
For the gift off Zeal in preaching the word symply / being more excellent
then to have a special dexterity / and red^nes in interpreting (the one
proceeding off greater knowledge / the other off greter love): the office
whereunto yt is knit / must needs be higher. Thirdly let him show / how these
Evangelists / Prophets / and Apostels / may be changed into Pastors. For if
their gifts off interpretation / and Zeal / be greater the^ fall into a
Pastor: then yt is nether lawful for the Bishop to admit / nor for them to
accept the office off a pastor / after they have once exercised these offices:
which is directly contrary to the practice off our churches. Fourthly if there
be such offices / why are they not ordained every one to their several
function: Apostels to their Apostelship / Prophets to their Prophetship /
Evangelists to their Evangelist ship? that they may know to what kind of
Ministry to apply themselves / and poursue after that gift / which is most
agreeable with their office. Fifthly / considering that yt is commen to them all
to preach whereneed requires / how comes yt to pass / that some being
restrained unto a Diocese / other have for their circuit / a whole province /
other a whole realm / other two realms off England / and Ireland? or if this
diversity off limitation / make diversity off function: let him tell us /
which off these we shall take for Apostels / which for Prophets / which for
Evangelists. But there would be no end / if I should poursue all the
absurdities / which hang upon this assertion. I come therefore unto that spoken
a part off the Evangelists.

He says that he has showed by scripture, reason, and authority, Diuis. 5.
pa. 233.
that though the name off an Evangelist be changed, yet the office remains:
which is most untrue. For nether has yt any authority at all / and yt is both
against reason / and scripture / that the office by his saying remaining fully
/ and in all points: the name should be Diuis. 2. pa. 217.
changed. I say by his saying fully / and in all points / forasmuch as that
towching writing off the gospel (wherein only he makes our Evangelists / to
differ from those in the Apostels time) shall be showed not to apperteine unto
the office off an Evangelist / such as Saint Paul speaks off. Where I said
it is against reason / that the name should be taken away: both I said it for
that there is a profitable admonition in it / to keep them in remembrance off
their duty: and for that it contains a mark off Honor / above certain
other ministers. Which being a part off reward / ought not to be cut of from
them / which do faithfully bestow themselves in that office. yt is against
scripture manifestly: which by this means is set to school / whilst the name
which yt gave being cast aside / an other as more fit / is received. Whereunto
ad / that it is against commen experience. For it comes often to pass / that
the duties commanded falling away / the names anexed unto them remain: but
that they remaining / the names (especially which carry a note off honor / that
men so willingly lay hold of) wear out / is very seldom / or never heard
off. So that here I have to thancke the D. which puts me in remembrance off
a very probable reason / against all his new found as well Prophets / and
Apostels / as Evangelists. Which is / that for so much as the names were worn
out many ages ago / the offices them selves had also an end: and forasmuch as
no ordinary minister now / owght to be called by these titles / or being called
to receive the^: there fore the offices whereof these be the names / are
ceased. Otherwise these titles both ought to be given / and may be received /
as well as those of bishop / or Pastor / and Doct.

Where I allege that Timothe, and Philip Evangelists, had their vocation
confirmed by miracle: towching Philip he makes an outcrie / for that he was
entered into his ministry off Euangelistship, before the miracle 8. Act. 29.
As if the same came not to pass Number. 17. 8.
in Aron / which had his calling confirmed by miracle / long after he had don
the office of the high priest. Likewise he answers / that it was rather done
for the Eunuchs sake, then for Philips. Albeit yt were so / yet by that
(rather) is not shut forth / that yt was doo^ for Philips. If he had learned
that David / and other servants off 1. Sam. 27 1. Psalm. 116 11.
God / come oftentimes either through small success in their ministry / or
manifould contradictions off the wicked / or sense off their own weakness /
into doubt off their calling: he would not have found it so strange / that the
servants off God in their own respect / have had these confirmacions. Where
he says / these particular examples make no general rule: I showed the
likelihood / whereupon I thought the rest to have the same / for so much as these
two which the scripture only calls Evangelists / had that confirmation.
Which I leave to the judgment of the reader.

Where he says / the place 1. Tim. 1. 18. proves not that Timo. had his
calling confirmed by miracle, first becawse Prophecy is no miracle, then
becawse he being ordained by putting on off hands, needed no confirmaton by
miracle: the first is nothing but daliance in the word / my meaning being
apparent / which is / that he was by an extraordinary calling / and in our
Ministers unwonted. Albeit yff to have things hid / and which no knowledge off
man is able to come unto foretold / be miraculous: yt can not be denied / but
that a Prophecy may in a general sense / be called a miracle. The other
exception is frivolous: considering that both Paul / and Barnabas which were
miraculously called of the holy ghost / by the voice off the Prophets / unto
acerten ministry / had notwithstanding for a further confirmacion / the
laying on off hands Act. 13. 3.
off the Mynisterie off Antioche. And yt is also vngoddly / as that which
directly contrarieth Saint Paul which drawing arguments for the confirmacion
off Timothe / as well off that Propheceie / as off the imposition off hands:
esteemed them both needful. That which he adds / that there is 1 Timothy 4. 14.
2. Timo. 1. 6.
no mention off any Euangelistship in that place off Timothe: is unworthy any
answer.

An other answer is / that Timoth. was Bishop. in proof whereoff like an evil
shoemaker as one said / which puts a great shoo on a little foot / he has
spent a whole sheet off papir. When Diuis. 59. pa. 404. Agesilaus in Plutar.
if he had gained this point / yt would serve him to small advantage: which
notwithstanding how far he is from / shall plainly be seen. Therefore to give
the onset off this great heap / his first reason that Timothe was bishop,
because the Epistels written unto him contain the office off a bishop: proves
as well that he was a Deacon / a widow / a man / a woman / old / young / and
consequently a monstre: seeing he wrote off all their duties. Yea rather that he
was a Deacon. Considering that there is nothing in the description off a Deacon
/ which agrees not unto him: but in the description off a bishop / that which
he requires off not being given to wine, and not being a young Christian,
could have no place in Timothies instruction: nourished in the truth from his
2. Tim. 3. 15.
cradel / and so sparing in the use off wine / that S. Paul was feign to call
him to a more liberal vso off it. let him show therefore but one only precept
directed unto Timothe in both those Epistels 1. Timo. 5 23.
which is proper unto a bishop: nay let him show one procept (that only
excepted which I alleged / off doing the worck of an Evangelist) which owght
not as well to have been observed off the Apostel him self / if he had tawght
where Timothe did. If he be able to show no one such point / which makes him
to differ from other ministers of the word: then all may see how vain a reason
this is / which he has made the growndsell off this cawse.

His second reason drawn (as he calls yt) off the subscription of the second
Epistle / is as vain. For who is there onles be which has his nose stuffed /
with self willed prejudice against the truth / that can not easily smell that
subscription / not to be in the canon off the holy scripture? for considering
that he had in the beginning off the Epistle / made the direction unto Timothet
what needed he in the subscription / repete the same again? Likewise that he
was first, and that he was ordained, or chosen by voice: sauoreth not S. Paul.
Considering that if there were any such thing / both Timot. and the Ephesi.
knew it well: and there was more cawse to write that in the former Epistel /
then in this whereby he calls him from thence: also in the superscription /
then in the subscriptio^. seeing it is contrary to all use of letters / to set
either the name / or titles off him to whom we write / in the subscription / or
vnderwriting of our letters. This riot / and disorder hardly happen unto a man
off mean Judgment / and shall we think that they were committed off Saint
Paul / or rather of God by him? last off all / that the subscription has was
written, and not written, and when Paul appeared, not when I / or when I
Paul appeared: does manifestly argue / that yt was none off his / considering
that there is no such subscription in all his Epistles / where he speaks off
him self / in the third person. And seeing in those things wherein he used the
hand off an other / which copied out his letters / he never uses that manner
of speech: that he would use yt in the subscription / which can not be
otherwise esteemed then off his own hand / yt is altogether incredible*

Where for confirmation off this he says / that it is so in the most, best,
and auncientest greek copies: him self setdowne his answer / which he is not
able once to remove. For if those subscriptio^s be untrue / as appears /
especially in that of the first epistle to the Cor. which have testimony off
the most / best / and auncientest writers / as well as this: how comes yt to
pass / that there being the self same authority in both / yt should be off
such strenght in Beza. upon the 1. Cor.
in this subscription / which is off no value in the other? nay when that
subscription to the Cor. has the testimony off all greek copies / and this
off his is forsaken not only off the Syriake paraphrase / but off diverse the
auncientest greek copies: how is he not ashamed to lay such weight off this
cawse / in that testimony? Upon 1. Timot.
yt is true therefore that M. Beza says / that these subscriptions were not S.
Paul's / but some others / for the most part either unlearned / or not so well
advised.

His third reason is drawn off authority off writere. wherein not to examine
how truly he has alleged these places / as a thing unworthy the tourning off
a leaf / nor to speak off his fond allegation off diverse autorities /
especially Chrysostom / and Theodoreis / which make no manner mention off any
bishopely state off Timothe / off Zuinglius twice cited which making thoffice
off a bishop / and Evangelist one / serves not to prove / either that he was
more a bishop then an Evangelist / or that the same may have diverse functions
at once: I say not to examine these / they are all (if I would use his own
weapon) overthrown page 325.
in a word / that histories are not curious, in calling men by their several
titles. If that be true in histories / which off all other seek after even
from the cradell to the grave / things of les importance / then the office
which a man has borne / either in church / or commen wealth: much more is it in
other writers. But that writers especially when they speak by the way / and
not off set purpose / speak thus / and call me^ by vnpropertitles: shall be
once answered against all the rakinges / both here / and page 230. when I come
to the D. arguments whereby he proves Prophets / Evangelists / Apostles /
etc. In the mean season I will not stick to confess / that diverse off these
writers / histories especially (peradventure deceived by that subscription)
esteemed him a bishop / and no Euangeliste. But what then? if they were for one
a 100. they can not counteruaile / much less bear down / the testimony of
the Apostle. ^. Timot. 4. 5.


Howbeit not all the ancient writers / are (as he untruly says) of that
judgment. For not to speak of Ambrose / which calls Timot. a Deacon / where
he opposes a Deacon to a bishop: In Epist. ad Phil. Ad Trall.
Ignatius an ancient writer says / that he was a Deacon / and that where he
dividing the ministeries off the church into Bishopes / and Deacons / etc. does
openly oppose a Deacon to a bishop. Where all his testimonies are not able to
aford one sentence / wherein Timothe is so called a Bishop / that he is opposed
/ unto an Evangelist. Therefore althowghe these places prove him nor an
Evangelist: yet they have more to prove that he was no bishop / that all those
to prove him a bishop / which are raked here together. Albeit Ignatius missing
the proper name / assigns him the true office off an Evangelist: which was to
be assistant to Saint Paul in his Apostelship. Where he says / that all the
new writers are off that mind that he was a bishop, Master Beza only
excepted: I trust the Doctors faith in alleging autorities / is too well
known / to abuse the simplest any more / with these visardes. I only had
Calu. and Muscul. at hand / the reader may look others if he Call insti. 4. 3.
4. Tit. de minis. ca. de off.
think good: both which plainly say he was an Evangelist / where they handle
properly the several ministries off the church / and make a manifest
difference between a bishop / and an Evangelist. And such is his dealing / that
he fears not to bring even from thence a piece of proof / where Calu. moving
the question / whether the word Evangelist verified off Timoth. be taken in a
general sense / for any that preaches the word / or for that proper office 2.
Tim. 4.
which S. Paul expresses to the Ephesians. upon two reasons concludes / that he
speaks off that office off an Evangelist. Yet upon that he says / Timothe
was excellenter then common Pastors: this trim interpreter concludes
directly against Calvin / that he had the proper office off a Bishop, and that
Calvin meant that he had a notable gift above the rest off the Pastors. As
though Calvin reasoned not off the degree off offices / one above an other: but
off the degree of gifts in one / and the same. Yt is too great shame to strive
with such light of words. Considering that he does there make Timothes
office, a middle degree betvveen Pastors, and Apostels: higher then Pastors /
lower then Apostles.

This man also which reprocheth me as one setting the fathers together by the
ears, without cawse where the disagreeme^t is manifest / 102. Page 114.
and which says symply / that yt is great injury to learned men, to accuse
them off contrariety with themselves: goes about to prove Beza directly
contrary unto him selff. For where Beza shows Upon 1. Tim. 1.
that Saint Paul did not leave Tim. at Ephesus, as their bishop, which the D. in
affirming that Beza is against him confesses, he busieth him self / to prove
him to have contrary sentences. For proof hereoff he alleges / that all were
bishops which S. Paul sent for from Ephesus to Miletum: and therefore Timothe
being one off those which by Bezaes judgment was sent for, must needs be a
Bishop. Albeit it he granted which Beza says / that Tim. was sent for: yet
that they were all bishops wanted proof. For all know that it is not unwonted /
to call a whole company gathered off diverse degrees / by the title off that
whereoff there are must in the company / without speaking to every one by
their particular titles: especially seeing he speaks indefinitely / that the
holy ghost, had appointed them, and not all them Bishops. Where Saint Luke says
that both the princes off the people / Elders / and Scribes / and those of the
race off the high pristes were assembled: Peter in speaking unto Act. 4. 5.
and 6.
them makes mention only off the Princes / and Elders / without naming the
scribes / and priests / which notwithstanding he spoke unto with the rest.

But I can hardly grant that Timothe was then sent for / to come with the rest
off the Ministers unto Miletum. considering that there was as appears so
small a space / at the least between Act. 20. 4
the time which Beza supposes Timoth. to have been sent to Ephesus from S.
Paul / and this sending for the bishops unto Miletum: that Timo. taking the
straight course unto Ephesus / was little more then only arrived / when Saint
Paul sent from Miletum. Secondly for that S. Paul writes unto Timothe / that
he left Trophimus / one off his companions in that journey / 2. Tim. 4. 20. Act
20. 4
sick at Miletum: which had been nedeles if Timothe had been with Paul / as
the bishops off Ephesus were / until he parted from Miletum. Thirdly / for
that S. Paul in that oration unto the bishops / says that he knew that none
off them should see his Act. 20. 25. 38.
face any more: which he would never have said off Tim. His other reason that
he calls him president, a general word agreing to any in preeminence / is
nothing worth. That which he ioineth to back yt with / as added by Beza out
off Cypri. that the Bishop ruled the college off Seniors: the place is in his
confessions / and not where he assigns. howbeit yt makes nothing to the
purpose. For althowgh the Bishops were presidentes in the Eldership in
Cyprians time / when that office was the highest in the church: yet yt
follows not therefore / that the bishops were always the first in the
Apostels times / when there were higher functions. Onles the D. will say that
the bishops took the upper hand off the Apostels / and Prophets / when they
came unto their churches / and joined them selves unto their consultations.

And albeit yt has appeared / and shall appear that the Answ. has not wun so
much as a poor cottage: yet as though he had taken great Babylon / or Niniue /
he makes his Triumphs: which if he had had any hold off him self / at least
he might have differred / until he had answered the reasons to the contrary.
For if (as he most untruly says) he had all the writers calling Timothe
bishop: yet if the scripture stand for us / yt is reason that he with all his
writers / should veil their bonnet. Now therefore although he say / I forget
my promis, of proving Timothe an Evangelist: yet the reason I alleged / that
the scripture so calls page 232.
him, will prove better memory in this point / then he can well aford. To this
reason he answers / first that the scripture does not call him so, but only
bids him do the work of an Euang. which in deed is more against him. For
they are sometimes called by a title / 233.
which not doing the worck belonging thereunto / can not be properly so called:
but they which do the work which the title pretends / may always properly
be called by yt. And the vsuallest arguments in scripture / to prove or
improve a man to be such / as he bears countenance off / are fetched from
this place off effects.

His second answer stands off the interpetation off these words / the
vvorcke off an Evangelist. Which being alleged out off Bulling. Muscul.
Heming. to be preaching the gospel purely, and constantly is nothing to the
purpose. For we grant yt is true / but that there is further understood /
which may severe him from other ministers off the word. Whereoff Calvin
assigns Upon 2. Tim. 4. 5.
these reasons: one that by ascribing unto him this degree above that off
Pastors / he might procure him more authority: the other that he might thereby
give the spur to stir up / and enforce him self to all careful travail / off
answering so high a calling. Off both which reasons he assigns a manifest
cause / which is that the Apostel throughout his whole epistle / drives unto
those two ends: This is yet clearer / for that where other titles off Apost.
Prophe. etc. be carried off the scripture from their particular / unto a
general signification: this word off Evangelist (set a part this place in
controversy) is not used but to note that proper office / opposed unto other
ministeries off the word. And therefore (...). 1. Tim. 2. 7. 2 Timothy 1. 11. page
232. li. 3. 37.
the Apostel having occasion to speak off this word preacher / shunneth (as
seems) the word Evangelist / and uses an other: when as notwithstanding the
word Evangelist was proper to holy writ / and the other commen to profane: off
which reason also I left a step / in the place before recited. Again Eusebius
(howsoever otherwise he forgets him self) where he speaks off that proper
office / notes it out by the same manner of speech which the Apostell: saying
/ they did the vvorcke off Evangelists. (...). Act. 17. 18. 19 1. Cor. 16. 1.
These. 3. Act 20. Phil 1. 21. Colos. 1. Philem. Ephesians 4. 11 1. Cor. 12. 28. ^0.
Last off all it appears by that the scripture sets forth off him / both
before he was at Ephesus / and after / touchching his ministry in many places
where the Apostels had tawght before: that the work off Evangelist / is taken
in that particular signification / whereby it is severed from other Ministers:
considering that the Evangelists office was / to water where the Apostles had
planted / and to be assistant unto them.

His third answer is a mash / and bruing of all together / drinck fitter for
horse / then men. For to be sure to make Timothe a bishop / he thinks that
one at one time / may be Apostle / Evangelist / Doctor / bishop / and I can not
tell what: which is directly against the word off God. As when yt says that
God gave some Apostels, some Prophets: again he set first Apostles, secondly
Prophets, etc. Again are all Apostels, are all Prophets, etc. Whereby
appears / that the holy ghost places these diverse gifts in several persons
/ and that they are one under an other: so that onles one / and the same man
may at one time / be second and third / inferior and superior / before and
after him self: yt can not be that one at one time / can be Apostle /
Evangelist / etc. hitherto pertains (which is towched in the former book)
that the Apostel brings off the likeness off constitution off our bodies /
with Romans 12. 4. 5. 1. Cor. 1^, 12.
the church, that as the natural body / so the spiritual of the church / is
best preserved / and maintained in most comelines / when every member does his
proper office: and of the contrary side / ^^ the one so the other is hurt / and
disfygured / when one breaks upon an other. Whereupon yt is evident / how
untrue yt is which the D. does in so great assurance set down: that one may be
Evangelist / and Bishop at one time.

Besides that / he is confuted by his own words. For if the office off an
Evangelist / be to preach more fervently then others: (which signification
those three which he has set down only (as that which puts a difference
betwe^ yt and others) ca^ stand) the^ he ca^ be no bishop: considering that
every office has his proper gift / according to the measure whereof it is
exequuted. And yt is as absurd / that a bishop should preach more ferue^tly /
and beyond the measure of a bishop: as yt is that a man may leap beyond him
self / ouerrun himself. yt is said that one in his full age / differs from
him self in his childhood: and a man at one time / may after a sort pass him
self at an other: but that he should differ from him self / at one and the same
time / as the D. judgment implies / this is the first tydinges I have heard
off yt. Again yt is houlden off all that I have red (Zuinglius only excepted
/ which makes a bishop / and an Evangelist all one) that both an Evangelist is
not / and a bishop is / bound to a certain place. And this difference is thus
far confessed off the D. that the Pastor is more bound to one special church /
then the Evangelist. which if yt be true / a man being (as he says) at one
time both bishop / and Evangelist / may be also at one time bound / and not
bound unto one place / have a special charge off one / and indifferent off
all: which will be hard for him to bring to pass / without he work miracles.

For his reasons whereupon this opinion stands / that Saint Paul is called a
Doctor, S. Matthew, and John being Apostels, are off writers 1. Tim. 2.
called Evangelists: they are far from proving this. Touching the first /
Saint Paul is not called a Doctor symply / but with addition Doctor off the
Gentiles: declaring that his Mynistry perteined not to one kingdom / but unto
all / which is all one with an Apostel. Towching the other / he should understand
that our question is not off an Evangelist as writers / but as Saint Ephesians. 4. 11
Paul takes Evangelist: which can be by no means understood off him / which
writes the story off the gospel. considering that Philip which is confessed
to have been an Evangelist / in that sense was none. Yff he say that the
Apostle meant / to set forth two kinds of Evangelists / one preaching only /
an other preaching / and writing too: I answer / that Saint Paul pourposing
there to set forth the liberality off the Lord / in giving preaching
ministries unto the church / was nether so negligent a commender off the grace
off God / nor so dry / and poor off speech: but if there had been an other
several ministry (as this answer supposes) he both would / and could have
used an other word / as a several dishe to have presented this gift with. And
seeing the D. brings in S. Paul / offering one only gift of the bishoprik /
unto the church / in two words as it were two dishes: Page 219.
what likelihood is there / that he would thrust up so narrowly these two gifts
/ whereoff each off them being more excellent then the bishopric / asks
greater room?

Moreover by the same reason that men may call Saint Matthew / and Saint John
Evangelists / becawse they wrote the stories of the gospel: they may call S.
Paul / and Peter / etc. For as they wrote the story / so these wrote the sum
off the whole doctrine off the gospel. They being therefore both writers off
the gospel / in this rule of esteeming Evangelists by writing / must needs
be a like Evangelists. For the greek word favors the one as well as the
other: yt being as joyful news / which S. Peter / and Paul wrote / as that
which S. Matthew / and John. For the difference off story and sum, bring not
a grain weight to pull the name of Evangelists more to these / then to those.
Now therefore for so much as yt is manifest by the subscription of S. Paul's
epistels / that he writing did the office of an Apostle: it is also clear /
that both S. Matthew / and John being Apostels / in writing the story off the
Gospel did the same: and that the committing off the Gospel to writing / was
not the proper difference off any special office / but according to
thoccasions offered / and moving of the holy spirit off God / commen to other
functions off that time. And as the Pastors off our time which both preach /
and write / differ not in ministry from those which preach only / and are
oftentimes more excellent pastors / then they, so the w^sting off Saint John /
and Matthew being Apostels / off Saint Luck / and Marck Evangelists / might
paraduenture make them more excellent Apostels / or Evangelists / then those
which wrote not: but to change their ministry / it could not. Last off all /
off this answer follows thabsurditie before noted / that one man at the same
time / should be first / and second / before and behind himself.

That an Evangelist at one time / may be a bishop at an other, makes little for
the D. considering that we show / that Timothe 2. Tim. 4. 5.
was even then at Ephesus an Evangelist / when he supposes him to have been
bishop. Howbeit it is unlike that they which were ordained Evangelists / and
set in higher degree above the Pastor / were without their fault / thrust down
unto the order of Bishops. Men now a days peradventure may choose to an office
off charge / one whom upon better trial as not altogether sufficient / they
may cause to rise out off his chair / and sit in a lower place: but in the
Apostels ordinatio^ / especially of Timo. in whom they were directed by the
voice off God / it could by no means 1. Tim. 1. 18.
comme to pass. This being untrue / in the Evangelists cast down to thoffice
off bishops: is yet more intolerable in the Apostels. For they are by this
means not let / but cast headlong down / from the highest staier in the
ministry / unto the lowest almost: yea by the D. saying (which makes the
Pastor / and the Doctor all one) even unto the lowest. But it can not be / that
they which were appointed by the voice off Christ immediately to the
Apostelship / can either off their own / or any other authority in earth / be
put from that ministry. And therefore our men do substantially dispute
against the Papists / which would have Peter bishop of Rome: for that being
ordained an Apostel / he could not betake him unto thoffice off a bishop. which
the Answ. with diverse other grounds / would to maintain his fantasies gladly
shake.

The reason pretended out off Zuing. for that they abode in one place: if it be
his / is insufficient. For to omit that it is easy to show / that James
immediately after he was ordained to the Apostelship at thascension off our
Savior / exercised his charge in one place / namely Jerusalem / during his
whole life / whereby should follow that he was never any Apostell: and to let
pass that Eusebius cites out off Clement / that all the Apostels remained 5.
li. 18. c.
by the space off xij. years in Jerusalem / after our Savior Christ's
ascension / whereby they all should be bishops during that time: to say nothing
also off Saint Paul / which teaching at Rome / and there looking to end his
life / eue^ from thence writes 28. act. 30 Ephesians. 1. 1. 2. Tim. 1. 1
him self an Apostle / and not a bishop: I say to let all this pass / which
notwithstanding casts down this opinion / the Ans. must know that thabiding
long in one place / does not make a bishop differ from an Apostel: but the
necessity / and bond to abide in one place / by reason of his particular
function. Which when it nether can be showed off any Apostel / and is as has
been showed / directly contrary to his function: yt can not be / that the abode
in one place / should prove a change off the Apostelship / into the function
off a bishop.

Whereby is also answered the last reason off the D. that Tim. was bishop,
becawse he retourning to Ephesus died there. For if that were granted / what
reason is there / that whereas by the biscours off the scriptures before
alleged / it appears Timothe tawght in diverse churches: he should be said
bishop off Ephesus / becawse that was the last church he instructed? why not
off the first / or second as well as off the last? it is all one as if a man
being a stranger in diverse places / should be said to be Cytisen of that /
were he lays his bones. Wherein the D. again approaches unto the absurdity
off the Papists: which against that the Protestants allege / that Peter is
said off writers / as well bishop off Alexandria / and Antioche / as off Rome
/ answer that the difference is great / because he died at Rome. Nether helps
it him any thing which he alleges in an other place out of Call. that Tychicus
was sent to supply Timothies absence. For beside that the Apostle does page
336.
not go so far / and whatsoever can be said in that point is coniecturall:
Calu. words do not necessarily enforce a deputy / considering that absence
may after a sort be supplied / by a successor.

And if beside the first ordination off Timoth. unto the function off an
Evangelist / which is unlimited / we will consider the manner off his embassage
toward the Ephesians. there can nothing les be gathered then this / that Timothe
was off Saint Paul instituted bishop off Ephesus / whereby he should need a 1.
Tim. 1. ^ (...)
deputy. For in that he sent him / desyring him to tarry for him there: he
declares that he was not sent to remain always / but for a time. But if the
Answ. take exception that I have found out this new translation / to make the
place serve for my turn: first I trust that those which have still in the
greek / will easly grant that the word will bear this sense: then it has some
confirmacion of that / which Saint Paul writes off diligence to be used in his
caling there / until his coming. Which word until although 1. Tim. 4. 13.
Sustineres me. 2. l. cont. epist. Par.
not always: yet for the most part / makes an e^d of that / whereunto it is
applied. Last off all / it appears by Augustine which uses this translation /
that yt was off ancient time received: which testimony off antiquity cast in
/ when the skoles are even on both sides / may carry it away. Thus I leave it to
the Judgment off the indifferent reader / what truth it has that the Answ.
affirms / of Timothes being bishop at Ephesus. I return back to the general
treatise off the Evangelist.

Where I show that if there were Evangelists, yet the bishops could not
ordein the^; being their inferiors: he answers Diuis. 6. pa. 233. Ephesians. 4. 1^
that yt can not be proved, that an Evangelist is of higher degree, the^ a
bishop. If O. Paul's authority be not sufficient / which setting the ministries
off the word so precisely in order / prefers the Evangelist / and Prophet
unto the Pastor / or bishop: nor the Judgment off writers (whereoff although
some make an Evangelist next in honor unto an Apostle / some the Prophet: yet
both sorts prefer Eusebius. 3: 27. Calu. up. the Ephesians. Beza. pa. 226.
the Evangelist / and Prophet unto the Pastor / or bishop) if I say none of
these be sufficient: yet the D. him self will help us / which in appointing
the gifts off Prophets / and Evangelists greater then those of the bishop
proves that he here denies. And although he take this liberty off denying
things / which none durst ever call into doubt: yet he escapes not so /
considering that although he make the bishop to take the wall off the
Evangelist: yet he can not do yt in the Apostels / and Prophets. Therefore the
absurdity remains still / that the bishop being an inferior minister /
takes upon him to make ministers / which are above him. He says that the 7.
of the Heb. makes not for me, becawse blessing is not there taken for
consecration to the ministry. yet the reason is all one. For as the Apostel
proves that Melchizedech was greater then Abraham / because he was the
minister of God / to pronounce the bessing upon him in the name / and authority
of the Lord: so he that ordeineth being a public Minister off God / to
pronounce his assistance to wards him that is to be admitted / owght by the
same reason / to be greater then he.

Where I alleged out of Eusebius. that the Evangelists did li. 3. c. 37.
ordein bishops, having nothing to answer he was content to take the benefit
off the printers / or writers fault: which as casely might come to pass / for
the figure off 3. had set the figure off 2. where I show that these Evangelists
are superfluous, if the pastors, and Doctors do their duty: he asks what
if there be page 34.
not for every church, a sufficient Pastor. Which being answered in an other
place / I answer also here / that his Evangelists should help to make up the
number. Where he says if every church were provided off an able Pastor, yet
for confirmation off the doctrine, oftener preaching, diverse worcking of God by
one rather then an other, the Evangelists might do good: beside that he
easily forgets the churches charge / which being hardly able to maintain
their proper ministry / should be ouercharged with those that ride about: and
beside that the Pastor being provided unto every church / the overplus owght to
serve to fournish them off Doctors / an other ordinary mynisterie off the
word: he must know that able teachers / can teach as often as the church can
conveniently meet. And it can not be denied / but they have the blessing off
God promised to their labors / before any other. If there be any such great /
and urgent need off confirmation off any point off doctrine / the churches hard
by may by duty off godly neighborhood / help one an other in that behalff.

The place to prove the ceassing off this Mynisterie out off Eusebius. lib. 5. ca.
9
Eus. is manifest to all that will understand. For in that speaking of the time
about the year 162. he says there were yet Evangelists, he declares that
there were none in his time: and that he says (...).
with repetition / there were there were, all see that he wrote that with
declaration off sorrow / that they having been before / were not then. That
which he answers / that they can not now go from kingdom to kingdom,
becawse the miraculous gift off tounges is ceased: makes utterly against him.
For Eusebius. putting that amongst other an^exed to the office off an Evangelist:
left the reason off the want off that ministry / which he had before
bewailed. Which being the same now / that was then: yt follows that as there
was not then / so there is not now / any such function. Thus much for the
maintenance off the reasons / which were set down by me against the D.
Apostels / Prophets / etc. it follows to examine his.

First the reader may see the hardness off the D. countenance / which having
diverse reasons alleged out of the scripture / asks notwithstanding for one
word out off it / which does but insinuate these Page 229.
offices to be temporal. After he alleges Ephesians. 4. where upon that it is
said / that those with other Ministeries off the word / were given off God for
the gathering together off the saints / until we all come unto a perfect
man: he concludes but unjustly / that they are perpetual ministeries. For the
offices off Apostelship / etc. may well have their worck in the perfection off
the church / without such continuance. Which he might have easily known / if
he had considered that which our Savior Christ says / that the fruit off
their preaching should remain. Therefore although 15. John. 16.
their ministry were but for a time: yet for as much as the fruit thereoff
has / and shall have her worck unto the worlds end / in the perfection off
the church off God: it might be well said / that they were given for the
gathering off the saints / until they came to a be perfect man. Nether do
the words off the Apostle / import continuance off all these offices. For if
all these amongst them / and every one in his turn / finish this worck: yt is
enough / nothing falls from the liberality off the Lord / nothing from the
truth off this word. no more then he breaks promis / which undertaking to
furnish an other off all manner of worckmen until his house be finished /
after foundations laid / and patron left unto carpenters / and masons / how to
proceed in the rest off the building: with draws the master builder. for as
the lord abated the number of sorts of builders: so has he deminished the
variety off works / requisite to the building. And as the offices off Pastor
/ and Doctor which were not in the beginning off this building / are said to
be given to perfecting off it / even so these functions off Apost. etc. although
they be not in the end / may likewise be said. But I merueil that the Answ.
does not understand / that both this place of the Ephesians. and that off the
Corinthes ^. 12. speak of such Apostels / Prophets / and Evangelists / as
were noted with such marks off immediate calling / extraordinary gifts / etc.
as fall not into the Apostels / Prophets / etc. which he dreameth off. If
therefore he think that the Lord has bound him self by those words / to
continue these degrees: yt follows that he is bound to furnish them / with
gifts proper to them. For if promising such as S. Paul here means he give
other kinds / much inferior unto them: he thereby (which all godly ears
detest) is argued off untruth.

His other reason is / that Prophets in the 1. Corint. 14. and Prophecy p.
229. 230
12. Romans are put as ordinary. Whereunto I answer / that the word Prophecy /
is taken sometimes not for that particular function Saint Paul speaks off /
but generally for any public instruction off the people / in the will off God.
As when it is said extinguish not the spirit, despise not prophecy. That it
is so taken 1. These. 5. 19.
to the Romans yt is manifest / for that yt is divided / and altogether consumed
into the ministeries off the word. So that there being no ordinary minister off
the word in the church / which it embraces not: yt must follow that it is
taken there / for no particular 1. Tim. 3. Phili. 1. 1.
function. Which thing may better appear / for that in other places where S.
Paul deuideth the whole mynistrie of the church / the ministry off the word /
which he uttered here by the word off Prophecy / he there attributes not unto
Prophets / but unto Bishops. And when as the prophecy which the D. phansieth
/ is a simple Ministry off the church: that Prophecy mentioned there being
compounded / must needs be diverse. Likewise that a Prophet to the Corin. is
taken generally / for any which instructs with any word off exhortation / yt
is apparent both by that S. Paul attributes prophesying / to all which have 1.
Cor. 14. 1. 2. 3 4. 5. 6. 23. 24 3^* 39,
any gift off teaching: and in that he does so often oppose it / to the
fruteles speaking in a strange tongue / amongst the assembly of the faithful.

His testimonies out off writers remain / wherein amongst the ancient / he
has only a counterfeit sentence off Ambrose / as I have before declared:
which as yt is full of confusion / and disorder: so yt makes nothing for the
D. for if Apostels be bishops / and Evangelists / and Evangelists be Deacons
/ etc. what makes that to prove / that there are beside the bishops / and
Deacons / several functions of Apostels / and Evangelists / which is the
question. But how this fable is beaten down by all Tertul de Cor. mil. Athan.
in diuersis Epist. Eusebius ^. lib. 30. ca. Ieron. ad Euag. Igna. ad Tral. Magnes.
etc. Insti, li. 4. c. 3. s. 4. Upon Ephesians. 4.
ancient antiquity / that may be a sufficient argument / that the ancient
writers in great consent / speak off the whole ministry off the church / as
divided into these three orders / Bishops / Elders / and Deacons. After that
other ministries entered / as doorkepers / subdeacons / etc. yet there were none
but such lightheaded spirits as I have before spoken off / that durst peint out
any their mynysteries / with the names off Apostels / Evangelists / and
Prophets.

For the new writers (that the D. if his forhead be not of iron / may learn to
blush) I will towch their Judgment only / which he has alleged for him self.
Master Calvin dividing the mynistrie off the word into Apostels / Prophets /
Evangelists / Pastors / and Doctors: affirms that the two last only, that
is to say Pastors / and Doctors are ordinary. Bucer likewise dividing them into
perpetual, and for a time, affyrmeth that these perteine unto thestate off the
former church / and corrects the D. Ambrose for appliyng them to his times /
by the true Ambroses sentence to the contrary / in the first of his Offic.
Peter Martyr using the same division / shows that the function off Apost.
Upon 1. Cor. 12.
and Prophets / are not in use: and that the ministrye of Prophets / is not
only expyred in respect of telling things to come / but also for the manner
off interpreting the scripture. That he speaks not the same off the
Evangelist / was for that the Apostle makes no mention off him in that place.
Musculus deuideth the mynisteries Loci. com. de minist. of
off the word, into those which served for the beginning off the gospel, as
Apost. Euang. Proph.: and those which continue for ever, as Pastors, Doctors,
Elders, Bishops. Bullinger says the office off Apostleship / Prophetship / and
Euangelistship Dec. 5. ser. 3.
/ were instituted off the Lord for a time: and that these many ages / even
since the foundation off the kingedome off Christ, both Apostels, Evangelists,
and Prophets are ceased, into whose place are come bishops, Pastors,
Doctors, and Elders. Last off all the confession off the churches / having
spoken off all mynisteries off the word / mentioned off the Apostel: concludes
/ that off all those now it is lawful to esteem mynistries off the church /
Bishops / Elders / Pastors / and Doctors. These autors affirming that these
mynistries be extraordinary / that they were for a time / that other are come
into their places: the reader may see how the D. deals with him.

Let yt now be noted / how he has haled these sentences taken from them. Out
off Master Calvin he alleges / that God has stirred up Apostels, or
Evangelists since the time of the primitive church, and has done so at this
time. Within a line after he adds / yet I Instit lib. 4 ca. 3. se 4
call that extraordinary, because in churchs well dressed, it has no place.
Of the like sort yt is that he alleges out off my book: whereas upon Master
Calvin / so of my words / which affirm that God has raised up sometimes
Evangelists immediately by his spirit, without any calling off men: he would
conclude / that the office is ordinary / and perpetual: then which bouldnes
what can be greater? Out of Bucer he alleges / that there be now Eua^gelists.
Where if his manner of speech / that there are found Evangelists, could not /
yet that which he adds / that God does it by merueilous means: ought to have
kept him from that allegacion / except he thinck that a miraculous calling / be
perpetual / and ordinary. Out of the Confess. is brought / that these offices
off Apostles, etc. are mynistries off the new Testament: else should they have
great injury / seeing they were both in time / and dignity first. but who (the
D. set a part) would ever conclude thereof / that they are perpetual
ministeries? especially considering it adds immediately in plain words /
that the Apostles are ceased, and Pastors come into their places: which could
not be / if it had any such meaning as the D. phansieth. Where it says / that
there are yet Prophets: if that were not which I alleged out of it / towhing
the shutting out of those three ministeries / from them which are now in use:
yet the manner off speaking there are yet found, the same with that of Bucer
before alleged / declares that they meant thereby an extraordinary calling. For
so we use to speak of things rare / and not in commen use.

Last off all / where yt is alleged out off Bullinger / that the words
mentioned to the Ephe. are confounded: yt does not make for him / but is answer
both against the most places brought to prove Timothe a bishop / and against
those which he has cited / in the 3. and 4. Division off this chap. for if
those ministries being separate one from an other / their names notwithstanding
be confounded: yt must follow / that not every one which is called an Apostle
/ or bishop / etc. has that function which is by some propriety severed from
other / and which the Apostle me^t to the Ephesians. for where one man being an
Apostle / is sometimes called a Prophet / Bishop / Doctor / Elder / and Deacon:
if he will say that because he is called by these titles / he did therefore all
those functions proper unto those mynistries: beside thabsurdities before
showed / the untruth does manifestly appear / in the office off disposing off
the churches money / Whereoff the Apostles discharging 6. Act. 3. 4. 2. Cor.
11. 23.
them selves / ceased not therefore sometime to be called by the same name off
Deacons. And to use those authorities which he has brought / Ierom calls I
say the Prophet / both Evangelist / and Apostel. Yet I think the D. does not
esteem Ierom to have had so little judgment / as to think that he was either off
them / in that signification they are taken of Saint Paul. likewise Proaem.
sup. Esa. Page 405. Li. 1. inst. ca. 9. se. 1. up. 20. Act. 2. offic. alia est
enim, etc. cum veritas ipsa limatur, etc. Ephesians 4. 11.
where he has cited out off Calvin / that Timothe was a Pastor: when Calvin
calls him also an excellent Doctor, and makes that a several function from
the Pastor / yt is clear that he spoke not off the special function off a
Pastor. The same may be said off Beza / which calls S. Paul a Bishop. with
diverse other / wherein writers speaking off one in passing / and not off
purpose: content them selves with those general titles / which
notwithstanding when they inquired into the natures off them (as we do here)
spoke otherwise / which use is also noted off Cicero.

And to shut up this matter / it is to be understood / that there be diverse
significations off these words Apostles / Propheres / Doctors / etc. for in
general signification they agree unto all ministers off the word. Considering
that all are sent / all feed / teach / and by a trope are said to prophecy.
Their other signification which S. Paul sets forth / is particular / and
agrees only to only to one several ministry. Observe then how the D. has
trifled / when as a part off our question being / whether there be now Apostels
/ Prophets / and Evangelists in particular signification / and as they differ
as well one from an other / as from Pastors / and Doctors: he has brought
certain places / where these names be taken generally / and as every off them
may be verified off all mynistries off the word. as if upon that the Mayor off
the city / is called sometimes the officer / sometimes the Magistrate / he
should conclude that he has three several offices. And where (an other part
off our question being / whether these functions are now ordinary / or
extraordinary / perpetual or for some ruinous time) he has taken upon him to
prove them ordinary / and perpetual: he has alleged testimonies / which
confessing that some off these ministeries have been found in our days / ad
partly in expres words / partly in words / and circumstances of like value /
that they were extraordinary / that they are but for a time: then which what
can be greater mockery off his reader? And so I trust yt appears / as well
upon the arguments Ephesians. 4. 11.
I have used / as upon the shame off the D. answers: that off all the
mynisteries of the word / reckened of S Paul / there remain only Doctor / and
Pastor: and that the function off Apostles / Prophets / and Evangelists /
have no place in the church / onles the lord immediately styr them up / withowt
the ordinary calling by men.

Off the necessary residence of the Pastor 4. Tractat. 5. according to the D.
Cap. 1. Diuis. 1. page 235.
THe D. to deliver the Non residents / from the crime he is charged with /
flies from the judgment off the word off God / unto his own conscience: so
that if he / and his conscience although astonished / or blindled / can agree
off some easier way the^ is debated / all mouths are shut up to speak against
him. And pa. 238. he says that preaching, and private exhortations, must be
according to the conscience, and discretion off the Pastor: which is too
shameful a saying. In stead wheroff if he had put a good conscience (which
will admit no persuasion but out off the word off God): he had openly begged
that in question. The lord knew too well the unreformed corners / and false
doors of the best co^scice^ces / to commit his church which he loved so dearly
unto their 1. Cor. 4. 3. 4.
courteousie. When Saint Paul confesses that he was not as towching his
ministry justified / albeit his conscience cast him not in the teeth / of any
thing he had done: he declares that the conscience is no sufficent rule / to
direct the minister in his charge* Yet his was more Christ allike / then is to
be hoped after off any now. and when he says / that all the worckes off a good
minister / are 2. Tim. 3* 16.
taught out off the scripture inspired off God: he incloseth the Pastor within
streighter bounds / then the Answ. which leaves him in the large field / or
wilderness rather sometime off his conscience / sometime of the peoples
pleasure. That which he brings off the examples off the Apostels / and
Evangelists / is absurd: considering that both the callinges are diverse: and
even in the very point whereoff the question is towching the place / yt is
confessed of him / that the Pastor has one certain appointed him to exercise
his charge / which the other have not. Off this sort Diuis. 12. page 244.
is that he alleges after off sonas the Prophet: whose mynistery was
altogether extraordinary toward the Nineuites. Which if yt prove any thing:
yt proves that the pastor / after he has once laid open the sins off his
flock / and denounced the judgment against them / may go his ways withowt
either deputy / or return. Likewise that off S. Paul Act 20. free from the
Ephesians. blood, becawse he had declared them the whole counsel off God. Which is
first impertinent: considering that the pastors teaching at his Diuis. 13: Pa
244.
charge / is not to be compared with the Apostels teaching at one church / but
at all the churches of his Apostelship. Then yt is apparently against him:
considering that the Apostle which clears him self off their blood / does
nowithstanding all the knowledge they had / charge the pastors with watch /
and ward over them / as those which should answer for them. So that onles S.
Paul's diligence had been poursued in feeding them / which were already so well
fed / not the people only / but the pastors also / should have perished.

And even the extraordinary callinges / are so far from strenghthening these
startinges a side from appointed charges: that they help to bind them more
streitly to them* for they had not only a general calling to execute their
function: but withal special direction unto the persons / and places unto
which the Lord would have their ministry to apperteine. for when those off
Nazareth thought much / that our Sau. Christ healed in other cities Luke 4.
23. etc.
off Galile / and not in theirs / where he was brought up: he alleges the
calling off God / which sent him to do miracles in other places / rather then
there: and shows the cawse why Elias rather relieved the extreme famine / and
Elizeus cured the leprosy of strangers / then of their own country: for
that they were sent unto them. Also desired to tarry in a place / he said it
was not Luke 4. 43
at his liberty to tarry / but that he must preach to other cities. alleging
this reason / that he was sent off his father so to do. Considering therefore
that they had not only general callinges to do their duties / but also where
/ and to whom: much more in the callinges which are ordinary / and certain it
owght to be observed / that men have not only callinges to preach / but
direction unto the place / and parties to whom they should preach. Which
because yt is not now / without calling of the church: yt follows there can
be none such. That he adds / if he have care off them, is altogether from the
cawse: considering that the pastors care / is but one part of his duty: and may
be taken off one never present. Likewise that of his sufficient deputy (beside
that yt comes after to be spoken of) if the absence he phansieth be unlawful:
the deputy for yt is idly mentioned.

I alleged that the Evangelists, and Apostles tarried more in one place then
in an other. Which may be easily understood / not only in that S Paul /
preached somewhere years / other where months / in some places weeks / in
other not all but in that by certain vocation S. Peter / etc. were more bound
to Gal. 2.
the places where the Jews / then where the Gentiles were: and Saint Paul / and
Barnabas had in their general charge / a more straight bond to preach unto the
Gentiles / then to the Jews. And albeit the Evangelists he imagines / are let
so lose that they may preach through the realm: yet even in that scope he
leueth them / they have a nearer knot / and further duty off preaching in
places of their nativity / abode of friends / and kinsfolk. Therefore if the
residence off a Pastor / be no more then the D. plainly sets down / that he
ought to do it especially in that place, and more in that then page 242.
in others: the difference between a Pastor / and them / towching the bond to a
place / granted also off the Answ. is clean taken away. Burhe will not answer
the former reason / because it comes out off place. Where for so much as
preaching in other places / is alleged to be one off the chief cawses off non
residence: all men see that this arrow was shot at the heart off his cause. And
if yt had no place here: why did not he carry yt to the proper place? how comes
it to pass / that he answers yt not else where? But how vain this excuse is
/ it appears: seeing eue^ in this division / to prove that the Pastors may
preach in other places / then in their charges / which is that he refuses to
speak off / as impertinent: he alleges the example of the Apostels / and
Evangelists / and so continues almost a whole side off repetitions.

Likewise to that alleged / that Timothe, and Tite, came not from Ephesus and
Crete off their own heads, but called off the Apostle a cheiff governor off
the church, which can be no vvarrant to those which leave their charges
without any such calling: he answers not. That which is said off the D.
that S: Paul sent for Timothe for his own private business: is untrue / nether
has any grownd off the word. And if he thinck that those words help him /
that Timothe should bring Marck as one profitable to serve him: they rather
confute him. for yt is absurd to imagine / 2. Tim. 4. 11.
that S. Paul would take two such notable lights from the service off the
church / to serve his private business / and to do that which might be done by
others / which had no public charge in the church: especially considering that
he had Luke with him before. Therefore that service must be expounded / of the
service off the gospel / whereunto he would employ them.

Whereas I alleged for residence / against those which leaving their proper
charges wander in other places / that they Diuis. 2. Page 237.
should not attempt any thing in the ministry, without calling: the Ans.
says / a man is not so called to one place, that he is restrained from doing
good in other: which is not the question. For it is not denied but he may do
good by prayer / counseill / and writing After be says / that he constantly
belieueth that in the more places he labors, the more his service is accepted
unto God: and p. 241. that he is a member, and minister off the whole church
generally: and page 224. wheresoever the preacher may do most good, thither he
is called of God. Wherein beside the miracle off making Apostles / he brings
in other wonders which the Lord him selff never wrought: which is / to change
a Pastor into an Apostle. And beside that it is directly against the Act. 20.
17. Philip. 1. 1 Socrat. li. 5. ca. 8. page 224.
order off the scripture / which calls them bishops off such / and such a
particular church / and not off the whole church: against the Canons off the
old Councels / which forbad the bishops to go beyond their own bounds / and
assigns that cause off appointing Patriarchs: yt is against that him self
has set down / where putting difference between pastors / bishops / and other
preachers / he says / that Pastors, and bishops have their cures limited
Whereupon follows that if they go to other places / they both pass their
limits / and destroy the difference assigned off the Answ. between them / and
other licenced preachers.

Yea if he be minister off the whole church / he has a necessary calling to
preach in as many places / as he can possibly: as he which otherwise shall be
gilty off their blood / over whom having a mynistry / he has done no duty.
But forasmuch as the Pastor has his calling unto one certain place only / yt
must needs be that he going to other churches off his own head / goes
withowt calling. Onles he will here / fly unto secret persuasions off the
spirit off God / without the voice off the church: which is mere
Anabaptisticall. And where he says / that God calls him to that place where
he may do most good: first he does presumpteously / that takes upon him to
determine where he may do most good / and that which controlment off the
churches judgment / which placing him in a certain church / thereby gives her
sentence / that he might do most good there.

Then I answer / that although he could know where he might do most good: yet
that is no sufficient calling off God. For the lord calls sometime his
ministers unto places / where they gain least / and sends none to those
where after preaching would follow repentance / as appears by that our Savior
Christ speaks off Corazim / and Bethsaida / compared with Tire / and Sydon
Math. 11. 20. Ezec. 3. 6.
/ off Capernaum compared with Sodom: and by that the Lord says to Ezechiel /
off the Jews compared with the Gentiles. And our Sau. Christ which knew where
he might do most good / and best fill his hand off the Lords corn / following
the calling off God his father / even in the land off Jury where his charge was
/ preached more in certain stoncharted towns / then in those which were better
affectioned to his doctrine. Which may appear both by Jerusalem / and the
examples before recited / and especially in Capernaum. In which for that he
preached so often / and wrought so many miracles / yt is in an other place
called his own cyty. Now if our Sau. Christ preached no where but by the
calling off God his father / and yet few in places more 9. Math. 1
abundantly / where he knew he should have a thinner harvest: yt follows that
yt is both untrue which the Answ. says / that God calls a man to preach /
where he may do most good: and true / that the lawful voice of the church
(being the same to the Mynisters now / which the holy spirit off God was in
those extraordinary callinges) owght to go before every one in his mynistry /
not only for direction off him to preach / but also for the place where.
Whereupon follows / that he which being placed in one church / leapeth into
an other / without an other calling off the church / runs or ever he be
sent. So that althowgh the Pastor had never so hearty a desire to profyt, in his
wandering from place to place: yet having no calling / there is no obedience:
and therefore if in casting his net into an other man's fishing / he should
enclose never so great a multitude: yet with out pardon / he shall one day
hear / that to obey is better the^ sacrifice* and to harken better then the
fat of ra^mes* Where he adds that God 1. Sam. 15. 22.
enclineth not so to one church, that he would have the other neglected: I
grant / and further that every one ought to take care off all the churches /
but according to the bounds off that calling / wherein he is set off God. And
beside that I have showed / that the love off God toward men is no certain
rule / to direct the minister in his function / but his calling: the Answ. by
this reason / must take shipping over to Rome / and Constantinople / and to
whatsoever place he shall understand to have need off his help.

You do as you say dally, not with mine / but with the holy Diuis. 3. page 237.
Gostes metaphors off pastor / and watcheman. And first where you would so
assign the resemblance between these / and a Pastor off the church in other
things / that you would not have page 220.
yt come to the diligence / and continuance in feeding: you are manifestly
confuted by the words off the scripture. for in the person of Peter / yt
requiring off all ministers off the word / that they should feed, feed, feed,
according to the charge committed unto John. 21. 15. etc.
them: shows that the similitude reaches to the diligent continuance. Which
may better appear / in that as the government of the Pastor toward his
church / is set out in the picture off a shepherd: so is the spiritual
government of our Savior Christ / shadowed forth in the same similitude. and
life as our spiritual Psalm. 23. John 10.
feeding is off Christ: so the principal means which he uses to feed us by /
is the Pastor. Whereupon yt follows / that if it be needful for us at all
times / to have our spiritual feeding of Christ: yt is needful also to have
always / that hand which the Lord especially has appointed to give it by.
Likewise noting a good minister by watch day and night / without cease / yt is
clear that Esa. ^2 6.
the resemblance reaches unto the continuance upon their charge. Whereunto
pertains / that the scripture compares the spiritual watch over the
churches / with the watch which shepherdes kept in those countries / which for
the multitude off wolves / and other hurtful beasts / watched day and night.
For thereby Luk 28. Genesis 31. 40.
is implied a greater attendance / then if the comparison had been drawn off
the fashion off our countries. Which although it be expressly set down in my
49. page yet the Ans. will not understand ^t: but says he knows not
wherefore the 2. of S. Luke should be quoted.

To conclude it is to be observed / that albeit he grateth the cares off his
reader / by so often repetition off these syly differences: yet he will not once
acknowledge the strenght off the argument: which is not as he imagines off
like, but off the less to the more. For if there owght to be such diligence /
and continuance off watch for things off so small value: how much greater
owght yt to be for those / which are bowght with the precious blood off the
son of God. If for those which have sometimes truce with their ennemy: much
more for those which have restles war. If against the hazard off this life
only: much more against the danger off everlasting death. Therefore to let
the untruth off some differences which he raketh up / unworthy off confutation
/ rest in the judgment off the reader: if they were all true / the argument
remains still unanswered. For albeit the absence / and substitution which the
D. imagines / be allowed in the wordly watch: yet it follows not that the
same is to be allowed off / in the spiritual.

Nether helps yt which he alleges / and that in an other pa. 221. and 244.
place / out off Chrysostom: that the sheep are here reasonable, which are
there unreasonable. Wherein first comes to be observed / how all is fish with
the Answ. that comes to net. To briue the church from the election off her
minister / he alleged out off Chrysostom / that the people is nothing but a
tumultuous stir, compacted of folly. Here where he would make more elbowroume
for the Pastor / they are reasonable sheep / such as can feed themselves / such
as can page 215.
provide for them selves. Thus he is content for advantage / both him self to
play on both hands: and to draw his Doctor to the same. But if this reason be
oftentimes in the reasonable sheep page 221.
more ennemy then friend unto the spiritual feeding; if the setld: sheep have
naturally more appetite to desire / taste to discern / and Romans 8. 7 Math. 16.
17.
means to enjoy their convenient feeding / then these reasonable have for
theirs: then this sentence off Chrysostom helps not. And yt may peradventure
seem to smell off the smoke of free will / and off the natural power of man:
whereoff he is often too loud a preacher.

Likewise that which he brings / off the difference off the temporal meat
soon digested, and off the spiritual which continues for ever, 221. 556. 244.
so often repeted: and of that no man can take the sheep off God out of his hand,
is ashamefull abuse off the holy scripture. For to let pa^ how many ways this
feeding is through the malice off the devil / Math. 13. 4. etc.
and corruption off men's natures / either clean taken away / or turned to the
hurt off the hearers: likewise not to stand in that the Pastor knows not what
time the Lord calls effectually / and gives that meat that never consumes /
to those which are under his charge / which ought to keep him in a continual
exercise off his function / and waiting for that hour when the Lord will towch
their hearts: I say not to stand upon these / the D. should have known / that
as the Lord declares / that none can take them out off his hand: so he has
disposed off the means / whereby he will hold them / which is the ministry
off his word. And as he shows the virtue of the word / in the hearts of
those which are effectually called / to be perpetual: so he ordeineth y^
should have that perpetuite / by that means off preaching / whereby it first
took root: In watering that which is planted / feeding ^. Cor. 3. 7.
first with milk / then with whole meat / them which are once conceived by the
immortal seed of the word preached / until such time as they come to their
perfect growght / and stature off the ^. Pet. 1. 23 and 2. 2. Ephesians. 4. ^5.
full age off Christ. Ad hereunto / that these places applied unto the use the
D. puts them / serve to prove that preaching off the word / is needles
amongst those which have believed / and as well that the pastor may be away
without any deputy / as with one. For if the residence off the Pastor may be
less / because the sheep off God can not fall from their calling / and because
the spiritual food which they have once tasted of / endures to life: the same
coming to pass vvithowt any further instruction / yt follows by the D.
reason / that they may be without all ministry off the word. And if this may
diminish the continual residence off the Pastor / yt may as well abate the
diligence off the hearers: so that after they feel them selves to have believed
/ they need not seek so carefully / the food off the word off God. But as
sentence given by God that S. Paul should appear at Rome / and not perish Act.
23. 11 Act. 27. 23 etc. and 27. 31.
with his company in the sea / it being impossible that he should perish / or
any off his company / he truly said / that they could not be saved / onles the
mariners did abide in the the ship: even so it impossible to take Gods sheep
out of his hand / is truly said notwithstanding / that yt is impossible for
them to be saved / withowt continuance off feeding by the word off God. For as
that was the ordinary means / to deliver from ship wrack: so this from
spiritual destruction.

In the next division that which he answers of a Pastor acepted of God,
though he be not so wise as Salomo^, etc. is from the purpose. pa. 23^.
if he would have answered / he should have said / that a man having both his
hands full / and more then he can overcome / off the charge committed unto
him: may voluntarily / and off his own head / reach out his hand for more. The
mildnes off Christ hinders not his justice / not only against the unfaithful
servant / which hides his talent in a napkin: but against the foolish / which
having enough to do at home / makes him self worck abroad. The cavil of
baptism is utterly unworthy of answer: considering that I expound my self in
the next words. The example off celebrating baptism but once or twice in the
year, is fondly / and without judgment alleged: seeing that it was very
inconvenient / and not to be followed. Preaching at the discretion off the
Pastor, is confuted: that other may mynister sacraments, then mynisters off
the word, is a begging off that in controversy / and after disputed.

To that that I propounded of the necessary / and continual abode / to the end
that the preaching thorough knowledge off thestate page 139.
off the people / might have the better effect: he answers / that the
Apostles althowgh they did not long continue in a place, yet prevailed much.
as if the Pastors now had the discretion off spirits / which the Apostels / or
were armed as they / with power off vvorking miracles / and distribution off
gifts / whereby their preaching was made so fruitful: or as if there were
not more particular knowledge required in a Pastor toward his flock / then in
an Apostle toward his charge. Considering that an Apostle might execute his
Apostelship / toward those whom he never saw / or was present with: which I
thinck he will not say off a 2. Colos. ^ page 241.
Pastor. Where he says / yt is not so hard a matter to know the peoples
conditions: all wise men see the contrary: yea the experience of men deceived
in the natures off their friends / wives / and children / best known unto them
/ might have taught him otherwise. And if he were so righthanded in this matter
/ as he pretends: yet considering the estate off his people changes / in
the whole / or in the particulars: yt is meet for the knowledge of their estate
/ he should wait upon the alterations.

He says also / that admonition being given them in due time, and order, their
blood shallbe upon their own pates: and in other place / that if the the city
be sufficiently admonished, leaving some behind him, the watchman has doo^
his duty, and may go to another place. Wherein first (as his wo^t page 244.
is) he takes that for granted / which is the question. For yt is in
question what is sufficient admonition / and what is to admonish in time / and
order: whether as long as he continues Pastor of that church / which we
maintein: or until he shall esteem his church lightened with the knowledge
off the truth / which the D. supposes. Then the similitude of the vvatcheman /
confuteth his imaginary sufficiency. For as where the war is durable / there
yt is not enough for the vvatcheman to have discried the ennemies once / or
twice / onles he do yt as often as they come against the city: even so yt can be
no discharge unto the spiritual watcheman / to have given warning / onles he
do yt during the whole time off the spiritual war: which being continual /
and withowt truce / requires his continual watch. And this being alleged pa
244.
off me afterward / is altogether unanswered.

Moreover there is herein / difference between the spiritual / and bodily
watch / that there yt is enough of one danger to have given one vvaarning: but
in the spiritual / the alarm bell must be rung oftentimes / for one / and the
same danger / yea and Philip 3. 1. 2. 2. Pet. ^, 12.
that in things well known. Again although in bodily vvatch / the watchma^
after he has given warning may go to his rest: yet it is not so with the
spiritual watchma^. For he is bound not only to admonish the^ of the coming
of the en^emies / but to fortify / and comfort them: they must as the priests
in the battles of the Israelites / blow continually the silver trumpet / not
only that they should every one take him self to his armor: but that in the
fight through that passioned / and stirring music off trumpettes / they might
blow up / and whet the courage off the soldiers. And herein he is greatly
abused / that in this whole disputacion / and precisely here / he imagines the
duty off the Pastor / to be only in instructing the sinner / and giving to
understand what he must do: when as the Lord teaches / that this vvatch
consists as well in admonishing the righteous / and those that have lived
Ezec. 3. 18 19. 20.
long in all commendation off good worckes / as the sinner which never was
lifted up / out off the mire off his wickedness. Likewise that the Pastors
agreement with the fieldshepherd / is not only in leading them to the
pastures / and setting meat before Ezec. 34. 4. 2. Pet. 1. 12
them / whereby they may be kept from staruing: but in healing the sick /
bringing home the straies / strengthening the weak: whereunto if we ad that
off S. Peter / which teaches that he owght to strengthen the strong: I would
gladly know off the Answ. what time there is / wherein one off these duties is
not in season to be done off the Pastor.

Further this answer cleaves not together. For if the Pastor have discharged
his duty after his supposed warning, that their blowd shall light upon their
own pates: what need he leave a deputy behind him? He dare not answer that
the deputy is but off pure grace off the Pastor / and if he leave him to
instruct off necessity: how has he discharged his duty / that in necessary
substitution off an other in his place / he still confesses him self bownd
unto? And those other duties off conforting the sad / binding up the broken /
etc. be as well commanded unto the Pastor / as the bringing them to the
knowledge of the truth: and be also more proper / considering that his
government is properly off those / which have some entrance into the church.
by what rule is it lawful more / to turn over unto his deputy / these other
offices off ministry: then that which him selff esteems him bound to / in his
own person? If he may set over his second / and third instructions / and
admonitions / etc. why may be not the first? So it may come to pass (which he
deniing in words / does in deed confirm) that a Pastor page 243.
may do all by deputy.

That he alleges off God directing the preacher in his words, and matter:
tends to Anabaptisme. For as well may it be alleged to prove / that the
Pastor may preach without study: as withowt knowledge of the estate of his
people / as a means to direct both his words / and matter / to the most
profit of his hearers. Where he says / a discrete preacher will so temper his
matter, as he may profit all, and hurt none. If he had told us how / and off
what droges tha^ receipt is made / which is fit at all times / in all places: I
should better have known what to have answered. In the mean season / he is
clean beside the question: which is not whether a man may profit / in
preaching to the people / whose estate he knows not: but whether he profits
more / that knows yt. He that casts blindefold / may hit the mark: but no
wise man will lay any thing on his head. The reasons I brought to prove / that
the want off knowing the estate / may either hinder the fruit / or give occasion
off that danger / which by knowing it might be avoided: are for the most
part vntowched.

Here his memory serves him not / for any place out of the Diui.s 6. pa. 240.
1. Reg. 6. 1. Chron. 28. 11. 12. 13. 19. 1. Sam. 19. 12. 1. Cor. 9. 13.
law, which proves continual residence off the Pastor. I will let pass the
howses built rownd about / and joining to the temple / which being done off
Solomon (as was the rest off the building) according to the word of God /
might declare how near their charges the lord will have the Ministers off the
church. Likewise I will not press the example which is alleged / off Ely
sitting at the door of the Tabernable / to espy the manners / and answer the
doubts off those which entered. I will content my selff with the Apostel /
the best expounder off the law: who setting forth the Priests function / by
that part off it which consisted in sacrifices: uses a word off great
strenght / to bind them to a continual residence / and signifies in effect /
a continual sitting at their (...).
charge. Now considering that the Pastors diligence is the same in his church /
that theirs was in their charge: continual presence being required off them /
the same / or greater rather if greater can be / is required off the pastor: as
he which has greater trust / committed unto him.

That which is spoken off diverse beside the Pastor, able to dissolve doubts
which arise: not to meddle with the truth thereof / nor to stay in the great
gifts required in one / that should comfort him that is cast down / whom the
scripture affirms to be so care / that a man shall skarce find one amongst
a thousand: I answer Job. 33. 23
that it helps not / not only becawse they hanging of their Pastor / know
not to whom to have recourse: but also considering that the dissoluing off the
doubt / or comfort according to the necessity off the person / depends not
off knowledge only / but upon the blessing which the Lord gives. that being
therefore greater / and more abundant / when yt is done by the instrument
which the Lord has sanctified for that purpose: yt follows / that if there
were such supplies as he speaks of: yet the Pastors presence is necessary.
And therefore yt helps him not / which he page 244.
alleges afterward out off the Coloss. that they should admonish one an other
in psalms, etc. but makes against him / considering that if particular
persons / have a duty off admonishing those that are fallen: the Pastor has
much more. And if the lord will not spare the means off the admonition off a
private man / for restoring off him that is fallen: he will much less spare
the mynistery off the Pastor.

That which he often repeteth of help by reading off the scriptures, is not to
the purpose. For if the help of the Pastor be not requisite / when the sheep
are particularly stricken off the Lord: there is no necessary use off him at
all. And where the Lord has provided resistance against tentation / not only
by reading / but also and that especially / by the lively voice off the
Mynister: what is else to betray the sheep unto the woulf / if this be not / to
leave them destitute off the most principal means off their defense? beside
that / the place off Tymothe 2. 3. is abused / whilst he draws those things
to private men / which the Apostle speaks off the Mynister off the word:
whom he calls the man off God, as the manner of the scripture is to call the
Prophets / in which respect Saint Paul so calls Timothe in an other place.
Nether does it belong unto private persons 1. Tim. 6: 11.
to teach / and to confute false doctrine: which the Apostle shows to be a
part off those good works / which scripture storeth that man off God with. To
the next division he answers nothing / but yet fills up the place / as is
there to be seen. Diuis. 8. page 241. 1. Tim. 4. 12. Io. 10. 4.


To that out off the Apostle / and our Savior Christ / off the Pastors
presence, that in going before his flock, he might serve for a patron off good
vvoockes: he answers that our Savior Christ / and Saint Paul serve for
examples, to those which never saw them, and with whom they were not
continually. Albeit the light off their example shining so clear / might be
seen off those which were far of: yet the same follows not in the pastors /
whose light is a great deal dim^er. Likewise the pastor being notas our S.
Christ / and S. Paul lights off the world / but off those howses over which
they are set: ought to be placed where they may give most light unto them.
Considering that it is unmeet / not only to put the light under a bushel /
where it is altogether unprofitable: but also under the table / where
notwithstanding it may give some comfortable remedy / against the darcknes.
Therefore for so much as the example that may be both seen / and heard / has
more force to conform the followers unto yt / then that which is only heard:
the reason remains still unanswered. seeing the question is not only / how he
may serve for example / but how he may do yt to their most advantage.

To that of the restreint of Pastors to their proper flocks, 1 Pet. 5. 2. Act
20 28.
he answers / he wrote not to Pastors only, but to all in general, that
have the name off Elders. his reason thereof that Peter says he was also an
elder, is senseles / and has no manner of taste. I will not stick to confess
/ that S. Peter vvrote in those words to other Elders then the Pastors: yet
that he vvrote to them only / that vveretied to particular congregacions
(which mainteineth the reply) yt is manifest by the words alleged out of S.
Peter. Wherein if I have brought the right sense / he owght to have rested: else
to have confuted thereasons / wherewith that translation is warranted / and
the other which he sets down / removed; and not thus co^fusedly to make a
mashe of all. And it avails him not / to seek corners in the diverse
interpretation off the place: when as that off the Acts does in plain / and
confessed speech / utter the same that is here debated off.

After he adds howsoever the place be expounded, yet it makes not against
him. No if S. Peter / and Paul cry never so high / in this language of
continual residence: yet the D. is deaf / and will not hear. If both the
Apostles do not only command the Pastors to feed in their proper flocks: not
only that they must employ their talentes / but where: yt is manifest that
they shut out / that rouing abroad unto other churches / which is pretended
for Non residence. I showed how the argument is good / taken from the place off
the Thessal. that for so much as S. Paul conceived a great grief / in being
absent a small space from those / to whom 1 Thessalonians, 2. 17.
he was not so streitly bound / as the Pastor to his flock: the Pastor owght
much more to be greiued / to be away from his flock. And consequently thereoff
must follow / that if their absence sat so near their hearts / as yt owght: yt
would hang such plummets off their heales / as should hinder them from those
lightfooted leapes / which he mainteineth. I added also / that the Pastor
having the same duty unto his proper church, which the Apostles had toward
all the churches of their charge: yt must follovv, that as they were
continually in their ministry toward some off those churches: so the Pastor
should be continual upon the charge off his church. That he brings against
this / that the Apostle did not speak this in any duty off mynistery: for that
a learned man notes off that place, how the saints desire to see one an
other bodily, is ridiculous: as if his desire to see them / could not stand
with the duty off the his mynistery.

In the two next diuis. unto the reasons alleged / off the page 242. 243.
Pastors care so much more stirred up, as he sees the blessing of God upon his
labor: and of familiar acquaintance needful in a Pastor toward his flock,
to embolden them to come unto him, both which are best procured by continual
residence: he answers nothing. where I alleged / the singular love by this
means wrought between the Pastor, and the flock: he asks me how I know it
/ seeing I had never experience in any? I know yt of the cawses off love /
whereoff the daily conversation / and delight to be together / is one off the
principal. off natural reason which I cyted out off Aristotle / that teaches
how men have greater care / over things proper unto them / then over those
that are commen to them with more. And having greater care / yt followweth they
have greater love / from whence the care proceeds. Likewise I know yt by
experience in the Apostle S. Paul: which utters greater affections off love
toward the Corinth. and Philip. and other with whom heremaineed longest / and
suffered most for: then toward the other churches / where he made not that
abode / nor took so great pains.

He asks what Aristotle had to do with non residence? if yt had been but
Balams ass / he should have been schoolmaster fit enough for some / which
refuse to be taught by the word off God. But this is one off M. D. oracled /
which he says owght to be believed? considering that speaking off the natural
causes off preservation of things / for which I alleged him / he spoke of
things perteining to his profession. That he charge me with not reporting
Aristot. words truly / is a wrangling cavil: for I kept the sense off the
author / considering that a thing commen to many / requires the care off many.
That he says / it can not be true that it is neglected off all, which is cared
for off all, is to childish: considering the flower off speech so often used
off all writers / both profane / and holy: as they living are dead / having
nothing possess all things / he that is every where / is no where. Nether is
care taken in less measure then yt owght to be (which I speak off) contrary
to neglect, as he supposes: but a kind off neglect. That he adds a man
owght not so take care off hit private things, as to neglect the commen
wealth, is from the purpose: seeing the pastor in his charge over his flock /
serves not him self / but the commen profit / and that off the whole church.
forasmuch as it pertains to the commodity off the whole body / that the
part which he has the nourishement off / be well preserved: beside that I have
showed / how the care for other churches / may be with a continual residence
at his own.

In the next diui. skowring over again the removing of Apostles / and
Eua^gelistes from place to place (which is answered) Page 243. (...)
he adds that the Pastors did the same, which is utterly untrue: that a man
may be transferred from one place to an other, which is no part of the
question: that those which have given their names to the gospel, are
sufficiently armed with faith, although the Pastor be not present, which is
absurd / when the armor off faith / with the rest off the complete harness
off o Christian / which he speaks off in the next diuis. is not so put upon /
but that it is daily to be put on / and that by the preaching off the gospel
especially, He says further that although they be tempted, yet they can not be
overcome: which is confuted not ^nely by diverse examples of most excellent
saints / Noe / David / Peter / etc. but by whole churches off Galatia / etc.
which have been carried away by false teachers. For if he speak off the final
victory / yt is absurd: consydering that that depends off the election off
God / unknown unto him / and may be as well said off the elect which have not
yet believed. Likewise that it is a more acceptable worck, to gain those which
are altogether in ignorance: wherein beside that he takes upon him to be a
planter off churches / Page* ^^^*
which before he assigned to be proper to the Apostles: I answer that albeit it
be never so good a worck in yt self / yet it is not good / much less the best
/ unto him which has no calling thereunto. And in that he presumes a calling /
he does but beg that in controversy / which is also before refuted. That he
alleges off the lost groat* Prodigal son, etc. makes against him:
considering that those places are not off strangers from the church / but off
them which after knowledge off the truth / fall into some corruption of life /
or doctrine / as appears in the parable of the stray sheep / Lu. 15. 14. etc.
which although it be of the same kind with the other two / he has by all
likelihood left out / because it did more plainly show his folly. In this
respect also S. James says / that a man that gains his brother straied from
the truth / s^ueth a soul. He says 5. Iam. 19: 20.
his brother / not his neighbowr. Therefore this most excellent worck off
converting sinners / and finding off those which are lost / being always in
the purest churches / through the ambicion / covetousness / idleness /
licentiousnes / etc. off one / or other: it follows / that the pastor having
exercise of the most excellent worck which can be / in his own church / owght
not by the D. own reason / cast him self upon others. All in the two next
diuis. is answered: nether contain they any answer / proper unto the reasons
alleged off me.

He answers that the similitude off the eye, and soul in the body, Diuis.

compared with the Pastor in his church, agreing in some points, can not be
applied to the residence: becawse the Pastor may be absent from his flock
withowt present destruction, which the eye, and soul can not. If this be a
sufficient exception / there be few similitudes in the scripture / which are
able to hold out: and he might as well say / that as the eye waxes worse / and
worse through age / so the Pastor may w^r every day more fool then other.
Howbeit this is clear / that forsomuche as the Pastor does the office off an
eye / and off the soul Mat. 6. 22
unto his church: his absence from it ought to be such / as the body off the
church may nether see the worse / nor be les disposed / and lively unto all
good worckes: which is enowgh to break the neck / both off his monthly / much
more quarterly sermons / and off his reading deputies.

Hitherto pertains which the D. intitleth / the most effectual Theleuenth

kind off preaching: where he would if he durst / expound diligent preaching /
preaching once a month: to which end he stowreth up a fresh / the difference
between spiritual food / and corporal / before answered. But because he dare
not take upon him this defense / and the rest of the treatise has nothing but
a childishe excuse / off his reproaches against the Ministers of London, an
impudent denial off his Lewdenes toward the weomen, an intolerable bragg
off his benefits / and off his preaching often, out courses against me / all
beside the cawse: I will leave them in the readers judgment.

In the next Tract. off the great conuenience off preaching before
administration off the Sacraments / falling also into this page 562.
treatise (as that which pulls at the least one of those feathers / wherewith
non residentes so willingly take their flight from their own charges) there
should have been almost as title to answer / as in the other: if the D. had
not used such open false accusations / as he may thereby seem to have striuen
for the mastrie thereoff / with the father off them. And first to let pas his
correction off thorder off my reasoning / whereby he makes him selff more then
ridiculous / to all which have a grain off knowledge that ways: to that he
says / that John as minister preached in the wilderness, and baptized in
Jordan, and thereupon will conclude / that if preaaching before the Sacraments
now have grownd in Iohnes example, preaching in the wilderness, and baptizing in
rivers have the same: I answer that the case is nothing like. For his preaching
in the wilderness / was by special vocation / whereunto he was directed by an
express propheceye. This instance therefore is unfitly alleged / which Es.
40. 7.
albeit it were incident to his ministry: yet that was by extraordinary
calling. The baptizing in Jordan / was for that he sought the commodity off
water / as appears by other places / where John. 3 23
he likewise baptized not as the D. pretends / for that his mynisterie called
him more to that place / then unto an other.

Yt is also untrue / that the Apostles in that they were ministers of the word,
preached in all places, and wrought miracles. For then all ministers pa. 563.
off the word / should do the same. Considering that as whatsoever agrees
unto one man / as he is man / agrees unto all / even so whatsoever agrees
unto one minister off the word / as he is minister theroff / must needs be
verified off all. The reason wheroff is more known / then that the D. withowt
blusshing / owght thus to be ignorant off: that whatsoever is verefyed off a
general, as general, is verefyed off all underneath yt. Therefore that the
Apostels preached the word / they did it in that they were ministers off the
word: but that they preached in all places / and joined therewith miracles /
they did it not as ministers off the word / but as such ministers / that is to
say / extraordinary / and Apostles. Where he says / there is an other reason
off preaching before John's baptism, then before ours, for that John had to do
with those that believed not in Christ, whhich he calls a little after
infidels, and we have to baptize infantes only: to pass by his ignorance off
calling the Jews at that time infidels (the only people off God / even before
John's baptism) which notwithstanding deserves the whip: he owght to
understand / that albeit the baptism be administered unto infantes / which have
no use off preaching yet for so much as the knowledge off that mynistery /
necessarily pertains to the whole assembly / and particularly to those which
undertake the bringing up off the infantes* the necessity off preaching before
the Sacrament / does remain.

He says / that it can not be gathered off S. Math. that S. John preached
immediately before he baptized and yet the first reason I alleged / Diuis. 2.
page 563. 19. ca. 4. 5
that he baptized after he had preached, he clean passes by: the other off
the Acts / he understands not how it can be gathered. Although the
interpretation I noted was not commenly known / as that which towched off some
few / was not seen of diverse writers off name: yet when I pointed him to it /
I supposed he would have understood. But I presumed the ^^che off his
understanding / and yet not knowing what I would note / he condemns the sense
I have followed / as tending to Anabaptistry or Papistrie, or I know not what.
S. Paul meaning to refer the gifts off the holy ghost / which the twelve
disciples at Ephesus / were to receive by putting on off hands / unto the
performance 1. Act. 5.
off the truth off the promise figured by baptism / and so to join the sign
with the thing signified: in the fourth verse shows how John preached, that
his disciples should believe in Jesus Christ which came after him. After in
the 9. verse. he shows Act. 19.
that those disciples off John, and not (as is commenly supposed) those twelve
disciples off Ephesus / having heard John's preaching, and not (as is also
supposed) Paul's / were baptized into 4. verse 5. verse.
the name off the lord Jesus. Which interpretation as yt flows / and has
plain proof off the two conjunctions / which have relation one to an other /
and can not without violence be severed: so off all other yt most stops the
mouth off the Anabaptists, and Papists, taking all coulor off Argument from
them: and withal notes the order I alleged yt for / that after they had
heard John preach, they were baptized.

Where it being most boldly affirmed off the D. that it is manifest Diuis. 3
page 505
that our Savior Christ was baptized without preaching, he owght to have
showed yt by manifest reasons: he not only set down no reason / but against
the reasons I alleged / opposes his naked saying. For that that S. Luke has
not, that S. John preached immediately before he baptized, is unworthy off
answer: as if the order off the story could not show that / withowt the word
immediately: or as if nothing might be said done immediately after an other /
but where some such precise note off time is added. That he says / he knows
no purpose why our Savior Christ should be at John's sermon: yt was answered /
that he vouchesafing to be baptized off John / yt was probable / that he would
honor the ministry off the word with his presence: which he passes with
silence, beside that he must learn / that our Savior Christ growing in
wisdom / Luke 2. 52.
and stature until the time off his baptism / when he received the holy ghost
withowt measure: no more neglected the ordinary means off God / whereby he
received his increase off wisdom / then the ordinary nourishement whereby he
grew in stature.

That the disciples were preached unto of the use of the supper / Diuis. 4:
before they received / the reason follows in the 6. diuis. That S. Luke
noted the sommes / rather then laid out at large / the sermons of our Sa.
Christ: howsoever the D. will not acknowledge yt / is more manifest then his
impudent denial / owght to cawse me enter into proof off. To the next reason /
of continual practice Diuis. 5.
of preaching immediately before the Sacraments / proved out of S. Luke / his
answer is insufficie^t. For beside that it is untrue / that the assembly
infantes excepted / are sufficiently instructed off the use off baptism: his
answer off preaching immediately before the sacraments, to those that are not
converted, has no place / considering that S. Paul preached to those in the
administration off Act. 20. 7
the supper / which were already converted.

Where I confess that nether the Adm. nor I hold for a Diuis. 6. 566.
thing simply necessary / that the word be preached immediately before the
Sacraments: he says that there is then no cause to contend, yt being agreed
off the conuenience. If it be very convenient that preaching be immediately
before the Sacraments: then the coustome off reading only / is not
sufficient: which is that he found fault with in the Adm. for at the least a
great conuenience is wanting to that sufficiency. And seeing the scripture
commends things convenient / as it forbids the contrary: the order of
preaching immediately before the Sacraments / even in this respect / owght
(onles yt be rare / and upon great causes) to be observed. Where I say the
life off the sacraments depends upon the the word preached: the D. says
yt is a foul error. no marvel according to his black divinity. But how
comes it so foul? because the life off the Sacraments depends upon the
promises in the word. I grant / and nether upon preaching, nor reading. that
is utterly false. for when baptism belongs not unto infantes / but in that
their ancesters in the conuenant / and those no otherwise in conuenant / then
by faith which comes are preaching: yt follows / Romans 4. 12. and 10. 14.
that the parents having no Fruict off the covenant but by preaching by / can
much les have profit off the Sacrament without it I grant their infantes
salvation / depends upon the election off God: yet that they may be partakers
off baptism / depends on that the promise preached was received (at least in
the churches judgment) off those off whom they are descended. Thus the
doctrine foul in the D. judgment / is beautiful in the scriptures.

Let us now se whether yt be so discourteously handled off others as off the D.
Calvin showing that the Sacrament Instit. lib. 4. c. 14. 4.
stands of the word / and element / says we must understand the word,
notvvispered, vvithovvt understanding, and faith, with a noise only, as if yt
had power like an enchantement, to consecrate the Element: but which being
preached Har. in 3. ^arg.
causes us to understand, what the visible sign means. Likewise upon
these words (Preaching the baptism of repentance) the word sacrament does
not signifye a vain Ceremony, which stands of shows vvithovvt doctrine,
but the word off God is alvvaies annexed: which gives life unto the outvvard
Ceremony. I understand the word not mumbled between the teeth, but
pronounced with a clear voice, fit to edify the faith* for yt is not said
simply that John baptized to repentance, as though the grace of God were shut
up in the visible sign: but that he preached the virtue of baptism, that the
figne might have effect, by the word he preached. Here is not only the same
judgment / but almost the same words: that the life of the sacrament depends
upon the word / and that preached. In his dispute after / as though I had said
that the sacraments are dead / unless the word be preached im^ediatly before /
he declares that be is given to speak all untruth / be yt never so apparent.
For it is directly against that I set down / in the same place / he rayseth
this false accusation: where I confessing that there is no precise necessity
off preaching immediately before the sacraments / affirm notwitstanding / that
preaching owght to Diuis 7. page 567.
go before them.

In that he brings out off Zuing. against the Anabaptists / the first place
is altogether against him. For although the disciples baptized withowt
teaching: yet it being said there that our Savior Christ tavvght, yt is
evident that preaching went before the sacrament. The other place is to fill up
room. For we say not that young infantes must be tawght before they be
baptized: but that doctrine must go before the sacraments in the church of
God / as the publishing off the grant before the seal. Where he would
conclude that I understood the necessity off preaching before the Page 568.
administration, not in respect off the rest off the church present, but off
the infantes, for that the life off the sacrament pertains not unto others
then those which be pareakers: Who has so blinded him that he understands
not / that baptism received off the standers by in their infancy / takes
effect daily by preaching after they be off age: and that withowt preaching in
those which be off discretion / yt remains unfruitful / and serving only
to condemnation. Yea even the baptism off the infantes / not only pertains
unto the parents for whose comfort yt is also ministered: but depends as I
have showed off this / that they off whom they come / have through preaching
off the word before that baptism / given their names unto Christ. Thus having
obtained that yt is very convenient / that there should be preaching immediately
before the administration off Sacraments: I return back with one band more /
to hold the Pastor from rouing beyond the tether off his church. Other things
impertinent unto this place shall be answered in their places.

His triumphs upon that I confess / that the Pastor may Diuis. 14. and 15.

for some business with leave off his church, with an able deputy be absent:
notwithstanding he would so feign mount them on high by his questions / are
beggarly / and do scarce crepe upon the ground. For where he asks first /
whether he may not as well be away for public affairs, as for private: he may
if they be of that sort / which agree with his vocation. But what then? will he
conclude of an ynch an ell / off a week a month / off a month half a year:
and off a case off necessity / make an ordinary license? when S. Paul will
have him which enters into this warfare off ministry / to unwrap him self off

yt: being already entered / he will much less suffer that he should either feek
new occasions off absence / or take all that are offered. Our Savior Christ

those off their house: declared sufficiently that they owght to be very urgent
cawses / which should draw the mynister off the word / from the charge
committed unto him. And when his love toward God / must be moten by feeding
off his flock committed unto his charge: his long / and often voluntary
absence / must John 21.
needs prove a small love in him toward the Lord. Which reason being
alleged / is altogether unanswered. This rare absence / and that upon urgent
cawse / may appear a so by the practice of the church. The Council off Men's /
decreing that the Bishop upon sickness or some other urgent cause off absence
not able 2. Tom. Call. 25.
to preach, should have some every sunday, and other festdayes to preach in his
steed: declares that the use off the church / did nether suffer the bishop to
be away but upon great cawse: and that not so much as one holy day / withowt a
preaching minister to supply his place. Augustine says / that he was not
absent from the church of Hippo, but compelled by sickness. Zuinglius putting
Epist. 138

office off a Pastor, is alvvaies in the power of Ecclesias.
the church over which he is set, and never goes from it. Upon which both
testimonies off the scripture / and practice off the church yt appears / how
to have a deputy owght not to be (as the D. would have it) an accoustomed
thing: but rare / and upon urgent causes.

Where before he alleges for proof off a deputy / that there Page 221.
is no shepherd which has not a boy, or a man to supply his absence: he owght
to understand / that our Savior Christ is that master shephherd / and
therefore he being but a servant / can no more set ones his charge / then one
servant discharge him self upon an other. Beside / what sheepmaister is there
of so small housbandry / which will be content that his stipend should be
mangled / and a portion given unto an hyreling / for a monthly / or quarterly
oversight off his flock / suffer the shepherd to enjoy the rest? yt may well
be for the poursprofit off the shepherd: but it can not be but to the great
scare off the sheep. considering that not only the hired can not by any
likelihood / have that care over the flock which the proper pastor has: but
also that all this disputacion tends hither / that they may have a reading /
or other in sufficient substitute: which as the shepherdes boy / or rather eurr
/ content with a lock / or two / will leave Master Person the master
shepherd / the rest off the fleese. For such is their fidelity / that where as
in times past the preistes are commanded to bear the arck upon Nom. 7. ^
their own shoulders / so they should feed their flocks them selves: they are
not only content to shift yt from their own shoulders / but as the foolish /
and idle preistes in committing yt to 2. Sam. ^. 6.
such vnstilfull governors / they lay yt upon a cart / hale yt with oxen / not
with the adventure / but with certain event of an overthrow. Although herein I
speak too favorably off the greatest nombre off them: which do not bestow so
much cost as a new cart / and a draft off oxen come to. For they have learned
their howsebandry rather off him which teaches / that alvvaies it stands
Plin. l. 18. nature hist

the church of God / were sent home to our popish Philisthins from whence yt
came: the kitchen fire being thereby 1. Sam. 6. 8.
well abbated / this disputation for adeputy / would be well cooled. For an
able man would either for conscience / or honesties sake / keep him self from
this hyrelingship. I say conscience / because amongst other corruptions / he
can not avoid the crime off Simony (as they call yt) whylest to obtain a
place / he is content to part stakes with the Pastor. Honesty / whylest all not
seruill minded / will rather choose to be free / then under the yoke off an
other 1. Cor. 7. 24.
man's service.

His second question / whether the flock be not in like danger in the Pastors
absence with leave, as withowt: is altogether from the purpose / when it is no
lawful for him nether with leave / nor without leave / to be away with danger
off his flock. His third / where I find in scripture that the Pastor owght to
have leave off his parish: is answered in that I showed that the Pastors are
belonging to their churches / and are their servants: which he altogether
passes by. His last asks how he ca^ in his absence have an able deputy,
seeing he may not be admitted to the ministry, which has not a certain
flock. As though in such necessity for so small a time / the supply may not
be made by the Pastors hard by: which is also answer to that he obiecteth page
249.

Unto the next diuis. I answer not. Upon that many parishes Chap. 2. Diuis. 2.
page 247. of Pluralities of Benifices.
may be joined in one, and fix towns in France (as he says) are committed
unto one Pastor, he concludes that one Pastor may have diverse flocks: which
is unworthy any answer. As if a thousand sheep in one pasture / were not
easelier / and with more commodity tended / then three in three sheepgates.
For as towching the preaching off the word / and administering the Sacraments /
unto diverse towns assembled into one body vff a church: the labor is almost
all one in ten / and ten hundred. The residue off the charge being commen with
him unto the rest off the elders / may be (especially in such necessities)
borne out by increasing their number / according to the compass off the churches
territory. Yt is also untrue that he affirms I have said / that the number,
or distance off place is all one. And yt is inconvenient / that either a greater
number be assembled into the body off one particular church / then can be at
once tawght off one mouth / or that the number should be taken out off towns /
farther removed from the places off the churches resort / then that they may
have convenient access. Likewise yt is untrue which he says off six towns to
one Pastor in France. For although one church be assembled out off diverse
towns: yet it falls out that the least part off those towns pertains unto
the church: and those few meet together in one place / to receive the
nourriture provided for them off the Lord / by the hand off their Pastor.

To that alleged / that the Pastor if he will have many flocks, should
content him selff with that stipend off them all, Diuis. 3. 4 5. page 247.
248. etc.
which he has off one, when that one is able to maintain him, and his
family honestly: he answers not. yet was it necessary to be answered /
considering that thereby the peinting of that Zeal / under pretense whereoff
they spread their nets over so many churches / is washed away. Where he
accuses me whotly / other of deceiving, or being deceived, in that the
Council off Nice, is put withowt the addition off Second. whereby yt might be
severed from the purer Council off Nice: I can not precisely say / whether the
leaving out off Second / were my fault / or the fault off some other. but that
I meant to deceive none / there be which can witness: by that that in the second
edition (howsoever yt was omitted) I gave a note whereby that should be
corrected. His reason wherewith he would prove / that I meant to abuse the
reader, for that I set it before Damasus, is to frivolous: considering that
that conterfeict Damasus / mentioned in the first Tome off councels / was not
before this second Council: and yt is not unwonted to put the judgment off a
council before that off a particular person. As for the corruption off the
Council, I have showed how that makes more against the D. pa. 223.
then if the testimony had been fetched from the first Council. And where he
says / the Council meant that one should not have permitted unto him more great
cities then one: yt is a shameless corruption off the mind off the Council.
Considering that the drift theroff is / that one should not have more to live
one / then is needful to maintain him self competently: and therefore is
content as it were to wincke at those / which are placed in poor churches not
able to maintain their Pastor: albeit it inclines rather to this / that he
Propter homin^ inopiam indulgeatur.
should supply that which is wanting / by some honest occupation.

That he adds that Gratian him self does so expound it: all men understand
how vnsauourly yt is spoken. As if it were any marvel that Gratian so
expounded yt / which is known to be an open corrupter off the Councels / and
manifestly in this point off having many benefices / not only in this council
/ but in that off Calcedon. For where the Council decreed that no man might be
ordained in two cities: he does impudently dally with it / saying he may be
notvvithstanding Archbishop of one city, and bishop Can. 2, Clericu^.
of an other: provided that he enjoy the one as entitled to yt, and the other
by way off commendation. Which is but a toy to mock an ape. As if a man should
say / that yt were not lawful to have two wives at ones / but yet he might
have two weomen / one under the title off a wife / an other of a lem^end. This
interpretation off the Council / is yet made worse by the D. for he adds
that a Pastor may not be ordained in more great cities then one: as thoug the
Council would permit one to be over diverse small cities. The proof browght by
the Council / that 1. Cor. 7. 20.
every one ovvght to tarry in that vocation vvherin he is called, is fit. The
reason against yt / that the Apostle speaks off the kind off vocation, and
not off the place, is fond: as thowgh yt were not a man's calling / to do
that he has to do / in one certain place: or as thowgh if the soldier / or
ambassador commanded to serve in one place / serve in an other / he offended
not against this rule off the Apostle. Where fault is found / that I set down
councels in the plural number, alleging but one: he deals very straightly
which will not suffer me to speak as other do. but that there may be councels
/ let him learn that the same was decreed in the council off Toledo. Whereunto
I join Master Hopers judgment / Cause. 10. can. 3. Upon the com^aun. Thou
shall not steal.
which says that no man off what gifts soever may have two liuinges. and
therefore he is not so much a shepherd which has many flocks / as the D. says
/ as a thief: seeing not able to do the office of a Pastor toward them / he
pilleth them.

Towching Damasus / that his purpose was nothing les then to condemn idle
bishops / him self idlest off all: shall be seen in an other place / when yt
shall appear that he had no good meaning in these words. Notwithstanding the
comparison (which likeneth the Pastors that put over their charge, unto harlots
that give their children to other to nourse, that they may sooner give them
selves to lust) being apt / I took as a good stone set in an evil place. In
the next diu. the first part / that it is better page 149.
that one should have diverse flocks / then any be vntawght / is answered: in
that yt is both better that one church be sufficiently fed / then all
insufficiently: and it is alleged before / and after / how the want off
preachers is in part becawse they are not sought after / in part because they
are driven out / which were placed. In the 2. diuis. off this cha. Diuis. 7.
^ag. 250.
The other part is also answered.

All the Answer. witnesses / browght in to prove that Denis the Monkish pope
first divided parishes, and Dioceses, are suspected. Polidore whom he has
chosen to speak in the name off the rest / does (as the D. him self has
done) falsify the words off the Monk. Considering that he says not that he
appointed dioceses / but parishes / and church yardes only / making no
mention off dioceses. Whereupon the Canonistes them selves say / that bounds 80

off bishoprics were divided long before. Both which opinions shall appear
more at large to be false / where I shall show God willing / by what practices
the bishops stretched out their arms so far. Afterward the man in going
about to show mine / proclaims his own ignorance. For where he says there
was no limitation off place in the Apostles time, he is greatly deceyned. For
beside that there is almost in every story before the Apostles / often mention
off provinces / wherinto the gouernementes were divided: Cicero makes mention
off the division off provinces Li. 13 Epist. sam.
into dioceses. The Romans likewise before the Apostles had their Curias / the
same with the greek word whereof our word (parish) is taken. Also towching the
very word parish, by Eusebius. 5. 17.
that Eusebius recites out off Apolonius / a Senator off Rome / who lived
about the year off our Lord 180. of Montanus which could not be received, not
so much as of his own parish whence he was: yt appears that it was both
in use / and in the same signification that we take yt / long before Denis (off
whom the D. would father this division off Parishes) was bishop. So yt is
manifest these divisions were before the Monks time / yea before the Apostles
time.

And where he says / all men may know that limitation off Parishes, and
dioceses could not be made but off men in authority, and theruppon concludes
/ that it could not be made by the Apostles: yt is very true towching the
precise limitacion. but how is he so blinded that he can not also thereby see /
that yt is an idle dream that he so greatly stryueth for / that Denis limited
dioceses, parishes, etc? considering that the Denis he supposes / living about
An. 266. had no authority / but was a poor Bishop under persequnting
Emperors. And if the Emperors had been Christian then / as they were heathen:
yet how comes yt to pass / he does not understand / that in going about to
make men believe / that the Bishop off Rome at that time had authority to
limite dioceses / parishes / etc. in the church off God: he sets up a Pope
/ and armeth him with that authority which he never came unto four hundredth
years after. Finally if this Monk were off any credit / he is directly
against him even in this cawse. For off the words before alleged yt is clear
/ that he appointed unto every elder a several parish: vvherin he should keep
him self: which is against the plurality off benefices / that he so greatly
strives for.

He asks where it appears, that the scripture divided national churches
into congregations, and parishes? I answer that off that the scripture Act. 14.
23 Tit. 15. 1. Cor. 41. 40. Psalm. 122. 3
wills elders to be chosen for every competent congregation / and particular
body off church / and also that these assemblies (as all other things in the
church) should be with the greatest conuenience / so that as Jerusalem had
commendation in having her building knit closely together / even so the church
as much as may be conveniently / should have her parts not only in a
spiritual bond off charity / but in neighborhood of dwellinges well trussed
one with an other: yt is apparent / that although the scriture does not mention
parishes / nor precisely define off the compass / yet yt gives the rule /
whereby they are squared out. For when a parish well bounded / is nothing else
but a number of those families / which dwelling near together may have a
commodious resort: and the assemblies off the churches owght so to be ranged /
as they may be nearest the place off their spiritual refection: yt follows
that the scripture has after a sort / given the churches tarriers / and that
a parish well bounded for the spiritual intercommuning / has testimony out
off the word off God.

Where he asks proof off this / that dioces is taken for a parish: yt
appears first that in the primitive church / bishops in steed Eusebius. 6. li 9.
10 20 21.
that they are now off such a dioces / were then of a parish. afterward when
they began to hook into their possession / more churches then they were able to
feed: they were called bishops off dioceses* yet the name parish was not
quite worn out / but indifferently used for a dioces: as appears by the
council of Ancyran / where one translation having dioces, the other has parish.
Ca 18.
And yt shall better appear in the 8. Tract. that at the first there were
dioceses off so narrow compass: that diverse parishes in England / may appear to
be off greater circuit then they.

That the place off burial mentioned off Eusebius. wat in the field, may as I
said be gathered off the use off the church: which I have noted in an other
place. That the churches of Christ had nether the^ / nor in the time that the
D. imagines / any churchyardes / is manifest: considering that then the
temples (whereunto the churchyardes were annexed) were possessed off idolaters.
The answer to the incommodities off burial in churchiardes / that by that
reason churches, and other things must necessarily be removed: is a begging
off that in question / and otherwise insufficient. For yt is in demand wether
it be convenient: and if it had been / yet being not necessary / it owght for
such abuses to be taken away. And beside the incommodities assigned / it was as
may appear / taken of the Papists / from the superstition off the heathen.
For Lycurgus Plut. in vit. Lycur.
made this law / that men should burye in cities, and round about the temples.
Now residence being necessary / and that principally for preaching off the word
/ it appears how disordered a power yt is off the bishop: off whose license
the pastor both chosen and ordained / must depend / in a thing precisely
commanded to him by the Lord / and for omitting whereof the thunderbolt 1. Tim.
3: 10. 1. Cor. 9. 16. Chap. 3. Tract. 6. page 255.
of Gods course / is from heaven thrown upon him. Therefore the chapter
entitled Off licenses to preach / shall be here in a word or two dispatched.

First the D. charged with false dealing / in that he surmiseth of the Ad. as
if one might preach withowt their approbation to whom yt apperteineth:
answers their meaning is plain. belike he has it by revelation / for in
their words there is not a title sounding thar ways. But he says yt was
their own case, which put from preaching would have preached against the
bishops will. Where leaving that to those that may have knowledge thereof / I
answer that he towcheth not the matter. For both they speak / and my reply was
of those / which ordained to preach the gospel / are sent to their charges not
able to do their duties withowt further license: as if a man charged to do a
thing / should be bound hand and foot of him that charged him / and laid at
his mercy whether he will lose him. Whereunto he answeretth not a word. Thirdly
he lays to my charge / that I had not answered towching that the Adm. would
have preached against the bishops will: a word wheroff is not found but only
in his latter book. then which what greater dotage can there be? as if there
could be default off answer / whera there was no such thing objected.

In that I said / vvithovvt their approbation to whom yt apperteineth: he
excepteth that there is an equivocation, yt being not set down by whom the
election should be made. Where beside that yt was apparent before by a whole
treatise / what we think in that behalf / and out of place to speak off it
here: his exception is too childish. For to whomsoever thelection does
appertein / this case remains the same. whether it be unlawful to ordein one
to preach the word / and yet to keep it still in his power / whether he shall
do yt or no. Off this sort is that he says / I suppose no man may preach
which has not certain charge, and only in yt. Wheroff although I make not
here one word off mention: yet howsoever yt be taken / this case remains
one. Where I showed that the bishop could not allege for defense / that he
whom he sends prisoner to his church / is either heritik, or schismatic, or
suspected, for that he ovvght not then to have admitted him unto that
ministry: he uses open falsehood. For he says I suppose that hypocrites,
schismatikes etc. may be known forthwith: or suspected may be by and by
removed. Whereas first I have not a word off Hypocrites / and have before
manifestly tawght the contrary off that he here forgeth / that the church can
not proceed against Hypocrites, that is those whose sins are not discovered:
and that God only has reserved their judgment unto him self. Then where I
show / that those which are to be admitted to the ministry / owgt to be free
from suspicion off heresy / or schism: the D. answers as if I had said /
that those which have already been in the ministry / were upon suspicion off
heresy to be desposed. Which what seely Sophistery it is / and whether this
whole diuis. declare the D. spoiled off all both conscience / and judgment: I
leave yt to be considered off all men.

The 5. Tract. and 6. un the O.
Off preaching Mynisters.
Here may be justly renewed the complaint of the prophet / Eze. 44. 8
that the priests did not only them selves not execute their charge /
according to the laws given in that behalf: but gave those also entrance / to
whom the lord had utterly denied it. For yt is not enough for the D. to feed
him selff / and others with the blood off the church / in defense off the
unlawful absence off the Pastor: onles by this maintenance off unpreaching
ministers / as yt were by banner spread / he make a feast theroff unto all the
ravening / and Cormorant fowls in the land. And so as if it were a small thing
/ to bear the condemnation off his own parishes: he stretches out his hand /
to have part in the gilt off others. And although this defense may seem to be
given to these woeful readers: yet if we give a little heed / we shall easily
perceive / that both this puddle / and others which depend upon it / return to
fill if it were possible / the Ocean sea off non residents. For no^ residence
would bring little either to filling off cofres / or bathing off them in the
delights off the world / or to what other thing soever they in their absence
propound: unless there were such hungry knights / as would for a crust of bread
/ supply this absence. Now for removing off these sweepinges out off the church
ministry / we must come back to a diuis. towching this matter.

Where yt is said that the people need not pine away for lack off food,
seeing they have one to read, etc: yt is but a begging off that page 153.
in question. for is this the diet which God has appointed to his children /
or portion he has commanded his faithful servants to give unto his family
in due season / or that delicate table / and Math. 24. 45. Math. 13: 52.
cup that runs over? are these the householders which before they set up / or
take the charge off housekeping / have filled all the ir garners / furnished
all their cellars / frawght all their threasuries with all store new and oulde
/ fit to enterteine the sons / and dawghters off the great king off
heaven? we is unto that hows hold that has such a steward / and woe shall be
unto that steward that upon such provision / undertakes the stewardshippe
off the house off God. But woe and woe again shall be to him / that not only
him self famisheth the how should which he has / but teaches others to do
so: and not only does evil / but justifies the evil doer. A. great part
off the D. alowance here / comes to be examined after: as that bare reading is
not able without Gods extraordinary work / to deliver one soul / and that
homilies are not serviceable in this solemn bancket.

Now to run throwgh the rest / I answer prayers, and Sacraments forasmuch
as they take effect by the preachinge off the word / where that is not /
those do not only not feed / but are ordinarily to further condemnation.
That which the Curates can give before they have learned their Cathechisme (of
wiche time is here spoken) is poison and no meat: so that hitherto they may
pyne / for any thing that the Answ. sets before them / in such sort
especially as he settethe yt. All the hope therefore off delyueringe them from
famyn / hangs upon the well disposed preacher, which if he feed another
flock with the hinderance off his own / or having no flock go abowte in
circuit whether so ever he thincketh good: I will not dente but the one and
the other may have a good meaning therein / but whether the lord allow off it
(onles he be able to show the seal off some extraordinary calling) I leave yt
to be considered / of that which has been before disputed. I omit that I know
my self / that within seven miles of Cambridge / there have been parishes
where one off these sermons was not / in four whole years. Which if y^ be so
near Cambridge / where the greatest number off those preachers be: what is to
be thowghte off other places off the Realm?

Onles you count every reproach / and raylinge word an argument / here is no
word to prove, that yt is meet to enjoin mynisters to learn Cathechismes:
that is to say / to prove that they may be ministers off the word / before
they have learned the Christian A. B. C. which children off seeen yaere old in
reformed churches / can answer unto. They are necessary poinctes wh^ he are
tawghte there. So is the A. B. C. to him which will learn to read. they are
the weightieste things in our Religion. Else they could not be the foundations
which uphold the whole buildinge. To have said something you should have
said / they are the hardeste / and difficulteste poinctes off religion, but
that you can not / those being without the circuit off a Cathechisme. I am
content therefore you shall praise the book with what words you will: but
when you have done / look that you leave yt a Catechism / that is to say a
treatise of the first eleme^tes / or A. B. C. off Christianity. And then yt
follows / that yowr enioyninge off yowr mynisters to learn it: does
necessarily presuppose ignorance off those things / the want off knowledge
wheroff in that age / not only owghte to remove them from the college off
mynisters: but leaves them no place till they be better instructed / to sit
amongst the Christians. And if you think this no discredit at all, you have
yowr credit separate from the credit off the church: which is discredited /
dishonored / yea utterly destroyed by such blind eyes. And I may further
say / that he which thinks this no discredit, may be feared to seek
credit in the ignorance off the mynisters: whilst amongeste such a blind
company / his sight may be somewhat / and whilst he may use their
simplicity / to the establishment off that tyranny / which a learned
mynistrie would never bear.

But because the Ans. can say nothing / let us hear what the Heluetian
confession (fully repeted again 253. and yet again 484. mentioned also the
fowrth time) says for them. we condemn all unmeet mynisters, not endued
with gifts necessary for a shepherd, that should feed his flock. What do
I hear? do you condemn all / etc? hearken Master D. here is sentence off
condemnation given off those / which you defend. Was there no easier word to
use but condemninge? if they had only said they approved them not / speakinge
owte off the word off God / as they do yt had been a shrewde blow. But in
saying flatt'y that they condemn them: they have said what they could / for
the utter sweepinge them owte of the church / as long as yt stands. And take
this also with you / that in condemninge them / they condemn the making / and
defense of them Thus our ignorante ministers have once passed the condemnation
off the churches and in this condemnation they lie / and shall lie as long as
the word off God remains / if all men in the world would absolve them. But
let us hear whether they be repriued by the judgment of these churches / or
whether they give any pardon / which gave the condemnation.

There follows that they allow better off the harmeles symplicitie off
some, then off the exquisite learning off others, joined withdraw pride. And
worthily. For nether can pride agree with manners off the minister off God:
and harmles symplicitie may well agree / with a competent learning meet for
that function. In the end they conclude / that they reiecte not the good
symplicitie of certain, so they be not altogether unskillful off God, and his
word. First this can make nothing for excuse off our mynisters. For when
they are to learn their Catechism / and the principles off Christian Religion
/ what knowledge is left unto them off God / and off his word? Then yt is like
/ that by harmles symplicitie they mean some rare / and singular holiness /
whereby they goo as far beyond the other in life / as they come behind them
in learning: which all see to be otherwise in our ignorante ministers /
oftentimes the masters off misrule to all the parish. Otherwise they knew
what Jerome says / Ad Oceanum.
that in that S. Paul requires that a bishop should be wise, he barreth
those which under the name off symplicitie, excuse the folly off mynisters.

Last off all by that skill off God / and off his word / they must needs
understand such gifts / as are necessary for a shepherd to feed his
flock: which is ability to teach / to exhort / to convince the
adversary: and if he have those / although he have not the knowledge off
tounges / and arts / in the name off God let him have the chair. And such I
confess our church has had / and has some / but they are very rare: and
off these I doubt not but the confession means. Nether can they be withowte
manifest injury / thowghte to receive those which they had before condemned.
for shall we say off them that with one mouth / yea with one breathe they
blewe whout / and kolde? wheruppon I conclude / that the condemnation being
here greater then the pardon / and the wound wider then the plaster: you were
very near driven / when you were compelled to use the testimony off these
churches / to cover the nakedness off the ignorante mynisters* your notable
slander off the Adm. I am content shall (as you say) rest in the readers
iudgmente. That I have gathered yowr argument faithfully / towchinge the
learning off Catechismes / is showed before. There follows the 2. diuis. (the
first being a blank) where beside the causes by him assigned pa. 2^2.
of want off able Ministers / be to no purpose / considering that we show
there can be no cause off instituting a reading ministry / and be also out off
place / considering that he should have opposed them / to those which I
alleged in that behalf: that pa. 484.
which only was material / that we be in cause off that fewnes, is only
said.

Where I alleged out off S. Paul / that yt is an express commandment that a
pastor should be able to teach, and Diuis. 3. 253. 1, Tim. 3. 2 Tit. 1. 9.
convince gaynsayers, and therefore to be broken upon no occasion: he answers
that S. Paul shows the qualities off a pastor, but says not that we may not
have reading Pastors, if there be none, or not a sufficient nombre in whom all
those qualities concur. Then which what can be more bluntly said? For this
being a general rule / he owght to have showed where the Lord gives leave to
take vnteaching mynisters / contrary unto the tenor off this commandment:
which he is never able to do. For the scripture commanding the pastors should
be able to teach / and convince does forthwith shutowt all other: it being a
general rule / that it both commands the contrary off that it forbids:
and forbids the contrary off that yt commands. And there is no
commandment in the scripture / which may not be eluded by the D. answer. For
thus yt may be said / that we may have images in churches to teach the
ignorant: for that although the lord forbid them / yet he has not said that
where there are none / or not a sufficient number off able teachers / we may
not have such supplies. Those also which pressed with extreme hunger seek
remedy in stealing / find him their proctor. For the lord has not said in so
many words / that one which is hungerbitten / may not steal as much as will
save his life. But when all commandments be general in the scripture /
albeit they have not always the universal note off All / or None: onles there
be some exception declared / this off the sufficiency off the pastor / being
not only universal / but universally propounded / is better armed against all
these fond cauils. For our savior declaring that every one instructed Mat 13. 52
as a scribe unto the kingdom off God / owght to be provided aforehand with
store off doctrine / and judgment to apply yt according to the present
occasion: does give manifestly to understand / that no one may be received into
the order off pastors / which is not able to teach his flock.

And the D. may as well say / that in default of sober / chaste / and quiet
pastors / they may choose dronckards / whoremongers / swashbucklers: as that in
default off a teaching pastor / they may take vnteaching. Yea rather may he say
the one then the other / considering that sobriety / chastity / and quietness
are commen with him to all Christians: but ability to teach / and confute are
his proper duties. Therefore although these be both intolerable / yet the church
receives les harm / by pastors which infected with (...) do teach: then by
them which free from these / are utterly unable to teach. For the good life off
the pastor withowt doctrine / whereby they may be both tawght to put their trust
in god / and see the good works they should follow / is as a fair coulor
withowt light to show yt by / utterly unprofitable: where the word truly
preached / shines oftentimes clearer in the hearts / then the cloud of the
pastors disordered life / ca^ stay the fruict of. And albeit all
commandments off God / are such as may not for any cause be broken: yet this
S. Paul gives off the Pastor / has a special fense cast about yt / whereby it
might be kept in greater safety. For the spirit of God / foreseing this
shameful profanation off the ministry / together with the present danger
unto the church / uses a preface to this description of the pastors office /
used rarely / and but in matters of greatest stablenes / saying yt is a certain
doctrine. As if he should say / that which follows is an unvariable / 1. Tim.
3. 1
and unchangeable rule / which can by no authority of men / for any cause not
only be broken / but not so much as bowed / or once vvrinched a side.

His reason that Paul was glad those preached, which swarued from Diuis 2. page
44.
that rule, beside that I have showed it ridiculous: is here out of place /
considering that these readers which would have re^t his heart in pieces / being
ordained with breach off the rule off God could not cheer him up again by
preaching: whereunto they are as fit as an ox to fly. Witness the D. him self
/ which adds that our ignorant ministers may by study so profit in knowledge,
that they may be able privately to exhort Where yt is merueilons to see how he
fometh out their shame / whom he has taken to his defense. If he had said /
that in time with study they might be able to preach: yet forsomuche as while
that grass grows / the people perish / his answer had been intolerable. Now
gyuing no further hope / then that in time they will be able privately to
admonish / Romans 15. 14. Heb. 3. 13.
which every Christian owght to do: he has given sentence off them / that
they will never be able to do the work off Pastors / wheroff they bear the
name: that is that they will never be but idols. What they do by reading is
after to be seen. The place of Osea which resecteth from the ministry / those
that have not kn^^^^^ge Cap. 4. verse. 6.
off the law / becawse it failed a little in the quotation / he has let
quietly go by.

Where he gives me the lie, for that I ascribe unto him this argument / there
must be reading in the church, therefore ministers that can do nothing but
read: his words be these. I see not how you can condemn reading ministers,
seeing reading is necessary in the church. let the reader judge what a hard
forehead he has. Where I concluded theruppon / that every one which could
break bread, distribute the cup, etc. should be a meet minister: all see that
it follows upon the former reason. And this which the D. counts a jest, he
is not able to answer in his greatest earnest. His answer to the place off S.
James is frivolous. For Diuis. 4. page 260. Iam 5. 14. Lu. 9 c 2. Page 133.
his reason why the place off ^. Luke commanding the 12. disciples to preach /
can not be applied unto our Ministers, is for that other things joined with yt
were temporal. And this is his reason before / that the example off the
Apostels elections is to be followed wholly, or not at all. Therefore the place
off S. James / did fully confute his answer: considering that the anointing of
the sick coupled with prayer / by the elders off the church / being temporal:
the other notwithstanding is perpetual. And this shift that that place was
spoken off all ministers, and the other off S Luke off the 12. only, will not
cover his shame. For what will he say unto the rules given as the same time /
that they should be simple in their ministry as doves, wise as serpents,
Math. 10. 16. 17.
take heed off men? are they not spoken to the ministers now / becawse they
were spoken then to the 12. only? What unto that our Savior Christ commanded
to go into all the world / Math 28. ^^.
teaching / and baptizing in the name off the Father / Son / and Holy Ghost?
which place shakes him out of both his rags: for that was spoken to the
eleven Apostels only / and the commandment off going into all the world /
was temporal. Yet I think he dare not deny / but the commandment off
baptizing in the name off Father / Son / and holy Ghost / is perpetual / and
belonging unto all Pastors. Wheruppon follows that the place off S. Luke
stands still / to whip out unpreaching Pastors. In the page 483. this is
handled again. Diuis. 15.


Where I allege that they be unchangeable laws (...) God, that he should not
be minister off the church which can not teach, nor Minister Sacraments
which can not preach: the D. leaving the first which was the very cause /
shppeth to the second / which is handled in an other Tract. as that wherein his
provision was better. Howbeit because I would not the D. cause should leese her
advantage by his oversight: I confess that Chrysostomes testimony / may seem
to perteine to the cause in hand / forasmuch as he makes a kind off
preisthood not able to teach. To whom (with this exception that I will not be
pressed with his authority / further then he brings reason off the word off
God) I answer that as the word preisthood / is often times in ecclesiastical
writers taken for the pastor / and chief minister off the church / off which
our present question is: so sometime yt is taken for the elders / joined as
helpers in government unto the pastor / and which had not (as shall appear)
to do doythe the preaching off the word / and administration off the
Sacraments. As when yt is said / that the Bishop chosen by Gods ordinance,
and the Elders joined with him in the priestly honor. Cypr. l. 3. Epist. 1.
According unto which sense / Chrysostomes saying makes nothing to this
question. For we deny not / but that he may be an elder / and consequently (as
they term him) a priest assistant to the pastor / which is not able to preach:
but that he may be the pastor / we utterly deny. So remains only against us
in Chrysostom. testimony / that he may baptize that can not preach: which with
the rest perteining to that head / shall (god willing) be in their proper place
answered. As for the 5. 1. Tim. towching the Elders which rule well / in the
treatise off the Presbytery yt shall appear, that it is not understood off
these caterpillars. where he requires warrant off the word of God, for that I
confess the church may appoint for a reader only some grave man, he
confessing yt lawful as well as I: for answer to his request / I refer him to
that disputation where 2. Tracte. according to the D. Diuis. 16. page 484.
I have proved / that it is not lawful to place any thing in the church / not
justified by the word.

That the cavvse off this fevvnes off able ministers, is partly the thrusting
ovvt off those which are fyt to teach, partly that others fyt are not sought
after: it is manifest. Whether they owght to be sought after / and not to offer
them selves: I leave to be esteemed off that which is written in this point / in
the book entitled off the discipline, etc. Whether they be off right thrust
out, I leave to be judged off the discourse off these controversies: whether
they which are not yet entered / have just cawse to forbear / I leave to be
considered off the disputation before / and off that of the Archbishop /
Archedeacons / Commissaries / etc. which follows. For if it fall out that the
calling be unlawful / whereby the entrance should be made / and the authority
of the church tirantes such / that being entered / one can not walk in the way
off his ministry prescribed off the lord: then it must follow / that although
those that are entered / having testimony off their conscience that they serve
the lord / and keeping themselves from the pollutions / may poursue their
course: yet these can not withowt shipwreck off conscience (I speak off
ordinary callinges) even in the very port / or ever they launche forth / commit
them selves to this viage.

Where he says there want no prouokinges to draw them to the mynistery: even
that is an other cawse off this scarcety. for the churchliuinges so unequally
divided / that some few being drunken / the most hunger: discourage from
that study. For the parent which follows the sent off honor / and gain in
Archbishoprickes / bishoprics / and other such poisons off the ministry: is
oftentimes beaten back by despair / that they shall not atteine to that gain
/ which desired as they think off many / can be obtained but off few. He that
is willing his son should serve in the estate off a Minister / and looks
with a more single eye / to the continuence off true religion unto his
posterity: yet when he considers how few liuinges there be (those excepted
wherewith he will not have his son desiled) able to maintain the pastor with
his competent howsehold / honestly / he applies him to an other trade of life.
Wheroff although occasion be given by horrible vnthankefullnes off men / which
in steed off gyuing some thing into the treasury off the church / have by
their pillage browght her almost to starck beggary: yet that parent should
consider / that the lord will never leave / nor forsake his / and that Heb. 13.
5. Agg. 2. 9.
gould and silver is the Lords. Which seeing he fournished to those / that in
symplicity sought the building off his house / out off the cofres off heathen
Princes: he will much les suffer them to want necessaries under godly / and
Christian. But this place is plentifully handled in the foresaid book off
disc^p^^ne. I only (because the question was here off the cause off w^nting
sufficient pastors) towched yt.

Here the D. light estimation off the churches salvation / Diuis. 17. Page 484.
and off preaching is notably discovered. before he said / that these reading
pastors were taken for necessity: now he teaches / that ^f there were
sufficient pastors to supply the roumes / yet the readers should keep their
places still If ye ask why: lest forsooth they with their families should go
a begging. Here a whole church is sold for 30 pieces off silver / or rather
as I may say / for old shoes. For the D. weighing in his skiles / whether yt
is better that the church should want a preaching pastor / whom God has
ordained the principal instrument to save his church by / or that the reader
with his family should go a begging: has found the sowlehealth off a whole
church / far lighter then the bodily commodity of one reader with his family.
Where he says / yt seems that I would have the minister renant at will / or
by courtesy: it is an untrue surmise. For I complain that these reading
Ministers / were not only placed until other might be gotten: but had a free
hold / whereby the sheep are not only committed to the woulf / but the door
sparred also upon them.

Where he asks for the place, in which Augustine calls them woulues that
teach not: if he have not the word vvoulf, yet he speaks Lib. de Past.
to that effect / when upon the place off Ezechiel I have given the a
watchman, etc. he proves that he which holds his peace / murthereth. Which
also even the Pope himself / as long as there was but a sparcke of true
knowledge / confesses. If the D. Greg. Epist. 1. 33.
say / that his me^ hold not their peace, because they read: it is a cavil
unworthy answer. As though when the Prophet calls the rascal ministers off
his time / domme dogs, and such as could not Esaias. 56. 10.
not barcke, his meaning were to charge them that they could not spell / or
read in a book off their own language laid before them. And so I trust
appears / that this tail off reading ministers owght to be cut of: and that
they are none off these princely gifts / which our Savior Christ ascended
into heaven / sends 4. Ephesians. 11
unto his church / but the bishops (to speak no grievous lier off them) more
then beggarly presents. But we are not yet at an end. For that which the D.
can not get / in comparing a preaching pastor with a keading: he thincketh to
obtein in comparing reading with preaching / whereunto perremeth his 13 Tract.

First he mainteineth his untrue accusation off the Adm. to Diuis. 1. page 568.
wching their condemning off reading off scriptures. Which in comparing the
words alleged by the D. with those of the Ad. in old time the word was
preached, now it is supposed sufficient if it be redd: I commit unto the
readers judgment. And if his dishonest realing were not evident there / because
off an other sentence off the Adm. subject unto reprehension: yet he lays yt
open in the same behavior to wards me. For althowgh I have not a word against
reading / and diverse commendations of yt: yet page 717.
he fears not with full throat to accuse me / as a despiser off reading off
the scriptures, as companion off the Papists ungodliness in that behalff. Which
although he do often / yet further then his reasons give occasion: he shall
never gain off me / that I will vouchesafe him a word off answer / to all this
owtcries. After upon that I say / if I may call him mynister that can do
nothing but read (which is as indifferent to give him the name off a mynister
/ as to take it from him / being left between both) the D. according to his
old equity / concludes that I signify and that plainly, how I esteem them
for no ministers. Which he likewise gathers / for that I say as they call
them. Wherein I will not deny but there may be occasion given / to him
especially that hunteth after yt / off that surmise. But my meaning was / to
note how unworthy they are / as off the office / so off the name off a Minister
off the gospel: not to make void their mynistery such as it is / in
administration off the Sacraments. which I confess as in the Popish Preistes
baptism / for that they be the public officers appointed thereunto / althowgh
unduly ministered / to be the holy Sacraments off Christ. And that this was my
meaning might easily have been gathered / in that I allowing off the
administration of Sacraments by Heretics / so much worse then they / as as
it is to teach falsely then not to teach at all: could by no equal
interpretation / be judged to condemn the Sacraments ministered by them.

Where I say that albeit the D. cavvse in this point be Diuis. 2. Page 969.
good, that the reading off the scriptures is profitable: yet as one be
pitched, he defiles yt in evil handling: he answers as though I confessed /
that I misliked the matter well handled, only for that yt was done by him:
which is a shameless untruth. Bucers sentence Diuis. 3. page 569.
(reading is a kind off preaching) I think will not be found: and I dowbt
not but the D. would have brought yt / if there had been any. So he is
destitute off his good authority, and withal remains the absurdity / before
assigned. The sentence set down out off Bucer is altogether idle: seeing the
profit off reading the scriptures / both publickely / and privately is
confessed. Where to prove that reading is not so effectual as preaching, I
allege S. Paul / that one can not believe vvithovvt a preacher: he answers
Romans 10. 14.
that by preaching there is meant all kind off publishing the gospel by
owtward voice. but off reason off this exposition / either out off scripture /
or any other / more then his own I say, he brings not a lettre. For that he
adds / off taking away by this means from the majesty off the scriptures,
and making them d^^^e, etc. (amplified in the next diuis. by asking why the
scriptures were then written? with other such too too idle questions / which I
am ashamed to defile my pen with) is unworthy the name of a reason. As if in
that reading makes me^ fitter to hear the word preached / and to seek after
yt / in that yt helps to nourish faith engrended / in that it confirms a
man in the doctrine preached / when by reading he perceives yt to be as the
preacher tawght / in that it renueth the memory off that was preached / which
otherwise would decay: I say as if in these respects / and such like / the
profit off reading / and committing the word to writing / were not singular /
and inestimable, beside that it is not denied / but the Lord may
extraordinarily give faith by reading only: although the order which God has
put / is to save by folishenes (as it is esteemed) off preaching. 1. Cor. 1. 21.
beside also that yt is absurd / that the D. asks why else the gospel should
be writter? as if there were no other cause of writing off it / then that it
should be simply redd: or as though the principal cawse was not * that yt
should be preached.

But to return to the D. exposition: First it overthrows the argument off
the Apostle. For the Jews offended that he / and other preached to the
Ge^tils: proving first that the invocation off the name of God pertains unto
them / he concludes thereupon / that preaching unto them was lawful:
considering that they could not otherwise come to call upon the name off God,
where by the D. exposition / the Jews might have excepted / that his mynistery
toward them was not thereby justified: forasmuch as they might come to
invocation by reading only / withowt his / and others ministry off preaching.
Furthermore / the Apostle S. Paul affirming in plain words / that the
preaching he speaks Romans 10. 15.
off / can not be made but by him which is sent: yt is first manifest / that
reading privately is clean shut out / from being contained under this
preaching. For faith coming only by that preaching / and that preaching only
lawful by the sending of God / and public calling: it follows / that
except he will say / that the scripture may not be redd privately / onles a man
be publicly called thereunto / that both private reading of the scripture / can
no be contained under the Apostles word of preaching / and that faith (onles by
extraordinary work of God) can not be engendered by private reading. Forasmuch
as it is engendered only by that preaching / under which private reading is not
contained. And so goes to the ground one piece off the D. assertion.

Now if private reading only / can not ordinarily engender faith: I would know
how public reading only / can do yt. Beside that / when public reading may
be by a simple reader / which has no other charge in the church / and off whom
this solemn fending can not be understood: yt follows / that faith can not
by public reading only be engendered. Forasmuch as he being none off those
sent his reading can not be that preaching / by which faith is engendered. I say
that a reader only can not be off those sent the Apostle speaks off / not
only because he has regard unto the ministeries off the word / appointed by
God: but also for that the place off Esaie / out off which he proves that
faith comes not but by preaching / will by no means suffer to carry the word
preacher unto a simple reader. For beside that it were frivolous / to refer the
lifting up off the voice off those preachers Esa. 52 8.
whereunto the Prophet exhorts / unto a loud reading / which is understood
of earnestnes / and diligence in preaching: that voice he speaks off / is the
voice off the churches watchmen* which title when yt can not agree unto a
simple reader / that has no further charge then to read in a book /
according to the prescript off others: yt is manifest / that a simple reader
can not be contained under S. Paul's preacher / seeing he can not be contained
under Esaies / which is the same with S. Paul's. For when the title off
watchman, draws a continual care / and circumspection over those he
watches: and the reader for any thing his office requires / may occupy him
self in any worldly business / saving only the time off his reading: yt is
clear that he is no church watchman.

Nay the reading mynisters / which have charge off sowles committed unto them /
can be none off this order of watcheman: seeing they can not only not see the
ennemy a far of / but not hard by / much les discry him: yt perteining to an
instructed pastor / which according to the circumstance off the invasion /
knows to apply his watch word. Now seeing simple reading / nether private /
nor public can be contained under the preaching S. Paul speaks off Romans 10.
(which is an interpretation / and laying open the scriptures by a public
mynister / apt / and autorised thereunto): yt follows / that faith which the
Apostle teaches no otherwise to come / but by that preaching / comes not
ordinarily by simple reading. I omit here / that the Apostle uses to express
(...).
this preaching / both by crying and telling good nevves: wheroff when yt can
not be showed out off scripture / or (as I am persuaded) out of any other author
/ that either of them / much les both together / is used for simple reading: yt
follows that simple reading can not be understood / by the word preaching.

To prove that bare reading ingendreth faith / he cites Diuis. 4. 570.
John 5. repeted page 574. 2. Timo. 3.. whereto perteine Math. 7. Act. 17. 1.
John 4. Gal. 1. disorderly placed page 717. but to no purpose. For when our
Savior bids the Jews search the scriptures: he refers them by that
search / to judge off the doctrine he had preached before: which proves no
fruict off reading / when there is no preaching. beside that / it will be hard
for him to refer the word search / to reading only: as if one could not search
the scriptures / when he attends to them alleged in sermons. yea he is
confuted / by the place him self has alleged: Where he would prove that the
scripture red / in respect off making the hearers more apt to discern off
preaching / is better then preached. for when the Apostle teaches the
Galatians to hold them accursed / which preach other doctrine then they had
received by his preaching: he does flatly make his preaching / 1. Gal. 8. 9.
the rule to examine other preachings by. The place off Tim. being (as I have
showed) off the proper duties off the minister off the word in preaching /
making no manner off mention off reading / is alleged withowt all judgment.
Hither refer Bucers Testimony in his former division / which makes for that
set down in this. For Bucer setting him self to commend reading in the church
/ says twice / bare, or only reading, confirms in the knowledge off the
Doctrine: which necessarily presupposes a knowledge foreplaced / or ever yt
can be confirmed by reading only. Where as if he might / it is to be thowght
he would have said that it ingendreth knowledge off the doctrine off salvation.

Where I alleged that the consideration off the creatures may nourish faith,
not able yet to breed yt: he answers / then let us have images that they may
be lay me^nes books. Which beside the common fault off being nothing worth /
is a wicked / and popish answer. For if I had made the consideration of the
creatures equal unto reading off the scriptures in that teinement off
salvation / as I compared them only in that both nourishing faith / nether
could ordinarily breed yt: had yt been lawful therefore for him to match
instruction by images / with that which comes by beholding the creatures? is
there either the same / or like proportion between the school of Imagery / and
of the creation of the world? are these books of the same print? the one
coming from the lords press / the other out off the devils printing house:
the one giving a good report off the Lord / and Psa. 191.
setting out his glory / the other 1. To. 23
dishonoring him: the one 1. To. 18
teaching the truth / the other being Iere. 10. 14 Abac. 2. 18.
Doctors of lies / and vanity: finally the one being Job. 12. 6. 7. 8. Mat. 6.
26
commanded / the other Io. 1. 5. 21
forbidden? But thus must the judgment off God be fulfilled / against the
ennemies off his truth: in closing up their eyes / which seeing will not
perceive. The like blindness yt is / that he accounts an image a visable
creature, making thereby a carpentour / a creator. In granting that preaching
is the most ordinary mean to work salvation by / his opinion shakes: a
token that yt will fall flat in the end. For if it be the most ordinary / and
the most ordinary ordinarily most effectual: then it is untrue he says /
that the word simply redd, is as effectual as preached.

Where upon lifting up off our Savior (as Moses lift up the serpent
(following Caluins interpretation / which expounds Diuis. 5* page 571. Ioh. 3
14.
yt off the preaching off the gospel) I showed that the word preached being
lifted up higher then when yt is redd / is easelier seen of the eye of faith:
this trifler frames first my reason of the ^^. ver. wheroff I make not a
lettre mention. Secondly brings an other interpretation off the place I
allege: but answers not Caluins reasons / who co^futeth it. Thirdly / he
says that although the interpretation be granted / which I followed: yet the
cause is not proved thereby / for that Christ is lifted up by simple readi^ng*
which is no sufficient answer / onles he had added / that it is lifted up as
high. For when I affirm the word set in a low place / I mean not that all
reading symply / and in it self considered / is on the ground: but in
comparison off that when it is expounded by preaching. And if preaching do
make yt better understood / and easelier seen then when yt is redd only
(which Diuis. ^. Page 172.
at unawares he manifestly confesses: then yt is true which I have set down /
that preaching in respect off reading, does as yt were set the word in a more
sightly, and therefore higher place. As for Caluins interpretation which I
followed / becawse yt is dowbtfull / and the conference off an other place
seems rather to confirm Augustines / who refers yt to the cross off John
12. 32.
our Sau. Christ: to spar out the D. from his out courses / let him follow that
he brings / I will not strive, especially seeing the same sense off lifting up
our Savior by preaching / appears otherwise: where by yt he is said / to be
crucified before our eyes. Gal. 3. 1.


Unto that I allege off the savor off the word, sweeter, and more
nourishable when it is braied, and cut, then when Diuis 6. page 572.
yt is by reading given as yt were whole, and in gross: towching the first /
he asks whether the word redd is not a sweet savor, in steed that he should
have said / as sweet / which he durst not. In the second / whether there be no
discretion required in reading? yes / but 2. Cor. 2. 16. 2. Tim. 2. 15.
more in preaching. Although thus he towcheth not the matter. for unto the
point of breaking / and cutting off the scripture / done by preaching which
applies the general doctrine to the particular circumstance / wherein it is
like unto aromatique spices / sweeter broken then whole / and unto wholesome
meat / apter to nourish when yt is chewed / or cut / then when yt is not: he
answers nothing. For as things aromatiquall / and meats both broken / and
whole / have the same savor / and virtue off nourishing in regard off them
selves / yet in regard off us are sweeter / and more nourishable broken etc: so
the word off God / off the same virtue in yt self both redd / and preached / is
unto us more profitable preached / then redd. whereunto pertains that Saint
Luke calls the interpretation off the scriptures / an opening of them: which
in the second edition / because yt was leo figurative then the comparison off
aromatique things (that being a metonimy off the preacher for preaching) I put
in the place theroff. for if interpretation off the scriptures be the opening
off them / as Saint Luke declares calling yt opening in one verse / which 24.
27. 32.
he called interpreting in an other: yt follows that the word redd / in
respect off being preached / is as it were shut / and clasped. for this cawse
are the ministers off the word / said to have Math. 16. 19.
the keys off the kingdom off heaven: for that withowt their ministry off
preaching / the kingdom off heaven is as yt were locked.

Where he asks whether I think the praise of preaching, the dispraise of
reading: all understand that it is easter to strike water out off a flint /
then to find honest dealing in this man. For is this to dispraise reading / to
prefer preaching before yt? In commending preaching before praying / and
private meditation of scripture more then private reading / and practicing more
then both: do I dispraise private reading / or meditation? and yet the word
off God is the same redd / meditated / and practiced. But this is a Popish
practice: which upon that we prefer faith to good worckes / concludes that we
make no account off good worckes.

Where upon that preaching is called both planting / and watering Diuis. 7. pa
722. 1. Cor 3. 6
yt is showed that as the hovvsbandman receives not fruict, onles both be
done, so no salvation to be looked for, where is no preaching: he answers
that there is showed how the word off God is not effectual, onles God give
increase: which is to no purpose. For he not only shows that / but that God
gives his increase through their preaching: and that they be the howsbandes by
whose preaching the Lord makes his orcheyard. He answers further / that in
this place there is no comparison between reading and preaching: but
considers not how the scripture gives this / as also those before cited /
unto simple reading / thereby singulary exalting preaching above bare reading.
So that although some off these in some degree / or all extraordinarily may be
done by bare reading: yet by these co^mendations / as it were by a more
precious apparel / is advanced the grace off God / more richly rached unto us
by the hand off preaching / then reading. Last off all he answers / that
tilling, and watering may be applied also unto diligent reading: where not
daring (as it seems) say planting, he has changed it wheroff the question
was for tilling: belike becawse he remembered he had said before / that yt is
proper unto the Apostles to plant. Where again his cawse receives an other
wound. For if planting be by preaching / and not by reading: then in this
respect / preaching is more effectual then bare reading. Then that he says
killing / and watering may be applied to reading: he should to maintain his
cause have said / as well / or as much.

To that off the people perishing vvithovvt prophecy, Pou. 29. 18.
which is not bare reading, but expounding, and applying off scriptures: he
answers that the people must needs decay in holiness, and knowledge where
there be no preachers. but why does he say decay, and not perish as Solomon
speaks? where his cause falls flat to the ground. For if the people perish
/ where be no preachers / althowgh there be readers / and contrariwise
preaching withowt bare reading / saves / engenders faith / and nourishes yt:
yt is manifest that the word redd is not so effectual as preached / and that
by bare reading ordinarily / there is no salvation / and therefore also no faith
/ both which he before denied. And if the people perish withowt preaching /
which have already been lightened by it. how much more (except the Lord work
extraordinarily) must they perish / that never had preaching?

Where he says / both preaching, and bare reading be necessary in the church:
if he mean publicly / as yt is true in preaching / so yt is untrue in simple
reading. For although yt be very convenient which is used in some churches /
where before preaching time the church assembled has the scriptures redd / in
such order that the whole Canon theroff is oftentimes in one year run
thorough: yet a nombre of churches which have no such order of simple reading /
can not be in this point charged with breach of Gods commandment: which they
might be / if simple reading were necessary. Considering especially that some
off them beside their set sermons / expounding every day paraphrastically two
chapters / with the principal points theroff taken / and applied unto their
auditors: gain that which the D. out of Bucer / presupposes to come only by
simple reading / that the scripture thereby is made familiar unto the people.
Where he says they be most profitable: the wine off this error so fumeth into
his head / that it has taken away the use off his tongue. for two things to
one and the same end / can not (but very improperly) be said most profitable.
For if preaching be most profitable to work faith by / then is not reading:
if reading / the^ is not preaching. it is true that me^ sometime speak so)
when the question is not of comparison between those things they speak off:
but otherwise / it is altogether strange.

Where he says preaching is more apt for the ignorant, and unlearned, and that
he denies not this: the untruth theroff is apparent. For if preaching be more
profitable to the unlearned then reading / and de at least as profitable to the
learned: then yt is false that he has set down with so great assurance / that
reading is as effectual as preaching: seeing the effect we speak off / is the
profit off the hearers. Yet as a man strawght off his wits strikes him
self: he overthrows this also in an other place. for in asking why Iosia
caused the law to be redd* except it had as great force to page 577.
persuade redd as preached: he signifies the contrary off that here affirmed.
Considering that the greatest part was off the commen people / and that gross:
as those which newly came out off filthy idolatry. Further if preaching were as
meet for the learned / and meeter for the rude: then his reason there / which
imagines that Iosia would not otherwise have caused the law to be redd / onles
there had been as great fruict in reading as preaching / falls flat.
Considering that the D. confesses / that preaching is more effectual to the
people: and I think dare not deny / but it is as effectual to the learned.
Therefore the reason why Josias cawsed the law to be redd / was not becawse
reading was as effectual as preaching: but because being both redd and
preached / yt profits more then when yt is symply redd.

Where he says marry have been called by bare reading: he says yt again and
again / but withowt all proof. For where (altogether out off place / his
purpose being to prove that reading edifieth more then preaching) he faith God
used reading at a means to call Augustine: yt is vain / seeing the question is
/ whether he used that only means, for yt appears that August. had greatly
profited in godliness / before that time wherein he heard the miraculous voice /
which sent him to reading. Beside that / the voice he tells off going before
his reading / will not suffer that that reading only / may challenge the whole
means off conversion. Likewise that he affirms out M. For / off many browght
to light page 576.
off the gospel by reading only: he makes not / nor (as I am persuaded)
could make yt appear. Although yt be confessed / that that may be done by the
Lords extraordinary worcking / which feeds sometime with quarles in the
wilderness. Yet yt is hard to show any time / wherein there have been
professors off the gospel / and God has not raised up some ministers / which
have either openly / or secretly as the time required / preached the word:
considering that even in those desolations of the church / the Lord Apoc. 11. 3.
by his two vvitnesses promises / that the church shall not be destitute off
true ministers.

Where confessing the word preached and red all one, I Diuis. 8. Page 573.
show notwithstanding that as the fire stirred gives more heat, so the word
as yt were blovven by preaching, flameth more in the hearers, then when it is
redd: he answers that this is to ione with the Papists in condemning the
scriptures of obscurity. but reason he can show none: and it is all one / as if
one should be charged to have said that the Son is darck / for that he
affirms yt lighter at noone days then at the Son rising. Then he must
understand / that we place not this difference of lightsomnes in the word /
which is always in it self most lightsom / red and preached: but partly in
the ordinance off God before noted / making that the special means / partly
in the darcknes of our understanding / which withowt the aid off preaching can
not come to sufficient knowledge off yt. Lastely he must learn / that
althowghe all things necessary to salvation / might by reading only be
understood: yet yt follows not / that a man may by reading only be saved.
For yt is one thing to have the scripture in his head / another to have it in
his heart: one thing to understand yt / another to believe yt / which belief
being only able to save / is ordinarily only engendered by preaching. Heb. 11.
6. To. 10. 14


Whereby also we have a piece off remedy / against another poison spit forth in
this diuis. that to those which understand the scriptures they are as whot, and
lightsome red as preached. For where in his former assertion although not in
words / yet in deed he utterly condemned the wisdom off God / ordeining
pastors / and Doctors for continual functions in the church / of whom there is
no use / if simple reading be as effectual as preaching: that being wrung out
off his hands / in that he is compelled to confess greater efficacy off
preaching toward the unlearned: yet rather the^ all this cobweb should be
vnweaued / he makes the ministry off preaching void toward the learned.
Whereas the scripture does not only generally / but particularly / and expressly
shut up the salvation off the learned in the means off preaching / as To. 10.
14 ^. Cor. 21. To. 1. 14.
off the unlearned. But this is a piece off the doctorall divinity of some in
Camebridge / which to excuse their shameful contempt off preaching / and to
make them a pillow to sleep on / or to pane them an alley to bowl in during
sermons in the afternoon: shame not to allege / that they ca^ profit as much
in reading the scriptures / or an homily out off Chrysostom in their study /
as by hearing a sermon in the church.

Unto the example off the Eumuche, which reading the scripture believed not
until he heard Philip preach, he answers that he understood yt not, and that
he speaks off an understanding reader. Which although it be untrue / the
words off his former book being general / withowt so much as the least
signification off exception: yet it is nothing worth. For the cause why he
could not understand yt is there assigned / for that he had no teacher Act 8.
verse. 31.
to show him the way. Whereby follows not (which the Papists conclude off
this place) that the people owght not to read the scriptures: seeing the Eunuch
which both knew / and confessed that he could not understand withowt a guide /
exercised him self diligently in reading off them. but this follows / that a
man can not ordinarily not only come to salvation / but not so much as to a
sufficient knowledge off it / withowt preaching. Where off infinite examples he
says one is as few as may be: yt appears this one was to much for him to
answer.

Now for all the false accusations / off joining with papists in despising off
reading the scripture, etc. once hear yowr one process / that yt is you that
strengh then their hands. For as in popery / by committing the office off
preaching especially unto the beggarly friars / and by declaring it more
honorable for the bishop to read a mass / then to preach a sermon / they set
reading in the head / and preaching in the tail: so you making simple reading
as profitable as preaching / hasten after them / and if you keep the same pase
you have begone / it will not be long or ever you overtake them.

The D. having before made simple readers equal with preaching Diuis. 9. page
574.
pastors / in that he holds simple reading / as effectual as preaching:
here in making bare reading better then preaching / prefers the readers
above the preachers. But in this later absurdity / first as before he would
make Musculus his packhorse / and therefore brawleth becawse I laid it not upon
Musc. so princely is the D. that he would have his faults whipped upon an
other man's skin. but at least I should have divided it between them. As if I
were matched with Musculus. but the truth is / that he makes not for him. For
he compares the profit taken of simple reading / and off a sermon made of him
which endeuoreth to make a glorious show off eloquence / and learning rather
then to apply him self to the capacity off the simple: which is nothing to that
in hand / where good reading is compared with good preaching. And therefore it
is ridiculous the D. brings of bitter inuectiues, and contentious sermons,
etc. compared with orderly reading. For in this comparison / it were not hard
to prove (which is blasphemy) that yt is better to read a piece off Lyuy /
then the books off the kings: namely if Lyuy be simply red / and the other
with interlining / and mixture off popish interpretation. If one defending
this would for maintenance off his comparison bring this escape: would not all
men hiss at him? this is his refuge also Page 717.
to salve that he said / off homilies red better then sermons preached.

His other instance off a papist carrying prejudice against all preachers, and
therefore not moved once by their doctrine, in which notwithstanding after by
reading he is established, is insufficient. for if the Lord by his virtue
showed throwgh preaching / do convert men vttenly perverted / and at enmity
with all truth / and consequently with Ephesians. 2.
the ministers theroff: how much more will he thereby convert papists? which by
doubting whether the gospel be truth / or their superstitions have ground / or
no / carry not that enmyty the other do / which have no such entrance. Then you
must understand / that as in the Sacraments the Lord does not always at the
same time they are ministered / work by his spirit / but chooses the time
that seems good to his wisdom: so yt is in preaching. whereby yt comes to
pass / that the spirit of God worcking faith at the time of reading / wrought
it not by that means only: but used thereunto the help off preaching / which
went before. For as green wood laid upon fire / and her with many strong
blastes / as last set on fire / and flaming with one / and that a soft blaste
/ is not to be be said chiefly set on fire with the soft blaste / because it
went immediately before: even so the word off God blown by preaching / and
after sensibly burning in the hearres of the hearers / by the means off
reading immediately gone before / is not so much to be ascribed unto reading /
as preaching. Considering that so it might comme to pass (which is absurd)
that contemplacion off the creatures / should profit more then reading. For
whereas the Lord has seth the print off the most off his promises / and other
Math. 6. 16. etc.
doctrines in the creatures: for example / off his fatherly care off providing
al things necessary for his / in the provision for birds off the air / and
rich array off the lilies off the field: yt may comme to pass / that that
doctrine known by means off preaching / and lying as yt were dead in the
heart / may after by sight / and earnest vewe off the things them selves / be
quickened. yet none off judgment will say / that the beholding off the
creatures wrrowght more in this / then preaching. Howbeit if the cases he
puts in this point were true: yet he is inexcusable / these plasters coming
a ye are and a half / after the wound given by such strange speech: which
owght to have gone with yt / if peradventure they might althowgh not heal /
yet somewhat hide the loathsome rawnes.

Hitherto pertains that which he has disorderly put page 176. where he says
/ that the reading off Saint Paul's epistles did the Romans more good, the^
preaching: which is contrary to S. Paul's meaning / 1. To. 1^.
who shows / that he could not have the like fruice off his ministry
toward them / as off other nations / because he was let to comme / and
preach unto them. His proofs coming a mile after / are first that a man's
meaning is commenly better expressed by writing, then by word. Which beside
that it is confuted by commensense / all men knowing that there is more
certain understanding by word off mouth / the^ by lettres (which if any doubt
arise in any word / can say nothing to the resolving off it) as yt is alleged
/ it can not tend but to utter subversion off the lords order / and to prove
that commenly, and for the most part / it is better to have reading / then
preaching. The other is that writing remains: as if the question were wether
canonical writing off the scriptures / were better then preaching: and not
whether there be more fruict in bare reading that which is written / then
preaching upon yt.

In this chap. which supposes reading preaching, beside strange Diuis. ^.

asseuerations / and begging of that in controversy: there is nothing / saving
that as absurdities are fruictfull / this beggetteth other. for pressed he
shameth not to say / that a child off 4. year old, is a preacher off the
gospel. And why not also a popeniay / tawght to pronounce some sentences off
scripture? for the D. reason (because preaching 10 Romans 14 is all publishing
off the gospel by external voice) 569.
serves for one / as for the other. And beside that it is frivolous that off
that God speaks to us by reading / he would conclude that he preaches to us
/ as though all speaking were preaching: yt is absurd that he says / the
scriptures are not preached in respect off him that reads, but in respect of
the spirit of God worcking in the hearers. For if reading were preaching / yt
should be preaching although it wrowght to comdemnation: whereas by the D. all
which hearing the word preached / profit not / are not preached unto. Which as
it 2. Cor. 2: 15. Heb. 4. 12 Diuis. 2. page 576. 1. Tim 32
is a gross error: so it is a shameful derogation to the ministry off the
word / worcking mightily not only to the salvation off the elect / but also
throwgh their fault / to destruction off the reprobate.

To the places proving that it is necessarily required in a minister / that he
should not only be sufficiently learned / but have Is. 50. 4.
also the gift off utterance: he answers not. Towching that the priests
lips should keep knowledge / and not his papers: he Malach. 2. 7.
answers that he shall have it readier in his lips, if he have yt in his
papers: which is not to purpose / seeing we spoke off those which have yt only
in papers. Then he has a childish cavil / that if he read he must use his
lips: as if the Prophet contented him self if the priests were able to read
only / and did not note thereby the aptnes to teach / as by uncircumcised
lips / is noted heaviness / Exodus 6. 12.
or vnreadines off speech. That a Preacher able for utterance, and learning to
preach, may read a sermon, if he mean privately / is not in question: if
publicly / yt belongs to the question off Homilies. His case off a man
pronouncing an other man's sermon withowt book / beside the fondnes is from the
cawse. That the reading of Ieremies, and Baruchs books was preaching, becawse
the books were sermons: is to dream / and not to dispute.

The 15. 16. verses Romans 15. make nothing to prove reading preaching: but make
rather against him / in that the Apostle showing Diuis. 3. page 576. (...)
that his writing to them was grownded off Gods calling / sowght a more
general word / off worcking for the gospel: which agrees to any action the
minister does by reason off his ministry / either in ministering the Sacraments
/ or otherwise. The difference Saint Paul puts between his preaching / is
apparent 1. To. 15.
althowgh the D. has lost his sight. That S. Paul meant he could not personally
preach unto them, is his addition / corrupting the mind off the Apostle. For
where showing that he had great desire to be personally with them (form spirit
he was not absent) he adds for a cawse that he might preach: the D. by this
answer / drowneth the effect in the cause / and so makes the Apostle assign
cawses / which cawse nothing / nor have any thing to be referred unto. Where I
show that S. Paul vvriting, is no more preaching then his hand, or pen he
vvrote with be his tongue, lights, or other instruments he spoke with: he
answers not / for that as he says it is a jest. Where if his cause could
speak / it would complain that he makes no more account of it / then to
esteem her head stroked / when it is cracked a sonder. for the reason is of the
efficient cause / seeing they can not be the same / which can not be made by the
same instruments.

To maintain his ridiculous demand (was not reading off Diuis. 4. pa 577.
Deuteronomy. preaching) he should have showed / that the reading off yt is rather
preaching / then reading off Exodus: which he does not. Howbeit he concludes /
that the reading theroff was preaching / becawse the Lord commanded that the
priests should read yt, that the people might learn to fear God: which is
as ridiculous. For so peinting / and grauing off the scriptures is preaching /
and peinters and grauers (which sometimes know never a lettre off the book)
shall be come preachers. Considering that the Lord commanded / Deuteronomy 27. 2. 3.
and 6. 9 and 11. 20. 21.
that the law should be graven in the entrance of their land / and written
upon their city gates / and howses: to this end that the people might learn
to fear God / etc. After he asks / why Iosia should cawse the law to be
redd, if reading had not been off at great force to persuade as preaching:
which frenzy belonging to another question / is answered before. Where he
concludes / that for that reading Diuis. 4. page 570.
is as effectual as preaching, therefore it is preaching: beside the falsehood
off the antecedent / the conclusion is too bad. for if the rain be as
effectual to cawse the fruictes grow / as the son / and meat as effectual
to perserue the life / as drink: it follows not therefore that the rain is
the son / or meat drink.

Where upon Nehem. 8. he would prove reading preaching: verse. 3. 4.
there is not a word whereon it may be gathered / but contrariwise they are
manifestly distinguished in that chap. For beside reading there mentioned / he
sets forth preaching by all these words / that the Levites cavvsed the
people to understand the law, gave the sense off the law, cavvsed them to
understand the reading. And where page 91. he says / that the words
translated off some they gave the sense, signify nothing les the^ that there
was any exposition 8. Nehe^ 7. 8.
joined with reading, bearing him self upon learners interpreters: seeing he
sees no further into this / then with other men's eyes / why should not he
have followed the judgment off the Geneua translation / which he pincheth?
they being learned men / and more in nombre then as (I think) he can allege.
Which I say not to justify that translation throwghowt / or to shut up the way
against a better: but because it seems an unworthy thing / to refuse their
judgment upon bare authority. I have none off his learned men to look their
judgments / howbeit for that I find one off the Hebrews so expounding the
words: I will not deny but some other deceived by him / might fall into that
error. Unto whom althowgh I could oppose an other / flatly expounding these
verses off reading joined with exposition / the exposition off the former not
shutting out preaching: yet I had rather my confutation stand of reason / then
authority. Which is that the holy ghost showing in the 7. verse / that the
Levites made the people understand the law / in the 8. shows how they did
it. for (says he) they redd in the book off the law distinctly, and in
giving the sense, caused them to understand the reading Whereas those words
which are turned (gyuing the sense) can not (...) withowt a gap / be carried to
the peoples attentive hearing: considering that it is spoken in that verse off
the Levites / withowt resuming off the people either expressly naming them / or
obscurely by any article. Which hard translations when an other sense does well
agree to the suit off the text / are by all means to be avoided. That these
words (the Levites cavvsed the people understand the law) be nothing else but
they made them give diligent ear unto the reading: yt is violent. For beside
that it is against the general rule / not to run to a figurative speech / when
the simple will (which the D. can not deny) agree with the residue off the
text: especially when both this / and the other interpretation (they Luke 4. 17
etc. Act. 13. 15 and 15. 21. verse. 12.
gave the sense) are confirmed by the practice off the church: yt is
vnconfirmed by any conference off scripture / or circumstance of place:
confuted also by that this word is expounded by an other / they made them know
the law. Where the scripture speaking off one thing diversely / if it speak
figuratively in one word / uses to speak properly in an other.

Where both by the words and practice of the church in other places / I showed
the place off the Acts to be understood Diuis. 5. Page 577. Act. 15. 21
off reading, and preaching jointly: the D. not answering the reason / says
that the place is evidently for him, which is a begging off that in question:
that he can read no interpreter which enterpreteth yt otherwise, no one being
browght which follows that sense: that the circumstance off the place makes
for him, becawse Saint James uses for a reason, to prove that the Jewish
ceremonies could not be forthwith abolished, that Moses had by reading of the
law every Sabbath so great authority: which is manifestly against him. for it
makes more for the confirmation of S. James sentence that he was both redd /
and preached every sabbath / then if he had been only redd: considering that
his authority was so much the deeper settled in the hearts off the Jews.

Hitherto pertains that in the end off his book / where he trifleth for that
the Adm. expounds (reading is not feading) Page 784.
by this it is bare feading: which is unworthy answer / considering it is
received in all tounges / often to deny that to be done / in diu. 10. page 243.
which is done insufficiently / as is before noted. That also he says there /
repeted p. 718. off dissent with my self, for that saying there that bare
reading withowt a miracle can not save from famishement, I say in an other
place that the word off God is easy, giving understanding to idiots, is
frivolous. Considering that I spoke off reading / not utterly separate from
preaching. If it be easy and give understanding by preaching / and reading
together / although not so by reading only: that stands which I have set
down. That he exclameth off that sentence / as Papisticall, etc. I have showed
how it is catholic / and his Papisticall that makes so easy a way to
salvation withowt preaching. yt is well with us / and the scriptures keep their
honor / if they bring to the elect salvation / used / and applied as the order
which the lord has set / requires. onles paraduenture he will say the holy
Sacraments leese their honor / when it is said they are not effectual to
salvation / without men be instructed by preaching before they be partakers off
them.

Having showed that bare reading off scriptures / can not make unpreaching
ministers occupy any place in the church: remains yet the reading of Homilies
/ with the Apocrypha: in which cover is sowght for the^ against the sentence of
conde^natio^ / and storm of the Lords wrathful judgment / which will follow
if they repent not speedely. for where these dry nources have no milk of their
own: the D. will have the^ yet give suck / although of the becastes of
others. But this kind off milk having taken wind / shall appear not to be
so fit to nourish / as that it may come into the church for a supply of
sermon. yt is enough if as for support off the nource / sometimes other then
hers be taken: so to spare the pastor hardly able every day to preach / the

churches, therefore we may read sermons in ours.) The absurdity wheroff lest
it should be hidden / he has made a great deal bigger. for charged with it he
answers / that the committing them by writing unto posterity, argues that
they thought them very profitable unto the church. so that his argument is /
they are profitable / therefore they may be red publicly in the church. As if
there were no profit reaped by reading the^ privately: or as if al things
profitable for the church / may be red openly in yt. where are browght in to
public reading / whole cartlodes off disputations of the Catholics with
Papists* Anabaptists / Arians: likewise of Ecclesiastical stories a hudge
heap / and other rables of heritikes / and schismatikes: which being
profitable / have the D. ladder to clime up into the pulpit. But one thing we
may note* what is that? that August and Chrysostom writ their sermons, therefore
it may be they red them sometimes in the church. If you be in earnest / in
earnest you are a sleep. For so far be you from concluding justly / that it is
meet to read them in the church: that you conclude not they were so much as
red. I pray you have any off our homilimakers / red their homilies in the
churches? I thinck not: onles it have been since you wrote / to make yowr
argument seem good. So in thincking to make one note, you make two shameful
blots. you see not why they may not as well now be red in the church, as then
preached: a pitiful blindness / wheroff the remedy if you will open you eyes /
follows. Now to come to the 3. chap. Tract. 21.

The first / and second diu. be not worth the answer / the third is answered /
except that he says / the Adm. proved not the sufficiency off the scripture by
1. Cor 1. 18. 1. To. 16. becawse there be manifest places for that purpose: as
though it were thus to be charged / if it used places which prove that /
although not the fittest. Where upon that the Lord admits no instruments
be they never so vile, in the Exodus 30. 29. Number. 10. 2.
service of the temple, nor tru^pets in assembling the people, but which were
sanctified to that use, although others were as apt to do the vvorcke as
they, I concluded that homilies, etc. not sanctified of the Lord to that
purpose, ovvght to be kept ovvt: he answers / that similitudes be no
sufficient proof, and that the Lord did not command that nothing should be
red in the church but canonical scripture, not remembering that it is the holy
ghostes / which teaches that the tabernacle with the vessels / were made
according to the patron off the church now. The which in the holy trumpetes is
Heb 8. 9.
more clearly seen: considering that the holy ghost commanding them to be
blown by the priests alone / and comparing the public Number. 10. 8. Is. 58. 1.
teaching with the sound off them: does not obscurely declare / that they were
shadows thereof. Therefore as the trumpet^ were sancrified to the temple / by
the commandment off God: so to make Homilies holy in Gods principal / and
public service / the like authority is required.

Where I show that nether homilies, nor Apocrypha are to be compared in goodne^
in themselves, nor in fruict tovvard the hearer, with the scripture, and
reading theroff (wherein the D. labored not, but ^o^^ered / against the Adm.)
he answers that nothing can thereby be concluded against homilies, which may
not be against sermons, and other interpretations, and rather against sermons
then homilies: which is detestable. For thereby he affirms / that homilies are
both better in them selves / and red more fruictfull to the hearers / then the
word off God preached. Wherein he controileth also the order off our church /
which will have homilies give place / ^f there be any to preach. For
confutacion wheroff I send the reader to that before disputed* for if the word
preached / be more fruictfull then the word yt selff red: then reading off
homilies inferior in fruict to the reading of scriptures (by the D. confession
here) must be much more inferior to the word preached. His reason is / for I
make no make no other difference betwixt homilies, and sermons, but that one is
pronounced within book, the other not so. Belike homilies / and sermons are
equal in all other things: yet homilies excel sermons / in that they are red
in the book / the other is done by lively voice. But is there no difference at
all but this? first ^et him understand / that sermons in the church / are
expressly commanded off the Lord / are such as are necessary for all churches /
and which no one can want. As for homilies / if they were in this dearth off
preaching granted convenient for our church: yet have they no commandment /
whereby they are made necessary / and such as the church is bound unto: they
also are such / as either all / or the most flourishing churches have not. In
which difference there is as great a goulf between them / as is between heaven
and earth. I speak off them now / as if they were conveniently ordained. For
although in such case / during the conuenience / they ought to be kept as
profitable orders off the church: yt these chaungeable constitutions / compared
with the eternal saw off God / are infinitely inferior. so it is utterly
false which he says afterward / all kind off publishing the doctrine in
scripture, have necessary uses in the church. Whereby he makes things
necessary to saluaceo^ / nether expressed / nor necessarily concluded of the
scripture: and conde^neth in this behalf / all churches which either have been /
or are / not receiving the use off homilies. Thus ones the singular fruict off
preaching the word / is manifest to be so much greater then homilies reading /
as the means ordained off the lord / is more fruictful then that off men.

Secondly if they were convenient / yet they might both be made / and
publickely red / withowt any of those ordinary ministeries which the lord has
appointed in his word. for a private man may write them / as he may do a
commentary: and if a minister make them / yet he does nor that by bond off his
ministry. for then he should leave a part off it undone / which wrote not
homilies: and having done all other parts / should be gilty off the not
fulfilling off it / for omitting this. seeing therefore there is no commanded
ministry off God required / nether in making / nor reading Romans 10. 15.
of them / and sermons can not be made withowt: there is here an other
singular difference / lifting up preaching with the fruict theroff / so far
above homilies red* as the Lords autorised Ambassador with his broad seal /
and letters patentes / is above him in whom no such marks appear, withowt
whose ministry when (as I have showed) faith can not be engendered / nor men
ordinarily saved: there being plentiful salvation withowt homilies reading /
as appears both otherwise / and by other churches where they are not: the
difference of preaching with the fruict theroff / is incomparably more / then
that by homilies reading.

The third difference is / that where sermons are applied to the present
circumstance / which by change off times / budding off new vices / rising of
errors / etc. vary almost every day this kind off interpretation (as that
which is starcke / and annu^med) can not poursue them. for where the preacher
with his sermon / is able according to the manifold windinges / and turninges
of sin / to wind / and turn in with yt / to thend he may stricke it: the
homilies are not able to turn / nether off the right hand / nor off the left /
but to what quarter soever the enemies are retired / yt must keep the train
wherein it was set off the maker. And if it were possible (which is not) to make
homilies against all diseases off vices / and errors: and that were also
granted / that the reading ministers could both discern the sickness / and
apply the medicine laid up in the homily / which requires the skill off a
learned man: yet as no physicion (how cunning soever) can so well prescribe at
ones / and in gross against a disease / as he that upon every step yt makes
gives counseill / and applies his medicine: so no homily maker / be he never
so great a divine / can at ones / and before hand prescribe so apt / and strong
remedies against sin / as he that does yt upon the present occasion. Homilies
then not able to comme to the vices / further then vices come to them: their
use for this / and other cawses aforesaied / is private. For a man feeling him
self assaulted in any wise / and knowing a treatise arming him against that
assault / may for his use be profitably occupied in it. I leave the difference
in gifts / isntrumental causes off sermons / and homilies: when as beside the
gifts required in homilies either reading / or making / there are in sermons
required the gift off utterance / and memory. I pass also that the D. in
saying there is no difference between an homily red, and a sermon preached, but
that the one is pronounced within book, the other not so: makes no difference
between him that writes his sermon / and reads it / and him that reads an
other man^es / not able to make one him self. this shall be sufficlent to have
showed that absurdity.

Where also go to the ground other absurdities / laid upon this foundation:
as that the promise off the assistance off gods spirit, is as well given to
writers of homilies, and their hearers: as to studiers for page 718.
sermons, and those which hear them. as if he had said / the Lord will give
testimony to his word / as well by the means which me^ have devised: as that
him self has ordained. Likewise that sermons should be kept out off the
church, as well as homilies, if they should be shut Ibi. diu. 5.
out because they are men's interpretation. considering that the preacher
albeit he be a man / yet in respect off his public ministry / instituted /
and command of the Lord / is as the angel off God / yea as Christ him self:
which can not be said off homily readers / Gal. 4. 14 2. Cor. 5. 20. Diuis. 5.
Page 718.
nor makers / especially in that respect. To that I allege off the coustome
off the Churches / before our Savior Christ's coming / and after / towching
homilies not used in the church, and that in such time when there was
greatest use off them: he answers / that the argument is of authority
negatiuely. where I leave to the judgment off the reader / what likelihood
there is / that there were any homilies red in the church / when both holy /
and ecclesiastical writers / making me^tio^ of the form of service of God in
the church / to the least / and smallest ceremonies: there is none diverse 100.
years / that ones vouchesafeth to mention homilies reading / which the D.
matcheth with preaching / the highest service off God in his church.

Where he says / that I condemn thargument drawn off men's authority, yt is
untrue: I said it constreineth not. And I spoke of it where yt is question off
searching the truth off a matter / wherein many easily deceived / none knows
the full off it: and not off reporting things done in presence off him that
writes / whereof he making profession to write / can not withowt gross
oversight / pass by. where he says / yt is an evil argument to conclude off
a thing not done, that it should not be done: if the churches governed by the
Prophets / and Apostles did it not / it being put as a piece off the service
off God / and as the D. says. necessary: either they faulted in not using this
means / which is absurd / or the D. which defends the use off it. He says /
I can not but acknowledge one good sermon red, to edify more then the Chalde
paraphrastes. so destitute off means to refute the reason I set down / why a
short paraphrasis was meeter then homilies, namely for that they approached
nerer unto the reading off the scripture which is best: he sets his cause
at my courtesy. But if I grant that he asks / he is nothing nerer: onles he
can prove that a learned homily / is fitter then a learned paraphrase made now
in this great light / which the Chalde paraphrastes could not have when they
wrote. So that although they expounding darckly / according to the time they
wrote in / be not so fit now to read / as an homily: yet yt stands still /
that a pharaphrast is fitter to be red then an homily. Where he says / I know
that the Jews have these paraphrastes yet red: I showed both by scripture and
otherwise / that they had the^ not openly red / when there was greatest need
off them. If they had them after when diverse corruptions were entered / or now
when they are the synagogue off Satan / tha^ makes rather for me. They which
told him that Jonathan was 42. years before our Savior Christ / if they meant
thereby to confute that I set down / should have given him something to answer
the authority I alleged. Although he might be well 42. yearers before our
Savior Christ / and then too: considering he was school fellow to Symeon /
off whom S. Luke makes mention.

The testimonies off Denis, and Clements Epistles red in the church, to prove
it untrue which I affirmed / off the churches practice towching reading off the
scriptures alone / after the Apostles tmes / are in that respect idle:
considering that I only showed / that that coustome continued after their
times / which were the best / and purest. Nether can the breaking off this
order by some churches / upon some occasion / let why it may not truly be
said both the coustome / and practice. If the Centuries conjecture were
received / that Denis epistles were red / as Clementes: yet that proves not
that they were red generally / considering that Clements was red but in
certain churches. But what if it be said / that they were red in those
churches / for that they were untruly Hieron. in catal. illustriu^ script.
thowght of the Canon of the scripture? Whereto serves not only that Denises
were called Catholic / but Clements weighty / and wonderful. Likewise that
Eusebius. esteeming Clement the canonical 3. lib 16. Lib. 3. 27.
translatour off the Epist. to the Hebrews: yt is not unlike / but he had that
epistle in like estimation. Last off all for that as he lightly rejected the
true canonical books off Saint James / Jude / and second off Saint Peter: so
he lightly held those for canonical / Lib. 2. 23. Lib. 3. 3.
which were not if I answer thus / my conjecture has better reason / then you
yet show: and then the reading off these epistles helps you not. you have
only Soters / which help nothing more / being red only at Corinth. Howbeit it
shall be sufficient answer / that as other corruptions crept in then: so the
seed of this began to be sown / and that the credit which yowr cawse gains
in that diverse churches red them: yt leeseth in that diverse others received
them not. Likewise it makes against him / that the council gives no place
unto homilies / but in extreme cases off sickness / etc. off the minister: where
he makes them the peoples ordinary food. The council as it were in a great
drowght / or snow when all is covered / will have the sheep helped with this
hard meat the D. will have it their commen allowance. Beside that it is the
objection / which I myself im^ediatly after prevented: pa 720.
my answer whereunto the D. towcheth not but only affirms it a good decree,
and no cawse off corruption: which is gross beggary. considering / that I show
how upon occasion theroff / in time came in the popish Legend / and Gregory's
homilies: which iustled out the holy Bible.

Where I showed that Bucers words secme counterfeit / Diuis. 6. page 720.
whereby he is browght exhorting to increase the number off homilies, when the
Lord should bless the realm with learned preachers: forasmuch as there were
then learned preachers / able to make homilies / which should have exceded the
volume of the Bible: he answers / that there is no cause to suspect them, but
the reason he can not answer. After he cyteth M Ridly but fondly. for if the
authority off all those which established that order / be not able to make yt
good: much less his alone / and being a party in this cawse he owght not
(albeit a singular man) be witness. Where I alleged the council council of
Laodicea / ordeining that nothing should be red in the Diuis. 7. page 71^. 59

church / but the canonical scripture: he answers / the council meant,
nothing under the name of holy scriptures: which is an open / and shameful
corruption. for after the council had said / that the gospels with other
scriptures / should be red on Sabbath days: yt adds / we must not read
books which are ovvt off the canon, but the canonical books off the old,
and now testament alone. And where he would confirm his interpretation by the
47. canon off the third council off Carthage: he is again indebted In the def
Apolo. 5. part. 3. cha 10. dluis.
unto Harding / which against Master Jewel / alleging the council off
Carthage / to prove that it commanded nothing should be red in Christ's
congregation / but the Canonical scriptures answers with the same words the
D. does / charging him with falsehood. To whom as now also to the D. the bishop
answers / that the meaning off the council was, that nothing else should be
red: which he proves by the council off Hippo / an abridgement off that off
Carthage: whene it is thus written. The scriptures canonical which are to be
red in the chap. 38.
church, and beside which nothing may be red: and so goes forward alleging
other testimonies / affirming partly that nothing owght / partly that nothing
was wont / to be red in the church beside holy scripture.

His answer to the council off Colen / is too childish. The councels words in
the sixth Canon are these / where in times past yt was ordained off the most
holy fathers, that the holy scriptures alone should be red in the church: we
know not by what carelesnes, other not to be compared with them, are come
into their place. Whereby appears / that it condemns not only reading off
saints lives, wheroff it speaks after: but generally the breach of the
councels decree / that nothing should be red in the church / but holy
scripture. Where he museth how we can say, that reading off homilies were
means to instle the bible into corners, seeing we will have the reading of
scriptures give place to preaching: I have showed how gross / and intolerable
ignorance it is / where I proved the excellency of preaching before simple
reading off scriptures / but especially before homilies. The objection which I
made off Diuis. 8. Page 721.
prayer / is answered: the answer is not ones moved, as for that the necessity
off changing the words off scripture in prayer, is as strong against sermons
preaching, as homilies reading: I have showed how false it is: when as that
change is autorised by precise commandment off God / which can not be showed
for reading homilies His reason that the Apocrypha may be red in the church /
becawse the council off Carthage decreing only the reading off canonical
scripture / took them in that number / adding that they be as well red in the
church / as counted portions off the old / and new testament: is absurd. For
seeing it is utterly unlawful for them / to take them as portions off the old
/ and new testament: yt follows by his own reason / that it is utterly
unlawful for them / to be openly red.

Where he says / there is nothing in them contrary to the rest off the
scripture, accounting them as a part: althowgh the reason be nothing worth /
considering that so a book gathered out off Cato / Theognes / and Cebes tables
/ etc. may be red in the church: yet I answer / that there be many places
partly plainly contrary to the holy scripture / partly frivolous / and unworthy
to be red. For Esoras Apocrypha / I will refer the reader partly unto Caluins

censure of them (the treatise I do not precisely remember / saving that it is
like to be in one of those against the Anabaptists / or Libertines / whose
gospel those books be) and partly to the manifest contradiction with the holy
scripture: which referring Apoc. (...) li. 1. c 2 etc ^sd^ ^ 2. Genesis 34. 2^ Gen

the genealogy off Esra unto Eleazar / to whom the priesthood belonged / is by
the Apocrypha referred unto Ely / and consequently unto Ithamar / to whom yt

the holy ghost condemns the fact off Simeon / and Levy toward the
Sichemites: Judith in propounding it for example / and to strenghthen her faith
in the cutting off off Holofernus head / allows yt. If it be said / but the
book does not allow it. The scripture never propounds a faulty prayer
withowt condemning off it / especially so long.

demanding pardon off the reader / a language unmeet for the holy ghost. These
few off a number which come to mind / shall suffice for a taste.

And be cause the D. tastes nothing but authority off men / he has ad Laetam.
Jerome of this mind: which writing to a woman / bids her take heed off all
the Apocrypha, affirming that they are not theirs whose names they bear, that
there are many faulty things mingled, and that it requires vvisdome, to seek
for gold in dirt. Ierom. In praef. in Dan. ibid. Ieron. praef. in prou.
The hymn also off the three children / he runs throwgh: where Erasmus
iestingly says / it is merueill that Jerome puts this song upon the spit
(meaning / condemns it) seeing it is both red, and soung in churches every
where, as if it were some special holy thing. Whereby it is not unlike but
that he speaks in another place / off the reading off Apocrypha to edyfying
off the people, not to confirmation off the doctrine is spoken rather story
wise / in telling what was done in that time / the^ what he allowed. for if it
be dangerous for one to read them privately / how must it needs be more to
read them openly? onles it be with exposition / which is yet more absurd.
Except paraduenture to reconcile Jerome / one had rather interpret those
words the church reads, off the private reading of every one off the church:
wheroff there are examples.

Now I must put the D. also in mind / that nether in his first / nor later
book / he has answered the Adm. reason / towching private reading only of
the Apocrypha: because their name which signifies secret, or hid does speak
as much. If he will say / they are so called because the writers of the^ are
unknown: he can not so escape / considering that this name does put a
difference between them / and canonical: which it could not / if that
signification should be followed. for part of the writers of canonical books
/ as of Iosue / Judges / Sam. Chron. Kings / etc. are unknown. To that wherein
the book is charged / for lifting up of diverse cha. of the Apocrypha, to be
red as extra ordinary lessons upon feast days, vvherin there are greatest
assemblies, some chap. off canonical scripture being not red at all: he
answers not a word / but leaves it to speak for it self. Seeing then the
scripture precisely forbids to ordeine a pastor not fit to teach / and bare
reading off homilies is convenient / off holy scriptures insufficient to save
the people by / which are the cruches wherewith the D. would vphould this lame
ministry: it follows together with the shameful absurdities / off reading
to be preaching / to be as good / yea better then preaching: that unpreaching
pastors as the pestilence off the church / owght to be thrown out.

Now I return back to the 7. Tract. off Ministers apparel / Page 256. in
32. sec. page 28.
whereunto albeit I was determined (as may appear) to reply: yet considering
after / that this cawse has been so fully debated / both by books in print /
and other treatises written in the hands of as many as desire after them:
considering also that the D. second answer (beside false accusations / as that
men have Page 256.
learned off me, and my parteners to esteem the surplis, etc. corrupt in them
selves etc. open facing down off things in knowledge off all men / as that
none are hindered one jot from coming to the gospel by prescript apparel:
bare affirmacions withowt proof / as that no minister 257.
making conscience off wearing thapparell, will rather wear it moved by
example off other, then by the law which commands it: almost continual 258.
reasoning not to the matter / which he cowardly dissembleth / as that
Prophets (which were extraordinary ministers) had an extraordinary apparel,
which is not denied (which train taken at 262.
the beginning / is followed to the end): triumphs in his own shame / ^^
appears in the place off Salomons Ecclesiastes): I say beside these
considering that he has almost nothing at all? not before answered / and that
he has not fetched from any treasury off good learning / but as taken up by
the high way side^ and considering that we have this question with very few
(him / the Papists / or those which have already cast an eye unto the papists
/ only excepted / with whom to trauaill in this point before their other gale
be purged / were to heal the skin / and leave the bones still broken) all
these things considered / with that that it may better appear / we take not
these things for the greatest matter we complain of: I thowght good to tread
this treatise under my foot / and to save some good hours / which might be
lost in vnripping this beggary. That I say off having this question with very
few / him / etc. excepted / I mean in that where he says the surplis, square
cap, and tippet be most convenient, decent, and comely: page 25^. 285.
others in whom there is any love off the truth / confess it a weed unmeet for
a minister of the gospel / which not able to root out / they are for certain
causes content to bear with. And althowgh destitute off answer / he plie his
matter with accusatio^s of disobedience / and contempt of magistrate: yet I
doubt not but with all indifferent / our open / and simple profession off the
necessity off higher powers / and off the honor / and humble submission to
Her Majesty / and all magistrates underneath her / either in doing things
commanded / or patiently suffering for that which we can not with good
conscience do / shall be sufficient defense, especially seeing that even in
this matter off apparel / it is confessed / that obedience owght to be given /
where the commandment is with injury to the ministry.

As for the D. either error / or flattery / that in things indifferent
commanded by the Magistrate, we owght not to have such regard to the offense
Diuis. 4. page 258. 1. Cor. 8. 7. 11. Romans 14. 50. 20. Romans 14. 15. 21.
off the weak, but that if all should be offended, that is to say perish / and
make shipwreck off conscience (for that is the offense which S. Paul / and we
after him speak off) yet we owght to do that which is commanded: the
Magistrate being thereby lifted above the Lord / we utterly condemn.
Considering it being a flat commandment off the holy ghost / that we abstain
from things in their own nature indifferent / if the weak brother should be
offended: no authority either off church / or commen wealth / can make yt void.
And where the magistrates commanding / and owr obedience unto him / owght to
be squared out first by the love off God then off men / our brethren
especially: this new carpenter / as one that frames his squire according to
his timber / and not his timber according to the squire / will make our
obedience to the cyuill Magistrate / the rule off the love off God / and our
brethren. So that in steed that he should teach / that we may obey no further
unto the magistrate / then the same will agree with the glory off God / and
salvation off our brethren: he teaches that in things off their own nature
indifferent / we must have no further regard / nether to salvation off our
bethren / nor to the glory off God (which in neglect of their salvation is
trodden under food) then will agree with doing that the magistrate commands.
1. Cor. 8. 12.
But I am gone further then I thowght: seeing there ca^ hardly be any so simple
/ which perceives not easily / both the fondnes / and absurdity off his
answers in this question.

The reply to the D. 8. Tract. off Archbishopes / and Bishopes.
Unto the first / and second division / being beside the question / I answer
nothing. Before I come to the third / Math. 20. Luke 22. In the 1. tract.
forsomuche as the place off the Evangelists / which is before / is general /
and strikes at all the lofty / and swelling titles off the ministry: I will
set it here down in the foreward off the reasons / browghte against the names
off Archbishopes / etc. as that which speaking against all the smoky names /
must needs comprehend these. In the D. answer therefore / whereby he goes
about to prove that these words gracious; or bountiful Diuis. 1. Page 63.
Luke 22. 25
Lords, make nothing against the great names / and magnifical titles off the
ministers: this is the first / that Saint Mark, and Muthewe have no words
bearing any such sense. Whereunto I answer / that as yt is a general rule
almost throwghowte the scripture / that repetitions are not withowt some usury
/ and increase: so in the writings of the Eua^gelistes / yt is to be observed
almost every where. And therefore yt owghte not to have been strange / if other
Evangelists speaking off the authority only / S. Luke added also touching the
titles.

Secondly he answers / this clawse yt shall not be so with you, is not
referred unto those words (are called bountiful and benefyciall) but unto
ambition, and tyra^nical dominion only. whereunto I answer / first that
for so much as the things there affirmed of the Ministers / and the word off
gracious Lords, is as well affirmed (...).
off kings / as the word off bearinge dominion: therefore those words (yt
shall not be so with you) are as well referred unto the words (gracious
lords) as unto the word off domynion. Secondly yowr answer is contrary to the
authority you have alleged owte off Calvin. For if yt be true / that these
words bountiful benefactors, be all one with the words off Mathewe kings
exercise authority over them, and yowr self grant Math. 20. 25.
that these words (yt shall not be so with you) are referred unto the
dominion / and exercise off authority: yt follows that they must needs be
verified also / off bountiful benefactors.

Thirdly he answers / that this word bountiful is off no such imperiousnes,
but it might well agree to the disciples, and consequently to ministers.
Whereunto I answer / that it is no word off empire / but annexed unto yt: and
therefore that which can not agree to the ministers / whom God has shut from
any such domynion. And that it is a word off great port / and statelines /
appears forsomuche as not only the Egyptian kings were so called: but as
the D. him self confesses / the Ebrewes did so call their princes. (...)
Now he must understand / that that Hebrew word which he has set down
(bountiful) was nether given unto the Hebrewe princes by flattery off their
subjects / nor wrong from the subjects by tyrannous ambition off their
princes: but was a title given unto them by the holy ghost. Therefore it is
apparante / that S. Luke in those words / either respecting the coustome off
the profane kings / or of the good princes of the Jews in (...) paste: mente
that style was proper to the cyuill magistrate / and to high for the low
countenance off a minister.

Again this title off munificence / and bountifullnes as Aristotle shows /
is much more then liberal: and is not said but of Ethick. 4
those / which besides a great readiness of mind to give / have also wherewith
to bestow great gifts / and that to many. So that yt is no marvel /
althowghe this title be given off S. Luke unto princes / as they which for the
most part / are only hable to use the bounty answerable unto that title.
Again where he says / that these words off S. Luke are to be expounded by S.
Mathewe, and Mark, which have for (bountiful) they that are great: yt is
manifest by his own confession / that this title off bountiful imports
some great pomp / and owtwarde statelines. And thereby follows that S. Mathewe
/ and Luke using these three words (princes, great, kings) to note one thing:
yt must needs be that this word bountiful, being as you say all one with
(great) is forthwith all one with the other two words / princes, and kings.
Last off all / Calvin gyuing a reason off the signification off this word / a
little after the words you have alleged / says that theruppon yt comes that
men pay tributes and impostes, that princes may have to maintain the port,
and magnifycence off their estate. Whereby you might understand / that this
word does draw withal a more glyttering / and glorius estate / then can
agrree to the simplycitie off the ministry off the gospel.

Where also against me making two members of the sentence off our S. Christ
/ one towchinge the authority / and domynio^ of the cyuill magistrate / the other
towching his title / and name / the D. owte of Caluins words would prove /
that they be all onethe must understand that Calu. words are not full enowghe
to carry that meaning. For when he says / that S. Luke calls kings
bountiful, in the same sense that S. Mathevve says they exercise authority:
his purpose is to show / that they perteine / and are referred both to the
description off his estate / and to put the difference between him / and the
minister of the word. For otherwise they ca^ not be said to he all one /
saying one of the^ is verified off the other: and Luke beside this title of
bountiful lords, makes mention off exercisyng authority, and Domynion over
them. Therefore if this be an absurd saying (they which exercise authority over
them, exercise authority over them): yt is clear that Caluins meaning is not /
to confound one of those with an other. and if yt should / yet the
Evangelists words will not suffer yt.

Where further he says / that the name off graciouse Lord being a name off
svperioritie, and reverence, may therefore be given to ecclesiastical persons,
as well as unto civil: I can see no cord off reason which binds these
together. For the name of King / Prince / Duke / etc. names off superiority /
and reverence / by his reason may be given to ecclesiastical persons: which
him self denies. Therefore the D. must seek another distinction then this.
Nay let him divide tytles off dignity when he will / making as he does these
two off superiority / and reverence one member: whatsoever he makes the other
/ yt will fall within their compass. Furthermore the names off Earls / and Dukes
are no more proper to cyuill magistrates in our country / then the name off
gracious lord. For as the one is a note off one lyfted up into high degree /
so the other: and as the name off a lord with us / is not the name off an
office / but off honor only: so be the names off Dukes / and Earls. For men
being borne dukes / and Earls are not therefore borne magistrates: which
notwithstanding they should be / if the names off Dukes / and Earls were
proper to the civil magistrate.

In the name off Archbishop / the first part which signifies a prince / is
proper to the civil magistrate / and can not withowt robbery / be translated
from him unto Ecclesiastical persons. Which is to be showed first in that our
Savior Christ / and the Apostles when soever they speak off the superiority
off the ministers off the new Testamente / do so carefully avoid that word
/ with all those which fall from yt / or are derived of yt. Then in that
Aristor. says / the word domynion, does signify an imperious rule, as Beza
observes: where he shows that (...). upon the^ 13. off the Acts.
it can not agree to the ministers of the gospel. Thirdly eue^ by the D. own
confession in this place. For the greek word signifinge a prince / which name
he confesses proper unto the civil magistrate: (...).
yt must follow that the name off Archbishop / which is as much as prince off
bishopes / breaks upon the possession off the magistrate. whereupon follows
that that name is not only injurious / and tyrannical in respect off the
order off ministers / while it chalengeth princedome over them: but
presumptuous against the magistrate / whyleste yt pulls that name unto yt /
which is proper to him. So that if it were lawful for him / to exercise any
superiority over his fellow mynisters: yet yt owghte to be by an other title.
My mayor which you say is overthrown, has not so much as felt any
attempt. for the ouerthowe thereof were to prove / that the names proper to the
cyuill magistrate / belong unto one minister over another: which is not once
endeavored. The minor (which is that a cyuil magistrate is severed from the
ecclesiastical persons by lofty titles) has nothing against yt / but this
that gracious lord is commen to both civil magistrate, and ecclesiastical
person: which is taken for granted / where yt owghte to be proved. for all
thowghe he say / I may see it: yet he shows forth no light off reason to
make me see yt by. as for that he alleges / that in some places he is called
Dominus, which has but small lordship: I have answered yt in another place /
where I show that lord with us / can not be so taken / unless he mean a
Christmas lord / our lord off misrule. Now both the propositions standing /
the conclusion is most treue. When as also the title off Grace, is given to
ecclesiastical persons / which is given unto the prince / and does not agree
unto any under the degree off a Duke / the next unto the prince: I vvoulde
gladly know what difference there is / between the titles off ecclesiastical
persons / and the civil magistrate / so great that he must needs be very
blind which does not see yt. And where the D. says / that ecclesiastical
persons may show forth the countenance of their degree: he nether shows
what that is / and must be believed off his bare word / for there is no proof
at all. But off the pomp in other things / there shall be (God willing)
spoken off afterward.

Wheer the D. says yt is the poincte off a Sophister to strive for Diuis 3.
page 300.
names off things, where there is agreement off the matter: unto the reasons /
and examples I alleged to prove / that the very bare in 5. diui. Page 32.
use off certain names is unlawful / althowgh the things noted by them be
not / he answers not a word. And if those examples be not strong enowgh /
to obtain that at his hands: I would know of him which makes so small
accounte off names / whether a man which confesses him self mortal / may be
called by the name of Jehovah / etc. The answer to the first proposition is
insufficient. I could take exceptions to the examples here aliedged / as that
these words I have said you are Gods, are not given unto magistrates that they
should be saluted by the name off God / or that one king should be called the
God of England / another the god off France (which were not tolerable / and
approaching to the pride off Antiochus) but to this end that the authority
which they exercise according unto God / might be acknowledged in them: yet I
answer generally / that those speeches be therefore lawful / because the Lord
in his scripture has communicated them with men. wherefore if the D. will
prove that the title off archbishop / proper unto our Savior Christ / may 1.
Pet. 5. 4
be imparted unto a mortal man: he must show that as the name off God /
light off the world / etc. is given unto men in the scripture: so is also the
name of Archbishope. which when he shall never do / yt is in vain to
pretend these examples. For as yt had been an intolerable arrogancy for any
man / to have either taken / or given the authority off God unto the sons off
Adam / onles he him self had so honored them: so is yt full off presumption /
either to give or take this so high a name / which being the several off our
Savior Christ / was never by no word off his / laid owte in commen unto any
simple man whatsoever.

The D. answer unto the second proposition by distinction (the ignorance
vvheroff he does so often times reproach me with) is full of disorder / and
has nothing sound. first yt faulteth in that yt rendeth a sunder things
which can not be separated / and that two ways: one in separating the
government of the church by pastors / doctors / etc. from the spiritual. For
when the ecclesiastical ministry has respect to the soul / and
conscience: when yt is called the mynisterie off the spirit / spiritual: when
they which 13. Ebr. 17
(...) yt / are called mynisters in the kingdom off heaue^^ when the owtward
preaching / excommunication / and other discipline 1. Cor. 3. 8 1. Cor. 12. 1.
5. Mat. 11. 11 2. Cor. 10. 3. 4.
which they use / be spiritual: this separation off the owtward government
off the church from the spiritual / and making off them opposite members /
does not distinguishe but destroy the government off Christ. The Other is that
where our Savior Christ governs his church spiritually / both with his
spirit / and word: he places his sprituall government / only in that he
touches the hearts off his elect, by his spirit. And where our Sau. Christ
uses the external ministry off men / not only in distribution off his word
/ but also off his spirit: the D. makes thexternall ministry / to serve
only for the dispensation off the word / and not off the spirit. whereas he
owghte to have considered / that as Christ him self sitting in heaven / now
teaches by the mouth of the ministry: so he gives also his spirit by the
same ministry / in which respect yt is called the ministry off the spirit.
Seeing therefore the external government off Christ in his church is spiritual
/ and even that inward towch off the spirit of God / is not ordinarily / but
by the subordinate ministeries which God has appoincted in his church: yt is
manifest that that distinction / that Christ has no subordinate pastors
underneath him in the spiritual government, is false.

And if no man should touch yt / the D. has given it the fall him self. For
where he says / Christ in the spiritual regiment is the only Pastor: by and
by he says / he is the only archbishop in spiritual government. Which if yt
be true: then has he also in the spiritual government / other bishops
underneath him. for he can not be said arche or chief bishop / but in
respect off other bishops under him. And if this distinction were not false:
yet is it here idle / and out off place. for S. Peter out off whom I cited this
testymony / appropriateth to our S. Christ the name of archbishop / in respect
off the external regiment: that is to say / in respect that every bishop had
a particular charge of ministry underneath him. And where the D. faith / there
are other archbishops beside Christ in the external government: seeing he can
not deny / but the authority off Christ in every province / is greater then
off his Archbishop: I would gledly know off him / when he has given the name
off Archbishop to another / what name he leaves unto our Savior Christ /
whereby that exellencie / and pre-eminence off authority / may be noted. if yt
fall out that there is no name above an archbishop: I see not how he must not
be constrained / to confess that that name is excessive / which being the
greatest that can be in ecclesiastical government / is given to him that has
not greatest authority.

The other fault of this distinction is / that yt confounds / and shuffleth
together the authority of our Savior Christ / as he is the son off God only
before all worlds / coequall with his father: with that which he has given
off his father / and which he exercises in respect he is mediator between
God and us. For in the government off the church / and superiorytie over the
officers off it / our Savior Christ himself has a superior / 1. Cor. 4* 23.
1. Cor. 11. 3. 1. Cor. 15. 27. 28.
which is his father: but in the government off kingdoms / and other common
wealths / and in the superiority which he has over kings / and judges / he
has no superior / but immediate authority with his father. Therefore the
mouldinge up off the two estates / and gouernementes together / is to lay the
foundations off many errors. Last of all admitting this distinction / how
comes yt to pass that this poincte of his / that there are many archbishops
in the owtward regiment off the church, being that which is denied: is left
vvithowt any assistance off reason out off the scripture?

Here remains only to prove / the title Head off the church / to belong
only to our Savior Christ. I must therefore desire 4. Diuis. 301.
the reader to turn unto the 6. diuis. page 181. where the D. confesses as
much as I / that Christ is only the head of the church. If Christ be only
head: then that I set down / that the cyuill magistrate is head of the
co^monwealthe / and not of the church / stands. But if the magistrate be head
off the church: then Christ is not only. Howbeit having for fear off the
owtcry off all / made a little courtesy unto the truth: he forth with lifts
up his heel against it / and will have the civil magistrate head also off
the church / whereupon must follow infynite absurdities. first the doctrine
off the Apostle is by this means clean overthrown / Ephesians. 1. 21. 1. Col. 18.
which shows that this title Head of the church / was given to our Sau.
Christ / to lift him above all powers / rules / and domyons / either in heaven
/ or earth. Where if this title belong also unto the cyuill magistrate: then
yt is manifest / that there is a power in earth / whereunto our Savior
Christ is not in this point superior. And by the same reason that he may
give the cyuill magistrate this title / he may give him also that he is the
first begotten of all creatures / the first begotten off the dead / yea the
redemer of his people which he governs. For these all are a like given unto
him / as dignities whereby he is lyfted up above all creatures. And beside that
the whole argument off the Apostle in both places / lead to show that this
title Head off the church / can not be said of any creature: yt is confirmed
by the demonstratiue article / wherewith the Hebrews esyecially / whom Saint
Paul followed / use to tie that which is verified off one / unto him self
alone. For he says he is the head: as if he should say / he (...).
and none other is the head of the church. Again if the church be the body
of Christ / and of the cyuill magistrate / yt shall have two heads: which
being monsterous / is to the great dishonor off Christ / and his church. So
also should come to pass / that the church having the magistrate for head /
is accomplished / and made a perfect man without Christ: so that the
knittinge of our Savior Christ / should not be an accomplishmente off that
which lacked / but an addition off that which is to much. And if the church be
planted in a popular estate: then for so much as all govern in commen / and all
have authority / all shall be head there / and no body at all: which is
another monster.

Now if we consider the cawses / why our Savior Christ is called the head of
his church (which are that as the head is the higheste part in a man / above
which there is none allwaies joined with the body: so he is the chiefest / and
highest in his church / inseperably knitte with yt / and that as the head
gives sense / and moving unto all the body: so he quickneth / and to gether
with understanding of heavenly things / gives strenght to walk therein) I say
when these be the causes: yt is manifest / these things nor no one off them /
either agreing / or having any possibility to agree with any creature in heaven
/ or earth / either toward the whole church / or toward any partycular
assembly: that the name off the Head of the church / can not be without great
violence / given unto any simple creature. And yff yt be said that the cyuill
magistrate is a subordinate / and mynisteriall head off the church / as the
magistrate being head off the commen wealth / has other which may be called
under heads beneath him: he must understand that those heads are appoincted
/ becawse the chief magistrate can not be present with the whole body off his
people / nor in his own person perform the office of a head unto them all.
But forasmuch as Christ is never severed from his body / nor from any part
off yt / and is able / and does perform that wherefore he is called head / unto
all his church: yt owghte not to seem strange that there may be a subordinate
head in the commen wealth / where there can be none in the church.

And as yt has certain ground in the scripture / that this title of head of
the church / is to high to be given unto any man: so has yt been confirmed
from time to time / by writers both old / and new / which have had the honor
off Christ in any convenient estimation. Let us therefore see whether this
ialousie over the title of head of the church / not only in respect off the
whole / but in respect also off a particular congregation / have De
simplicitate praelat. Apol. 2. part. 2. c. diuis. 1. Li. 1. contra liter.
Petil. c. 5: Li. 3 contra liter. Pet. c. 42.
their approbation. Cyprian says / there is but one head off the church. The
bishop off Salsburie affirms the same. Augustine proves that the minister
which baptiseth / can not be the head off him which is baptized / because
Christ is the head off the whole church. And in another place / that Paul
could not be head of the churches which he planted / becawse Christ is head
off the whole body. which reason should be nothing worth / if either Saint
Paul / or any other minister might be a ministry all head off the church
under Christ. And if the name of ministerial head off the churches which
Paul planted / can not be given unto him which was a governor next / and
immediately under Christ in that same kind off government in the which our
Savior Christ is head / that is to say spiritual / no not then when there
was no Christian magistrate to make challenge unto that title / and to bring yt
into dowbte / whether yt belonged unto S. Paul / or to him: yt can not be that
the magistrate may take unto him that title / whose gouernmente does not
approach so nere unto our Savior Christ's / as he is head off the church.

And as they have taken away this title from the ministers over their flocks:
so have they from Emperors / and princes in regard off their subjects.
Ambrose says / yt is the greatest honor the Emperor can have, to be called
son off the church: Epist. 32.
and in the same Epistle / a good Emperor is within, not above the chutch.
Calvin teaches that there is but one only head Institut. li. 4. ca. 6. sect.

of the church, which is Christ: that the name does only agree to him, that
in that name he can have no substitute upon earth. Where if yt be said / that
he mente that off the Pope over all churches: althowgh the disputation be
directed against the Pope: yet his reasons are general / and prove that no
man may usurp that title. But to clear that matter / in an other place he

shows / that it is to much to attribute unto a King the name of the head
of the church: and that they are blasphemous, that give him yt Now where he
says here / and repeteth p 301. that in respect off the supreme authority
which god has given unto the magistrate, he may be called the head off the
church: the supreme authority over the church / being only given unto
Christ: yt must follow that this name only belongs to him.

Where partly in this diuis. but more fully page 301. he says / althowgh in
respect of life, and nutriment given, and spiritual blessings powered into
the body off the church, our Savior Christ is only head: yet towching the
external society, and owtward government, the magistrate Pigh. hierar.

Diuis 3. page 300.
also may be head off the church: yt is first to be noted from whom this
provision was browghte him. For as Harding borrowed yt off Pighius: so the D.
pourueiers had it from Harding / or from both. For to overthrow this doctrine
that Christ alone is head of his church / this distinction is browghte / that
according to the inward influence off grace / Christ only is head: but
according to the owtward government / the being of head is commen with him to
others. For answer whereunto / I refer my self in part to that I have written
before / off the absurd distinction between the government off the church by
the mynisterie off men / instituted off our Sau. Christ / and his spiritual
gouernmente. For that if there be no head but Christ / in respect of the
spiritual gouernemente: there is no head but he in respect of the word /
sacraments / and discipline administered by those whom he has appoincted.
forasmuch as that is also his spiritual gouernmente. And even in the owtward
society / and assemblies off the church / where one or two are gathered in his
name / either for hearing off the word / or for prayer / or any other church
exercise / our Savior Christ being in the myddeste off them as mediator /
must needs be there as head: and if he be there not idle / but doing the
office off the head fully: yt follows that even in the owtwarde society /
and meetinges off the church / no simple man can be called the head off it.
Seeing that our Savior Christ doing the whole office off the head him self
alone: leaves nothing to men / by doing wheroff they may obtain that title.
Wherefore whosoever in seeking to profit the church according to his calling /
does any thing to the preservation off this body: he does yt as an eye / an
arm / an ear / or as some other member / and not a^ head off it.

Now to his distinction out off Andreas. who after he confesses that Christ
is only head / as he governs the church with Page 18^.
his spirit: adds / that for somuche as the church off God being visible /
is not only ruled by the word / but by sword off the magistrate / that there
be so many heads off the church / as rulers off countries. Where first let it
be observed / that he quoteth no place: peradventure lest some either words /
or circumstance might give the answer. Then that he enhaunceth his credit
whith the title off a learned man: where for any thing I have redd (and I have
redd his defense off the real presence against Beza) yt might well have been
left owte. Howbeit both for his corruption in judgment / and otherwise: I
refer the learned reader / to that Vrsinus a learned man has written against
him. Whereby he may understand how this commendation was without discretion /
only to serve the present turn. And I beseech you Sir / who is this
Vergerius whom Andreas reprehendeth: which you have so nakedly set down /
clothing Andrue so gorgiously? This is is good reader Petrus Paulus Vergerius /
with whom whether the other be once to be compared / either for sownd knowledge
/ or innocence off life / I leave to their judgment which have redd / and
known them both: and withal whether if an argument of authority be off such
weighte as the D. will have yt / he has by this testimony made a hole in his
own cawse.

In the distinction yt is first to be observed / that as Andrue dissenteth
from the truth: so he does from Pighius / Harding / and the D. for when he
opposes the government by the sword / unto that off the word / making yt off
the word a piece off the spiritual government / and then says that there be
diverse heads off the church in respect off government by the sword: he
gives to understand that his Judgment is / that in respect off the
ecclesiastical mynisterie / our Savior Christ is only head. Which may yet
better appear in that he says / there are so many heads / as rulers of
countries: and says not so many heads as bishops off churches. And if this be
not his mind: yt will stand the D. upon / to bring out other words to
declare yt. Now Pigh. Hard. and the D. upon the bare word off Athanasius /
will have heads in respect off the ecclesiastical government: pa 30^.
they one over all churches / he one in every diocese. Wherein the reader may
see / that if this rotten seed take rooting / howsoever the Princes honor be
pretended / the fruiete pertains also to the bishops. In which distinction
off bishop head off his / but not of the whole church: albeit the D. would
gladly seem to slip from the Papists / yet they will not so part with him.
For beside that I have showed how the godly learned / upon that our Sau.
Christ is head / conclude as well against heads of particular churches / as
against one head off the universal: this Judgment off his is the deuinitie
off two Popish Councels / Constance / and Basile. Where the Bishops (those
especially before partners in this robbery off our Savior Christ with the man
off Rome / and namely he off Antyoche) displeased that the Pope alone should
have all that boutye: to make Room for them selves / shut his headship up in
the compass off his own country: opening their eyes to so much trwth / as
served their own tournes.

But to come to the poinct off Andrues distinction: let yt be considered first
that our Savior Christ is in one respect creator / and preserver of man kind
/ in another redemer / and vpholdder of his church. For he created once / and
preserves daily as God coequal with his Father / and holy spirit: but he both
redeemed once / and daily gathers his church / as mediator of god and man. in
which respect even yet in his infynite glory he enjoys / he is / an shall be
under his father / and holy ghost: until having put down all rule / and power
/ he shall render the kingdom to his 1. Cor. 1^, 24.
Father. Secondly yt is to be considered / that as our Savior Christ does
these in dyners respects: so he does them by diverse means. To wit that as God
symply he has ordained certain means / to serve his providence in the
perseruation of man kind: so as God and man / he has ordained other certain
/ for the gathering / and keeping off his church. These grounds laid / yt is to
be considered / whether the exercise off the sword by the magistrate / come
from our Savior Christ preserver off man kind / wherein he is coequal to his
father: or as mediator off his church / wherein he is inferior. Where
forasmuch as our Savior Christ's kingdom was not of this world / and that
against horrible disorders in his church / punishable by the sword / he did
not (one extraordinary whipping excepted) draw yt: and considering that this
lawful ordinance off God / is not only in the church / but withowt: yt is
manifest that our Savior Christ in respect off his mediatourship toward us
/ exercises not the cyuill sword. For in that he said his kingdom was not off
this world / he made an opposition not unto the wicked off the world / as
other some times but unto Cesars authority / which was the ordinance of God /
whereto he was falsely charged to have made claim. And in that he drew not the
sword against open disorders / it argues that that was without the compass off
his vocation: otherwise he would never have suffered the glory of God / to have
been trodden under feet. And in that the authority off the sword in heathen
princes (althowgh not a like used) is the same ordinance off God that in
Christian: the one proceeding off God immediately / and not from our Gauiour Christ
as mediator / the other does likewise. But why should we wrestle further in
this poincte with Andrue? seeing the D. which builds of his authority / in
confessing that the magistrate is ordained off God immediately / stands with
us that he is not ordained off our Savior Christ / in respect that he is
mediator between God and us. heruppon follows that the office off the cyuill
magistrate is properly one off those means / which serves the Lords
providence in the preservation off man kind. Now if the cyuill magistrate
should be the head off the church: he must be an under / and subordinat head
off Christ. Consydering that the lord has committed the government off the
church / unto our Savior Christ / and that otherwise there should be two
heads off yt / wheroff one were not under another: which is absurd. But he is
not an under / and subordinate head off Christ / consydering that his
authority comes from God symply / and immediately / even as our Savior
Christ's: and therefore not the head off the church.

To this disputation pertains that which the D. else where Diuis. 19. Page

in synuateth / off the Magistrate comprised, albeit not expressed in the 12.
1. Corinthians. under the word gouernementes: but in an other treatise more
plainly. in the first place to hale in the Archbishop / in the second to thrust
out the elders: which notwithstanding is easily refuted by the same place. for
if the cyuill magistrate should be comprehended under that word off
government / and be one off the officers off the church there mentioned: yt
should follow that he should be an under officer / not only to the Apostles /
but also to Prophets / and Doctors. For S. Paul puts these as the
principallest mynisteries in the church: as the degres off first, second, and
third declare. But I think the D. will not make him under officer to all
these: therefore he is not comprehended under that division / but is of an other
sort off officers. Secondly yt should follow / that Christian magistrates were
in that time / yt being granted that the offices there reckned / were already
in the church. But the D. says / that there were then no Christian
magistrates: yt follows therefore by his own words / that the magistrate
could nether be expressed / nor contained in those words. if yt be said that
althowgh the D. say there were none / yet I / and the trwth yt self say
otherwise: I answer that all the gifts / and offices there reckned / were not
only then / but were then most plentiful. Considering therefore that the
Christian magistrate / was then a gift more rare then at other times after: yt
can not be that he is comprehended under that words Upon all which yt falls
/ that the Magistrate is head off the church as Andreas says / in respect off
that he exercises the sword. Likewise it goes to ground which the D. puts
/ that by the same reason the magistrate is head off the comme^ wealth next
under God, he may be also head off the church. Which is a gross peticion of
the principle / being nothing but the contrary off that I set down.

That owte off Chrysostom / that certain weomen were head off the church off
Philippos, will not serve: considering that he speaks not off any cheifdome
in power / or authority / but off excellency (...)
in godliness / and zeal. And the greek word he uses signifying also a sum /
needs not to be taken in signification off head: but that Chrysostom. meaning
was / that in those weome^ / there was as it were a sum off the church / in
whose godly virtues / a man might behold the estate off the whole. Nay yt can
not but with great violence there signify a head / for then he should have
said / they were heads of the church: and not head. And if it should: yet yt
must be understood / that head there is to say the chief off the weomen off
that church: which is nothing to purpose. for I am sure yt was not Chrysostom.
mind to prefer them to the Bishopes / etc. The cavil also that the
magistrate being but a member off the church, is not thereby barred from being
head: is unworthy answer / In def. Apol. part. 6* cap. 4. Diuis. 2. Daniel 10.
13. Colos. 1. 16.
seeing yt is manifest off what members I spoke: and the Bishop off Salsbury
speaks even in the same words.

If yt be said / that the magistrates honor is touched here: I answer that
then the Angels them selves are dishonored / which having government of
kingdoms / and nations / add also of the churches which they serve: have not /
nor owght as I have showed to have / the title off head off the church. Nay
those which go abowte to gratify Princes / with the spoil off our Savior
Christ / are found dishonorers of them: as those which leave the^ no place in
the church of Christ. for if the magistrate be head of the church of Christ /
which is within his domynio^ the^ he is none of yt. For all that church makes
the body of Christ / and every one of the church fulfilleth the place of one
member of the body. So that he that is not of the body / can have no place in
the church. if yt be further said that he has injury / considering that he
brings such singular comfort / and profit unto the church / establishing the
pureness off religion / overthrowing the corruptions / repressing sin /
crowning virtue: beside the weight of glory which attends for good Princes in
the life to come / and that they are honored with most honorable names / which
owght more then content the most excellent servants off God / which are but
simple creatures: yt must be also considered / that as the godly magistrate
being head of the common wealth / brings singular commodity unto the church:
so do the godly pastors / which be the church officers / bring singular
fruict unto the comme^ wealth. For whilst they conquer by the word / riote /
adultry / covetousness / pride / idleness / etc. whereby diseases / beggary /
translations off inheritance from the right heirs / needles dearthes /
seditions / rebellions (whereoff every one is an engine able to pull down the
commen wealth): they may be well called the horse / and chariot of the common
wealth. But yet as the pastors can not therefore be said / officers of the
comme^ wealth: no more can the magistrate / which by vertwe of his civil
office gives singular assistance unto the church / be called properly the
church officer. If (as I see) it like some to call magistrates a kind of
officers in the church / because they being members / by public calling Bez.
confess ca. 5. artic. 23.
procure the quiet theroff: they which are disposed may so speak / I will not
strive. But why I esteem the title off head of the church / not to agree unto
any simple creature / etherin heaven / or earth / I have showed my reasons /
let the church Judge.

The question is not whether the name of Archbishop is / but whether it owght

church / draw such credit / the putting down of it in all other churches
throwghowt Christendom / must needs bring great prejudice. But it is lawful:
therein is the question. Which althowgh he has often affirmed: yet we are come
to an end of the decisio^ of this question by the scriptures / and no word
browght to confirm it. Wherein either he is little beholding to his cawse / which
will minister him nothing to say: or his cawse to him which leaves it thus
destitute. For althowgh the reasons against yt should be insufficie^t: yet if
he would have this title continue in the church / he should have by showing the
lawfullnes of it out of the word / both persuaded those which have an evil
opinion of it / and confirmed them which waver. For the sixth diuis. let the
Judgment be the readers. Before I come unto the 7. I will for the cause
alleged in the beginning off this treatise / take in here the residue off the
20. off S. Math.

Yowr trans^ation the kings off the Gentiles, whereby you would page 62.
prone that he puts not a difference between the cyuil / and ecclesiastical
power / is faulty: as that which withowt necessity / goes from the proper
signification off the word. For it signifies (...) Genesis 10. 31. 32. Deuteronomy. 32.
28. Psalm. 43. 1. Math. 28. 19. Act. 10. 35. Luke 7. 5.
naturally / not the Gentiles / but symply any nation / in which signification
yt is taken often in the old / and new testament: and not only when the
Israelites are joined together with other nations / but even when the holy ghost
speaks of the Jews a part / he calls them by the same word here used.
Therefore it appears / that there is nether any such meaning of the
Eua^gelistes: and if there were / yet he gains nothing. For it is easy to
answer that he therefore makes mention off the Princes off the Gentiles /
forasmuch as there was no King / nor sovereign civil principality amongst
the Jews. Wheruppon our Savior was compelled / to take example off princely
authority from the Gentiles. And if there were any small fragments of cyuill
government in the Jews hands: yt was the high priests / and other
ecclesiastical persons. Which beside that yt was bastard / and degenerate from
the institution off God: it was both more ambitiously sowght (as may appear by
the ecclesiastical stories) and more tyranically administered / as appears in
scriptures / then any the most disordered Act. 4. 3. and 5. 1. etc. and 9. 1. 2.
government amongst the Heathen. So that if our Savior would have set forth
a patron off ambition / and tyranny in government: he needed not have sowght it
amongst the Gentiles / when he had it at home.

Yt may be said further / that he taking his example off the cyuill dominion
off the Gentills / would thereby pull out off the peoples heads / that fond
opinion amongst them / and the rest off Jews: that they at the coming off
the Messiah / should be Emperors off all the world / and all the Gentills be
their subjects. Especially considering this petition off the sons off Zebedy
/ was grounded off that idlephansie. And if need required / it were not hard
to bring examples off diverse Kings / and principal magistrates amongst the
Gentiles / which both came unto their government modestly / and used yt with
all equity / and commodity off the subjects; as off the contrary part diverse
off the Kings amongst the Jews / whose entry has not been so honest / nor
government so easy. upon which consyderations it may appear / that there was
an other reason off making mention of the Gentiles Math. 6. then in this place.
Last off all / there is nothing answered to the example off our Savior Christ
/ which does manifestly ouethrow the D. interpretation. For when as it is
certain / that examples are browght to explane the rules which go before /
and in the example our Savior Christ opposes mynistring unto others / to this
to be ministered unto by others: it must needs follow / that the place which
went before / must be understood simply of domynion / and not tyrannical
domynion. for if the example had been sitting unto M. D. meaning: he should
have said / as I came not tirannically to be ministered unto / or ambitiously
to desire it / but modestly to rule.

The distinction also of the Magistrate / and off the minister / wherein the
weight of this cawse lies / is not towched. This division off domynion, is
altogether idle. for it is plain that when I say the cyuill Magistrate is
severed by bearing domynion / from the ecclesiastical person: I meant lawful.
and when as I deny / that the ecclesiastical person can exercise any domynion
at all: what place is there left to this division? for what dominion soever he
had proved / to have been lawful for an ecclesiastical person / had been
suffycient overthrow of that I set down. And as the division is superfluous:
so yt is unskillful. For the two first parts / the rule with oppression, and
the rule described 1. Sam. 8. be all one: and the last member comprehends all
that go before. And so it is not only no good division / but no division a^
all. Nether is he any happier in applying off it. for where my second
proposition was / that the ecclesiastical person is severed from the cyuill by
bearing domynion: he says / that is true in the two first significations.
Whereby must follow / that either yt is lawful for the cyuill magistrate to
rule with oppression / or else for the Bishop. For if it be lawful for nether
of them: the^ one is not severed from the other / in those kinds off domynion.
The last section off the 62. page / etc. perteining altogether unto the
question off Bishopes bearing cyuill offices. I will put over unto the proper
place. Here the question is only / what belongs to the mynister in respect
off his ecclesiastical ministry.

The authority off man in Gods cawse / weighs no further then weight is given
by reason. Therefore you should not prejudice the exposition of this place / by
Bucers Judgment: especially / considering it has counterpois / of other as
learned. Howbeit although Bucer followed an other interpretacio^ the^ we: yet
yt shall appear he me^t nothing less / the^ thereby to approve any of this
stately Lordlines used of our bishops / and that he is in this cawse ours. As
for his interpretacio^ / for my part although I confess that Princes in
providing for the peoples under them / do after a sort serve them: yet I deny
that our S. Christ meant to note here / Princes duties in their government. And
first the circumstance of the place does confute yt. For when as the disciples
gaping after worldly rule / depended of the opinion conceived / that our S.
Christ should be a great king upon earth: it is apparent that his answer / that
he came to be a minister and to serve, was to overthrow that phantasye of
theirs. as if he should say / you look to be Lords under me / and I my self
came not to be a lord / or Prince: wherefore yowr desire of rule under me / is
in vain. And if this be the natural sense of those words: then yt is
manifest / that this word of ministering / being opposed unto the state of a
Prince / this sentence can by no means agree unto civil magistrates.

Further / when he calls his disciples to the imitacion of his service / and
ministry (him self being a minister of the gospelly: it is clear / that he
speaks of such a ministry / as can not agree unto the civil magistrate.
This may yet better appear / by the adiointes / or cleauinges knit unto the
mynistery: which being such as can not agree to the cyuill Magistrate / it
follows that these words can not be understood off both gouernementes. For
our S. Christ in his mynistry / did not only serve unto others / but was as a
servant: and did not only minister / but was as a minister / that is to say
carried the face / and countenance of a servant / in apparel / in diet / in
obedience unto the cyuill Magistrate. Whereunto the Apostle has regard / when
he says / that our Savior took the shape / and form off a servant. But
Princes althowgh they serve Philip. 2. 7.
the profit off their peoples: yet they nether carye / nether is it meet they
should carry / the form / and shape off servants / either in apparel / or
diet / or any part off cyuill behavior* but contrariwise it stands with the
ordinance off God / that they should have some owtward mark off excellency /
above the rest.

Moreover in that our Savior Christ / declares that the cheiftye of the
disciples shall never be so great in the church / but that the highest shall
be servant unto the rest: it must needs be that he means an other kind off
service / then can agree unto the cyuill Magistrate. For although he be called
a minister, and Rom 13. 4. 6. (...) Act. 13. 36 (...) 2. Corin. 45. Psalm 2. 11.
and 18. 1.
public officer of God for the profit of the people / and it be said that
David did minister unto the age vvherin he lived: yet that the holy ghost does
ever call them servants off their people / as he says here his disciples
shall be / it can not be showed. for this word servant / which our Savior
Christ attributes unto his disciples / and S. Paul used in saying that he was
the Corinthians servant, signifies a lower / and more humble kind off service
then the other: and is never attributed (as I think) unto the civil
Magistrate in respect off his subjects / but only in respect off his
subjection unto the Lord. Whereupon follows / that for so much as our Savior
Christ speaks here / of a more humble service then can fall into the Majesty
of the cyuill Magistrate toward his people. this place can not be
understood off the cyuill government.

That in the end has also force / that whereas the Evangelists speaking off
principality / and greatness which the Magistrate has over his subjects / use
with full consent the word Prince: when they come to describe the superiority
/ and greatness which (...).
our Saui. Christ will have in his mynisters / they also with full consent
abstain from it / being proper (as I have showed) to the Magistrate: and set
in place theroff a leader, a word off less authority / (...) Heb 13 7.
and by thapostle ascribed unto mynisters. Where if he had meant in that later
part / to have described the duty off the cyuill magistrate: he would by all
likelihood have kept the same word / saying / whosoever amongst you shall be
Prince / shall be as yowr servant. Therefore yt is evident / that our Savior
meant this sentence off the ministry off the word / and not of Magistrates.

I know well you say this place is fitly alleged against the Pope, Diuis 2.
page 64.
and that in words you thrust him far away / whom in deed you cawse to
approach. But forasmuch as yowr words serving against the Pope / yowr reasons
are for him: and that his person being changed / his cawse is still defended:
it behooved me to look / not so much at yowr defiance in words / as at that
maintenance which the course off yowr disputation brings unto him. And let it
be now considered / whether yowr tongue being with the Bishop / yowr hand be not
with Harding. He to prove that the Pope may exercise both civil / and
ecclesiastical jurisdiction / In the def. off the Apol. part 6. c. 11. diuis.

brings forth the example of Moses both priest, and Prince. The Bishop to
confute that / alleges this text off S. Matthew. which if it put not a
difference between the office of a Prince / and off a minister (as you say it
does not): then has the Bishop answered nothing. For the question is not there
/ whether the Pope may tyran^ously / or ambitiously either seek after / or
exercise cyuill jurisdiction: but whether he may exercise any at all. Nether is
the question / whether the Pope may exercise that authority as a thing
belonging unto him self / or of the grant off Princes. For then his rule
should be avouched good in some times / when the Emperors have willingly
submitted them selves / with their scepters unto the pleasure off Popes. As for
his reigning in men's consciences, it peteineth not to this place. So that if
the D. answer be good: then this place which the Bishop alleges / makes
nothing against the Popes civil sword / provided that he seek it not, and
that he have it of the kings grant. Which how contrary it is to the Bishops
meaning / may easily appear by that which follows.

If therefore he agree with the bishop (as he says): he must allow Defens.
Apol. ib.
off these words off Cyprian / Christ by several duties, and distinct honors,
has here set a difference between both the powers. And then does Bucers
authority fail him: who thincketh that those offices are not distinguished in
those words (it shall not be so with you). and then also is he goen from
his strongest hold / that our Savior Christ, did only discern between the
affections: when as it is said / that he discerned between the offices.
Moreover then must he allow off Bernardes saying: yt is plain that temporal
domynion is forbidden the Apostles, now therefore thou being Pope how dare
thou vsurp either the Apostleship being a prince, or the Princehood, being
successor off the Apostle? doubtless from the one off them thou art forbidden,
etc. And if he allow off this: then falls he from his conning distinction /
off having it ambitiously, and by election. For considering that Bernarde says
/ he is forbidden it / and speaks not there against the abuse / but against
the use off dominion in a bishop: it follows that domynion nether falls
into a bishop / in that he is a bishop: nor can be received off him / being
offered off the cyuill Magistrate. The reader therefore may see / that the
exposition you follow off this place / does quite overthrow the bishops answer
/ and opens the Papists mouth which he had stopped.

takes away all dominion off one over an other. This reason I having answered
before / was unneedful to be here repeated. so remains for him to prove /
that if our Savior Christ had meant to take away all domynion off the Apostles,
one over an other: then he would have said, no man owght to be great amongst
you, and that there was no other way to give out this sense but this. The
second concludes / that our Savior had no meaning to take away superiors
amongst Christians, nothing to this question. For no man denies / but there
owght to be superiors. As for that he interlaceth off Peter^ cheifty: it is
answered afterward.

The similitudes he uses / can not win his superiority off one minister over
an other. For as for heavenly bodies, althowgh one off them be more excellent
then an other: yet they exercise no dominion one over an other. Therefore if it
prove any thing: it proves that excellency off gifts amongst ecclesiastical
persons / does not lift them up in authority / and commandment one over an
other: but only makes a difference in order / and comelines. Which we have
showed in the beginning to be in ecclesiastical mynistery: where we willingly
receive order / opposed to confusion: refusing domynion opposed unto
subjection. For the heavenly spirits. what will you allege to prove / that
they have domynion one over an other? The place of the Ephesians / thrones,
domynions, principalities, povvres? if you do: it is boldier then Augustine
durst do. But if they be superior one to an other: that superiority is
Enchi. 58 ca.
answered in the church by superiority off mynisters over the people. If they
be severed in orders one from an other: that is not denied to be in officers
off the church. If they exercise domynion one over an other: that is expressed
in commen wealths. So that if the Answ. were able to prove all these / which
will be hard for him withowt Denyses dreams: yet he may see they conclude not
a domynion / off one minister over an other. The third reason likewise /
concludes not against this cawse: and to these two reasons I answered at large.
Which if the Ans. would have taken away: he owght to have showed / that there
can be no superiority of one over an other in the church / onles one minister
be superior to another. but that he passes slily by / and picketh a quarrel
unto the examples.

To his exception against the first example / that there is inequality
amongst servants: I answer there is none / but by the masters express
appointement. And therefore if he will have advantage theroff: he must prove
that it is the Lords ordinance / that one minister should rule over an other.
beside that / it is enough to maintain mine answer / off equality off
servants in a family / that it is so for the most part: and when my meaning
was of servants left in one / and the same order / yt is out off time to
allege this example. Secondly the inequality there made / is not of one
steward over an other / but over the family which he ministers unto: and
therefore this similitude makes to show / that one minister is not ruler over
an other / but every minister ruler off his flock. Thirdly that similitude off
government off the steward, Math. 24. being propounded as a picture to set
forth the rule off ministers over their flocks: declares not only how there
owght no government to be erected in the church / but by commaundment off God:
but also how far it owght to be from that absolute domynion / or lordly pomp /
which the Answ. would bring in. which Musc. a great man with the D. declares /
when he says: He speaks after the commen faschion: for this was the office
of the principal servant, to give every man his diet: he was not Upon 24.
Math.
appointed to be lord off others.

As for his exception against my other example / of equality off brethren: the
inequality which the scripture makes between the elder brother, and the rest,
is nothing les then any rule / or authority to command them: but only a
reverence which the younger owght to bear to the elder / which we willingly
grant amongst the ministry / that the younger men give place to the gray
hears off the elder. The Other preeminence off having two parts off the goods,
wheroff the younger brethren had but one / is no matter off inequality in
authority / whereof only we speak: wherein also we will not deny / but one
minister according to his charge off children / may have greater portion then
other. And both these exceptions are not taken against my allegation so much /
as against the godly writers off our time. Which to prove the equality of
authority off the bishop off Rome / with other bishops: have alleged that they
called one an other brethren, that they were fellovv servants.

Dominion here forbidden (says the Ans.) is not of one minister over an other,
but over the people: wherein he is greatly deceived. For our Sau. Christ
speaking to his 12. disciples according to S. Math. says whosoever shall be
great amongst you, shall be yovvr minister, and whosoever amongst you
shall be first, shall be yovvr servant: restreining their service off each off
them / unto the residue off their fellows. Again the circumstance in S. Math.
and Marck / that the other ten disdained at the two brethren, and which S.
Luke expresses / that the contention was amongst the 12. which off them
might seem to be greatest: do manifestly overthrow that saying. For if they
had not desired to be above the residue off their fellows: there had been no
cawse off disdaigne. And the strife was not / what government they should use
over the people: but which amongst them selves should be greatest. Whereupon
onles we will say / that our Saui. Christ laid his plaster beside the sore /
and spoke from the purpose off that the cawse required: yt must be confessed /
that this domynion forbidden / is in respect off one minister over an other.

Whereby him that sits at the table, he would have the people understood:
he is grossly ouerseen. for so by the testimony off our S. Christ / the people
should be greater then he him self: seeing he affirms / that he which sits
is greater then he which vvaiteth. For noting the dignity off a minister / by
that usually annexed unto masters / to sit at the table while their servants
wait: he teaches that for so much as he their master / to whom it apperteined
to sit / and be waited upon / was unto them rather as a servant waiting / then
a master sitting at the table: much more they being fellows / should serve
one an other. Where you charge me for not truly translating the greek word: I
appele to the masters (...).
off that tongue / whether I have followed the natural etimol^gie. Where you ad
that it signifies the chief ruler, or guide in every business: I acknowledge
you for no Lexicon / and being in controversy / it owght to have been proved.
Stephen does affirm that In this Thesau.
they which translate it a prince, have no ground that he can tell off. What
cheifty S. Peter had amongst theresidue off the Apostles / shall be considered
in a more fit place: it shall be sufficient here to have noted / that the Ans.
exposition off the word / first is the same with Hardinges: and my exposition
which he here confuteth / alone with the bishops which he confirms by good
arguments / where he denies that S. Peter was Prince of the Artic 4. diuis.
31.
Apostles / or Lord over them / or had power / or dominion over them. Then it
overthrows Musculus. For where he says that Peter was found in many places
to have been chief amongst the rest: the D. by this exposition / makes him
chief symply in all places. Thus it may appear / that yowr cawse finds small
harting at Musc. hand.

You say my exposition is contrary to the truth, and judgment off the learned:
but you show only that it agrees not with certain Diuis. 4. page 69.
interpreters judgment / that the truth is otherwise / you show not. If you
had showed the first / that it is contrary to the truth: the second had been
needles. I propounded that doubtfully / and although that signification of the
preposition has good warrant out of the use off that tongue: yet I will not
stand at the arms and / with so learned interpreters for it. Howbeit when I
give place / yet S. Luke may not give back: who using the simple verbes withowt
the preposition / makes manifest that there is no peruersenes / or deformity
off government noted. for if he should mean to set forth a peruersenes / or
deformity off government / and having so many words to do it with / yet did
not: I can not see how he should have been void off some fault. Where you say
he must be expounded by the other Evangelists: that can by no means be
admitted. For it comes often to pass in the greek tongue / that compound
verbes are put for simples: but that simples have a compound signification /
the use off that tongue will not suffer. For the use off the word in the Acts,
and S. Peter: beside that it is not strange for one word in scripture / to be
taken diversely: that place makes nothing to prove this signification. For what
word soever S. Luke had used in the Acts: yet for so much as that action came
from those unclean spirits / it must needs be disordered. Therefore the
peruersenes off it / does not appear in the word / but in the subject from
whence it came.

And if a man would make that word to signify a deformity / becawse that rule
was beyond measure: by the same reason the words Prince / Rule / Power / names
off lawful authority / should be condemned: For that a scribed unto Devils /
Ioh. 14. 30. 6. Ephesians. 12. (...).
they are allwaies tyrannical. And Beza also here alleged / in that place
says / the word notes not any dominion there, but only that they gat the
upper hand of those exorcistes: which when it may be taken as well in good part
/ as in the evil: the Answ. can by no means help him self therewith. For
that off Saint Peter / where he says it is manifest that it signifies violent
dominion: I grant that that rule which it signifies / is violent in a Pastor
/ but that which is violent in him over his flock / is moderate / and lawful in
a Prince over his subjects. and so S. Peter kept the same distinction off
government off the civil Magistrate / and the Minister / which he had learned
off our Savior Christ. For if he meant by that word / a dominion simply
tirannicall: he would have opposed yt unto a moderate dominion / not as he did
unto being an example off the flock. As if he should say / you must not bear
dominion over yowr flocks as Princes / which with diverse notes of their
magnificence get authority over their subjects: but you not having these means
/ to get reverence and authority amongst yowr flocks / must so much the more
enforce yowr selves / to all commendable example off life.

Whereunto agrees that which Saint Paul vvriteth unto Timothe: whom he
exhorts to keep up his authority in the 1. Tim. 4. 12.
church / and deliver him self from contempt which his yowth was subject
unto / by being a patron off good vvorckes unto his church. And Beza in that
place / saying by those words care, and no kingdom is committed unto
Mynisters, and that by that place yt appears, that Pastors may not bear rule
over their flocks, after the manner off kings: does sufficiently declare /
that the word does not signify simply a tirannicall dominion / but one such as
agreing unto kings / is notwithstanding unsitting for Pastors. For he says
kingdom / and Kings: not Tyranny / nor Tyrants / which he owght to have
said / if he would have confirmed yowr interpretation. Beside that Stephen
puts both the simple / and compound to In his These.
signify one thing: that is / a simple dominion withowt any such tail off
tyranny / as is here imagined.

You may deny if you will that the snow is white. By (all these places) must
needs be understood those which Musc. off whom you speak / does interpret:
but yowr self had said In 1. diui. off this chap.
before / that he expounds those three off S. Math. Marck / and Luke:
therefore although you added not three, yet that must needs be understood.
And in this yowr shift you break yowr grammers head: seeing Aristotle teaches
that the number of three, is the least number that this word all can be
verifyed off. Lib. 1. de coelo 1. c.
Where you said Christ did not say no man shall be great amongst the^: my
answer was that he had said that before, and needed not to repete it, whereunto
you answer nothing. The place I alleged out of S. Luke / overthrows yowr
answer. For if by these words whosoever will be great, desire off dominion
had been only found fault with: then he would not have spoken simply /
whosoever amongst you, withowt adding any thing off ambition / or desire to
rule: and to this you answer nothing / but cover yowr self only with Musc.
authority. For where you say / you spoke as the words be* you understand well
that they do not specify any ambition / which you must needs mean / or else
you maintain not yowr answer. Where you say, S. Lukes words make against me,
as which insinuate that there must be some great amongst them: you take it
otherwise then it is. For if you will not admit the interpretacion I alleged /
in referring this greatness unto excellency of gifts one above an other: nor
Call. interpretation sauoreth not in yowr taste, that it is as much as if our
Savior should say, yovvr greatness, excellency, and dignity shall be, in
submitting yovvr selves unto you brethren: yet you will not refuse Bucer /
whom you here build upon. which by great in this place / understands him
that is elder in age: and proves it by the word (...)
younger, opposed to him. And it is not unlike but one of those reasons /
whereby some off those disciples would have grounded their principality over
other their fellows / was for that they were auncienter in years. Which
soever of these expositions you admit: you see that to be great here /
signifies nothing les / then any dominion off one minister over another.

First the Ans. says / that I go about to prove that our Savior Diuis. 5.
Page 70.
Christ does not reprove thambition off his disciples: which is a manifest
untruth. For I say that he does reprove it / and give also larger place to the
reproof off their ambition / then he. for where he would have it to consist
only in that they ambitiously desired to rule over their fellows: I affirm
that he did not only take them up for that / but also that they desired to
rule one over an other / which was not lawful. Secondly he says / I have
falsified his words, in that I father off him that our Savior reprehended
only thambition of his disciples. which I do not / for my words ascribe
unto him that he said / they were reproved not only for desire off rule /
but for rule to oppress. Then to maintein this quarrel / he affirms he
said / our Savior reproves the tirannicall rule off kings off the Gentills:
as thowgh that made any thing to prove / that he did in his disciples only
reprove ambition. For reproof of oppression in kings: was not part off
reprehension off the disciples.

Moreover he could not be ignorant by the course off disputation / that when
I said / if ambition only were reprehended in the disciples: I meant that, if
our S. Christ had forbidden his disciples ambitious desire off rule one over an
other, and not rule it self: which does manifestly towch the cawse. Thus partly
with a manifest untruth / partly with a trifling cauil / which (if it were
true) makes nether whoat / nor kold: it seems he would have cast a mist
before his readers eyes / that he should not see him give the slip from my
first argument in this diuis. For unto this reason / that in that sense off the
place which he sets down, the answer off our Savior Christ should not
have benefit: considering the Disciples might have replied, that he forbad
tyrannical rule of their inferiors, but they desired moderate, and well
ruled government: he answers not a word. To his answer unto the second
reason / that they are called bountiful, which have no sparck of bountifulnes:
I reply that althowgh that may sometimes come to pass / yet it should have
been out of time / to have made mention of it here in that sense. For if as you
say / our Savior speak here against the tirannie, and ambition of Princes:
then it was out off place to make mention off the flattery off their subjects
/ which call them by the title off bountiful. For that is rather the fault off
the subjects / then off the Princes. If you say that they desire that title:
first the words off S. Luke do not bear it out: for he says they are called
gracious Lords / and not they desire to be so called. Then it being a thing
not simply unlawful / for a Prince to desire to be called / and counted
bountiful / to this end that by that fame men might be more serviceable:
althowgh it should be granted to you / that S. Luke meant that they desire that
title: yet forasmuch as there is no stain off ambition / or tirannie in that
desire / you are still behind with yowr answer.

For yowr example off the Pope called most holiest, etc. yt is nothing like.
For men deceived by error / call him so: and althowgh they say untruly / yet
they speak as they thinck / which can not be in this case, considering that no
man can be abused by a false opinion off his bountifulnes / which not only
gives not / but is an oppressor. And although as there are found which knowing
the wickedness off the Pope / call him notwithstanding most holy: so there be
which knowing the illiberalitie off their Princes / call them notwithstanding
bountiful: yet you should have considered / that S. Luke speaks not here /
how Princes are called off certain particular persons: but by what titles they
are called generally / of all their subjects. So that if you would have spoke
to purpose / you should have showed / that it is a common thing for tyrants /
to be called generally of their subjects whom they pill / bountiful: and that
which is harder for you to do / that men will call ministers bountiful /
which give nothing. Otherwise the interpretation which you imagine / has no
place.

To my third reason / that it is not to be thovvght off all the Apostles, that
they desired rule one over another, to the end they might use cruelty, and
oppression over their fellows: he answers not a word. It may be as I have
showed / gathered off the scripture / which is not expressed in it: else how
take you upon you to set down / that the 10. were as ambitious in disdayning,
as the 2. were in desiring, seeing that is not expressed? If I be deceived, in
thincking that those greek words be all one: I am deceived with the (...)
Hesychius.
Grecians / for so I have red. And if yowr authority were any in this case /
yet it is suspected: and therefore needed better proof / then yowr bare word.
and albeit it were true / that the one has sometime a more larger use, then
the other: yet hereit appears / that the indignation off these Apostles was
such / as Aristotle defines the other word by: that is / conceived off an
opinion they had, that those (...).
two were not worthy to rule over them.

The words off our Savior Christ in the 20. of S. Math. etc. are spoken unto
the 12. only / whom he had set apart for the Chap. 24 Diuis. 1. Page 72.
ministry off the gospel: but his words S. Math. 23. are spoken not only
unto them / but unto the commen people. Wheruppon it follows / that our
Savior ioining the people with his disciples / in the dehortations which he
makes here: could not as in the other place / where he speaks unto them
alone / speak off the proper listes / and bounds of the ministry: and
therefore there is no cause why M. should be glad, that I agree with him in
the exposition off Math. 23. Further / Math. 20. making comparison between the
12. disciples / and Princes: here so far as towcheth the disciples / he makes
comparison between them / and other ecclesiastical ministers. There being
therefore things in the state off a commendable Prince / which agree not unto
the ministry of the gospel: it follows that he may be well thowght / there
not only to have forbidden the disciples ambition / damnable in both estates:
but also those things / which being commendable in Princes / agree not unto
them. Off the other side / all things commendable in the Pharisees ministry
Ecclesiastical / agreing likewise to theirs: it follows of necessity / that
there he must needs speak against ambition only. Unto the next diuis. being
reproaches / I answer not: only where he charge me with falsehood, becawse
I affirm he says / the book off commen prayer is a perfect rule to govern
the church off England by / where nothing is wanting / or to much: I answer
that there be not the same words / but when there is nothing he will
acknowledge to be off the order of the book / which he mainteineth not / and
refuses to have added things which have their ground off the word: I leave
to the reader to judge / whether although my words are with the fullest / yet
I am far from his meaning.

Now I return again to his 8 Tract. The Ans. skoffing upon my unskillfulness
in logic / says he can find nether head, nor foot Diuis. 7. page 303.
in my reason. Thus I will find both. They which deny the lawfulnes of John's
ministry / because there was no such ministry contained in the scriptures /
thowght no ministry lawful / not contained in them: but the Scribes / and
Levites did so: therefore they esteemed no ministry lawful / not contained in
scripture. Against this he takes exception / first to the translation / which
is altogether friuolus. for beside that both the words may bear that
signikication / and it is not unlike but by the article / the Evangelist meant
not some one singular Prophet / spoken of in the law beside the Messiah / but
rather any Prophet extraordinary / to whom the Lord showed him self / either by
vision / or dream: Nom. 12. 6.
the interpretation which he cites out of Beza / alters not the argument /
but rather strenghtheneth it / noting thereby that it was necessary not only
to have the function off a Prophet: but off one which was especially noted /
and marked out by the scripture. Secondly where he says / that if they had
asked John whether he had been a Prophet, he would not have denied it, and
adds for proof theroff / our Savior Christ said he was one: he is abused.
for our Savior saying that he was greater then a prophet, and that the Math.
11. ^. 13.
Prophets endured until John's coming, denies that he was a Prophet / and
makes his ministry a mean function between the function of a Prophet / and
ministry off the gospel: more excellent then the first / and inferior to the
other. If he would have had a coulor off his defense / he should rather have
cited his fathers saying of him / which calls him the Prophet of the highest:
1. Luke 76.
but that could not have served the turn nether / For that the word is there
taken generally / for those which teach the will off God: which is often as
has been showed.

Yowr third exception / that all the functions are not reckened up, becawse
they ask him not whether he was a Priest, or Leuite: is as vain as the rest
for therefore they ask him not / becawse he tawght not being consecrated unto
any of them / according to the ecclesiastical order provided in that behalf:
and that was one occasion off this embassadge unto John. Last off all / where
in the margent he says / that the Pharisees made false arguments, and that I
do the same: he speaks unadvisedly. for howsoever there was otherwise great
ignorance in them: yet that their reason was good herin / it appears by that
S. John to prove his ministry lawful / browght testimony theroff out off
the scripture: and for that our 1. Ioh. 23. Mat. 21. 25
Savior Christ / meaning to confirm the ministry off John / asks whether
it were from heaven / or off men. In which words condemning all ministeries
which men institute / and that come not from heaven: he confirms the Parises
argument / which was that John exercising a mynisterie not ordained by the
law / should have been gilty of breach of the law / if he could not have showed
some extraordinary vocation. Thus appears that there was both bead, and
foot in this argument: and that by all likelihood true / which he could not
impugn but by untruth. The 8. and 9. diuis. which follow / have (as commonly
the rest) nothing but bare sayings: which becawse I shall meet withal again
/ I will here pass over* only in the eight yt is to be noted / that he
says it is servile to tie the church off Christ to the patron off the Jews
Synagoge. Wherein either he says nothing / or he would have understood more /
then he dare veter. For if he mean that the church of Christ may not be in all
ordinances / and ceremonies comfortable to that off the Jews: it makes
nothing to the purpose. but if he mean that the church has now more liberty
in adding ministeries / then the Jews had / as his answer to that I set down
does require: then I see no cawse why he should not have so said. But that
although he would say / yet he durst not: and therefore spa^^ thus vncertenly /
that when I should show the contrary: he in this general speech / might have
some corner to hide him in.

Seeing I must needs prove that the crow is black / that is Diuis 10. page 304.
to say / tharchbishoprick a new ministry / thus yt is proved. That which
has diverse efficient cawses / is an other / and diverse: but there are diverse
efficient cawses off the ministry off tharchbishop / and those expressed in
the word off God. That there are diverse efficient cawses / is manifest: for
that the office off Bishop / Elder / and Deacon being by God him self / the
office off tharchbishop / was devised / and browght in by man. And although
this be proof enough / to them that have their senses exercised in the holy
scripture / where in the ministry oftentimes they are called strangers /
which have not their offices limited by the Nomb. 18 4.
prescript off Gods word: yet that it may appear how little modesty there is
in this strong denial / I will ad others. Whereas a Bishop may be ordained by
two / or three other Bishops: tharchbishop must be ordained by all the Bishops
off the province / either present / or at the least consenting. Now seeing the
ordination is off the form off their ministry / and these formal causes be
diverse: yt follows that these offices must needs be diverse. And that the
substantial / and essential form of a Bishop / is differente from that off
tharchbishop / yt is plain also by that they are members off one division /
and therefore off necessity differ in the substantial form: as a man
differs from a brute beast / not in circumstance / but in that he is off an
other nature. And when the D. grants the effects / and worckes off
tharchbishop / to be diverse from those off the Bishop / the one ruling /
the other obeing / and that by oath given and taken: it seems very strange /
that he should deny that it is a new / and diverse office from those appointed
in the scripture.

Furthermore / when as the subjects off the Bishop / and Archbishop be diverse
/ where about they be occupied / the one having one church / or to speak
according to his sense / one Diocese / the other a whole province: still it must
fall out / that they are diverse offices. Last off all / forasmuch as offices in
the scripture / are perpetual / and thoffice off an Archbishop may be taken
away by men (by his own confession): yt must follow / that they be diverse
offices. And if he look when I should conclude a new minis^^^e: beside that yt
is all new which is strange / and strange which is not commanded by the word
of God: yt coming as shall appear some hundredth years after the Apostles
times / whose only authority is able to make the gray hears / and antiquity
of a thing be reuere^ced: it follows that this word new / if. he nourish any
mystery in it / is also truly verified of the ministry of tharchbishop.

Timothe, and Tite, shall never be proved to have had any such authority over
the rest / and if they had / yet yt falls not on tharchbishops side: seeing
they were no Bishops / but Evangelists / as has appeared. When the church
appointed one Bishop to rule over all Ministers, Elders, and Deacons in the
same church: yt did appoint a new ministry. and all these reasons almost /
before browght against the newnes off tharchbishops functions / return upon
the head of that institution. And if there be any hold in the Ans. word / he
has otherwhere affirmed / that thoffice off a Bishop is superior unto the
office off a Pastor. if so / it is not the same. But why dare not the D. page
137.
as well confess / that the church may erect a new mynisterie? seeing he
affirms flatly as much in effect, for to prove an Archbishop / he alleges /
that beside those in the scripture / the church may appoint both names / and
offices. now I would gladly know / first whether when the church appoints an
office / that was never before a new office / or no? and then whether a new
office be a new mynysterye? And yff to erect up an office which was never / be
to erect a new office / and a new office be a new mynysterie: it must follow
that the church in erecting an other office / then is set forth in scripture /
erecteth a new ministry. The Ans. is afraied to confess a new ministry /
and not afraied to confess a new office: off which superstition I would gladly
understand some reason. Now where he would have the care off our Savior over
his church in time off the gospel, to consist in that he has set down the
doctrine more plainly in all poinctes, then under the law: this being a
doctrine off salvation under the law / that there should be ministers in the
church: yt follows by his own saying / that he has set yt down more
plainly in all points now / then under the law. Therefore also this point / how
many orders / and degrees off ministry owght to be / considering that that
was precisely defined in the law / is more narrowly bounded in the gospel. Thus
he defending more in deed / then in words he dare set down: is almost at
continual battle with himself / and has scarce at any time his proofs /
and propositions of one measure.

But that I follow not the chase off words / leaving his meaning / where (...)
any light footing of it to be found: that which he would say / and wherewith his
purpose is vpholden / can not stand: that albeit our Savior has tawght the
doctrine more plainly now, then under the law: yet it follows not that he
has performed that in the government off the church. If this be his meaning
as I said / there is great injury done unto the church / great dishonor unto
our Savior Christ. For he having at all times done the office / not only off
a Doctor in teaching / but also off a king in prescribing the manner / and
form off government unto yt: howmuch soever he is said to have done less /
in appointing the outward government off his church now / then under the law:
so much is both he robbed off that part off his kingly office / which God his
heavenly Father anointed him unto / and the church spoiled of the fruict which
should come unto her thereby. Yt is therefore a most certain doctrine / that in
all things perteining to the kingdom of heaven / whether in matter off
doctrine / or government / the Lord has in as great specialtie marcked them
out / as either before / or under the law. In cyuill matters / and things
perteining to this present life / he has I grant used a greater
particularytie with them / then amongst us / framing laws according to the
quality of that people / and coontrey: wherein the leaving of us at greater
liberty / is so far from proving the like liberty in things perteining to
the kingdom off heaven / that they rather prove a streighter bond. For even as
when the Lord would have his favor more appear by temporal blessings off
this life toward the people under the law / then toward us / he gave also
polityke laws most exactly / whereby they might both most easily come into /
and most steadfastly remain in possessyon off those earthly benfites: even so
at this time / wherein he would not have his favor so much esteemed by those
owtward commodities / is required that as his care in prescribing laws for
that purpose / has somewhat fallen in leaving them to men's co^sultations /
which may be deceived: so his care for conduit / and government of the life to
come / should (if it were possible) rise / in leaving less to the order off
men / then in times past.

And the D. should either have cut off quite / that part off the Kingly office
off Christ / which consists in owtward government off his church: or else
have let yt had the full course. Now when he grants that beside the doctrine
off salvation / he entered into the description off outward government off the
church (saying beside the doctrine he ordained there should be not only fit
ministers to publish it, but officers to govern the people in godliness) as if
in beginning off that description he declared his care over his church / and
not ^^ making an end off it: he signifies that he declared less care. For if
to describe the three offices of government / Bishop / Deacon / and Elder /
were an argument off his love / and care toward his church: had not also the
adding to off the fourth (if any were) been a token off the same? But if as the
Ans. would make us believe / the Lord declared his great care, and love more
toward his church, in leaving that office at her arbitrament: then yt should
also follow / that in appointing no more but the Deacon / and Elder which
governs only / yea in appointing no officer at all / he should have showed
him self more careful / and loving. Which if yt be absurd: that he says
whereof this follows / is not to be admitted.

Again whereas he grants that our Savior Christ has gone throwgh with the
doctrine: I would ask off him why in that point he has made so clean worck?
Whatsoever he answer here / and what cawses soever he assign: he can not deny
but one cawse is / the blindness of men to see / and their perverseness of
judgment in things perteining to the kingdom off heaven. Which if it be true:
then I would gladly know off him / how they come to be so egleeyed / in the
matter off discipline / and government / which are such bussardes in the sight
off the doctrine? and how their eyes be opened here / which were shut there? As
if we were in less peril off error / in inuenting the Discipline off the
church: then we should have been in devising the doctrine. or as thowgh it were
an easier matter / to find a rule whereby the whole church jointly, then whereby
every one in his several / might be directed.

And if part of this government / and order being propounded / part also is
left out: why rather were not the greater offices / and off more weight
expressed / leaving the smaller to the stamp off man's head? for who knows not
but it is harder / to institute a ministry for the government off a whole
province / then for a company comprised within the territoire of a furlong? to
institute a ministry for government / and commandment of both people / and
Bishops too / then for the people only? So that off the two virtues required
in all sufficient dispensation / faithfulness / and wisdom / and which were
both most fully in our S. Christ: by the Ans. account / there was nether. For
in that he is made to have described some part off the government / and not
all: he is argued of unfaithfulness. in that he is made to have propounded the
les / and easier / leaving out greater / and more difficult: his wisdom is
reproched.

Nether may the D. thinck here to escape / with the distinction in 4. diu. off
this chap.
off external things variable by circumstances / which else where he
alleges. For first I have showed that yt is most untrue / that all external
things be variable. The^ he must remember / that he making his Archbishops
office to begin in the Apostles times / has drawn out his continuance unto
this time: all which he has (as he yet does) accounted off him as a head
pillar of the church off God. Now if he be such a profitable officer / both in
the purest time off the church / and the corrupt, both in persequution / and
peace / under a Christian Magistrate / and under a Tyra^t: yt is clear that
this is an office not variable by circumstance off times / but which our
Savior Christ / and his Apostles might have as well established in perpetuity
/ as he did any off those unchangeable ministeries / Bishops / Deacons / etc.

In calling yt a servile tie, to have the whole government at the prescript
off Gods word: he forgets that the greatest liberty / and freedom off
Christians is / to serve the Lord according to his revealed will / and in all
things to hang upon his mouth. But that he adds (yt is to be tied unto the
lettre, as in the law) first is Papisticall / and Anabaptisticall: proceeding
from a gross oversight / and want of understanding off the Apostles meaning /
when he speaks of the lettre of the law. For whereas the Apostle sets
against the lettre of the law / that is to say / the bare commandment Romans 7.
6
do this, etc. the worcking off the spirit given by promise / whereby the law
in part is obtained off us / and made healthful which otherwise brings
death: the Answ. with the Papists / and Anabaptists / opposes the lettre
unto that not written / nor commanded in scripture. When in that sense which
he takes lettre (if there were any such) we are as straightly / and precisely
bound unto the lettre / as ever were the Jews.

The examples brought as exceptions / against the certain / and commanded
mynisterie / are such for the most part / as might seem to have been brought /
to set the D. cawse in the mockery and lawghter of all men. For yt is well
known / that the name off a Scribe: was no name off any certain order, and
particular kind off ministry: but a general name given unto the skillful in
the law of God. For although we read of some to whom yt is given / which beside
the ordinary function wrote something: yet yt may be easily 1. Chron. 24. 6.
showed / that they had that name not off writing / but rather becawse they
were expert in the law off God written. Which as yt may be proved by diverse
autorities off the scripture: so yt does by Math. 13. 52.
the authority off our Savior Christ manifestly appear. And when our Savior
speaking off the times of the gospel / says he will send Scribes, and yet
never heard tell off that there was any certain order / or particular function
off Scribes under the gospel: Math. 23. 34.
yt is clear that under title off Scribe / there was never understood any
several degree off ministry. The same is to be aswered unto the name of
Doctor of law: that yt was a general name where with they were named / which
were learned / or taken for learned in the law of God. Which may appear for
that whom S. Math. calls a a lawier / or Doctor of the law / S. Marck 22. 35.
12. 28.
calls a Scribe.

To change the Capitain off the Temple into an Ecclesiastical officer, needs
a very strong exorcisme. The Temple of Jerusalem being the strongest place in
the whole city / and by reason off the height commanding the whole city
round about / was by all likelihood taken of the Romans to be their fort / or
Cytadell. Considering that Herod had also builded a fort there / called
Antonia: where Calu. up 4. Act.
they placing their garrisons / did the easelier / and with greater security /
hold the Jews in that bondage / which they sought at every occasion to shake
off. Herunto lead the profane minds of the Romans / which beside the safety
they sowght that ways / took pleasure also in profaning the temple off the
Lord: ad also the practice off our days / which may serve for confirmacion
hereof. But howsoever the matter be / this appears plainly / that that office
was not ecclesiastical / but both a cyuill / and warlike function. For when S.
John beside the servants off the Scribes / 28. John 3
and high priests / makes mention off a band off men: yt may appear that as
the servants / and ministers belonged unto the high Priests / and Scribes: so
the band belonged unto those Capitaines off the temple / and that they were
there as those which had the charge off the band.

The same may yet appear further / by that where he laying hold off certain
off the Apostles / put them in prison: after they 4. Act. 1.
came out they confirmed them selves against their threats / by that the fame
thing was happened unto them / which was propheceyed of by David / and wheroff
our Savior had experience: in that both Jews / and Gentiles / and both powers
cyuill / and ecclesiastical rose up against him. Whereby it is clear / they
had regard to the owtrage which they suffered / both off the Priests / and
Scribes Jews: and of the Capitain off the temple a Gentill. As for the chief
of the Sinagoge: they are the same which be called Elders / and Ancients off
the church in reformed churches / wheroff in every Synagoge / and assembly off
the Jews / there was some nombre (as shall in place appear) called chief /
not for that they had over the mynisters / but becawse they had the government
off the people. Whether the Seniors off the people, were before the restoring
off the captivity of Babylon, shall appear in place not to be much material.

Yt is a certain reason which is drawn from the figures / to Diuis. 11. etc.
page 305. etc. 7. Act 44 Heb. 8. 5.
the things figured / in this sort. for if they were not like unto them they
shadow forth: they should be no figures. I apply not particularly the parts of
the Arck / to the parts of the church: but compare generally the building off
the one / with the other. Which point also. S. Stephen / and the Apostle to the
Hebrews do likewise press. Therefore thalledging off Calvin / against
thapplication off every part thereof unto the church / is idle. The exceptions
are to small purpose. For when I ask what: I deny not but some things might
have been left. for if he had would he might have known / that as the Lord
advanced his glory toward his church / and approached unto men by knowledge of
him selff: so he did more precisely / and particularly set forth all things /
perteining to the church / and government thereof: and that therefore under the
gospel / wherein he has opened the threasures of knowledge / yt must follow
that he left things more clear / and certain then before. Yet I will towch
the vanity off his exceptions.

For pinnes, and nails: I would ask him how he can make a cofer without them /
especially for the water. And therefore if he had prepared bordes / etc. and not
set them together / I thinck he had not obeyed the voice of God. and it is
as much as if he should say / that he was not bidden to take a nedle into his
hand / which is bidden to sew. Whether the windows were off glass, or
Crystal made not to purpose: so that they gave a clear light (which the
word Moses uses signified) it was enough. Howsoever you were misled by certain
expositours / the cover mentioned Genesis 8. Genesis 6. cap. 16.
is cmmaunded in the making off the Ark / where the Lord also prescribes yt
should be a cubit above the Ark: very fit to shut the waters / that they should
not fall continually upon the Ark. The ouerseer, and master off this work,
could be no other then Noa: at whose prescript yt was to be done / and which
was to answer if any thing had been done otherwise then the commandment. The
Raven, and dove sent forth, were not things belonging to the building off the
Ark: and yet as meat / and drink they are commanded him / for so much as they
perteined to preservation off his life / which the Lord had given him in charge.

That out of Pellicane, and again and again out off Calvin, are such as
granted / conclude not against this cawse. That the learned writers say, God
charged the Jews with ceremonies of his own, that they should have no leisure
to use any other: they never use it to prove that there is more liberty to the
church now / then in times past / to devise any thing: but it is their buckler
which they hold out against the Papists / who by example of that church /
would lode this now with such a multitude off ceremonies. Therefore he^ does not
in this allegory follow their authority: but rather clean contrary / walks
herin in the Papists steps. Which where they are pressed / by this so
diligent prescript off all things by the word of God in the old people:
answer as the D. that that was done for the rudenes off that people / and
because they were but children / and that it were injury to the church off
Christ / to shut her up so short as that was. Where he concludes of them /
that there was only expressed what should be done in the worship off God, and
not in external policy: first there be no such words wheruppon he may pull
in that (and not in the external policy). And in deed it is not to distinguish
/ but to pull in pieces. for what whorship off God can there be in the
assemblies of Christian me^ / withowt the ministry of the word / withowt
external policy / withowt administration of Sacraments / without praying
openly / and with owtward sound? all which are external. When Calvin calls
yt spiritual worship, his meaning is nothingles / then to oppose spiritual to
all external / done with mouth / and other partee of the body: but he calls
it spiritual / by comparison off the worship of God under the law / which
consisted in corporal washinges / cleansinges apparel / etc. and this is that
which either abuses him: or wherewith he would abuse other.

And although no singular parts off the Tabernacle / or Temple themselves
should set forth unto us / the external policy of the churches: yet when not
only they be described / but yt is prescribed how many kind of officers there
should be / and what every one should do: that might suffice to prove / that
if he will needs separate the worship off God / from thexternall policy: yet
as the Lord set forth the one / so he left nothing vndescribed in the other.
Towching the alteration made by Solomon, and David in sorting the Ministers off
the Temple, and other things (an other of the Papists reasons / to prove that
they may ordein things / beside the 1. Chron. 24. 19. 2. Chron. 29. 25.
prescript off the word): yt is answered in the same chap. the Ans. alleges /
where yt is said / that all that was done by commandment of God. And in an
other place is set forth / that those were instituted by commandment of David
/ which had commandment off God / browght by the hands off Gad the seer /
and of Nathan the Prophet. But seeing the Ans. will not accord with me in this
point / of appointing things under the law: let him at least bear him self
speak in his former book. God in the old law, Page ^^^.
prescribed unto his people perfect, and absolute laws, not only moral, and
judicial, but ceremonial: nether was there the least thing to be done in the
church, omitted in the law. Let him show how this will agree with that here
in the tenth / and 13. diuis. I have showed that it is one thing to be
contained / an other to be expressed in scripture. Therefore if yowr cawse have
no better hold then that: it must go to the ground.

I have showed how this answer / of leaving things to the order Diuis. 14.
Page 307.
off the church, varied by circumstance, etc. can not stand in the Archbishops
case / nor ordinary government of the church. The argument is not off lykes,
or payres, but of the smaller unto the great. And although it should be true /
that you say / that the Lord loved the church then as well as he does now: yet
the reason is still of the les unto the great. For if he did so particularly
describe the offices / not of Math. 11. 11. 2. Cor. 3.
such excellency / and weight as the offices / and mynisteries of the
gospel: yt must follow / that he has much more used that dyligence / in
particular description of the mynisteries hereof. If the 4. off John, mean
that our Savior should tell all things necessary to salvation: then the
Mynisterie with the degrees theroff / being necessary / and vvithowt the
which the Lord does not ordinarily give any salvation at all / yt is clear
that he has also declared all Romans 10. 14.
degrees thereoff. That out off Saint John 20. is spoken of the miracles our
Savior did / not off his doctrine: and is thrust in by strong hands in this
place. The chief amongst the rest off the Mynisters / I might well with S.
Paul / call the pillars: and therefore if the Lord should have made no mention
off the Archbishops / they keeping such a place as they do: yt is truly said
/ that the pillars should have been forgotten. If the Magistrate were an
officer of the church / and not of the commen wealth: there are many places in
scripture both old / and new / that describe his office / and all that
pertains to him at large. Whereof if the Ans. can bring but one for his
Archbishop: this controversy is at an end. Here be many (we knows) whereof
some are not indebate: and those which be / have no causes annexed with them
/ vvherby other might come to knowledge off them / as well as he. Yt is
therefore enough to have mentioned mine answer / without staying in confutation
of all those things / which he at all adventures throws out / to make up an
answer.

He says it is dangerous to say, that the ministeries owght not to be Diuis.
15. page 307.
retained, withowt which the church is fully builded: becawse the Magistrate is
thereby shut forth, as well as the Archbishop. Our question is / what
ecclesiastical ministeries are sufficient: the mention therefore off the civil
Magistrate / is absurd. Also it is too great either oversight / or peruersenes /
not to understand that an universal rule / is not to be racked to every thing:
but is true off those things / vvheroff it is given. Beside that / hereby at
unawares he confesses / that the church may be fully builded, and accomplished
withowt a Christian Magistrate: which is against that he says / the magistrate
is the head of the church. His exception (that there is no perfection off
unity off the church / by reason off good / and bad mingled) first is nothing
to this question: secondly yt is a quarrel not against me / but S Paul whose
words I used. Thirdly as the ministeries off the word Ephesians. 4. 13. 1. Timot.
4. 16.
are said to save / and bring us to the kingdom off heaven / becawse they
give both entrance / and advancement thereunto / although we come not to full
possession off them / so long as we being in this life / need them still: so
they are well said / to bring us to perfection of unity / because having
begun to knit us together here / they follow still with new increases / until
we come to perfection in the life to come. As for that there must be offices,
as well to preserve, and keep the perfection off unity, as to build yt, and
bring it thereunto: beside that for shift off answer / he is driven as yt were
with one breath / to affirm that he denied before / off the perfection of
unity: he must understand / that the church is always in building / as long
at it is here upon earth / and always in knitting. Therefore if those offices
be sufficent to build / and knit: they are perfectly sufficient. and if
tharchbishops office be to keep the church builded / and knit yt is manifest
we may spare him here / and that his service must then begin / when all other
ministries take end. The next diuis has for answer (according to the D.
coustome) only that which I preue^ting answered afterwad: saving that he
adds as an exception / that there be Apostles which there reckened / are
notwithstanding by us shut out from the present estate off this church. as if
he understood not that in the founding of the church / these may be necessary /
which afterward are not: which also being entreated off in an other place /
needs not here to be repeated.

Yt is Calu. which reasons of the place of the Ephesia^s / that Diuis. 17.
page 308.
for so much as the Apostle says / that the church is fully builded withowt a
Pope: therefore there owght to be no Pope. and how slenderly soever he seems
to the Ans. to have reasoned: yet shall yt appear by the vanity of his
exceptio^s against it / coming afterward to be discussed / that yt is weighty.
But where he says / albeit the argument be good against the Pope, yet yt is
not so against the archbishop: onles he can exempt him by miracle / or teach us
some other Logic then has hitherto been heard off / the reason includes him
as well as the Pope. For if it be granted that the Popes office is therefore
unprofitable to the church / becawse S. Paul made no mention off it in the
ministeries requisite for the building theroff there being like wise no mention
off the office off an Archbishop / yt must theruppon follow / that tharchbishop
also is unprofitable. if there be the same cawse: there must follow the same
effect. The reason added / off the Pope doing things which tharchbishop does
not, claiming things which tharchbishop claims not, etc. has no place at
all. for the question is not off the abuse / and tyranny off the Pope: but
whether as it is unprofitable that one should govern all the churches in the
world / so yt be also that he should govern all in a whole province. And by
the D. answer the office off Pastors should be unlawful / if they challenge
unto them selves things unlawful: and the Popes office good / and lawful /
if he bearing rule over all churches / would abstain from those / and such
like chalenges which the Ans. sets down. The contrary wheroff is true. For
as the Pastors office can by no owtrage of him that exercises it / be made
unlawful: so the usage of dominion off one over all / be yt never so moderate
/ and qualified can never be lawful. Last of all / the Archbishop him self /
if he should challenge those things in his province / which the Pope chalengeth
over the world / should be by this reason as unlawful an officer as the Pope.
Therefore this difference between the Archbishop / and Pope / being accidental
/ and not towching the nature off the government wheroff we have to enquire /
is vnstilfully alleged. Yet it is the hole wheru^to the Ans. is compelled
diverse times to have his recourse. That the ministry is a matter of salvation
/ that tharchbishop is a new ministry / that it is absurd here to fly to
thexample off the Magistrate / where the question is what Ecclesiastical
offices are profitable: is before declared.

The Ans. conclusion off my reply / touching the place to the Ephesians. is evil
shut up. For where he says that tharchbishoprick Diuis. 18. page 309.
may stand, becawse that place reckening up only the ministeries of the word,
that is a ministry off order, and policy: how could he forget / that
tharchbishop medleth with the ministry of the word? and therefore it was
necessary to be here mentioned / if the Apostle had given him any place in the
church. If he will say / that he has not only the mynisterie off the word /
but off order also: the answer is at hand / that so had both the Apostles by
his own confession / and all the rest off those ministeries / as appears
afterward. Whether therefore tharchbishop be considered in his ministry of the
word / or as together with that he holds the reigns off government / or as
one of the most principal ministeries of the church: either he has his place
here to the Ephesians. or not a^ all. For both all ministeries off the word (to
speak as the D.) separate from government / and order / and all occupied in
the word / and government jointly / and all principal ministeries of off the
church / are here reckened up. Every one then off these three cawses being
sufficient / to have made mention of tharchbishop: all together put a
necessity upon the Apostle to speak off him / if he had been worth the
speaking off.

Where he thincketh there was no cause to speak off him, for that he differs
not from a bishop in ministry off the word, but in order, and government
only, and that therefore yt is no diverse ministry from the bishops office: by
the same reason I may say / that S. Paul needed not to have mentioned Pastors /
etc. For the Pastors preached the word / as the Apostles. But if this one
difference alhough there were no more / make the ministry of Apostles / and
pastors diverse / that the one has charge off one only church / the other off
a^ry^ must follow / that the ministry off an archbishop is diverse from the
bishops / the one watching over a whole province / the other over a diocese only.
Yea it is plain off that spoken before off the Archbishops new ministry /
that there are as many / or more things whereby he differs from a bishop: then
any of these ministeries S. Paul reckeneth up / differ one from an other. His
answer to the place off the Corinth. consists in that he would prove / that
the division off offices there, is perfect. Wherein it it easy to see what
extremity my reply (which he calls a vain shift) drove him unto: and how he
could not cover his nakedness here / but with discovering an other place as
unseemly as this. For amongst his answers to the place off the Ephesians. whereby
he would prove / that that division is not perfect / this was one in the latin
pamphlet / that to the Corinth. S. Paul speaks off Apostles, Prophets, and
Doctors, leaving out Evangelists, and Pastors: and now to avoid my reply to
that answer / he says / clean contrary / that the Apostle made there a
perfect division of offices. But let us see whether this change be for the
better.

Where he says / Saint Paul did more perfectly divide to the Corinth. then to
the Ephesians. he is deceived. For even by his own confession / he speaking there
of preaching offices only / not off all offices off the church / and there
being none other preaching offices / but those which he reckeneth up: yt
follows that he made there a perfect division. In the place to the Corinth.
that there is no perfect division / although the D. words he changed / yet
his reason he used stands still: that the Evangelist is not there mentioned,
nor Pastor, which were offices in the church. Beside that he keeps in this
refutatio^ his old wont: which is to cut the knot / and not to lose yt. For he
brings reasons of his to prove the perfection of the division / withowt
answering mine. And yet his be such / as are vnwothy answer. For in the first /
beside that yt is untrue / that the Apostle made a perfect division of gifts
in the church: if he had / yet it follows not that he made the same in
offices / especially when he will needs separate offices from gifts. The second
reason (therefore yt is a perfect division, because there is added first,
second, third) is as simple as the first. for those words are not put there to
note the no^bre of offices / but to declare which is highest in degree / and
which next / etc. and if they did: yet I never could yet read / that they were
notes off a perfect division. His third (because yt has more members then that
in the Ephes^.) I think he understands by this time what strenght yt has: if
he remember that which I answered / that the Apostles meaning to the Ephesians. was /
not to divide the offices of the church in general / but those only which
handle the word. onles par adventure he thinck / that he makes a fuller
partition / which deuideth both the hands into eight fingers / then which
denideth one into five. Martyrs authority does not help him. For he says not
that he reckeneth all the parts of the church particularly / or how many it
has / which he should have said to help him: but only that he reckeneth up
what members the church has / which he does that reherseth some.

Whether a bishop be contained under a Pastor / or rather a Diuis. 19. Page 310.
Pastor under a bishop: shall not now be the question. But you are inconstant
in all yowr ways / and have one sentence standing / an other sitting. For
albeit I should agree with you / that a bishop is a Pastor: yet you do not
agree with yowr self. For otherwere in stretching out the Bishops arms / you
have these words: a bishop is both superior in office, and gifts unto a
Pastor. If he be so / he can not be contained under him: for that which
contains page 137.
an other thing / has at the least all in it self / which the contained has.
Again if I grant a bishop contained under the Pastor S. Paul speaks of: yet
I will not grant that the bishop you mean (which having so many churches to
rule / has never a one where he does the office off a bishop) is contained
under S. Paul's Pastor. For seeing his foundation is laid in Ieromes bishop /
proved before / and after / not to be of the institution of God / but off man:
yt can not be / that our kind of bishop should be comprehended under S.
Paul's Pastor. Wheruppon also follows / that tharchbishop which has a
necessary relation to that kind off bishop / and can not stand withowt him:
is not by any means contained under S. Paul's Pastor. The proofs of yowr
division of bishops into archbishops / and those called by the commen name of
bishops / are as doubtful as that wherefore they are brought.

To prove that the office off an Archbishop was in S. Paul's time / although
the name were not / is brought the word Consubstantiall* which being the commen
hook off the Papists / to (...).
pull in their vnwritte^ verities / owght to serve the reader for a watch word
/ that tharbishops office needing this physic / is sick off the same disease.
And for the word it self / although it be lawful / and very convenient / and
the council off Syrme did not well in yealding unto the Arrians to the
displacing of it: yet yt is not necessary / as withowt which the doctrine off
the truth off the divinity off our Savior Christ / can not be maintained. For
to say so / were to accuse the holy writers / S. John especially: which
debating that cawse against the heretics of his time / Cerinthus / Ebion /
etc. did never use it. But what is this unto the Archbishop? let us have but
one testimony out off the word off God off the office off an Archbishop / for
the infinite testimonies off the divinity of the son of God: and then this
example may help you. And although the word Consubstantiall were not in S.
Paul's time: Yet words off the same weight were. If you can show therefore
words of the same value with Archbishop / although you show not this / yt
shall be sufficient: if you can not / then this example makes against you.
Here also is further to be observed / that this answer off the D. off the
office of the archbishop being in the Apostles time / although the name was not
/ is the armor wherewith the Popes title of universal bishop is maintained.
Diuis. 1. art. 4.
For this is Hardinges answer to the bishop / that although the name of
universal bishop / was not at the first given to the Pope: yet the authority
was. After he flies to his old refuge of the Prince / and there seeks cover
for the Archbishop: asking whether he shall have no authority in the church,
becawse he was not in S. Paul's time. Although S. Paul had said that our
Savior Christ had given princes unto his church immediately after his ascension
/ as he bears us in hand he gave archbishops: either they must have had
authority then / or never after. So keeping yowr similitude / if our Savior
gave Archbishops when he ascended / and in S. Paul's time: either they must have
had their authority then / or never after. And the case is nothing like. for if
there were no Christian Princes in the Apostles times / they being needful for
preservation off the churches: the cawse was that it was not in the Apostles
power / to ordein Christian Princes. But it was in their power to have provided
the churches off Archbishops / if they had been needful: and therefore they had
been inexcusable for not appointing them / serving so greatly to the building
off the church / as we are borne in hand.

Moreover the comparison is most unfitly made: seeing the cyuill magistrate is a
perpetual office for all times / persons / places: whereas by his own
confession / the Archbisop is temporal / and arbitrarie. Where also he asks
whether the civil Magistrate shall not have the chief authority in governing
the church, because there is no express mention off him in these two places: I
answer that the Princes authority is established in other places / so that it
may flourish withowt these. But the Archbishopric / seeing yt is an
ecclesiastical function / either must be planted by one off these places / or
die in the church considering that there is no ecclesiastical function / which
is not here set forth. Yowr collection off my words is evil bound together.
for how cleave these? Some offices instituted off God endured for a time,
therefore men may devise new offices. Where lies the strenght of yowr argument?
Whether in this that becawse God instituted offices for a time / therefore man
may: or in this that God did abrogate certain offices / therefore man may
institute? Which soever you say (as you must needs say one): the absurdity is
apparent. for in both the comparison is made / between the authority off God /
and thautoritie off man. Between whom how great distance there is: so great
difference is there between yowr argument / and a just conclusion. The clean
contrary is gathered rather. For as we reason against the Papists / that God
did not abrogate his own ceremonies / that men should thrust in others
considering that if he would have had ceremonies / he would have taken off his
own: so yt may be said / that God did not cut off his own ministeries / to
make place for others: and that if more ministeries off preaching / and
governing jointly had been necessary / beside Doctors / and Pastors: he would
rather have kept his own / then taken those which men devise.

Here all shifts / and coulors failing him / and not being once Diuis. 20. page

able to lift at this reason: he has changed my argument. For where I had
said yt forth in a plain hypotheticall Syllogism: he has altered yt. But I
will offer yt him again, if under Saint Paul's Pastor tharchbishop be
comprehended, then he is necessary, and commanded by the word off God: but
you say he is comprehended: therefore he is commanded and necessary. Which if
it be true: then you are fallen from yowr distinction / of things necessary
to salvation / and not necessary / off things arbitrarie / and commanded by
the word off God. But let us see now you have prepared the argument after yowr
own fashion / and as you thowght you could weld yt / how you deal with yt.
You say first this proposition (Pastors are necessary at all times) is
particular. verily the masters / by whom this should be judged / never tawght
that an indefinite proposition in a necessary matter / is particular. But
because you like not the form which I used / you shall have it after yowr own
in this sort. All S. Paul's Pastors are necessary: the Archbishop (as you say)
is one off S. Paul's Pastors: therefore he is necessary. Here if you deny the
first proposition: you have the whole council / and Senate almost of learned
men against you: affirming that those two / Pastor / and Doctor / are amongst
the rest perpetual offices. And if to be a perpetual office be verified off
the Pastor / which S Paul speaks of: then it must be verified off all
contained underneath / amongst whom you say the Archbishop is. Secondly the
Archbishop being made one off the gifts / which our Savior ascending sent
unto his church: if yt were in the power off the church either to establish / or
not to establish him: yt should be in her power to refuse the gifts off
Christ. which if it be absurd: that also must be wheroff this follows.
Thirdly if the Archbishop be necessary at any time (which must needs be if he
be comprehended under S. Paul's Pastor): then goes to the grownd his common
refuge / that his office may be instituted / or not / at the churches will.

Moreover if he say that it is necessary / and commanded a^ some time / and
not at others: what a miserable case is the church in / that has no certain
address out of the word / when that necessity and commandment begins /
and when it ends: when this office is in season / when out of season?
Lastly forasmuch as S. Paul speaks of offices the^ in the chuch / not of
those which came after (as the Ans. him self is forced to confess) the
Archbishops office must needs have been in the Apostles time. Which if it be
true: those times being (as the Answ. has borne In 2. Tractat.
us in hand) so unlike ours: the persons in the church then off so different
dispositions from those now / the place also / the gospel being the^ in the
East parts / where now it is in the West: it must needs follow that this
monely office off the archbishop / which ebbeth and flows / being fit for the
Apostles times / is by all likelihood unfit for ours. His distinction unto the
second proposition is / that an Archbishop in respect off the ministry off
the word, and Sacraments is necessary always: but not in respect of policy,
and government. Which is as much to say / as an archbishop when he is an
archbishop / is always necessary for the church. For when he has not the
owtward government / then by yowr own rule he is no archbishop: then which
speech what can be more absurd? And of this answer follows / that there is a
time when the Pastors have nothing to do with the external policy / and
government off the church / but only to administer the word / and Sacraments:
and then the church shall be an heap / and not a body / a confused multitude /
not an orderly society. Yet in the next section / he gives the government
off the church and order unto the bishops / and archbishops / and will have
them part the stake off the Apostles authority which they had in the church.
And as this answer is absurd: so yt is contrary to that he has set down in
his former book / that not only the office off the Archbishop is necessary,
page 351. Diuis. 1. Diuis. 21. page 311.
but most necessary.

I said before that the Apostle speaks to the Ephesians. off mynisteries which
have to do with preaching the word: but never added (as you in yowr Doctors
book / and here) and not those which have to do with order, and discipline.
Therefore I had nothing forgotten my self, if be would have understood that
which is plain to all the world. for these two may well stand together / the
Apostle spoke there only off functions conversant in the word: and the Lord
spoke of those functio^s which Preach the word, and administer the
government. for the word only / does not seclude government from those
ministries: but shutreth out all ministeries not preaching / as that off the
Elder / and Deacon. And yt is one thing to say / the Lord spoke there only off
preaching mynisteries: an other to say / he spoke there of ministries only
preaching: which (me thincketh) you could not be ignorant of. Therefore Saint
Paul reckening up the ministeries there / which have together with the
preaching of the word / the administration off government / and making no
mention off the Archbishop / supposed to have both: yt follows that you are
yet behind with yowr answer. I have not confuted my shadow, but yowr fond
fantasy. For if S. Paul speak in that place, of those that have the
ministry off the word, and Sacraments only, and not off those which have to
do with the order of discipline: yt follows that Apostles have nothing to
do with order / and discipline / for so much as they are amongst those / which
S. Paul there speaks of. If this cogitacion never entered into yowr head: how
comes it to pass / that yt is found in yowr papers?

Lastly you say the administration off discipline, and government in the
Apostles, is fallen upon the Archbishops, and bishops, the overthrow off my
whole assertion If a man will believe you speaking / he may: otherwise here is
nothing but I said yt. And surely yt must be a very simple hold / that is
cast down with this paper shot of bare affirmatio^. but if you will weigh a
little what you say: you shall see that if there be any bullet at al in this
yowr saying / yt is charged wholly upon yowr self. For before you have said
once / or twice that the office, and authority off an Archbishop was in the
Apostles times. Which if yt be true / how does the Archbishop receive his
auauritie off order / and government by their death? for having yt before / he
cannot receive yt by their departure. Either therefore this is untrue / that the
archbishop exercises the same authority which the Apostles: or that which you
said before / that the office off the Archbishop was in the Apostles time: or
else this third is true / that he having in the Apostles time / authority which
he has now: by their death obtained beside their former authority / that which
the Apostle had also. Which how near it pricketh at the papacye / I leave to
every one to consider. But if the Archbishop will succeed unto the
administration off order / and government off the Apostels: why shows he not
his evidence? why brings he not forth his records of bequest / off
resignation: that it may appear he is not entered as a trespasser.

In that sense which I have showed in an other place / I In 3. diui. Page 231.
Ad Euagr.
grant it true which Jerome says / that all bishops succeed unto the
Apostles: but show me who speaks any thing off the succession off the
archbishop unto them. Nay verily that is flat against the archbishops
authority. For if every bishop have that authority in his church / which the
Apostles had in all the world: it follows that there nether needs / nether
can be any archbishop to receive any theroff. And that if any archbishop
challenge a greater authority / then is in any one bishop: he pulls to him
self greater authority in his province / then ever the Apostles had in the
world. And by the same reason that they be Lords / and superiors over
bishops: they must be lords / and superiors in their province over the
Apostles them selves / if they were alive. Considering they rule over those /
which in their dioceses have the same authority that the Apostles had. This I
speak / not that I thinck the Bishops had not this authority / from the very
birth / and foundation off the function / as towching the government off their
churches / or that there came any authority unto them by the Apostles death /
which they had not in their times: but that yt may be understood / that if
there were any such succession unto the Apostles government / as the D.
phansieth: the bishops are the right beyres / and that not certain (other some
shut forth) but every one as Jerome says. Although if tharchbishop should have
an Apostolical authority in governing his province: it has appeared / and
more shall (God willing) that the Apostles government was far from that
principality / and rule one over an other / which tharchbishops challenge over
their under bishops. The next division I will not answer. The next unto that /
I report me to the reader / whether I have faithfully / and almost seruilely
bound my self unto his words / in translating these pieces of his latin
pa^phlet. For the next also / I having showed that you placing the Apostles
function in preaching / and ministering the Sacraments / not in government:
and assigning to tharchbishop both Administration off the word / and
Sacraments / and order and discipline / must needs lay greater weight upon
tharchbishop / then upon the Apostles: if you now revoke yt / I am glad.
Howbeit ashamed to speak it in so many words / even yet the course off this
treatise does breath nothing else.

This is no answer unto my reason. For if the church withowt Diuis. 25. Page
313.
the Archbishop / and Archdeacon / be a body consisting of all the parts /
comely knit together / wherein nothing wants / nor nothing is to much: then it
follows / that these offices bring nether ornement / nor accomplishement to
the church / but make only an unprofitable knob / and lump off flesh / to the
both disfuguring / and hinderance off the growght off the body. And the
ministry off order / and policy of the church / being one part off this
body: if it be not whole / and complete / but need to be peeced out with
archbishops / and Archdeacons: it must draw with it this absurdity / that
there being one member imperfect withowt them / the body also off Christ is
not perfect. And where it is said / that as in the Apostles times the church
was not perfect withowt them, and Prophets, etc. so it is not now, meaning
thereby (as both before / and after has appeared) that tharchbishops should
supply the room off the Apostles: I answer that the Argument holds not. For
considering that the perfection off the body / must be measured by the will
off him whose the body is / that is Christ: as when he gave Apostles /
Evangelists / etc. he made it appear that he would not have his body perfect
withowt them: so when he took them away from his church / he made it known
that the body was perfect withowt the^. If Apostles / and Evangelists had
been put down by authority of man: then yt might have helped you / that as men
put down Mynisteries / so they might supply them with other. But seeing they
were taken away by the Lord: this yowr reason in effect (becawse God takes
away, therefore men may administeries) has no strenght in it. And where all
this drift is / that you would have tharchbishops office come in for the
Apostles / and therefore say that their authority over the pastors does, and
must remain in such places, as there be churches: besides my former answer
unto this point / you are again taken in the words off yowr own lips. For
if it must remain: then the office off the archbishop which you make the
vessel to receive this authority in / and whose office (you say) consists in
the rule off other pastors, is not variable / and depending off circumstance
off time / etc. but perpetual / and constant.

If Bucer speak as you make him: I can by no means subscribe unto him. For S.
Luke says plainly / that there were many Act. 20. 28.
bishops at Ephesus: and gives the name off bishop to many. That the name off
bishop did properly remain in one off them, and improperly in the other / if it
have so good authority as the former / I will believe that too: if not / I
hold me unto the words off S. Luke. And if the name off bishop does
improperly belong unto those / whom Saint Paul says the holy ghost had
appointed bishops: over the church: I confess that I can not tell what
authority is sufficient / to make that name off bishop proper unto them. And if
the name off bishop did not properly belong unto them all / but unto one only:
yt follows that the name also of an Elder / did not properly belong unto
them. For the one of them is Act. 20. c. 17. v.
as well verified of them / as the other: and there is no more restreint off
the name off bishop then of an Elder / unto any one singular person amongst
them. And how is this sentence off Bucer here pulled in by the hear? for
albeit it were concluded / that one bishop should bear dominion over the
ministers of one church: yet yt follows not which is here in question / that
one also owght to rule over all bishops in a province. The rest is answered.

In deed I deny, but you affirm that there be still Apostles / Diuis. 26.
page 314
Prophets / etc. and therefore by yowr saying / that order which was then /
owght now also to be continued. And although yowr archbishop were under
gownde: yet order in ecclesiastical mynistries remains / that the teaching
Elders should be a degree above those which govern only / and they above the
Deacons. The marck I shoot at is certain / that is to confute yowr distinction
off Diuis. 27: page 314.
mynisteries off the word / and Sacraments only / and ministeries off
government / and order: and it seems I shot so nigh / that I have driven you
away from the marck. For you wander / and tell us of things that have nether
head / nor foot: and which if they were true / make nether whot / nor kold unto
this question. For if your learned interpreters, have well defined S. Paul's
rule (the Elders which rule are worthy) etc. when they say yt is to serve
Christ, and his church faithfully, in doctrine, and integrity off life etc:
then it must suffice yowr Archbishop to do so / and no more. For if you thinck
that every minister in his church / is barred by that definition from further
government / then which consists in preaching / administering the Sacraments
/ vncorrupt life / etc: it follows that he meddling with more then those /
breaks the bounds off good government. After you make an other rode out off
the question / bearing the reader in hand / that I would conclude out off that
place equality off ministers when as my purpose was as I have showed / to
confute yowr vain distinction. Which although you here deny: yet the print
off yowr hand is deeper / then you can wipe out by these so strong / but little
honest denials. For onles you refer this word only, to the secluding off the
ministeries mentioned to the Ephesians / from the government / and policy off
the church: yowr answer falls as is before declared. Considering that you
laboring to make a difference between those mynisteries / and the Archbishops
/ make none: if they together with administration off the word / and
Sacraments / handle also order / and government. And although you had quite
left out the word only: yet these words (the Apostle does recite those
ministeries which are occupied in prayer, the word, and Sacraments: not off
them which are instituted for order, and discipline) have that sense which I
have given them. For if he speak off those which minister the word / and
Sacraments / not off those instituted for government / etc. yt follows that
he speaks off those which minister the word / and Sacraments only. As he
that says a man is justified by faith / and not by worckes: says that he is
justified by faith only. The bolt shot upon no occasion / towching the
papacy off every pastor in his church, and off shaking off the Princes
authority, being that which comes every hand while / when he has naught else
to say / shall be broken in an other place. For the two next diuis. let the
reader judge off the writings off both sides.

My words have light enough to have kept you from this Diuis. 30. page 316.
wandering / but that you take pleasure in untruth. for beside that the scope
off my disputation / does beat you from that vagarie: my words are plain.
For I say not that every one that occupies a mynisterie in the church, has
gifts sufficient for his calling: but every function, or mynistrie off the
church, has gifts sufficient, etc. And if yowr understanding be so narrow as
you pretend: understand it by examples. And becawse our question is of offices
necessary for our times / and therefore likewise off the gifts: you may learn
that the office off a Pastor / is (as has been showed) a several office from
the Doctor / because beside the knowledge / and dexterity in teaching / the
wisdom / and discretion in governing: yt has also annexed the grace to move
affections / either to the love of good / or hatred off evil. Likewise the
Doctor from the Elder: becawse beside the gift off government enough for that
function / there is required as I have said ability to teach. The Deacon from
the Elder: for that beside faithfulness / and reasonable wisdom / which is
sufficient for the gathering / and bestowing of the church money: is required
with greater wisdom a singular diligence / as off him whose charge reaches
unto the whole / where the other pertains to the poor of the church only:
and which is occupied in relieuing the pouerties off the mind / where the
other is off the body. This is that I said / every function has proper
gifts for the execution of it: and that forsomuche as now there is no gift
necessary for the ecclesiastical ministry / not contained in these / and
that all these fall into the ordinary ministry instituted / and specified in
the scripture: therefore these ordinatie Ministeries specified in scripture / are
sufficient. And as it is a good reason that there are no more Sacraments but
baptism / and the supper / for so much as there is no promise off life
everlasting not expessed in these / considering that the one seals up / and
assures that we are received into the house off God / the other that we shall
befed in it to life everlasting: even so these ministeries / are proved to be
sufficient / becawse all gifts necessary to good order / and conduit off the
church / are promised unto them.

Against this is said / that God tieth not his gifts to a certain nombre off
names, but bestows them where it pleases him. I spoke not off all gifts /
but of gifts necessary to govern the church with all: and those being
necessarily tied unto the offices which have / and owght to have / those names:
all other church offices are shut forth / as those which are either idle / or
hurtful. That there are functions necessary Coriath. 12. not mentioned to the
Ephesians, and again that the Apostle did not make a perfect division in either
off those places, is only to trifle out the time. for so much as I added
expressly / that I grounded my reason off both places jointly besides that it
is untrue that Deacons, and widows are left out to the Corinth. being
contained in the word helps. Moreover this is the third contrary (...).
sentence / which he has given off Corin. 12. for in the latin book he
proves / that there is no perfect division there: in this he goes in 18. diu.
page 309.
about to prove by reason / and authority / that it is pecfect: here he says
it is not perfect Such force has the truth / that yt makes them all guiddy /
and turnesick that wrestle against it: not perfect, perfect, not perfect. so
that the very Camelion it self / could never so soudenly / and into so contrary
coulors change it self. Against his exception that there are reckened up in
those places offices which endured for a time: I grant there were so / but
those ceassing (as has been showed) their proper gifts also be gone with
them. Where he adds that he could tell me, that the church has authority to
appoint names, and offices: yt is that in question / which he often says / but
never proves. Towching Readers / it is answered: as for Catechistes / they are
to be discussed after.

The argument which you say is too bad for a boy, is as good as I can make any.
I will leave it to the judgment of all which have skill / how you uncover yowr
self in yowr exceptions against it. For to omit that I have said / and leave to
be judged / of arguments good of particulers: my first proposition is
universal / if this be / the servant that knovveth his masters will, and
does it not, shall be beaten with many stripes: and this / they that do the
will of my father which is in heaven, shall enter into the kingdom off
heaven: he that is not with me, is against me: those which go after other
gods, shall lose their good: and an infimite number more / to be seen both in
holy / and profane writers. But as the ruder sort know not the King / onles he
have his crown upon his head: so the D. has no marck to know a general
proposition by / onles it have this word All, upon the head of it.

Likewise where he says this word (only) is not to be found in the second
proposition: He should have understood / that it is a part off the
principal extremes / and therefore could not enter there. It is his great
want / that he can not know one term / from another / onles they stand in
their natural order. for becawse he saw not these words (only are
sufficient) in the natural place off the extreme / as one that had no mark
to discern the master from the man / but by going before and behind / he
takethe one for another. When S. John says in the beginning was the word,
and by and by after / God was that word, with many such examples both in
holy / and profane writ: those that have but a little judgment can tell /
that althowgh he changed the natural order / yet those are still the first
parts / which are put in the later place: and that it is as much as if he had
said / The word was in the beginning, and the vorde was God. This is
therefore the argument, which in the Ans. sight has no manner off form. Those
functions which have all gifts needful / either for the ministering off the
word / and Sacraments / or for the gouernemente off the church / only are
sufficient: the functions reckened up off Saint Paul in both the places / to
the Ephesians and Corinth. have all gifts needful / either for ministering off the
word / and Sacraments / or for government of the church: therefore those
functions only are sufficient. Let the reader therefore judge / whether this
argument be like unto these sweepinges / that he has matched it with. That an
archbishop is a Diuis 31. Page 317 in diui. 10 page 304. in 3 Tra
new ministry / is declared. Where he says if no man appoint new offices,
but he which can give gifts to discharge them, it should follow, that no man
might appoint offices: if he understand as he owght to do ecclesiastical
offices / it is that I maintain. if he leap over here (as his coustome is) to
civil: I have showed that the reason is not like.

Half this diuis. is in the tenth off this chap. where yt has answer. My
argument here (a man may not ad to the ministeries, Diuis 32 page 318.
because he may not take away) is first off things apparently like: as those
which are likewise forbidden / likewise punished. Deuteronomy. 12. 32. Apoc. 22. 19.
Then it has this grownd / that they being contrary fall into one subject:
except one be naturally in it / as heat in fire. (Which I am constreined to
speak of / because I have to do with such a trifler / as would snatch at this
exception / although nothing to prurpose.) So that as he that has authority to
make laws / has also to abrogate / he which may absolve may condemn / he
that may bind may loose: so he that has power to ad / has also to deminish.
But marck what the D. answers. The question is whether men may ad to the
ministeries: the mean / and argument whereby I prove they can not, because it
is not lavvfull to deminish: now when he answers / that men may ad / does he
not give that for answer which is the question / and take that for his proof /
which is to be proved? And as for that which follows (the added ministeries
may be helps to ministeries instituted off God): yt is likewise in
controversy / being as doubtful as the rest. And the Papists may as well
answer thus / for the multiplying off their Sacraments: as the D. for increase
off the ministries. But for so much as these are yowr commen answers / here is
nothing new / or to be wondered at. Unto the second proposition he says / men
may take away offices off God which are temporal (that is enduring for a time)
but not perpetual. Wherein he is greatly abused. For nether any man / nor all
men in the world / could have put down the temporal ministeries off Apostles
/ Evangelists / etc. which the Lord ordained / onles the Lord him self had
withdrawn them: and therefore they so long remained in the church / until he
by their death / withowt raising up any seed unto them (by distribution of
those gifts whereby those ministeries might be furnished) declared that they
had an end.

The Ans. in defense of this forged Doctors / is like unto one Chap. 2. Diuis.
1. page 319.
which to defend him from the kolde / covers him self with a wet sack. For
before his ignorance might have in part excused him: now by this maintenance
off his answer / he has doubled his folly. For first to make him self clean /
he defiles as much as he can / Master Calvin / and the Bishop off Salisburie:
both which he nether shows to have used this Clement / and if they do: yet
their use of him / or such like / is so farfro^ lessening his fault / that is
makes it more appear. For they use them against the Papists / which for the
most part attributing unto them as great weight of authority / as to the
scriptures themselves / are so set up. Which they do also thereby to drive from
them: that if they can not be browght from the confidence they have in such /
becawse they are false: at least they might be browght to mislike them /
becawse they make against them. Likewise when they allege them / they give
them such an ear marck / that all may know them forged. But the D. does use
them against those / which hunger for proofs at his hands out off the word
off God / in the matters debated: which have that estimacion that is meet
should be had / off such filth as that is: which could not give credit unto
this authority / withowt renouncing the profession off the gospel / which we
have in commen. And in steed off giving him his ear marck: he puts a night
cap upon him / to hide it with. for in steed off alleging off him out off the
epistles / where he appears with his horns / and claws plainly: he makes
him come out of Polidore / as disguised out off a strange country. and becawse
Polidores words did not muffle him sufficiently / in saying that this was
contained in a little summarie off Christian religion: he (that Clement might
go the better unknown) added / in a book entitled, etc. which I merueil
with what face he cites Polidore for. as if there were no difference between
his / and Polidorc^ words. And he is not content only to have alleged the
authority: but as in a certain / and undoubted victory / he triumphs / and
insulteth upon his adversary: sarie: saying / Peter was not Antichrist, ergo
the name off an Archbishop, is not Antichristian.

In the second place he says / he used them not ^^ sure grownde^, but as
probable testimonies off antiquity of the name. Wherein his hand being with the
Papists / is against not only the manifest truth / but all those godly
writers / which reject those epistles as vpstartes / and lately forged under a
hedge. For against them all the D. says / that it is very probable that they
have that antiquity which they pretend. Thirdly / he compares them with the
Canons attributed unto the Apostles: wheroff albeit diverse ^^e falsely
fathered: yet those creeping in at sundry times / were ^^^w^^standing some
100. years / before this dross came ^^to the church. Wheruppon also the
corruptions in them / although they ^a^ter the walls off the city off God:
yet they raze not the foundacions off it / as this Clement does: nether are
they alleged off me (as he pretends) but with atteint off the baseness off
their birth. And for my alleging off Higinus: I refer me to the indgement off
the reader / what a cognizance I have given him there / page 4^^
to be known by.

His last refuge is / that yt is like Polidore meant some other book. not now
extant. For confutation off which unshamefast speech / to what end should I
other allege the latenes off the time wherein he wrote / or vnfoundnes off his
judgment? whereby he having not made half a turn from Popery unto the gospel:
might by all likelihood think / that those were Clementes epistles. The
weakness off his own proofs do betray him / as those that make more against
/ then for him. For if he will make difference between a gross epistle / and a
little book: the precise distinction tends rather to prove a book / then an
Epistle. And for the lenght / it is manifest: considering that Tully calls
such long letters / a volume: and in two or three epistles drawn out beyond
the ordinary / corrects him self / as breaking the bonds off an Epistle. The
same may be said both off the matter handled / and off the manner off
handling. Which being nether commen / nor familiar if a man will speak as the
Latins (whom Polidore follows) use: they were fitter for a book / then an
Epistle. That Clement scarce knowing what difference there is / between the
nominative / and accusative case: yt was no merueill if he were ignorant off
the difference / between a book / and an epistle: and therefore not unlike /
but Polidore helped him in his title. for the next diuis. I am content that the
issue declare / from whence the archbishop came.

Also in an other place / he to maintain tharchbishop says / the church may ad

denies that yt is a new ministry. Then forasmuch as his answer stands in
this difference / off ecclesiastical office / and degree / and again between
ecclesiastical degree / and order: becawse I thinck they were never heard off
before / they need some authority off the scripture / at least some
Ecclesiastical writers to confirm them. And beside that in ecclesiastical
writers / the mynisteries are separated one from an other by degree: the Ans.
Page 587.
him self in an other place / will have the word degree (when it is said /
they get unto them selves a good degree) to signify a diverse ministry from
the Deaconship. Likewise in an other place / to prove that a Bishop is above a
priest / he upon certain autorities Page 361.
concludes / that in those times there were three degrees off ministers /
bishop / priest / and deacon. whereupon yt must follow / that if the
Archbishop differ from the bishop in degree ecclesiastical: he must differ in
ministry / even as the degree off deacon / being different from the Elder /
makes a several mynisterie from yt. yea theruppon follows / that there
being then but three degrees in the church / wheroff the archbishop was none by
his own saying: there was then no archbishop / seeing he makes him a several
degree from them: which is a manifest overthrow off that he defends.

In an other place to prove Timothe archbishop / he alleges page 325.
that thoffice off tharchhishops, and bishops be one, becawse whatsoever is
necessary for a bishop, is necessary for an archbishop: which is ridiculous.
For then a bishop is all one with an Elder / considering that whatsoever is
necessary for an Elder / is necessary for a bishop: and the Evangelists
office the same that an Apostles / considering that whatsoever is necessary
for an Euang. is necessary for an Apostle. Where to prove the offices all one
/ he should have said / not only that it is necessary for an archbishop
which is for a bishop: but also that whatsoever is necessary for an archbishop
/ In the same place
^s likewise for a bishop. Where he says / they differ only in order, and
policy, and therefore all attributed in the Epistle to Timothe the Archbishop,
agrees unto every bishop: theroff follows that a commen (as he is called)
not differing in office from our bishop (as himself confesses after) shall by
the same reason / have power to do all things described in that epistle / and
consequently make ministers / and put out as well as our bishops do. These
things therefore were given out / or ever they were well thowght off: some time
tharchbishop differs in office from a bishop / sometime he differs not:
sometime he differs in order / sometime not: some time in degree / sometime
not.

To prove that S. Peter by him self / withowt the authority off other Apostles
/ instituted Archbishops / is browght the example off S. Paul, which made
Timothe, and Tite Archbishops: which is to prove one thing in controversy / by
that which is likewise. and is all one as if one doubting the suffiencie off
his creditor / in steed off some substanciall man to assure his debt / should
have a banck rowt browght to be bownd unto him. Which manner off reasoning when
all men know how absurd it is: it appears that the Ans. using it continually
/ is (as they say) at the end off his roll. That S. Paul did not appoint Titus
/ and Timothe of his own in 2. Tractat.
authority only / has before appeared: that he did not appoint the^
Archbishops / shall afterward (God willing) be showed. Beside that yt has been
already off Timothe showed / that he was an Evangelist: and the same reason is
off Tite.

To my other reason / that S. Peter would not graff the most noble plant (as it
is counted) off the ministry off the gospel / in the rotten stock off
Archflamines: he answers that Peter might place Archbishops where the
Archflamines were, not in respect off them, but in respect off the city. Which
distinction I confess I understand not: only I see / that in this cloud /
and mist off confused / and vndistinct distinction / he would steal away
unespied. for if in the same cities only where there were Archflamines (as we
are borne in hand) and in place off them Archbishops were placed: and as the
Archflamines were set to ouersee the flamines / so the Archbishops to ouersee
the bishops: how can it be but they were placed as well in respect off those
Achflamines / as off the cities? For they differ not in this point from
Archflam. considering that as archbishops were placed in respect off great
cities: so were the Archflam. before them. Here also the Answ. floteth in his
judgment off Peter. For before he said / he had the chief rule off the
^^^stles in all matters: and here / he was not above them in power. so that
onles Page 68.
he can mynce us a diversity between superior in rule / and superior in power:
yt is clear that he is not the same man here / that he was there.

The lords preistes / and Sacrafices were before the preistes / and sacrifices
off the Gentills. therefore that exception (God instituted Diuis. 4. page 321.
preistes and sacrifices though the Gentiles had the like) ^^ vain to prove
that there may be Archbishops / as there were Archflamines. A King was
necessary for the Israelites, to shadow owte to the^ the kingdom of our S.
Christ: therefore that example is owte of place. To prove conformite between
the people of God / and Idolaters in things which are not necessary / as the
Archebishoprick is confessed / beside that yt is an evil conclusion / to say
there may be conformity between the people off God / and Idolaters in cyuill
affairs / therefore in ecclesiastical: to ordeine a bishopp, and mynister
being the institution of God / in every church where there was other a flamen,
or mass preiste, can not be said to be framed according to those orders. But
to ordeine an Archbishop not instituted off God / both in that place where the
Archflamen was / and with that rule / and authority over the bishopes / which
the archflam. had over their flame^s: can not be imagined / but to have been
framed according to that Idolatrous function. If you will therefore make the
like: you must prove that as yt is the institucion of God / that in every
church there should be a bishop / or mynister: so yt is likewise his
institution / that in every great city / there should be an Archbishop. The
allegation owte of master Fox in the next / pertains not to this place. For
the question is not here / whether the Archbishops came in steed off
Arflamines / but wether S. Peter did ordeine archbishops in place off the
archflamines: which I assure my self you can not show owte off him.

Here he has at one push / thrust the archbishop quite owte off the church.
For if this be a good reason / there were no deacons Diuis. 6. page 312.
emongeste the Jews / becawse they were not specified in the oulde Testament:
then yt is likewise true / that forsomuche as there is no Archbishop specified
in the new Testament / there was no Archbishop in the Apostles times. Against
this take off Peter's ordeining off Archbishops in the place off Archeflamens /
add this / that the vanity off yt may appear: forasmuch as if there were
any Archeflamens in S. Peter's time / they were vpholden off the Magystrates
that lived in those days. And therefore to put down them / and place other in
their roumes / there was required S. Peter / beside his keys should have a
sword / and an army off men. For the Magystrates being then (as the Ans.
himself grants) heathenishe / and Idolatrous: this alteracio^ could never
be made / but by strong hand / and at the swords point. The rest / bare
affirmacions / and confuted in other places / I leave. Whether the Sadduces
were collectors for the poor / I will not enter further into: although his
reason / off not being specified in the old testament, is insufficient. For yt
is enough if yt be in new or old: consydering that the baptisyng off the
Israelites in the sea / and spiritual feeding by Manna / and the water
following them / being under the old Testament: are only specifyed in the
new. beside that his argument is negative off one part off 1. Corint. 10. etc.
the scripture / which he condemns in us off the whole.

Against the reason I bring to prove / that there were no Archflamines / is
answered that the matter is not great yt stands Diuis. 7. page ^^^.
upon the life off the Archbishop. For if yt be found a Canturberye tale / off
Saint Peter's placyng off Archbishops in place off Archflamynes: being not off
the Apostles planting / We may both boldlyer / and easelier pull him up by the
roots. Then he says / an argument off humane autorytye negatyue, is not good.
Wherein I refer my self to that said before in that behalf / and leave yt to
every man's consyderation / what lykelyhood there is that there were such /
when Tullye dyuiding / and distinguyshing the offices occupied about their Gods
/ makes no mention off that / supposed to have been cheyf. Where he asks why
the Grecians might not call him Archflamin, whom Tullie called Flamen Dialis: I
am content / let that be trial. And if he can show me either Plutarch / or
Dyonisyus Halicarnaseus / or any other good greek / or latin ancient writer /
that there was any such office: I will move no further disputation in this
matter. Therefore I would gladly know of you / what pr^ph^^e (...) they be
which make mention off these Archflamines. For the founteines from which this
report comes / are not ecclesiastical / but papisticall.

Last off all / to prove that there were Archflamines / and withal to lay open
my vnskilfullnes in stories, yt is alleged that there were such in England.
But how does he show my unskillfulness / which shows nothing wherein I prevented
him not? I knew well that there were that said so / I alleged them: but with
what truth / and fidelity / that is the question. To deciding wheroff beside
reproaches / what is browght? he will say paraduenture M. Fox. If thou turn
gentle reader the other side off the leaf / wherowt the sentence is taken: thou
shall understand manifest treachery. for M. Fox disputes against this opinion
/ and uses diverse reasons which confute flatly this fable / off the conversion
off England by Eleutherius Ambassadors: and sets down that sentence by way
off concession / rather carried against his will by certain stories in this
untruth / then led by his own Judgment. Note also that the D. is directly
here for Harding / against the Bishop off Sarum / both in this fable / off
Eleutherius / and the Archflamines. For towching archflamines he says / yt is
a mere fantasy, grounded upon an unsavory fable off Clementes, and
Anacletus: and that nether the name Archflamines, Apol pa 2. ca 4. d. 3.
or protaflamines, is to be found in any ancient allowed writer. and
towching the other fable of Eleutherius / objected by Harding as now by the D. he
answers / it is untrue: adding reasons there to be see^. And that this fable
whereof Geffrey Monumete^sis Apol pa 1. ca 2. d 2
was author / may better appear: having a little treatise theroff sent me with
M. Foxes leaf / well written in that behalf / that in the profit the church
shall receive / the author also may have some fruict off his trauaill / I will
here set yt down.

Geffrey Monumetensis makes here in Britayn before Lucius time / 28. flamines
/ and 3. Archflamines / and when Lucius received the Christian faith / that the
28. flamines were changed into 28. Bishops / and the 3. Archflam. into 3.
Archbishops / which had three seats in the three chief cities off the Isle /
London / Yorck / and Caerust. Unto London was subject Loegria / unto Yorck
Deira / and Albanya / unto Caerusk Cambry^. Thus all the Isle by this story
off Geffrey / should become Christened in Lucius time. But this could not come
to pass upon Lucius receiving the Religion of Christ / onles he had been king
over all Britayn. Now the manner off the Britaynes was not to have one king
alone / but many: as may most plainly appear both before Lucius time / and
after / by the old Roman histories / and also by Gildas the Britanie
historiographer / who lived about 1100. ago. Diodorus Siculus says / there
are many kings / and Frinces: lib. 5. ca. 8
when he speaks off Brytain / showing what yt was in the days off Julius
Caesar. After whom the Emperor that did attempt to subdue the Brytaines / was
Claudius / more then 50. years after that Julius Caesar made war upon them:
at which time what the government of Brytanes was in having Kings / thus
writteth Dion Cassius. The Britains were not free, but subject In vita
Claudies.
to diverse Kings Now an hundredth year after this almost / which is nigh the
time that Lucius is said by Geffrey to be King of Britayn / thus writes
Cornelius Tacitus. In times past they obeyed Kings, now by Princes they are
distracted with factions, and parts taking, nether is there any other thing
more profitable for us against most mighty nations, then that they take no
commen counsel: yt is seldom that two or three cities come together, to
vvithstand a commen danger. so vvhilest they fight severally, they are
ouercommed wholy. This writes Tacitus / son in law off that Lucius Agricola
/ who had the rule off this Isle 8. years continual in the reign off
Domitian the Emperor: and therefore could not but well understand / the manner
off the Britains in having at once many Princes / given to tumultes.

Now in the days off Seuerus the Emperor / who reigned by and by after this
time / in which Lucius is said King of Britains: hear what is reported by a
writer even off that age / and Dion Cassius.
which was for the most part / in the wars off the Romans him self. Amongst
the Brytaines, the people for a great part have the rule. To conclude Gildas
himself / in his inuectiue Epistle against the Britains / makes mention of
diverse kings / as living all at one time, but admit this were true / that
Lucius was King alone over all Brytaine: yet was he under the Roman deputy /
and could attempt no change of Religion / specially the Roman / and so
universally as is supposed / but with his allowance: the Brytaines having
among them at that time / so valiant a Roman deputy called Albinus / of whom
Seuerus then Emperor / stood him self in some awe / and durst attempt no
wars abroad / before he had first joined in sure amity with him. For
Dionifi. Halicarnassaeus.
to have flamines was proper to the Roman religion: Cornel. Tacit. li. 14.
but Druides proper to the Brytaines. Which if at any time the Romans did put
away / to establish their own flamines (which does not yet apeare by any
history) yet that could they not do over all Britain according to Geffreis
story / but only so far as their own province did extend. For over all
Britain they were never Lords: seeing that a Dion. Cassius.
Roman (which says he wrote that he saw) writes thus. Part off this Island,
is a little less then half ovvres: which when Seuerus would wholy subdue,
he entered into Calidonia. For a little before these words / he makes the
Britains consist of two kinds of people / whom be calls Meatas / and
Calidonios / and that the Romans had in their power / only the Meatas.

Again consider what was the life off the Britains in the days of Seuerus
the Emperor / who lived a little after that Lucius is said King off Britain:
and it will appear most plainly / that the Brytaines had not only no such
show off a general / and open Christian church established among them / as
sets forth Geffrey: but also that they were far from any little taste off
Christ. For thus yt is written off them. They live in tents naked, Dion
Cassius. in loco supra cita^o.
their vviues are commen, etc. Is it like that a people that abuses wines in
commen / had such a constituted form of a Christian church / as Geffrey gives
to understand? or was there ever such barberousnes off going naked off men /
and weomen / where the word off God was tawght? which commands not only
modesty / but semelynes. It is therefore rather true / which that old father
Gildas / their own country man speaks off them: the Britains received the
faith off Christ, even from the coming off Christ, and in the days off
Tiberius the Emperor: but that was not publicly nor universally by authority
off Prince / but off some few / and off those how? Of some Koldly, off some
soundly. and how long? until the times off Dioclesian the Tyrant: which was
after Lucius / at least 132. years.

But if we will narrowly exact this story of Geffrey / yt will hardly fall out
/ that Lucius him self became a Christian / according to his delivering off the
sterie. For he says yt came to pass by means off Eleutherius / woe was made
bishop off Rome in the days of Commodus the Emperor / anno 180. and yet
makes Lucius to die an 156. so by that reckening / Lucius became Christian
after he was dead / at least xxiiij years. Further if we well marck / after
what long blindness off time / this story comes to light / and in what defect
off any old / and good writer to keep the memory thereof: I dare warrant you
/ yt will prove but a fable. The time when this is said to be done / lacks a
good deal off 200. years after Christ: a thousand years after this we have
no known writer / nether off our own / not foreign / that makes any little
report off this change off Archflaminrickes into archbishoprickes / until the
time off Geffrey: who was made bishop off S. Ass / in the day off Henry the
second. And from whence fetches he this story? yt may be some will say / he
had yt off the old Britains / and was by him only turned into latin. but
how likely is this to be true? when old Gildas deals thus plainly / in
report off his own country monumentes. The monumentes In his epistle
aforesaied
of vvriters, if there were any, be either burnt by fire of ennemies: or by
navy of citisens exiled, carried far off, do not appear.

But if any man will say / perhaps this book of Geffrey was one off those so
carried away / and afterward found he woteth not where / was browght home
again: this besides it is off yt self but a conjecture / is also plainly
refuted by Geffrey him self: who vvriteth story almost off 200. years after
Gildas / and has the bistorie off Bid in some places / even word for word.
That I speak nothing off his untruth / and toto childish errors in many places
/ especially when he makes report off any matter of ancient time: which
might be some argument also / to draw from him opinion off antiquity. After
that Geffrey had once coiued this story / there lack no writers which also
make mention theroff: but so as they make some change off his report. As
Platina / who makes but 25. flamines. and 3. Archflamines: belike in vita
Eleutherij.
moved by the Epistle off Gildas / who makes the nombre of all the cities in
Britain / to be but 28. although he allege for his author Ptolomey. Thus far
this author: upon all which matter may appear / what folies they be which the
D. auowcheth for truth / and wheruppon he has laid the foundation off his
archbishop.

You shall not be hable to show that the bishops which the Apostels planted
were other, then which with thelders had the oversight Diuis. 8. Page 324.
of one particular congregation: and therefore yowr proofs are always by other
things / as dowtefull as the question in hand. And if that were true / yet
makes it nothing for the archbishop. For what synewes are in this argument?
The Apostles placed bishops in every city, therefore an Archbishop ouerseer
off them in every province. After he says / if by a pillar of Antechriste you
understand him or him: as if I had not sufficiently showed vvho^ I me^te. Who
can patiently answer this wandering where the way is so plainly beaten? and this
is his commen practice to piece owte his answer. Thirdly he says / he may take
reports off Antiquities from the papists: no man hinders him. But if he
will take their report in their own cawse / and in a matter invented to
advance the credit of the romish seat / that whilst Peter is made the
founder of Archbishops / and Patriarckes / the Pope his supposed successor /
might have the stewardship off them / and they be the easelier holden in his
obedience: if I say he will believe such stories / yt is to be feared lest
it be the Lords anger against him: whereby it is just that they should believe
lies / which will not believe the truth. And if the sentet of the archbishop
had so occupied his sense / that he has not smelte this frawde of the
papists / and the cawse hereof: Distinct. 22. Diuis. 9. page 325.
he might have learned it of Gratian / who carries this whole fable unto that
end.

You wipe not away the filthe off the times vvherin Volusianus wrote / and him
you purge not: who (by that he is so deep in his mass) appears to have
been defiled with it. And where you say / yt is not like that he would write
any thing in that matter, which he had not certainly learned of worthy writers:
I pray you what worthyer writers could there be in this behalf / then Denis
bishop off Corinthe / and Eusebius? I am sure he could not fetch further then
these. So that from whom soever he took yt (if he received yt of any): yt is
clear he received yt off those / which being further off the Apostels times /
can have no credit herin / further the^ they show forth the autors of their
report. but to make reume for the archbishop / we must believe those things
as certain / which nether are now / nor yet were the^ extante when Eusebius
wrote / which gathered his story off writers before his time: and not only
testimonies which never were / but whereof the bare names are not to be found.
Whereas the manner of writers is / when they allege any thing that the former
times had not spoken off / as at the finding of some great treasure / to note
the means how that fell into their hands.

Against the authority alleged owte off Eusebius / that Denis was bishop / is
opposed that it is a negative argument of autorisie: which is an engine to
wringe owte off the churches hands / a singular means which all the writers
of our times / use against the forgeries off the Papists. For when they
reason against the forged Epistles / against Chrisostomes leytourgie / against
the bastard writings of Augustine / etc. that there are things contained in
them which no writer of that age wherein they are supposed to have writ /
makes mention off; the D. has tawght an easy answer / that yt is an evil
argument off authority negatiuely / and that yt follows not that there were
no such things then / becawse they were not mentioned in their writings.
Likewise when the bishop of Salis. made this challenge after performed / that yt
could not be showed out off any allowed writer 600. Years after Christ / that
there was any mention off such / and such things maintained by popery: the
Answ. has with one word / wiped away the profit off all those travails.
for yt may be answered / that such things were / althowghe none made mention
of them. The Papists in their defenses have hard foreheades: but I think
there is scarce found amongeste the^ / that would not blushe at such an
answer. Yet this is almost the salve for all sores / namely where I have showed
/ that in none of the writers within certain hundred years after Christ /
which have filled their books with the mention of bishops / there is any the
least mention of an Archbishop. Against which riot off answer oftentimes
repeted / yt shall be sufficient once here to have spoken generally.

Now I come to that more proper to this place / that histories are not so
curious in calling men by their several tytles: because we use to call the
bishops of Canturbery, and York, oftener by name of bishop then archbishop.
But he should understand / that yt is one thing to speak after the commen
sort: and an other to write to the approbation of the learned. And when there
is no kind of writing so narrowly bound to the observation of circumstances
off place / time / person / as a story: yt must bring a great mist in it / to
put no difference between a bishop / and an Archbishop: considering that that
pertains to the policy off the church / whereunto they had regard. So that
althowgh he use some liberty off speech in other places: yet in this place yt
was more insufferable / and that so continually / in Denis twice / in James /
in the bishop of Rome / of Alexandria / etc. he might withowt reprehension have
spoken so once / or twice: but him perpetually to call all Archbishops bishops
/ I thinck you will hardly persuade any man off judgment. And if there had
been any such titles allowed: yt would have appeared in the superscriptions off
bishops to archbishops. At least the lower degrees off Deacons / and Elders
would have acknowledged it / as both duty / and honest civility requires:
otherwise if the archbishops had been froward / they would not have red the
letters. But not Eusebius only / Denis the Bishop / who wrote unto the church
off Athenes / so called him even in that place / where Eusebius. li. 3. ca. 4. and
4. 23.
(if he could truly) he would have awakened those of Athenes / with the
honorable mention off Denis their former archbishop: and not have let pass
that weight off authority / to have made his admonition more sounding.

Furthermore if Eusebius had spoken so improperly: he is yet to be charged with
further confusion. For he assigns him a parish / which is a territory
belonging unto a simple bishop: and not a province / which is an archbishops
kingdom. If therefore he confounded archbishop with bishop: at least he should
have spoken dinstinetly off their charges. Last off all / how idle a pharisie
this is off Denises archbishopric / may be considered forasmuch as Eusebius. in
both places by me alleged / calls him the first bishop off Athenes. And that
he was first in those parts may easily be seen / for that it was the wisdom
of the holy ghost / to settle first the Gospel in the mother towns / and head
places of dominion^: that from thence it might have passadge to places rownd
about / as the practice in the Acts does declare. Now if he were the first
bishop chosen after the conversion of Athenes: by the D. saying he was made
Archbishop / before there were any other bishops to ouersee. But forasmuch as
tharchbishop is in the nombre of those which hang of other / and that there
could be no archbishop where there were no bishops / nor bishop where there
were no churches rownd about: it is browght to pass / that there being no
bishops in those parts / at that time when Saint Paul ordained Denis bishop:
he can by no means be thowght to have ordained him archbishop. And that which
I have said in this point against the archbishopric off Denis (the last only
excepted) is to be understood off James / Titus / Timothe / etc.

If a spade be but a spade / and a fig but a fig: then a bishop is but a
bishop. Then also Erasmus saying (alleged page 405.) Diuis. 10. page 325.
that Timothe was a bishop / and no where that he was an archbishop /
affirms that he was but a bishop. Nether does this make against, but for me.
For if Erasmus speaking but of two / called one of them archbishop: is it like
that Eusebius speaking of so many / supposed archbishops / called never one of
them by their proper name? nether will I stick to confess / that Erasmus
deceived with the corruption of times vvherin he lived / spoke as he thowght:
imagining Titus an Archbishop / as left in Creta an Isle / and Timothe a simple
bishop / as left in one city. But it is good to observe by the way / how the
Ans. building with one hand / overthrows with the other. For let all men
that have but a grain of salt / judge how likely it is / that Timothe was
Archbishop: when so many writers both old and new / yea some in those times
that archbishops were / speaking of him: not one calls him archbishop / but
all bishop / as in his treatise may appear. but thus their tounges must be
confounded / that build up Babylon. Pa. 404.
As for Titus whom Erasmus calls archbishop / to make his authority of any
weight / he must needs raise that title either of some name given unto him in
the scripture: or of some effect which he was known to excute / proper to an
archbishop: or else off some ancient writer. But he could not raise it of any
title the scripture gives him / there being none such: nor off any thing Titus
did / forasmuch as there is nothing done off him / which the Ans. affirms
not to be commen to every bishop / nothing prescribed to him / which was not
prescribed to Timothe / whom Erasmus calls simply bishop: nor off any
ancient writer / there being none browght / nor as I am persuaded can be
browght: therefore it is clear / that Erasmus calling Titus archbishop has no
weight: as one which spoke according to the corruption off time / vvherin he
lived.

The rest of this diuis. is answered before: for the next / let yt In 3 diui.
page 320.
be judged how you have overthrown that alleged / towching Timothe / and Tite
being Evangelists. I will also refer to the readers judgment / what
vnlearnednes yt is to confute authority by better authority: and in what place
the D. will have us receive men's authority / when he will not have them
controlled by other men. How by this means he that has the first place to
speak / may stop the mouth off all that follow: forasmuch as yt shall be
unlawful for them / either out off the autors which the first speaker alleged
/ or any other / to oppose a contrary sentence. How also this being so
unlearnedly done off me / is notwithstanding learned in him: which has used it
diverse times. I leave also to be judged / how to the purpose he has alleged
these examples off Justice, and chief Justice, seeing I helped him with this
kind off division: and yt might have easily appeared that my argument was /
that for so much as the Scoliast called them simply bishope: therefore yt could
not be thowght / that he esteemed them archbishops / which is opposite member
in this division. Last of all how absurdly is it said / that he which calls
an archbishop a bishop / speaks properly? When he that has little more then
learned his Gra^mer / knows that it is a Trope / vvherin the general is
taken for the special: which is contrary to proper speech. Diuis. 12. page
326. etc.


To the first reason / I have showed what might lead Erasmus / to call Titus
archbishop over Crete / and not Timothe over Ephesus. To the second / I am
content that my reason off framing titles according to times, be nothing worth:
if Erasmus in a matter off divinity / and having the veil off corrupt times
to hinder his sight / could not be deceived: which erred in many things, and
in those he saw was often more That is halting of both sides.
Cretian / the^ Christian. The third (Erasmus did not give Titus a title
according to the custom off that age wherein him self lived, for that there
was then no bishop of Crete, ^s there was of Rome when Vincentius lived) is
sensles. Consydering that my answer is apparante / that in speaking of Titus /
he applied him self to the coustome which had prevailed in all places / off
calling the bishops off the metrapolitane cities / archbishops: which this
answer towchech not. Let him show one approved author for the name of
archbishop / or patriarch once only used in Eusebius time / or before / to
note the superiority off one bishop over all his fellows / and we will all
clap our hands unto him: if he can not / then yt is shame to say / those names
were usual in Eusebius time. That Nicephorus spoke no otherwise off Victor
then you have set down / yt is all one to me: which pourposed to show that he
spoke otherwise / then either Eusebius / or the trwth would suffer / having
regard unto the times wherein he lived So that my untrue reports off autors,
are such as they are no more beficiall to my cawse / then if I had used their
very words. For my answer made unto Volusianus / and Erasmus / that men use to
speak / and to think for the most part of things past / by the measure
off things present: if yt had no examples to warrant yt with / yet yt is so
manifest / and sensible / that I durst barely leave yt to the conscience off
all. and if the D. would give the rule of his tongue / but a little into the hand
of his conscience: I dowbt not but he would also confess yt? Howbeit we have a
manifest example in the Centuries / which confessing there was no Metropolitan

Philpot calls patriarch of Rome: when all know that there was no patriarch
many years after him. Last off all / when yt happened unto me to call Cyprian
Metrapolitane / which am an enemy to that estate (as I am also charged therewith

how much more might that befall to others / which had no such combat with

answered. His escape that James called bishop by Eusebius (to whom may be
adioined in catalogoscripillust.
Jerome) yet might be Archbishop, I have Diuis. 9. page 325
confuted. The plenty off testimonies for the Archbishop, browght now / hides
not his poverty in his first book. for all may know that this harvest came in
since. For the exposition of Ireneus / which interpreteh (they, every one
severally: if they severally ordained bishope every one in his circuit / so it
be understood with the churches consent, as is before in 2. Tract. Diuis. 14.
page 329.
declared: I am well content.

If the error off my argument had been so gross, as yowr sight had perceived
yt: I had bin sure to have heard of yt. Whatsoever / and how many cawses soever
you assign of appoincting an archbishop: yet this is a perfect division off
the subject / that for so much as the Archbishopricke (if any owght to be) must
needs be both in some person / and place: not found by thapostels ordination
which knew the best government / nether in that person / nor place both most
fittest / and most likest to receive yt: yt must follow that yt owght not to
be. As for yowr exception off the time: first yt is your manner that you might
be thowght to have store off answer / to make four off one. for whereas the
time, and persons to be governed, the suppression off sects, and peace off the
church* are put for several cawses: yt is manifest that one time makes no
difference off government from another / but in respect off the persons
governed: nor the persons them selves / but in respect of their contentions /
and alteracion of disposition. Then it shall appear after / that the times off
persequution such as those) were the fittest for that office: if that had been
convenient.

This Archbishop said to be the officer off order / confounds all order /
and changes all: an Evangelist into a bishop / a bishop Diuis. 15. page 329.
into an Archbishop / an archbishop into an Apostel / an Apostle into an
Archbishop which folies are before confuted. If S. John were Archbishop / or
did an Archbishops office in those places / where he abode: then the other
Apostle. in their circuites did the like / and were likewise Archbishops over
them / and the bishop there. so it follows that either there were no
Archbishops in the Apostles times: or if there were any / they had nothing to
do / their offices being not yet fallen / but in the Apostles hands. And if
the Ans. will needs have S. John's antoritie / the pose to measure out the
Archbishops authority yt must follow that forasmuch as he had the care / and
ouersighte of all churches in the world: the Archbishop must have the same. For
the next section / let the reader judge / whether I have delte syncerely: and
whether in saying Anaclete, and Anicete are but suspected, although he ad (not
without just cawse) he leave to them some credit. For the next also (of the
year wherein the Nicene council was houlden) being not to purpose / althowghe
I could maintain the account I followed / I will leave the Ans. in his earnest
disputation: whose practice is to handle trifles earnestly / and earnest
things triflingly

The leap is as great as I have said / and consequently as Diuis. 18. Page
331. etc.
dangerous to tharchbishops neck. For yt falls still forth / that for the
space off 300. years from the time off the Apostles / there is no syllable in
any one approved author / off any either archbishop / or Metrapolitane. for as
for the Canons attributed unto the Apostles (those only excepted which are to
be found in their writings) being as is agreed amongst men off any judgment
/ gathered off diverse councels in sundry times: that which is here alleged off
the Ans. was by all likelihood drawn out off the council off Antioch / having
almost the very words theroff saving as yt comes to pas / yt being somewhat
later / is somewhat worse. The council of Antioch / a good while after that
of Nice / can not make the fall off tharchbishop les dangerous. As for the
fable off Archbishops in England in Euleutherius time / yt is before confuted.
So that if a Metrapolitane were all one with an Archbishop: yet he is destitute
of the testimony off the purest / and best times. Where the D. thincketh those
words off the council off Nice (Let the ancient custom be kept) will save
his neck, and his body from harm: he is deceived. For this word ancient /
being in number off those / which have relation / and depend of others:
signifies a greater / or smaller time according to the things vvherwith it is
compared / or has relation unto. so that that may be / and often is called
ancient / which is but of very few years: and which other sometime can not
be so called / withowt a greater number. The bishops therefore comparing that
decree / with other made at that time / and not before / called that an
ancient custom.

And yt can be no strange kind off speech for the ministers being assembled
together / to speak off a matter continued a score off provincial Synodes /
and houlden in the space off 10. years / after this sort: In such and such
things, we will keep our old coustome. And that yt could not be long before
the council off Nice beside no testimony to the contrary * Aeneas Sy^uius
gives this for us: before the Nicene council every bishop lived Epist. 288
unto him self, and small regard was had to the bishops of home. But admit yt
had been so before the council off Nice / 20. yea 30. years yet by yowr own
count / there is no mention off him all that time which I have affirmed /
which is 300. years after our Savior Christ's ascension. Now therefore that
the auncientie off the Metrapolitane / appears not by this council to be
other / then I alleged: Let us see what credit yt owghte to have to prove
that this decree off theirs was good. For thereunto the D. regards when he
says / the notable, and famous council off Nice, must be off all wise, and
learned men next unto the scriptures reverenced, etc. It is sure that having
regard to the decision off the different / touching the perfect unity off
substance / of our Savior Christ with God the Father / it giving sentence
upon the infallible word off God / is worthy to be reverenced. But if the D.
will have their soundnes in that poincte / autorise the rest / and that our
reverence to yt should close up our mouths / from demanding from whence the
other canons come / what ground they have: yt is that which we can by no means
consent unto.

And that yt may appear how justly we call this canon off the council / unto
the towch stone of the word off God / let it be considered what is ordained off
them in the 12. and 23. Canons after Ruffin: where they prescribe seven years
unto one fallen in. 1. lib. 6. c.
to Idolatry / all which time (althowgh very repentante) they forbid him the
supper off the lord: where also yt keeps owte one which coming from the war
retourneth thither again / by the space off thirtene years / etc. which
severity (to let pas the rest) as yt is against the rule of S. Paul: so yt
could not but put a halter 2. Cor. 2. 7
in the deuiles hand / to snare a number of souls with all. what corruption
there was further at that time / either by ignorance / or ambition / may appear
by that if one Paphenutius had not been: they had all concluded against the
honorable society off bishops 1. lib. Soc. 11. cap.
/ elders / and Deacons with their lawful wives. If the Ans. say / these
errors were but the errors off those bishops only / but the canon off a
Metrapolitane has beside their allowance / the approbation off the former
times also / so that althowgh their single authority be not hable to way yt
down / yet helped with the ancient coustome before / yt will carry yt away:
I answer Ibid.
that in the same council appears / that to those chosen unto the ministry
unmarried / yt was not lawful to take any wife afterward: only being married
before entrance into the mynistrie / it was lawful for them to use the
benefit of that mariadge. And Paphenutius shows / that not only this was
before that council: but was an ancient tradition of the church / which
both him self / and the rest off the council rested in. what soever credit
therefore in any respect / comes unto the Metrapolitane by this sixth cano^:
the same in every: point comes to this so great a corruption / that nether
single ministers might mary / nor those which entered married / might after death
of their wives mary again If the fame of the council can not wipe away the
infamy of this: nether can it of that: and if the ancient tradition of the
church / do not autorise the one: nether can ancient coustome / autorise the
other.

The Ans. before / for one only error touching rebaptising / Page 147.
casts away the whole council of Carthage: I will not deal so rowghly with
the council off Nice only I desire that their authority be lifted up no
higher / then yt has state off the word off God. Howbeit it must not be let
goo in this canon off Nice (which is the overthrow of all that the Ans has
said before) that saying this was oulde coustome, it confesses thereby that it
was no ordinance of God vvheras if it came from S. Peter / Paul / etc. they
would have said according to the institution off the Apostles. it is also
worthy to be observed / that the jurisdiction the Metrapolitanes had in their
provinces / was before only voluntary / and vnco^strained: for that this was
the first time / that any law passed of yt: which noted off me in an other
place / is here well confirmed. so that these words the old coustome, which the
D. puts so great affaince in / if he make his acco^pts well / shall be found
to have been a reed of Egypt unto him: whereupon he leaning / is not stayed but
pricked.

To prove that the name off archbishop was not before the Diuis. 19. page 332.
council off Nice / nor within three hundred years after the ascension off
our Savior / I show that there is no mention off him in Theophilus / Ignatius
/ Clemens Alexandrinus / Iustine / Martyr / Ireneus / Tertullian / Origin /
Cyprian / in the histories out off which Eusebius gathers his story / nor in
Eusebius / nor (in a word) in no allowed writer / nether greek nor latin /
within that space. The D. asks whether the council off Nice, Antioche,
Epiphanius, etc. be not as good? all which are both later writers then those I
alleged: and after the 300. years before assigned. So that to prove the
antiquity off the name off Archbishop / and Metrapolitane / he says in effect
/ yt is all one to allege the stories / and writers which came after / as
those which went before: and to prove that these names were with in 300. years
after Christ / he alleges stories / and other writers which testyfie these
titles to have been after 300. years: which how absurd yt is / all men
understand. And what likelihoode off trwth yt has / that these names were
within 300. years / and od / when as not one only writer having so often
occasion to speak off them / does once name them: it may be considered partly
of that the bishop writes. For as he asked Harding / was there no man in the
world for the space off 600. years, hable to express the name off universal
Art. 4. diuis. 31.
bishop: So I ask the D. was there none in the world by the space off 300.
years / and od / hable to express the metrapolitans name? no man for the
space almost of 400. years / hable to express the archbishops name? partly
also I leave yt to be considered / off that I have said before.

Then he must understand / that as those stories / and writers he alleges /
make nothing to prove that antiquity which he supposes: so they being further
from the Apostles times / and nearer unto the time off Antichrist / are not off
so good credit / to prove the lawfullnes off that either office / or name / as
if they had had testimony of the purer times. moreover off these six autors
which he makes mention off / two wroote after 400. years: all the rest wrote
from abowte 350. years / unto the prick off 400. And althowgh he has browght
out so small a number: yet he must be feign to cut off half off them / as
those which make no mention off the archbishop. for nether Chrysostom / nor
Jerome / no not Ambrose (as shall appear) in their so great works / make any
mention off him. Where I showed that as the ced^^ off Liban can not be hydden
amongeste the Box trees, so the archbishop could not have been hydden in the
ancient writings amongst the other Mynisters: and further / that if he
were, he was contemned off them, which once vvoulde not defyle their pen by
vvriting off him: the Answ. as thowghe these perteined not to the matter / under
coulor of calling them frumpes, passes by them whereas a few such frumpes will
break the archbishops back / if they be not better looked unto.

The Ans. can never be holden in the railes off any lawful form off
disputacion. All men see that whatsoever he heapeth Diuis. 2^. Page 3, 8* etc.
up / touches not my reply. For he owght to improve the signification which I
have set down / off the word Metrapolitan bishop: which is, to be nothing else
then bishop of that city, which yt pleases the Emperor, or Prince to make
chief: and therefore that ^f the office swell no more then the name / there is
great difference between his / and tharchbishops name. This becawse he could
not do / the signification being so clear: he starteth a side / and goes
abowte to prove / that Metropolitan and Archbishop are taken for the same.
when the question is not here how they are taken / but what the words
signify. If he had showed that the word metrapolitane bishop / is as lofty in
signification / as the word archbishop: then he had spoken to the purpose.
Beside this / in a matter that is in controversy amongst writers / he makes
his profes by bare autorities: the controversy being not only between the
Ciuili^^s, and Canonistes, but also between others off our time.

Likewise it is to be observed / how cuill he has peeced these together /
bringing in M Calvin contrary unto Master Fox / in that the one makes a
Metrapolitane / and Archbishop to differ from a Patriarck / the other makes
them all one. M. Fox also to differ from himself: which in the second place
alleged out off him / makes difference between a metrapolitane / and primate:
in the third / makes them all one. Beside that also he is beside the forowgh
off his cawse / he gains not that which he goes abowght. For let us admit
that a metrapolitane / and Archbishop are taken for the same: yet thereof
follows not / that the name off an archbishop was in the church as soon as
the name of Metrapolitane. For althowgh a Prophet / and a seer be all one /
astranger / 1. Sam. 9. 9. Cicero 1 officioru^
and an ennemie in war betokened one thing: yet nether have the words the same
signification / nether were they all at one time / but came one after another.
For I would gladly know whether yt seem unto him / that all these titles
Metrapolitane / Archbishop / Primat / and Patriarch / came in at a clap. if
there be no likehoode in this: yt follows that his autors meaning is not /
that these names were all at the council off Nice: but after they crepte into
the church / were attributed unto one / and the same office off
metrapolitanship / specified in that council. For the authority over other
bishops / which is gone abowte by this Nicene council / to be proved like to
that of our archbishops: that I make not with the Answ. a confusion off all /
I will (God willing) show in place / how the Nicene / and Antiochen
Metrapolitane / have beside the name / almost nothing in commen with our
Archbishops.

Here will be no confession: yt was not enowghe for the Answ. before to allege
these forged canons withowt correction / Diuis. 20. page 334.
yea with commendation: but even now also detected / rather then he will yeald
to the trwth / the comme^ ennemy must have the advantage. He will not forsooth
greatly stick in the defense of these canons: then he will not give them quite
over. There is no small controversy (he says) abowte the number of canons of
this council: and a little after / there is great difference in writers for the
number of the canons. Let him name one (Papists excepted) that ever moved
controversy abowte this number of 70 and 80. canons which he talks off.
Athanasius in an Epistle that he as some think writes, etc. what some are
those? Pighius / Hosius / Harding / and their likes / and they do but say yt:
for that they did think so / there being nether coulor / nor shadow off trwth
in that so kold a devise / yt is hardly to be thowght. He says after / he has
done nothing strange in alleging these canons. I grant: for he has those
spoken of before / to keep him company. And in the next diui. to make up the
matter / he alleged not those canons as the vndowbted canons of the council
off Nice, but as probable. Is it in deed probable / that there was such filthe
in the church / in the time of the Nicene council / as those canons you
alleged make mention of?

The reasons whereby he would bring some credit unto these canons / are to light.
For where he reckeneth up certain things found in other writers / not
contained in those canons: he should have known that there might be other
things handled in that council / which were not browght into canons. For
example / that which he recites owte off Ambrose / towching the second marriage
off the clerckes, was talked on in the council / as I have showed before: but
yet there was no canon made off yt / as may appear by the stories before
alleged. For yt was browght in / not as a thing whereof they would consult: but
alleged as a reason by Paphnutius / to bar that which they would otherwise
have decreed. As for the council off Arles: yt speaks not off the council
off Nice / but only off a great Synod: and to restreigne that to that
council / is but a frierly note / which the gatherer off the councels makes /
to get some credit to those 70. canons / which the Ans. would thruste upon
us. There were things alleged in the council / which those nigh the times
wherein yt was holden / might come to the knowledge off by report off those
present at the council: which make nothing for proof off a greater number off
canons* For it is not like that the Canons of the Nicene council / wheroff
every Bishop throwgh the world (as the Bishop off Salisbury proves) had a
copy / were lost. And if there were such a number as he would have us
believe: yet when the ancient writers which follow so nere the council / or
lived in that time / could not come to the knowledge off them: is it like that
this vpstarte / not led with any desire off search off antiquity / but as
appears with a deuelishe appetite of advancing the seat off Antechriste /
should discover such a hoord of Canons? But if this new recorder seem unto
you to have browghte the other canons to light: then belike he has those you
cite out off the Council off Arles / off Jerome / and Ambrose. if not (wherein
I refer the reader unto the Canons / not having the book:) then yt might have
been argument / that those canons came not out of any store house off learned
monumentes / but out of his one forge.

You say you agree with the bishop off Salisbury in his reply against Harding
touching the canon he alleges. The trwth is that you have done the best you
can / to ouerthrowt the whole defense off the bishop in that behalf: which
stands in proof that those be counter faicte / and that there were no other
canons off the Nicene council / then are commonly extant. And where you say /
Hardinges canon must needs be counterfaict, becawse yt is contrary to the
canons off that council, but that which you have alleged, and in those
poinctes which you have alleged them, to be of the same substance the. 6. and
7. first those new canons being off one litter / if you give credit to one /
you can not take yt away altogether from the rest. Secondly all those canons
which are not contrary to any thing determined in the council off Nice / have
by this answer gotten that credit / which the authority / and name of the
Nicene council can give them. So that a number off wicked things which the
Council off Nice spoke not against / contained within these canons / are
commenced by the Ans. for decrees off the great Nicene Council / which were
long after decreed in the Popes kitchen.

Thirdly where he says the: 25. 26. 27. differ from the 6. and 7. but in
number, and not in substance: beside that he takes still for granted which
he should prove / he imagines all those learned fathers of that Council /
des^^^ute of judgment / and commen sense: which in setting down one / and the
self same canon four times / might worthily have been esteemed as bablyng
dyuines / as Bat^us a Pocte. And if the Council had been so grossly ouerseen:
yet how comes yt to pass / that that escaped the abridgers? Which are said
for shortness sake / to have browghte the 80, Canons into 70. Last of al / to
make this answer good / the reader must believe / (...) only that some of these
canons which this forger has added be true / and some false: but (for as much
as in the Canons alleged / the D. now sees that all in them contained / can
not befathered of the Nicene council) that in the same canon / one piece is
trwly / and another falsely fathered. As if we should not only not take the^
for brethren / which were begotten of one father: but in one / and the same
child / to esteem that the head / and the foot is base / and the arms / and
legs with the rest off the body / begotten in lawful matrimony. Thus yt
comes to pass / that as the deformity off the visadge is not helped / but
made worse by peinting so the D. fault / which might have had some excuse in
that he was abused / by this vain defense is inexcusable. Where upon I will
leave to the reader (which follows in the next diuisi.) whether upon light
credit unto some dissembling papists, he received these things with owte
examination: and whether in avoiding that / he makes him self guilty off a
greater fault.

Where have I refused ambrose for an historical witness? pertains this to the
story / whether an Archbishop be profitable for Diuis. 22. and 23. page 336.
the church / or no? whether he were or no / pertains: but whether meet / or
unmeet / is vvithowt the bounds off story. You had set down that Ambrose
allowed of an Archbishop: provoked by me / you can not show off his allowance.
And yet becawse you put me in remembrance off the story witness / when I
considered that nether the rest of his writings / nor other writers off the
same auncientie / and quarters / as Jerome / and Augustine / mention an
Archbishop: yt made me suspecte greatly / that there was corruption in that
place. After seeing how proudly / and swellingly he speaks off bishops / and
how basely off kings / saying the bishops are gold, and kings in comparison
off them but lead, and kings must put their nekes under the knees of the
bishops, and kiss their right hand (which speeches are ^a^ unlike Ambrose
style of kings): considering also that Erasm. nippeth that book in the head /
I assure my self that yt is a false Ambrose / and therefore that testimony to
be of no force. Wherein I am yet further confirmed by Ambrose own testimony /
who saying it is comely, that there 1. li. offic. cap. 50.
should be equality in the churches: which takes away bishops dominion. For
seeing that can not be understood off the whole company of the church: yt is
manifest that it must be restreined unto the mynisters theroff. and saving
this advantage / I answer to the next diuis. that yt shall appear after how
strange the name off the Archbishop was at that time.

For that alleged out off the Centuries / Ambrose was Metrapolitane off diverse
churches joined together: besides that you take that for granted which is in
co^trouersy / that is to say that the name of Metrapolitane / and Archbishop be
all one: you owghte to have showed the reasons vvherby they say so. For seeing
they have not that they vvrote by revelation: in a matter of controversy they
owghte no further to be believed / then they show reason. Otherwise I can
oppose also authority which says in plain words / Ambrose was a bishop not
of a whole province, or of Johannes Costerius in vita Ambros.
many cities, but off one only city. whose testomony yet is so much more off
credyt / then that off the Centuries / as by a nearer sight into Ambros.
works which he reuewed / he was better able to give judgment in this matter:
then they which occupied in reading off so many / could not perform that
diligente in all / which he in that author he especially labored in.

That I said of the Archbishop (if any were) ruling the action wherein the
bishops were ordained / and after the action ended having no more authority
the^ the rest / is vnconfuted / by any writer you allege. Calvin (the
ignorance of whose writings, with all otther, you obiecte unto me) does not
only not speak against yt: but says in some respect more then I. For I
speak this only of the Archbishop / alleged out of the counterfaict Ambrose:
but he (as I have showed) says generally of those ancient times / that the
Diuis. 71. page 418.
office off the Archbishop was rarely used. And that I said not (as you use)
withow reason: but with those reasons which you lifting at / can not move. For
where I showed yt not hke that one Archbishop ordained bishops / but other
bishops with him / Diuis. 24. page 336.
whose voices he gathered / the ancient counsels expressly forbidding that:
you say you showed yt not strange at that time, for a bishop alone to ordeine
ministers. Which thing how untrue yt is / I refer my self to that before
said. And if you had showed yt: yet in 2. Tra.
you making difference between a minister / and a bishop / in proving that one
bishop only ordained mynisters / have not proved that one bishop ordained
bishops. And in saying that Ambrose is to be understood, of that done by all
bishops in all places: you make them all gilty off breach off canons off the
general counsels in that behalf. Which how vntrwe yt is / may likewise
appear by that before said. Then how vain is yt / that for that the people
had in 2. Tra.
to do in the bishops election, one bishop alone withowt other his fellows,
did ordeine? After he asks. Where is now my distinction of election, and
ordination. First I declared that they being for the most part distinguished
/ are sometime taken for one. Secondly I have uttered no word whereby it is once
towched. Thirdly if I had taken yt away: yet: he same touches not this matter
/ as he says / but nether shows / nor can show how. only having nothing to
answer / he speaks in the clouds: where he is so far from being understood
of others / that I think he understood not him self.

His answer (Ambrose mente not off the Archbishop in the province where him
self was bishop) is first vpholden by flat begging of Diuis. 25. Page 337:
diverse things in controversy: as whether an archbishop / and metrapolitan be
all one / whether Ambrose were metrapolitane / and whether being / he had
authority him self to forbid such disorders. Secondly that he alleges to
remove yt from Ambroses province / makes rather against him. For if that
corruption he complained of / were in all places: then it was in his province
also: Where he says I am deceived, that I think he wrote his book for his
own diocese only: my words importe no such thing. yt is enowghe for me if in
the province where he was / this corruption had place: the further he will
strech those words / the depelier he wounds the government off the
archbishop. But this is more then duty / unto that counterfaicte Ambrose.

What truth this devise has / I am content yt be judged of the Diuis 26. Page
337.
reasons before alleged. my quotacion off the Centuries, was easy to find? if
you had not help of the table / the time yt self would quickly have directed
you. yt is in the begin^ing of the chapter which you alleged / so that if you
had red any more then served for yowr turn: you should have found how he
affirming / that in those days there were but three principal degrees off the
^lergie / bishop / elder / and deacon: alleges for proof Ambrose. The name
off Archbishop owte off Sozomen. makes not against this. considering that he
writing abowte the year 430. calls Simeon Archbishop / according to the time
wherein he vvrote / and not vvherin Simion lived. Nether does the place off
Epiphanius (alleged after owte of the Centuries) make against this. For
albeit the name of Archbishop was in his time / which lived either in Ambroses
time / or somewhat before: yet there is no likelihoode that it was then
received in the latin churches / seeing none off their writers of those times /
once make mention off that name. And it is certain that it being a greek name
/ was first received in the greek churches / and East parts / or ever it
came into the latin / and weaste.

Now for this great show the A. brings into the stage / they are scarce
worth the looking on: they shall have therefore a short answer. their authority
shall be considered after / being here altogether owte off place / and contrary
to the little off his chapter / and (according to the oulde coustome off
repetitions) propounded after: I here therefore deal only with the names. And
first for that off Metrapolitan: yt is showed that it is not the same in
signification with the Archbishops: yt is confessed that it was in the time off
the council off Nice / before which yt can not be showed / in any allowed
writer. for where the D. cites the Centuries / which call Cyprian which was
before it / Metrapolitan: they do so call him according to the coustome of
times which followed / as is before proved out off their own testimony. As

years: which is without our co^pas. for the name off an Archbishop / the
first mention alleged off him in any council / is nere upon 500. years.

Where yt is said / the name of an Archbishop is attributed unto Athanasius: he
should have told who does attribute that name / and then he had had his
answer. For nether in his worckes / nor in any ancient writer that speaks of
him / is it found. Indeed a Lou^nist does so call him: but he has no credit in
this cause. Where he alleges that the name of Archbishop is found in the 2.
Apology of Athanasius: if he show* Athanasius him self speaking so in his
own language / I believe him: if he can not / he must change his style / and
in steed off Athanasius / say the translator off Athanasius. And beside that
the Emperor set one John a Miletian / either heretic / or schismatike to be
more then quarter master with him: if yt be true that he has so earnestly
disputed before / that an archbishop, and Metrapolitan be all one, Alexandria
being the metrapolitan city page 334.
only / and the bishop thereof the only metrapolitan: yt must needs fall out
/ that where this other Archbishop is supposed off the D. to have been / there
could be no archbishop / and consequently that that is the translatours fault.

There remains only Epiphanius, the first off ancient vvriters that gave
this name place in his writings. I am content therefore let this be the first
flight off that name in to the church: which being abowte the year off our
Lord 389. at what time Ephanius flourished / near upon 400. years: yt is
apparent that both the Ans. is greatly ouershot / which would make us believe
this name to have been from the times of the Apostles: and that I kept my
self within my bounds / in saying the name off Archbishop can not be shevved
in any allowed writer, by the space off 300 years after Christ. As for that
he would prove yt to have been in Peter the bishop of Alexandrias time, which
was before the Nicene cocell, becawse Epiph. does call him Archbishop: yt has
been often answered / that that title was not of the Person / but of the times
vvherin Epiphanius vvrote. For when the vvriters before him / and those in
Peter's time / speaking off Peter call him bishop always / Eusebius. li. 7. ca.
32.
and not archbishop / and not him only / but Achilles / Alexander / and
Athanasius / which succeeded him: is there any man of so smail judgment / as
not to understand that this alteracion off title / came off the alteracion off
times? So we see that off all the testimonies the Answ. has mustred / there is
not one that has stricken one stroke / in the quarrel off that antiquity off
the name off Archbishop.

The two next sections / I leave to the Judgment off the reader: saving that
besides the vanity off thexcuse of Basils poverty / joined with vntrwth /
considering that Basil had not been so small a while bishop in one place / and
other / but he might have gotten some wull on his thread bear gown / if the
fleese off his Archbishopricke had hand yt: yt shall appear (God willing) that
as this poverty accompanied the bishops in perfequution: so the ordenary of
all godly bishops off those times / and long after / which lived in great peace
/ was as far from this lordly estate / as the honest frugalitie off diverse
mynisters with us / is from the riotous port off a bishop. As for my narrow
search off a comma, wheroff he speaks his pleasure: he might know that
althowge a comma be but a little prick: yet yt often makes a great matter. The
greatness off the metrapolitanship of Basile over Capadocia, was scarce a
plowghe land in comparison off that which you imagine. I for there were at the
least two Metrapolitanships in Capadocia: one in Caesaria / where Selladius
which succeeded Basil was bishop / an other in Nissa / where Gregory Basils
brother was. Beside Soc. lib. 5. cap. 8.
that / if it were trwe you say after / that Pontus perteined unto the Bishop
of Constantinople: Capadocia being in yt / Basil was his underling / and
therefore no cause why he should be called so great a metrapolitan, as you
pretend. Diuis. 28. page 342.


Here destitute off all defense / he flies from the cawse unto by matters /
partly vain / and partly false: which I will void in as few words as I ca^
/ before I come to the poincte off the cawse. Where he says Simeon
tharchbishop was a bowte the council off Nice, and therefore no cawse to accuse
those times, more then the former examples, and for proof alleges that he was
martyred by Sapore: if yt Niceph 7. lib. 20. cap.
he trw that is written / Sapores beginning his reign abowte the year of the
lord 310. and reigning 70. years / yt might be well for any thing yet alleged
/ that he was martyred abowte the year 380 and if we follow his account / yet
yt is answered. Where he says I declare my vnskillfullnes, in saying the
bishop of Constantinople Diuis. 26. 337.
challenged not the pre-eminence over all: let yt be noted that the hunger he
has to reprehend my vnskillfullnes / presses him so violently / that feeding
one yt so gredyly / he has not so soon swallowed / as he is compelled to
regorge / and lay them up again. For in the next sentence reprehending me as
if I had said / that the bishop Page 334
off Constantinople challenged the title off universal Patriarche in the
council off Calcedon / he plainly affirms he did not challenge yt: yet I say
not that he challenged that name / but only that he might ordein bishops off
Asia, etc. Where he would prove my unskillfulness, becawse Pelagius / and
Gregory Bishops off Rome / write against the Bishop off Constantinople for
that cawse: in deed so he may easily find him self talk / if when I speak
of the bishop of Constantinople which was in the time off the Calcedon Council
/ he talk off the Bishop off Connstantinople more then 100. year after.
Whether this be either to trifle / or not to know these things the knowledge
wheroff he so often chalengeth / let the reader judge. Again he says / the
name off universal bishop, was offered unto the bishop off Rome in the
council off Calcedon, and notwithstanding says / yt was first given unto the
bishop of Constantinople in the Council of Constantinople, being long after:
Which are things unlikely. For he making the Bishop of Rome / to begin his
claim to that title / so long before: yt is not to be thought / that being
then offered him / he would refuse yt. Which if yt were true / the bishop of
Constant. could not be the first that had that title given him / in the
Council of Constant. long after.

But yowr lodes man here as in other places / has seduced Pigh. 6. l. Hierar.

you. For this was taken out off Pighius / and objected off Harding against
the bishop off Salisbury: unto whom alleging for the proof thereof the
Epistles off Pope Gregory / the bishop answers / he could not refuse that
which was never offered him. And the trwth is / that not only there is no
such offer to be found in that Council / but things plainly repugnant. For
yt says expressly / the bishop off Constantinople shall have equal Calced.
16. Actio. Cap. 28.
preuiledges with Rome. And the same Council gives the same honor throwghowt
unto the bishop off Constantinople / which yt gave the bishop off Rome: saving
that becawse yt was the first seat off the Empire / yt is content that yt
shall have the first place. The same also may appear by the second
provincial Council off Constantinople / where this is repeated 3. Cap.
out off the Calcedon Council. Now seeing this council made the Bishop of
Constantinople equal in privileges / and honor with the Bishop off Rome: yt
must needs be a mere fable off Pope Gregory / the Papists / and our D. that
this Council offered unto the Bishop off Constantinople / the title off
universal Bishop. Thus with my vnskilfullnes, I am constrained to make up the
gap / the D. lays open unto the Papists.

Where he says Constantinople required nothing, but according to the 6. canon
off the Council of Nice: he greatly erreth. For first the privileges of the
church of Antioche / in that council were clean dashed / and the whole state
off the church being divided into the rule off four / that is the bishop off
Rome / Constantinople / Alexandria / and Jerusalem: the churches were browght
into miserable servitude / which may appear by the Council off
Constantinople: which decreeing this afterward / autoriseth the canon off that
matter / by the council off Calcedon. Secondly whereas the Council. Constant. 2
cap. 3. 6.
Council of Nice reserved to every province her privileges / and honor whereof
this was part (as appearethe by other decrees) that the bishops of every
province should choose their metrapolitane: he off Constantinople took a way
these privileges / from the greateste part off the churches throw owght the
whole world: considering that he had by this council / th appointing of the
Metrapolitans off part of Europe / and of all Asia / saving a little corner
vvherin they had pinned up the bishop off Jerusalem. Thirdly yt is clear /
that not only at the time of the Nicene Council he had no such large
domynion: but his Jurisdiction long after / was shut up within the bands off
Thracia only / withowt having any thing to do either in Pontus / or Asia: as
appears clearly both by Socrates / and by a former council off
Constantinople. Thus may the Answ. great skill / for the show whereof he has
thus ranged from the cawse / easily appear.

Now let yt be considered what is answered unto the argument / whereby upon the
words of the council off Carthage (the bishop of the first seat, should not
be called the chief off the Preistes, or the high preiste, or any such thing)
I concluded the title off the Archhishop forbidden. He says that was made
against the bishop off Rome, and the meaning off that Council was, that no
bishop should be called by the name off universal bishop: which is first
directly against that he has said before / off the title off the universal
bishop / offered in the Council off Calcedon unto the bishop of Rome. For if
Rome desired not that title / yea refused it offered: then there was no such
cause off the decree off the African Counsels / to bridle it in the title off
universal bishop. Secondly this exposition brings manifest force to the
counsels words. For if the name of an Archbishop be not sufficiently
forbidden / by these words (Prince off the preistes) which in the counsels
language confounding preiste / and bishop / is all one with the name off an
Archbishop: yet it is forbidden by those words which follow / no bishop shall
be called by any such name. And if that be not sufficient / 10 stop the way
against such trifling cauils as these: yet the words that follow (he shall
only be called the bishop of the first seat) are so plain that he must
have a very hard forhead / that will go abowte to owtface them.

Moreover Gratian adds as a part off this canon: but universal bishop, let
not the bishop off Rome himself be called. distin. 9^.
Whereby is manifest how vain the D. shifte is. For onles he had in the former
words / mente all other bishops: there can be no place for these / no not the
bishop off Rome. and onles the council had meant some other thing then
universal bishop / by these words chief preiste: there is no place for these /
universal bishop. For if we should follow the D. exposition / we should make
the council speak after this sort: the bishop off Rome shall not be called
universal bishop: but universal bishop, no not the bishop off Rome him self
shall be called. Which when yt is absurd / we must needee hold that this
Council provided / not only against the ambition of the bishop off Rome /
but off all other: and not against the puff of the name / of universal
bishop only / but against the smokeie title off Archbishop / Patriarch / etc.

Furthermore / in another council which confirms the canons off this / it
appears plainly / that that canon was made especially for the African
churches / for the provinces off Numidia / 4. Council Carthage.
Mauritania / and Tripolis. For Aurelius / and Musonius presidents off that
Council / in their Epistle to the Bishop off those provinces / charge them
that they had not kept those canons: and show how some covered them selves by
ignorance off them. And not only the council off Carthage / holden somewhat
more then 400. years after Christ / forbids these lofty titles: but the
council off Carthage whereat Cyprian was / within 200. and od years after
Christ / is found off the same judgment with this / that no bishop should be
called bishop of bishops So that to avoid this argument / the Answ. must be
compelled to say / that the bishop of Rome claimed the title off universal
bishop / within about 200. and 50. years after Christ: which althowghe he
dare much / I think he dare not answer. Again / he may understand that he
has the bishop for party. For he alleging out off Origin / that the
mynisters in the very time off Bishop off Sar. 4. Art. Diuis. 33.
persequution vvhileste he lived / passed the owtrage off worldly Princes:
adds that for that cawse / this canon of the Council of Carthage which I
have set down / was made. Gyuing plainly to understand / that it was to kill
the yche off ambition in the whole order off ministry: not as he bears us
in hand / only in respect off one person. And if there be any credit to be
given unto Gregory / there were nighe 600. years at the least run out / or
ever the bishop there / made claim unto this title. For he says / no bishop
off Rome until his time, had taken to him self that 4. lib. Epist. 32.
title off singularity, or would ever consent to be called by so profane a
name, off universal bishop.

Now let us see his reasons. The first is / Celestinus bishop of Rome, claimed
the hearing of matters in the Africane churches, as appears by the Africane
Council But how does he not see that the Council off Carthage / the Canon
wheroff I alleged / was before that council? His answer therefore is / that
the Council off Carthage by way off Propheceye / decreed against the ambition
off Celestinus / not then bishop. And althowgh this be absurd / yet that which
follows is yet more: that this canon should be to provide against the
ambition of the bishop of Constantinople, which challenged the name off
universal bishop / about two hundred years after this canon made. To
understand faults so particularly / and provide remedies so especial against
them before they be / requires a higher watch tower / then any council off
bishops could ever clyme into. And as for the Africane council / nether in the
words alleged by the D. nor any other off that Council does it appear /
that the Bishop off Rome claimed the title off universal bishop. But as Julius
bishop off Rome had done at the Council off Antioch / he owtreached in
claiming the hearing off cawses / which perteined not unto him. In which
respect the Council made a special chapter / that whosoever should appeal
beyond the seas / should not be received into communion off any in Africa.
Which chapter is not the 6. but 92. nether is it off titles, and Afric. council.
ca. 92.
names, but off jurisdiction.

Where he says / there were as hauty names in those times, as off Primat, and
for proof provoke unto the greek copy off that Council off Carthage: there
is no advantage in the Greek copy / which only makes mention off one first
amongst the bishops: and he is greatly deceived if he think / that to be first
bishop / is as much as to be Prince off Bishops. For the Bishop off Rome in
respect of the three other Patrigrckes / was first: yet not their Archbishop /
but only had the first place in their meetinges. Especially seeing the Council
does flatly forbid / that the first bishop amongst them should be called by
that name / but only bishop off the first seat. For that out of master Fox /
that these names Archbishop, etc. are not forbidden by this canon: I refer the
reader to his own worckes / with this remembrance that I have showed in the
former book / how Master Fox counts these degrees ambicious. As for the name
high priest out of Ignatius: if need were it may be showed both by reasons /
and authority / that he is not off that auncientie the D. supposes. Beside
that he gives it not to any one especially / but to all a like.

Affording you four witnesses, I allowed you one to many / Diuis. 29. Page 344.
two off them being counterfaicte. And if he will have part off those decrees
lawful / and part bastard: he must show that this was off Samasus / out off
some other then off this forger. Whether off these true bishops was first /
makes nothing to this question: yt is certain those you have alleged / are
counterfaictes. But becawse Jerome which lived in the true Samasus time /
makes mention off an archdeacon / let yt be granted to the D. which he
desires: does he think that Damasus mouth was so holy / that with once naming
an Archdeacon / he could sanctify thoffice for ever? yes for he was a
virtuous, learned, and godly bishop. But I have showed that amongst men / the
best ground bears th^sseis. Yea what if the D. praise / wheroff he is so
liberal when yt serves his turn / be to high / and it be found that he was
not so godly as he pretends? what if althowgh the tyranny were not so great /
as in his counterfaicre Damasus time / yet this Damasus off whom he would
father tharchdeacon / spoke in the Dragons voice: when he shameth not to write
that the bishop off Romes sentence was above all other / to be attended Soz.
li. 6. 23.
for in a Synod? whereby still appears how dangerous yt is / to fetch
example off government from those times.

To that I alleged off the names off Acoluthes / and Subdeacons / etc.
ancient / and yet not convenient: he answers / peradventure they were
profitable. So the profit off tharchdeacon being yet upon the die / and in
dowbt: we must notwithstanding have him thruste upon us. To that off Monks
auncienter then thardeacon / he answers nothing: but that yt follows not if
they were unlawful, that tharchdeacon is so. but yt follows well that if the
monk / with others are antichristian / notwithstanding their auncientie: that
yt is an evil proof you use / that the archdeacons etc. are not Antichristian
/ becawse they were ancient: wherein stand all yowr proofs. Whereas he says /
his purpose was only to show the antiquity of these names, and therefore I do
him wrong, which require he should have browght the approbation of these autors
towching them: both he has undertaken to prove / that these names are not
against the word / and after he concludes upon these restimonies / page 298.
that these names are not only ancient, but allowed off the best, eldeste,
worthieste writers, and councels. So appears that my accusation is just /
Page 348.
and that he took upon him to great a bourden. As for the auncientie off the
name Archdeacon / yt is not showed before almost 400. years after Christ:
which times how corrupt they were / has in part / and will after more
appear.

Can there be plainer words to prove that the Archdeacon was no minister /
then those whereby Sozomene puts difference Diuis. 30. Page 345. Soz. 7. lib.
19. ca.
between an Archdeacon / and an elder / making them several members? And where
he says / by that reason the Archdeacon should be no deacon, nor the bishop
no preiste, considering that these are there likewise distinguished: I merueill
that he will dally after this sort. For althowgh under the name off Deacon /
and priest / tharchdeacon / and bishop be comprehended: Yet who understands
not / that as when bishop / and archbishop are compared together / one does not
/ nor can not comprehend the other: so deacon / and Archdeaco^ / there expressly
compared / are opposed members / and can not be comprehended one of another.
For Deacons being divided into archdeacons / and those called by the commen
name of Deacons / likewise priests into bishops / and which are commonly
called priests (onles we will imagine that Sozome could not tell how to speak)
we must needs take them for distinct members. Further if the Archdeaco^ be
comprehended of any the rest of members in this place / it is under the
Deacons: and if he be contained under a priest also / then both the Deacon
which comprehends an archdeacon / must be contained under priest / and Sozome
is yet more ridiculous / which of one only coustome has made four. Beside
that / Jerome opposing an archdeacon unto an Epist. ad Rust. monach.
arch elder / or in yowr language archpriest / saying every church has her
archdeacon, and archpriest: declares manifestly / that the archdeacon was no
priest. And by Gregory's epistle / which writing unto the archdeacon off a
certain church / makes the title unto the Deaco^ off such a church: appears
that the Archdeacon Epist. 1. lib. 10.
was not a priest / but a Deacon.

It is a simple exception against the Council off Vrbane / that it is not to
be found in the tome off Counsels, especially when I cite Diuis. 31. page 346.
it but for a story witness: seeing there are some Counsels of more weight out
off that book / then some in yt. When Sozome tieth the archdeacon to the
church of Alexandria / as well as the Elders / and Deacons / onles he wll say
that the Elders / and Deacons were not tied unto that church: he must confess
that the archdeacon was. Which if it were not clear by Sozome / is manifest by
the words of Jerome / and Gregory before recited. Where he says / we have no
archdeacon not tied to one church: seeing he is called the archdeacon off such a
shire / and has his office not in one / but a hundred churches: I leave it to
the readers Judgment / with what boldness he determines to owtface all truth.
Likewise I leave to his judgment / whether Ieromes words (which to declare
the Ierom. ad Euag.
manner off the bishops election / brings for example the choice of the
archdeaco^ by the Deaco^s) be clear to prove that I have alleged the^ for:
and how frivolous he is in his shifts / as thowgh it were so strange a thing /
for the soldiers to choose their Captain: and how he takes it for granted /
that it is not material who chose the archdeacon / which is before confuted:
and last of all / how well he concludes / that forasmuch as a bishop is above
a Deacon, therefore he is above the whole college off Deacons. Likewise how
soundly he has answered unto the 2. next sections: which to avoid the
subjection off the archdeacon unto the minister / is driven to deny that an
Archdeacon is a Deacon / which notwithstanding affirms that an Archbishop /
is a bishop: yt being also before showed / that Gregory calls an archdeacon
Deacon / and being more clearer then the day / that as the archelder was both
an Elder / and under any bishop: so the Archdeacon was a Deacon / and of right
under any Elder. Considering that Jerome speaks of that Deacon / at whose
testimony an Elder was made: which one may easily understand / to have been an
archdeacon.

I leave the things before handled / off Residence on a certain place for
every minister: here is question only / what likelihood Diuis 33. page 347.
our Deanes have with the old. Which becawse the D. will not perceive / I must
be compelled to show Augustines wodes to him better. First therefore the Deanes
were monks (for Ierom. ad Nepot. and ad Rust.
often monks one was Deane) and consequently not ministers: when it is
manifest by stories / that the old monks were not only no ministers of the
word / but not so much as within any order ecclesiastical. Secondly it was a
reproach for those monks / and Deanes to be in any city / or great town:
seeing that a city Ierom ad Rusticu^. Sozom 1. lib. 13,
was a prison unto monks / and agreed unto them as dry la^d unto fish.
Thirdly their profession was to labor / and to gain their living by hand:
nether was it lawful for them otherwise to live / so that he that did not
labor / was esteemed as a thief: beside that / their diet was very homely /
and gross. Hitherto I think there is nothing like with our Deanes. Now where
the Answ says / the Deanes were set over the other 9. Monks, and so in their
rule resemble ours: he forgets that their rule was but in provision for
meat / and playing the part off their Cater / wheroff they made account unto
the Father. Of whom there was no cawse the D. should make mention here: but
that he finding no deanly authority in this poor Deane / would feign make it
out in the father: whilst he would make the reader believe / that the Father /
and Deane / were all one.

Where he says / these were godly societies which Augustine speaks off: I
will not deny but that Jerome / and August. with others commend them / as it
is not hard to show that discommend them: Theodor. li. 4. ca. 11.
but that they were so (what show soever they bore) being instituted besides
the warrant off the word / I utterly deny. Wherein I will refer my self to the
treatises off diverse learned me^ / which have handled that matter: that I be
not compelled here to set upon this vermin / which the Ans. raises again from
hell / to help the office off the Deane. it is enough to have showed / that
beside the name / and institution withowt warrant of Gods word / they have
nothing in commen. As for the unspeakable profit he says they bring unto the
church, it is but his coustome with riotous / and ouerrunning words / to
supply the beggerie of his reasons: and yt is confuted in an other place. There
remains one testimony page 472.
perteining to this question off tharchbishop / taken out of Beza / whereby the
Ans. would prove these names good / and holy. Whereunto before I answer / to
thend yt may appear that the D. does but hunt after words / contrary to
men's constant practice / and manifest writings: I am compelled here to open
/ what Bezaes judgment is off them.

upon 13 Act.
First I have showed before / how he holds that the name of dominion, wheroff
the Archbishop / and archdeacon be made / does not agree unto the ministry.
Secondly / in upon 1. Philip.
an other place he so far misliketh / that any should be called archbishop /
that he says the order which for policy sake was taken in the ancient
church, that one only amongst the Elders of every church, should have the
name off bishop, or president, was the first foundation which the devil
laid off tyranny in the church. After it came to Metrapolitanes, which they
call archbishops: which distinction had notvvithstanding a glorious pretense,
that Synodes might be the easelier called, and some order kept in government
of things. Then, to four Patriarchs: from four to two, from two to one,
which is the Pope. In the end for conclusion he adds: behold what it is to
go a nail breadeth, from the word off God. Thirdly / that the ancient
Confess. 5 ca. art. 29
fathers established amongst the bishops Metropolitanes / he confesses a good
intent: but for so much as that horrible tirannie which proceeded off them, did
ruin the churches, and now hinders the reformacion off them, we will
(says he) content our selves with the coustome, and order off the Apostles,
etc.

But what will the D. say to that he says / Archbishops, In his Epist. ep. 1.
and Primates are a shadovv, and image of the policy of Rome, which came in
by little, and little? that he calls them pety tyrants in respect off the
Pope? that althovvgh the names be never so ancient, yet it ovvght to have been
inquired whether it were lavvfull to bring them into the church: and if it
were, yet whether it be expedient now in this regeneration off the gospel,
to set up a fresh, or to abolishe them? that he says / it is an other reason
of a Bishop, Pastor, Deacon, Elder, as those which are instituted by the holy
ghost? that he is so far from allowing Archbishops / that our kind of bishops
he calls counterfaict bishops, relics of popery such as will bring in
Epicurisme? that all which vvil the churches safe, must take heed of that
pestilence? that M. Knox which had put them to flight / should take heed that
he suffered them not to come in again, althovvgh it pretend to have great force
to keep unity, under which pretense it deceived the ancient Fathers? Thus yt
appears what Bezaes judgment is / both off these names / and offices.

Now I return to the places alleged off the D. Where he is said to affirm
that archbishops, etc. are called in scriptures by one commen name off Pastors,
and Bishops: his words can not be referred unto the name / or office of
Archbishop. For considering there is no mention off them in scripture / the
scripture can not call them Pastors / and Bishops: especially seeing he shows
how they are Pastors / in respect off administration off the word / and
Sacraments / not in that they rule over Bishops: in which regard only it is
confessed that they were called Archbishops / etc. Where he affirms him to
call the names holy: the names which he calls holy / are the names of
Apostles / and bishops / not of archbishops etc. which may appear by that
following (and therefore they glory off the succession off the Apostles, and
true Bishops). For seeing they convey them selves unto the succession off the
Apostles / and Bishops under the cloak off names: what names are so fi^ to
disguise them / that they might be so taken / as those? And where he says / he
reckeneth up archdeacons, Canons, Seniors, Deanes, subdeacons, clearkes
amongst degrees taken out off the word off God, and from the Primitive church:
first he has not they were taken, but they seem to have taken, etc. Then if
the ancient church be taken / for that almost 400. years after Christ (as yt
may be / compared with that ^00. years after Christ): we deny not but these
names were in the Primitive church Moreover the Ans. to help the Dean / has
falsified Beza / translating for Deacon, Deane: which have no more kindred /
then a mat and a mattock. Last off all / if he could have brought this
testimony out off Beza / for allowance off names: yet he should have been
afraied to have used this advantage / seeing that place ministers more weapons
to beat / then to defend him. For there he condemns flatly / as a rabble, and
filthy assemble of monsters, unheard off in the ancient church, the degrees of
Suffraganes, Officials, Proctors, Vicares, Chapleines, etc: none off which I
suppose the D. may well spare / in upholding that estate which he phansieth so
good.

I appele not unto the Apostles times only / but unto the doctrine / Diuis.
36. page 349.
and order established: where we are sure there is light withowt darcknes /
truth withowt danger off errors. And if we leaving thapostles / should take a
patron off government off men / which may be deceived: yt owght rather to be
drawn from the Apostles times / then from those 500. years after: those being
so much purer / as they were nearer the incomparable brightness of the gospel
which shyned then / and further from those mistie times off Antichrist /
wherewith after the whole earth was ouercast. For if this man off sin being in
the eg in thappostles time / receyned by little and little continual increase /
until he came to his full growght: I see not why there was not as great odds
/ between the pureness off the church in thapostles time / and that 500. years
after / as between this / and that 1000. year after the Apostels. And if there
were no remedy against the corruptions off those purest times / but in taking
heed to the light which the Lord had set up in the doctrine / and government
off thapostles: how much more for remedy against such palpable darcknes / as
covered the face off the earth in our times / owght we to have resorted unto
that perfect / and vnmedled light? not unto them whose both heavens were
darker / and sight dimmer: and which beside greater night within them selves /
by reason off their infirmity / had less day withowt by reason of the glowmie
times. To that alleged / and confirmed / that these dignities off
Metrapolitanes / archbishops / etc. were as the hands that pulled, the feet
which brovvght, the shoulders that lifted up the Pope into his seat, which
otherwise he could never have atteined unto: the Ans. says only / that
sects, and heresies gave strenght unto Antichrist: which is nothing to
purpose / as thowgh both these could not stand well together.

Where he says / the writers, and Counsels off 500. years, labored to keep
out Antichrist, and therefore things taken from them, can not justly be
suspected: I merueill he understands not / first / that diverse off that
auncientie he speaks off / and off the chiefest Athana fius quaes. 29. and
30. Ambr. 10 lib. upon Luke. ca. 13. Ierom upon Daniell 9. 11.
of them / knew not what Antichrist was: but imagined fnodly of him / as of one
singular person / and that he should starte up soudenly / etc. that Elias
should come to destroy him / that he should be borne of the Jews / that he
should reign in Jerusalem / and diverse other such fables. Secondly / that he
remembers not the ignorance off men to be such / that they often times make
him a bridge / against whom they think to stop the passage. Thirdly / that
being oftentimes ouermastred off their affections / with hinderance off the
truth / they give somewhat to them. Further / that errors / and heresies (as
he says) strengthening Antechriste: he could forgette the manifold errors /
which are to be found in the fathers of the time he prescribes. Last off all
/ if he could be ignorante off these things: yet examples off our days might
have tawght him / that even now there be which knowing Antichriste / and
detesting him / cease not to maintain things / whereby that kingdom partly
stands.

Where he says / no man of modesty, and learning, will condemn orders of that
time withowte manifest proof, especially in government: I would gladly know
of him why he should add / especially in government. what reason can he show
/ why we should not call their government to as narrow a search / and as
straight a trial / as their doctrine? When as yt can not be but where the
Doctrine is attainted / the infection theroff must needs come unto the
discipline: especially when the Mynisters / which sit at the sierne off
government / be seized with that evil. And the discipline of the church
being the wall / wherewith the doctrine is kept safe: as in a city the wall is
that which feels the first assault / and is battered before the city can
lie open to the violence off the artillery: so in the siege off the church by
spiritual ennemies / the discipline / and government is that / wherinto the
first breach is made. So that having good cawse to hold for suspecte /
whatsoever either in doctrine / or in government those times left unto us /
not confirmed by substanciall proofs owte of the word: we have yet better
cawse to mistruste their government / as that which having abidden the
greatest brunte / has more need off reparacions. This appears in the
first Council of Nice / Council Nic. 11. 12 13. can before tovvched.
where the most off errors decreed upon / were in the discipline / and not so
much in the doctrine: beside the ungodly coustome / which may appear to have
occupied almost all the churches / towching the forbidding of the second
mariadge off ministers / before that council.

Furthermore / I would know what charter the Answ. can show / that the first
500. years (within compass whereof he has browght his testimonies) be just
the time off the primitive church / nether more nor less. But thus must he
do / that having nothing else / he might with this glorious title off the
primitiue^ church / dasell the eyes off the simple. Last off all / when he
says there was no function browght into the church the first 500. years /
allowed by general council / or credible writer / not meet for that time /
and alowable by the word off God: besides the gross demand off that in
question: I would know off him wherefore served exorcistes / when the gift off
casting forth evil spirits / was ceased? what he will answer unto Ad
Eustochium de custodia virginitatis.
Ieromes monks / De vita Pauli.
Eremites / De vita Hilarionis.
Anchoristes? Which were at that time very gross. what to the four
Patriarchs / or rather three? Which by the general Council off Calcedon /
soon after 400. years / had the government off churches throwghe owte all
the world. whether he allow of that famous robbery / whereby the bishop off
Rome / Constantinople / and Alexandria (for the bishop of Jerusalem beside the
name / had scarce aplowgh land in comparison off the rest) parted the state
off the whole inheritance off Christ? And if it be true which he pa. 344.
affirmed / that the Council of Calcedon offered the name universal bishop /
unto the bishop off Rome: how will he maintain that no general Council
within 500. years, allowed any office not agreeable unto the word of God, and
meet for those times? Finally / what will he say to that yt was (as Julius
bishop Sozo. li. 3. ca. 10.
of Rome says) decreed by the laws off the church / and immediately after the
Nicene Council / that the Bishop off Rome must be called to the Synod: and
that it was void which was done there / beside his sentence? Thus you may see
/ that yowr self enemy to Antechrist / throwghe your inordinate desire of
making good that you have once setdowne / have given him more ground / then he
could ever by strong hand off disputation conquer.

If there were no other difference between the times off the Diuis 37. Page 349.

as ever yt peeped up, no infection Euse. lib. 3. ca. 32.
being hable to lay hold off the chief governors, which in his times had
possessed the best off them: that alone is sufficient to show / that
examples may be safely fetched from the Apostels times / which can not be
withowt great danger / drawn from his times. But does not the D. see how
greatly he is abused / which compares the heretics off the Apostels times /
with the Catholics off his? their utter falling away / with the corruption of
others? Whereas if he would have answered to that I set down: he should have
compared Catholic governors / with Catolike governors. But he to lift up the
credit off his times / and to make them equal / or rather for the matter off
government superior unto the Apostels: compares the rose of his / with the
thorns off the Apostels times / the gold off those / with the dross off
these. And althowghe yt be gross answer / yet as if one should glory in his
shame / in the next sextion he insulteth upon me / as thowghe he had answered
very aptly / and I had spoken in the air. Whereupon I will leave yt to the
consideration off the reader / whether he seeking to advance his testimonies in
those words ( Pa. 348.

purpose showed / that those times were not pure / nor virginlyke / but that

Rome, etc. how untrue that is may cuidnetly appear / for as much as the bishop

claimed superiority page 342.
off all churches, and taken upon him as yt were the name, off universal
bishop. Nether did that proud statelines of the Romish Bishop / which
Socrates speakethe of / begin in Celestinus which banished the Nouatians /
but was in his predecessors / Boniface / Zosimus / and Innocentius / etc. as
may appear by diverse monumentes of that time. And Socrates does not reprove
them for that they were ennemies to the Nouatian heretics / but for that they
took upon them to exile them which perteined not unto the Bishop / but unto
the magistrate. Also it appears that Theodosius the Emperor / had permitted
the Nouatians to have Socr. 5. li. ca. 20.
a church there: so that there was double fault in the Bishop / which in steed
that he should have contented him self to preach / that it was not meet to have
such heretics in the church: took upon him to put them out / both by strong
hand / and contrary to the Emperors permission. And if Celestinus were such
as the D. has told us: then it is so far that Socrates speaking off him as
I have alleged / did it of evil will / that he is rather to be be accused for
to soft speech / in such a heinous fault.

Where he says I have falsified Socrates, which for passing beyond the
limits of priestehood to an owtwarde dominion, have set down, leaving the

Caput 3, Diuis. 1.
THat the reader may have clearer light / to judge of our writings on both
sides in the rest off this controversy / and that we may be better furnished
of weapons / against this great levy off pretended autorities; two questions
seem necessary to be decided / before we come unto them. The one / whether
the word off God has ordained that in every several congreation there
should be a bishop: which the Answ. does flatly deny / and Page 328.
further says / yt appears owte off certain ecclesiastical writers, and
the exampels off Timothe, and Titus, that the Apostels appointed bishops, only
in principal towns and cities. The other is / whether there were allowed in
one city / 2. or more bishops: which likewise he flatly denies can be showed
to have been from Christ^^ time, and that the whole practice page 366. Page 444
off the prymitiue church is against yt. If these things be showed to have
been ordained off the Apostels: yt must follow that this institution off God /
banished by Satan / owght to be called home / an that all authority off men /
and coustome exalted against this / must yealde the^ selves prisoners.
Likewise if these be showed / the trwthe of exposition of the testimonies of
the most aunciente writers / shall better appear: vvherby we have shute the
bishoplike authority in the circuit / and roundell of one church: which the
Ans. would have extended unto a realm / or diocese. And so shall come to pas /
that they which having all their senses possessed of the coustome of these later
/ and corrupter times / when they read or hear off a bishop in the scripture
/ or in the most auncie^te writers / conceive forthwith a bishop of the same
mould that ours be / shall a great deal easelier correct their error. For if
a bishop in the Apostels time / and off their institution / was the bishop off
one church only: by all likelihood those times which followed next after
them / kept them nearest unto that image: whereupon will fall owte / that this
usurped authority of bishops over their fellow ministers / did by little and
little increase / according to the measure of time further from that wherein
thapostels lived / and nearer unto that wherein Antichrist was fully settled.
which things although they have light enough in them selves: yet to clear
this matter better / there shall be (God willing) set down certain testimonies
of the most ancient times: whereby as by certain traces / the truth off these
things may be easelier found out.

The first that every particular church should have her bishhop / is manifest
by Paul to Timothe. For seeing the description of 1. Tim. 3.
a bishop which he gives / does agree unto the minister of every congregation
/ and nothing there required in the one / which is not in the other: it
follows that the minister off every congregation / is the bishop theroff. For
the description agreing with every of them: the things described must
likewise. Secondly / onles he do by this description off the bishop / set
forth the nature off every minister of the word in his congregation: in
describing the offices off the church / he has left out the principalest
members / and was more careful in describing the Deacons ministry / not
occupied in the word / then the preaching ministeries, but that is absurd: yt
must follow / that he understood them by the name off bishop. Furthermore S.
Paul's bishop was appointed to the same place / whereunto his Deacons: but his
Phili. 1. Act. 6.
Deacons were assigned to a particular congregation / as appears both by the
use of the scriptures / and also by that after this corruption entered / that
every church had not her bishop: yet it had her Deacons / as is to be Athana.
Apol. 2. Ierom. cont. Lucifer.
seen by that alleged of the Deacons off the churches off Mariotes. S. Paul
also there assigning the charge / and care of the bishop / over the church of
God / must either give him charge over the whole body of the catholic church:
or over one particular congregation: or of the faithful company of one house.
but he extends not his charge over all the Catholic church / for that were
to make a Pope / not a bishop: nor restrains him to the faithful of one
howshoulde / considering that he opposes the government off his house / to
the government of the church: yt follows therefore that he appoints him to
one particular church. That by this word church / must be understood one of
these three significacions / yt stands upon this grownd: that in none off S.
Paul's other Epistles / or S. Lukes writings / that word church is ever used
otherwise / and never signifies the church either off Province / or Dioces. For
when the Apostles utter the company off belieuers in such a circuit: they
always speak in the plural nombre / and call them the churches of such / and
such a place. And if it can be showed that this word is taken in them / for the
faithful in a whole province / or dioces: I will give over the hold of this
argument. If (as I persuade my self) that can not be done: then the church
assigned unto S. Paul's bishop / is a particular congregation.

Moreover S. Paul writing to Tite / to appoint Elders throwgh every town /
which were unblameable: adds because a Tite 1.
bishop must be unblameable. Whereupon either every town must have a bishop: or
his reason is not well knit. For he should both give his rule off one thing /
and his reason off an other: and it should come to pass / that those churches
which have no bishops / might lawfully have slanderous / and spotted bishops
seeing his only reason why elders of every town owght to be withowt reproach /
is because a bishop must be so. Again where it is said that Paul / and
Barnabas appointed by voice elders in every Act. 14.
church / either beside the auncientes off the church the Bishop was ordained:
or else the famous cities of Antioche / I conium / and Listra / in the number of
those churches there mentioned / received no bishop. But the Ans. him self
affirms / that the Apostels ordained bishops, in the principal cities, and
towns: therefore under these words * they ordained elders by voice in every
church, is understood that they ordained bishops in every church. For S.
Luke using the same words to set for the the ministry off all other churches
/ wherewith he settethe forth the ministry off those famous cities / unless
he will deny there were Bishops there: he must off necessity grant / that
the other churches had their bishops as well as they.

Last off all unless yt be the institution off God / that every particular
congregation should have her bishop: in that largies / and bountiful
liberality of ecclesiastical ministers / which S. Paul shewethe our Savior
Christ bestowed upon his church Ephesians. 4. 11.
after he was ascended / nothing falls to the lot of the partilar churches.
But yt is horrible injury unto the liberality off Christ / so to shut his
hand which he opened so wide: therefore it must needs be / that our Savior
Christ gave every church her Bishop as for the apostles / Eua^gelistes / and
Prophets / beside that their ministry was not straightened unto particular
churchs: they are (as before has been showed) ceased. There remain therefore
of the ministeries there reckened / the Pastor / and Doctor: whereof whether the
bishop be the same with the Pastor / as some thinck / or whether he contain
both Pastor / and Doctor / as other some esteem: it is manifest that either
every particular church must have a bishop * or else none of those ministeries
there recited. For if it be said that taking a bishop for the same with a
Pastor / the particular congregations having the Doctor / may have one off them
/ althowgh they have no bishop: it is easy to answer / that if the Pastor most
necessary / and whom the church can worst spare / do not belong: the Doctor
can les be thowght to apperteine to a particular church. And thus far out of
the scripturs / for proof of a bishop in every particular church: yt follows
to show the traces of this institution in the primitive church / which
succeeded next unto the Apostels.

The same the D. supposes the true Ignatius / writes thus: Every church
should have her altar, and every church her bishop. And lest peradventure the
D. should interpret / every Ad Philadelphios.
church, every dioces / or province: beside that I have showed that
signification of church was unknown unto those times / the autors meaning is
clear to the contrary / when he says / every church should have her
communion table, which he calls (...).
improperly an altar. Onles therefore the D. will say / that his meaning is
there should be but one communion table in a whole dioces / or province: this
hole is stopped up against him. And if (as he would make us believe) this was
John thapostles scholar: then amongst the testimonies of men / this may
worthily bear the bell. If not (as I for my part thinck): yet the later he is
/ the longer is proved this order of having a bishop / in every particular
congregation / seeing he shows what the face off the church was / in those
times when he lived. Epiphanius proving a bishop / and preaching Elder to
differ (which comes after to be Epipha. l. 3. Tom. 1. hae. 75.
examined) says: where (not as the Pope / and the Answ. in what great city
soever) there was found any worthy to be bishop, there a bishop was
appointed: yea and where there was not to fournish both bishop, and preaching
Elder, there thapostles made a bishop, and left the Elder. So that by his
Judgment / bishops were in greater nombre then / then preaching Elders. That
the same was also in Cyprians time / shall appear (God willing) in the places
after to be handled out off him. From his time unto the Council off Nice / we
have the story of Eusebius: wherein as in a glass we may see / that the
church in this point was little altered Considering that he assigns the
bishops charge / continually (for any thing that either the Ans. shows / or I
can gather) to one church / or to the churches in one city only. Which may
better appear in that his bishops / are so often times called the bishop off a
parish (as has been showed) and that he confounds a parish with a church
/ a pastor with a Bishop (as shall appear): so that onles the Answ. will say
/ that there was in those times but one parish / church / pastor / in compass
off a province / or dioces: he must be constreined to confess / that every
particular church for the most part / had a Bishop.

And althowgh after time of the Nicene Council / there is no dowbt but that as
the Bishops had more occasions of enlarging their bounds / throwghe the
disordered zeal off the godly Emperors / so they let not slip those
occasions: yet if we consider the estate off the church / what yt was abowte
400. years after Christ: we shall find that bishops were not the tenth part
so thyn sown / as ours be now. If a bishop ran in to any slander / and the
slander pressing him he could not assemble a great number of bishops: to the
end he should not remain in that Tom. 1. 2. Carth. ca. 10.
slander / the Council off Carthage was off advise / that his cause should
be heard off twelve bishops / and his own bishop. And an other / that if an
elder were accused / he might call 6. bishops from the places hard by / and
likewise a deacon three: which Tom. 1. c. 8. 3. Cart.
together with their own bishop should have authority to hear / and determine
the causes in debate. Now if for every accusation of a bishop / there were
assembled 12. bishops at the least / and that when the matter required haste:
for every accusation of an elder six / and off a Deacon three / beside their
own bishop: and that those might be taken in places hard by: all men may
understand / that there was more neighborhood in bishops then is now / and
that yt behooved that those bishops dwelte within no great compass / which might
be assembled with such commodity. For if we should imagine the same
condition off bishops then / which is now: how evil advised should the
Council have been / to cawse so many bishops to come so far / with so
great charges / with such long absence from their churches / with such
delaie / and suspense off the purgation off them / whose speedy dispatche
stood so greatly upon the glory off God / and edification of their churches?
Hereof yt may easily be seen / that this blessing and gift of God in having
off a bishop / rained not only upon great cities / and great towns: but
even over little borowghes / and villages where there was a sufficient
congregation / hable to maintain this mynisterie off the word.

And althowghe there be diverse cawses / why the aunciente stories do not so
often make mention / of the bishopes of vplandishe towns / as that in those
times of persequution / a number off them did scarcely yield one sufficient
company / hable to maintain the mynisterie off the word: and that by all
likelihoode the country men rownde abowte / made their resort unto the good
towns next them / which had a bishop: and for that the stories for the most
part / keep the memory only of the most famous bishops / which by godly
policy off the church / were placed in the most peopled towns: yet
notwithstanding yt is not hard to show diverse / which are expressedly called
bishops off small towns / or villages. As off one Eusebius. ^ li. 16. cap.
Zor^cus Bishop of the village of Coman: of Theod. 5 li. ca 4.
Mares / Bishop of a small town / called Dolicha: of Ierom. Tom. 1. catolog.
Gen^adi* vir. illus^*
Asclepius / Bishop of a small town in Africa; and of others / which partly I
have already showed owte off the testimony off Jerome / and partly shall be
showed (God willing) in discouse off Cyprians testimonies. I leave also to
speak of Socrat. 4. 26.
Gregory / bishop of a small city / called Naz^anzum: of an other which was
Quaest. 16.
priest of the Castle Cumane / that is 80. did.
Bishop: both which are as well forbidden / as to have a bishop in a village. I
follows to show upon what cawses / and by what means the church so
fruictfull in Bishops became afterward so baren. wheroff albeit yt is most
certain / that the principal cause was the wrath off the lord / who angry
with his church / sent such a dearthe: yet the doings off men which God had
disposed of wisely / for the accomplishement of his counsel towchinge the man
of sin / were partly unadvised / partly proceeding off ambicion: and that not
always after one sort / but taking increase / and gathering strenght with the
time. So that the ambition which at the first was kept in some awe / and
restraincte / in the end brake owte / and showed yt self as yt were bare
faced.

In the Africane Council / yt appearethe that before a certain law made of
the Emperor / whersoeuer and in what diocese 1. Tom. Council. 66. ca.
soever there was a church off Donatistes converted unto the Catholic church
/ that those proselytes / and conuertes had a Bishop of their own: and the
Council there confessethe / that they deserved so to have. Whereupon yt
folowethe / that how many churches so ever off the Donatistes were converted:
so many Bishops at the least / there might be in one only diocese. And if
this were a good law and equal (as the Council confessethe): what cause can
be assigned / why yt should be taken away / as appears yt was afterward?
In the second Council of Carthage yt was decreed / that those dioceses which
had no bishops 1. Tom. Council. 5. cap.
should have none: and those which had / should keep their proper Bishop
Notwithstanding if the number off the faithful should increase in that diocese
/ that the people desyring a Bishop / if the bishop of the diocese consented
thereunto / might have another bishop. Now in that the Council ordained that
there should be no bishops in that diocese / where there had been none: yt is
appara^te that their dioceses were not the twe^tith part so large as ours. For
is there any likelihoode / consideringe the number off the bishops before
proved / that the Council would decree that there should be no bishop within
30. or 40. miles / as it is with us? And when it ordeineth that in that diocese
where there was a bishop already / the number of the faithful increasing /
there might be at the instance off the churches / and consent of the bishop
other bishops ordained: yt utters the cause why diverse parishes round
abowte / were the diocese of one bishop: namely for that here and there / in
this and that town / there was scarce gleaned owte a sufficient number / off
those which having given their names to the gospel / were hable to make one
sufficient congregation to maintein the ministry. And therefore ordained /
that when the harueste of the faithefull should be more plentiful in those
places: then also counsel might be taken / off more Bishops.

Whereupon we may gather / this to have been a cause of this scarcity / that
it being left always in the discretion off the Bishop / whether he vvoulde
have any more Bishops: throwghe Ambicion yt came to pass / that the nombre off
Christians increasing / they would not suffer the people to have more bishops /
but ordeining them Elders / and Deacons / together with the name off the Bishop
/ retained unto them selves a great part off the authority / and government
to other belongyng. And this is In his book off the practice off Prelates.
that which that excellent Martyr of God William Tindall / shortly noted:
when the multitude off Christians increased, and the church was endovved
with great possessions: the bishops made the^ substitutes, which they called
preistes, and kept the name of Bishop unto them selves. And how unhappily it
was left in the Bishops choice / either to suffer another bishop to be
instituted or no / in his diocese: may appear by this shameful ambition /
which even the^ began to show yt self. For so far was yt / that they
vvoulde depart with any already gotten: that they a Africanum Concilium c.
84. 85. 87
assaied to encroche (and sometimes by strong hand) upon the bounds off
others: as appears by the manifold debates / which they had one with another
/ about their precinctes / testified in the book of Counsels.

the^ / that where in Afrike there were great swarms of Donatiste heretics /
and other strangers from the churches: as every Bishop gained those foreners
unto the church / so he enjoyed them. Which thing extended not only unto
every ones own diocese: but also to other dioceses / if the other Bishop were
somewhat sluggishe in that behalf. which what a great prophanacion yt was of
the gifts of God / no man of any judgment in the word of God / can be
ignorante. For seems it a meet thing / that for the blessing off God given
unto their preaching / they should be made rulers off all those peoples which
they gained? And what differs this from symonie: but that as one sells the
gifts off the holy ghost for money / so this made march andrise off them for
honor / and money both? And verily having before a competente stock / in this
poincte they did not so much get disciples unto Christ / as to them selves:
nor so much enlarge his kingdom / as their own: not do thoffice of pastors /
as of hirelinges / and st^pendarie soldiers bente upon the spoil.

Another cause off this scarcity was / that as they provided / that there
should be no bishops where were none before: so they African Council. ^^. 66.
decred / that in dioceses where there were / if after the death of the bishop
/ the people of that church had rather yield them selves subject unto another
bishop / then choose a new: that it should be lawful for them so to do. And
theruppon / yt is very like that diverse churches (when good bishops began to
be rarer / then wedges of gold) seeing any one which behaved him self more
tolerably: yielded them selves unto him. Not much unlike those times off the

taken deep root) the people did not unwillingly quite the estate of a
bishop: and as off an evil neighbor / and one which lay to heavy upon them /
were glad to be rid off him. yt might be also the peoples fault / which (as
our experience teachethe to much) rather then they would beat the charge of
mainteining a sufficient mynistrie off their own: were content to yield up
their privilege off having a bishop / to receive with abatement off their
charges / a mynistrie they cared not what.

to ordeine any Bishop / either in villages / or small city: lest throwghe the
multitude / bishops should wax vile / as I have alleged in the former book.
Whereupon comes here to be considered / what is answered: that I be not
compelled there to renew this question again. His answer is / that I have
falstfied the place, that I have not redd the Epistle, that if I had, having
any modesty I would never have so written To let the rest goo / and withal
his unworthy reproach / so often repeated / for saying Boniface to Zachary, in
stead off Zachary to Boniface / seeing the quotation in the margent is right: I
say to let these go / consider wherein I have used falshoode Y^ is first
assigned / in that where the words off the Epistle are / lest the name off a
Bishop should wax vile: I said / lest they should wax vile throvvghe the
multitude. If I have falsified in adding throvvgh the multitude: what truth /
or faith has the Answerer used / in adding / becawse the contemptiblenes off
the place, often times brings contempt off the person? This addicion off
words is greater then mine / and no more found in the Epistle then mine:
whose interpretacion is more aggreable unto the mind off the writer / his that
the danger off contempt was conceived by reason off the place, ormine that it
was by reason off the multitude: let the reader judge.

Which that he may he may the easelier do / let it be considered ad Euag. 2.
what Jerome writes / where speaking off the pride off the Deacons: he
assigns the cawse that they were so much set by / to have been their fewnes /
and the cawse why the Elders were so light made of / becawse they were more in
number. For the abundance of any commodity / does so commenly bring down the
price of it / that there is no nation I thinck where it is not in proverb /
that rare things are greatly esteemed: as contrariwise things off excellent /
and necessary use / are throwgh their multitude called vile. Which is declared
there by example of Poley / a commen / and vile herb in those countries: and
yet for the rarenes more esteemed in India / then pepper. Of the other side
where he says / they were not placed in villages* or small cities, because the
smallnes of the place does make the person often times contemned, in steed that
it is meet the bishop should be reverenced: by that reason there should be no
minister of the word in those places at all. For it behooves that the minister
also have the reverence of his people / which becomes the ambassador / and
steward off Christ: and if the bishop look for more / he pricketh at a further
marck / then ever the word off God set up. But how comes it to pass / that
the bishop off Canturbery is more esteemed / then the bishop off London: and he
off Winchester / then he off Norwich / if the place cawse the estimacion of the
Bishop? When gentlemen / and noblemen build their howses more commenly in small
towns / and more solitary places: does the Ans. thinck that they lose any of
their estimacion thereby? Also by this reason it owght to be forbidden / that
Justices off Peace, and Quorum should dwell in country towns / and
commanded to dwell only in great towns / lest they be contemned off the
people. But beside that it is contrary to the wisdom of God in the scripture:
the Paganes which never saw that light / could tell that the places do not
make men honorable, Plutarch. (...).
but men the places. And Jerome says / the bishop off an obscure city, has
as much authority as he off the most famous. If the D. answer / that it owght
to be so / but it is not / throwgh the folly off certain: if that were granted
/ yet yt is unmeet that the ministry should be according to the evil
disposition off certain. for then for so much as yowth is subject to contempt /
it should be unmeet to choose a young man (of what gifts soever) unto the
ministry.

The Other falshoode the Ans. charge me with / is / for that I gather off this
canon, that in times paste there were bishops in several parishes, and small
towns, when there was no bishop before off any parish. yt seems that his
understanding can not be so simple / but that he may perceive if there were no
other proof / that those canones made so often for the forbidding of ordeining
of bishops in villages / and small cities / proceeded theroff / that the
churches in villages / and small cities / had their bishops as other places
had. For to what purpose do they defend yt / but that yt was used? And
wherefore was that law so often renewed; unless there had been resistance / and
unless the churches refused to subject themselves / to such a wicked order? if
men make not laws but upon erperience of things which they mislike: how much
les do they renew them again and again / but upon gainsaying? And in that
Boniface which wrote unto Zachary / had appointed those three bishops in small
parishes / and towns: all understand that yt was no new thing then / to have
bishops in such places. But because he closethe his eyes / and will not see
things set before him: at least let him grope them. The false Damasus / 1.
Tom. Council. Epist. 4. Chorepiscopi. Villani Episco.
and very Antichriste / writing of this matter / inueiethe vehemently against
the appointinge off Bishops in villages / which he calls country bishops.
And yt appears plainly in that Epistle / that they had the self same
authority in all things / which city Bishops had. There he says also / that
yt was forbidden that there should be any bishop either in small city / or in
village / or Castle: lest the name and authority of a bishop / should wax
vile. And therefore commands / that those bishops off villages being
disgraded off their Bishoprics / should be thrown down to the order off
preisthoode. Here the D. may understand / that even in the time off
Antichriste / this order off every church having her bishop / was not so
abolished / but that there were remnantes off it in diverse places / and some
which maintained the liberty wherein God had sed them / against that owtrage
off Satan: who becawse he would make off bishops young Princes / and saw that
every parish was not hable to maintain that pomp / went abowte with
robbery off the rest / to lift up the head off one. Heroff yt may be seen
what cawse the D. has / to charge me with the falsifiyng of the Popes words
/ and how his habilite to defend the Popes decree / doothe not answer his
desire.

As for the reasons I browght to prove / that the placing^ off bishops in
villages, and small cities, could no more bring them in contempt, then the
shininge of the son, or falling off the rain in villages as well as in
cities, breeds contempt off those benefits: or the name or authority of
father, given to poor men as well as rich, makes that ordinance off God
nothing set by: he answers not a word. Where I further alleged the
foresight / and wisdom of God / which should receive a great wound if in
instituting for every church a Bishop / he should not have foreseen this
inconvenience / which the Ans. upon the Popes authority meinteineth: he
askethe when and where? I have (I trust) showed him now both. althowghe he if
he had either understood / or remembered what he wrote before twice / or thrice
/ when with Jerome he propounds unto us / that Bishop / and elder were all
one by Gods word: he should not have fallen into this extreme boldenes / of
denying every thing which is enemy unto his unadvised assertions. For if yt be
the institution off God / that every church should have a teaching elder /
and that elder (according to Ieromes saying allowed off him) were a bishop: yt
must needs follow / that to have a bishop in every church / is the
institution of God. And because the D. boweth so casely under the authority of
men / that he estemeth it the best proof: let him understand that this was
the judgment off two of the most famous me^ / which our land browght forth
these many years. And the same also executed for the testimony off the truth
off god: wheroff one of them amongst other things / suffered also for this
cause now in hand.

man may by the law off God, be bishop off two or three cities, yea off an
whole country: for that yt is contrary to the doctrine of S. Paul, which
vvriting unto Titus, commands that he should ordeine a bishop in every
town: proving that by the word elder / the Apostell means a bishop. M.

magistrates bring the^ to that point, it shall he as possible to hear a bishop
vvade godly, and symply thorovvgh the scripture in all case off religion, as to
drive a camel thorovvgh the eye of a nedle. A great pity it is to see, how
far the office off a bishop is degenerated, from the original in the
scripture. It was not so in the beginning when bishops were at the best, as
the Epistle to Tite testifies: that willed him to ordeine in every city of
Crete a bishop. And in case there were such love in them now, as was then
toward the people: they would say them selves, there were more to do for
the best off them in one city, then he could do. They know the primitive
church had no such bishops. until the time off Siluester the first, etc. Off
these things partly / and partly of that which shall be hereafter (God willing)
spoken / I leave yt to be esteemed off the indifferente reader / with how small
either knowledge / or conscience the D. has affirmed that yt can nether be
showed by scripture / nor confirmed by any ecclesiastical writer / or
practice off the primitive church: that either every church should have her
bishop / or that there should be bishops in villages / and small Cities.

The Other off the two questions remains / whether yt can be showed by
scripture / and by examples off the primative church * that there were in one
church more bishops then one. which we might in part have been eased off / if
the answ. having fallen owte with the trwth / were not likewise fallen owte
with him self. For he approving off the testimony off Jerome / which
affirms elders / and Bishops all one / and that the elders off a church
chose one amo^geste them / which only kept the name of bishop: does withal
necessarily affirm / that before the time that this ordinance was established
/ there were diverse bishops in one church. And in saying the word bishop is not
commenly used / but Page 383.
for him that in degree is above the rest: he at unawares confesses / that
there were diverse bishops in some churches / althowgh not commenly. But becawse
he has a faculty in denying / and affirming withowte showing any reason / and
that his word is no bond to tie him with all / when yt makes against him:
some thing also must be spoken / towching this matter. And seeing I have
showed that he is by S. Paul's determination / a Bishop / which is ap^e to
teach / and to exhort / to convince false doctrine / and reprove corrupt
manners; and that the Ans. can not deny but one such always is not
sufficient / for some churches especially where the commodity of assemblies
is so good / that every day the word off good is to be preached: yt can not
be denied but that there both may / and owght to be more bishops in a church
(much more in a city) then one.

And that this was the institution off God / it appearethe by 1. Phil. 1.
the practice of the churches in thapostels times: at Philippos / where Paul
expressly / saluteth diverse bishops: at Ephesus / from whence A and. 20.
certain bishops sent for / came to Miletu^. Likewise in the church off 1 Thessalonians. 5. 12.
Thessalonica there were diverse Presidentes / the same (by the Pa. 410.

yt is like to have been in other off great resort to hear the word off God
/ and ability to enterteine a more plentiful ministry. Nether let him (as
he is wont) oppose unto the manifest words off the scripture / Ambroses
exposition upon the place to the Philippians / nor that which goes under
Ieromes name upon the same. For as for Ambrose / a child may see how violently
he forces the text: and what inconvenience he runnethe into / to make yt

part / worn out. And as for the other / he is a cou^terfaicte / and so marked

only because he contrarieth that which Jerome did plainly teach: but also
for that the form off writing / is far off another complexion.

Yt can not be denied but that this order of God was stricke^ at by diverse
canons off Councels / and that as this was the first attempt / which the
devil gave to abridge the number off Bishops in the church: so yt was more
aunciente then that other / off robbing the villages / and small Cities off
their bishops. Upon what rotten grounds this abuse crepte in / comes
afterward to be considered: here yt is to be noted that this corruption was not
so general / but that often times yt admitted exception. And notwithstanding
both custom / and Canons in that behalf: good men upon occasion made no
conscience / to ordeine two bishops of one city. lib. 6. c. 10.
Eusebius. makes mention of Narcissus / and Alexander Bishops at ones in one
parish. and if yt be true which he reports / that the same was by revelation
from heaven: yt is a good argument / that this voice was as yt were a repeal

institution off God. Yt is written off Augustine / that he was made b Possido

bishop there / and by the consent off the Metra politane Bishop off Carthage.

Augustine him self also was off advise / that in those places where was a

of the church / then he should be received into the fellowship off the bishops
office with the catholic bishop. Where he puts only these exceptions / if
the people will suffer yt: if becavvse yt is not accoustomed, the people will
bear it. Whereby is clear / that notwithstanding it was forbidden by canons:
yet he thowght yt not unmeet / to have two bishops in one church / if the
people would bear it. and if he were of this advise / notwithstanding the
councils to the contrary: how much more would he have thought it meet if the
church had required / and made suit for it?

Also it is not to be forgotten / that although this corruption off gyuing the
name bishop to one in a church / from the rest to whom it did off right belong
/ be ancient: yet godly men misliked it / and by all likelihood broke it of.
Which Ieromes words do apparently import: this coustome was in the church

off Alexandria from S. Mark, until Heraclas, and Dionysius. For onles there
were some change then: why would he not rather have said / from S. Mark until
his time? considering that all that time / there was continual succession of
church / and bishops. Therefore belike those godly men / seeing the mischief like
to ensue of that coustome / and understanding that things owght to be called
to the apostolic institution: changed that coustome. Furthermore it is
diligently to be considered / that this order off having one only in every
church to have the name of Bishop / ouerspred not the church soudenly / and at

so that it is like there were diverse ages past / or ever this had a general
passage / thorowgh all the churches in the world. By all which it may appear /
how the Ans. is abused in saying / it can not be showed from Christ's time,
that ever there were two bishops in one church. These things being thus laid /
let us now come to Cyprians Testimonies.

Caput 3.
Unto the first division / I have answered. In the second / to page 355.
prove that Cyprian speakethe off an Archbishop / the D. concludes thus. yt is
the principal office of the archbishop, to provide that peace, and unity be
kept in the church, etc. but the office off him whom Cyprian describes, is to
keep peace in the church: therefore Cyprian speaks of an archbishop. This
argument is cast in the same moulde that those / which he has vntrwly
compared my reason unto before: page 316.
and yt has almost more faults / then words. But that the simplest may see
his dealing / yt is to be understood / that as the pretense off institucion
off the Archbishop was to keep peace / and suppress scismes: so the only
pretense off translating the name off bishop / from many in one church unto
one only / was the same: as appears by the place off Jerome after Ierom. ad
Euagr.
discussed. To let pass therefore that I have proved / and will after more
appear / that there was then nether Archbishop / nor Metropolitan / and for
disputacion sake to imagine Archbishops then: yet when both the name / and
office Cyprian speaks of / agree unto him which governs in every church /
or (to speak as the D. speaks) diocese: and the office only withowte the
name / agreethe to the Archbishop: yt must needs be meeter ^o refer Cypcians
words to the Bishop / then to the Archbishop / seeing that there be more cords
off reasons to pull them that ways / then the other. At the least yt is
clear / that the Argument off the A. is faulty: seeing yt was not only the
principal office off the Archbishop / to provide for peace / etc. but the same
also was the principal office off the Bishop / as that under pretense whereof /
that kind off Bishop was instituted.

Where he comes to his oulde hole / that althowghe the name be not there, yet
the office is: I refere my self unto that written before page 354.
in that be half. Howbeit here yt appears how he spoke withowt book /
saying all writers before the Nicene Council, make mention both off their
names, and offices: when as Cyprian one off them / has no word off them.
Where he says Cypr. speaks off Cornelius, who had government off all the
province: that is the question / which becawse he could not prove / he takes
granted. Where he adds Cyprian had the charge, and oversight off all
churches in Aphrica, and for proof alleges the 4. book, 8. Epistle: he is
abused / for Cyprian does say no such thing. He speaking there off himself
/ and off his fellow bishops assembled in Council / says in this sort: but
because our province is spread forth larger, and has both Numidia, and
Mauritania joining. he says not my province, but our province: which is
manifestly referred unto all the bishops assembled / as the course off the
epistle declares. Nether does he there speak off any jurisdiction / or
oversight which he had more then an other Bishop: nether yet off two
Mauritanias / as the D. says / but off one only. Yt appears therefore that
the water where he drew this / was trowbled: and from whence soever he have yt
/ Eusebius is off more credit in that matter. Who speaking of Cyprians large
dominion / shuts him with in Euse. 7. li. ca. 3.
the precinctes of Carthage: saying / he was bishop of the parish which was
in Carthage. And allthowgh it be clear that Cyprian had no such jurisdiction
/ yet to the end this vnfaithefull dealing may better appear / let it be
considered what was the estate off the church in Africa / about 150. yares
after: when there were Metrapolitanes which had oversight over Provinces / and
this weed of Ambition had spread yt self much further in the church. In the
Council of Afric yt appears / that Aurelius which long after succeeded
Cyprian in the church of Carthage / had not 1. Tom. Council.
him self any jurisdiction over either Mauritania / or Numidia: for that as he
was bishop off the first seat off that province wherein Carthage was: so
Xantippus was Bishop of the first in Numidia / and Nicetius of the first in
Mauritania. I omit that Mauritania was divided from Carthage by sea: so that
(contrary to the D. interpretacion) men must have passed the sea for decision
off causes. Whereby appears what a fable yt is / that Cyprian was
Metropolitan off those three provinces / when every one had a several
Metrapolitane.

Where he cyteth Gregory Nazianzene, that Cyprian ruled not only the church
off Carthage, but Afrike, Spain, and almost the whole east parts: yt is to
be observed / that where the D. seeks by sea and land / in every corner for
bishops of the largest spread / and lo^gest arms: at the last he has met
with one / which has more then he would gladly should be known. for
otherwise why has he concealed the rest of Gregory's sentence? Why has he
cut of the feet off yt? why has he pared Nazianzens words? Because I have not
the book: I will set it down / as the bishop of Salisbury Def. Apol. part. 2.
c. 5. d. 1.
has done. Cyprian was a bishop, the mightiest and noblest off all bishops.
For he had rule not only over the church off Carthage, and Afrike, which
until this day is famous off him, and by his means: but over all the vveast,
and in a manner over all the East, likewise over both North, and Southe.
Thus appears he has in this place / left owte both sowthe and North parts
off the world / and for that the Bishop turns Hesperiam.
vveast / he turns Spain. where if he complain of the bishops translation
(althowghe I dowbt not but the bishop had reason / seeing Hesperia / is opposed
unto the East): yet if it should note any one several country / yt is like
to note Italy. For so Jerome writes / that they used in times paste, to call
Hesperiam Italy: especially when it is uttered simply / withowt addyng utter
most. upon the 5. ca. off Isay.
now all may understand that Gregory's meaning was not / that Cyprian was
ruler off all churches in the world / in that sense the D. means / and that
he had authority off an archbishop over all churches in the world: but that he
was famous amongst all / and sowght unto for counsel from all parts. Whereby
appears / that the jurisdiction bishops had in times paste / owte off their
certain congregacions / was nothing but a reverent estimacion / purchased by
opinion of singular learning / and godliness / whereby others willingly / would
both ask / and follow their advise / in government off their churches.

And if the D. vvil have Cyprian archbishop / and Metrapolitane over all these
places: let him answer what shall becomme off his exposition / whereby he would
have every Archbishop in his province / to have peereles authority / withowt
controleme^t of any other Archbishop? what off the Province of Italy, ascribed
unto Cornelius? what off that whereby he says / none owghte to go over sea,
for trial off cawses? for althowghe we follow his vain off interpretacion in
all these / and for a bishop understand an archbishop / for a church a
Province / for the particular place where the quarrel rises / all that
circuit which is not parted by sea: yet this one assertion off his / that
Cypriane was Metrapolitane of almost all the East, VVeaste, North, and
Sowthe, overthrows whatsoever has been said in any off those poinctes.
For the wide throat off Cyprians Archbishopricke / has swallowed up all the
rest / and made them all but Suffraganes: and by / this reckening / not only
men must pass the sea / but many seas / to have end off their cawses. Last
off all / if yt be true he bears us in hand: let him tell us why the Bishop
off Rome may not have a souueraintie over all churches / as well as he
phansieth off the bishop off Carthage? considering they are in the same / and
felowlike degree. Therefore onles he will overthrow all / that ever he has
gone about to establishe / in this cause: and onles in trauailinge with the
Archbishop / he will be delivered off a Pope / and a Pope off the largest cyse
/ and longest last: he must be compelled whether he will or no / to expound
this word governed, by consailed, or excelled, or some other word as kolde /
and as vnconfortable to the office off a Metrapolitane / or archbishop.

Why Illiricus calls him metrapolitane, I have showed. He says I forget my
self, which call him in one place metropolita^: they are selie contradictions
allwaies which he charge me with. For he might have remembered that I said /
that this word metropolitan doothe signify nothing but bishop off the chief
City: in which sense I can easily aforde Cyprian to be a Metrapolitane /
withowte any great hinderance off my cawse / or help off his. I pass the
next diu. having nothing but importunate / and shameless begging of things in
controversy. As that Cornelius had a province under him, that Cyprian was
Metropolitan, that the place off Cyprian is trwly expounded off an Archbishop,
that I give the Papists advantage, in saying that the place makes as much
for a Pope, as an archbishop, that is to say nothing for either. Unto the next
/ I have answered where I laid open the vanity off his answer / that writers
pass by the title off archbishops: saving that it is to be noted / that where
the D. has before affirmed in plain words / that the name off Pope was
commen to all bishops: here to give some coulor Diuis. 5. Page 302.
unto his answer / he would make us believe that the name off Pope was commen
not unto all, but to many bishops, etc. what M. Fox says in that behalf / I
refer yt to the reader. That the name off Pope was commen to all bishops /
besides the testimonies I alleged before / may be seen in the bishop of In
the 4. article 8. diuis.
Salisbury / and M. Confess. ca. 7. Artic. 12. Diuis 5. page 357.
Beza: which both affirm the same.

As the D. could frame no argument out of Cyprians place / for the office off
tharchbishop / withowte begging: so he can not answer the reasons against the
Archbishop owte off Cyprian / withowt the same. For where I showed that the
whole people mentioned of Cyprian / being not the people of a diocese / or
Province / were notwithstanding those which Cyprians bishops governed / and
therefore that they were not over a diocese / or Province: he answers that if
I hadred any stories, I might understand, that bishops were chosen only by
the Cytisens of that place, whereof they were called bishops, and by no other in
their Province, or diocese. Which is a gross answer. For althowghe the stories
off later times (wherein yt is not denied but these offices were) make such
mention: yet what is that to our cawse? whose controversy is whether yt were
so in Cyprians times / as in times that followed. If he can show any
ecclesiastical story off like auncientie with Cyprian / that makes mention
off such election: then he says somewhat: if he can not / he doothe to much
abuse the time / and the reader. And certainly if Cypria^ said had no more / but
the people choose the^ bishops: yet (withowte contrary proof) he owght by all
reasonable understanding / be judged to speak off all that people / over which
he had government. but when he adds all the people, he leauethe no
controversy. And in the same place he says: for the due making Epist. li. 4.
1.
of Electio^s the next bishops of that Province where the place is void,
must come unto the people over whom the bishop is set: and the bishop ovvght
to be chosen in the presence off the people. Upon which words yt may thus be
further reasoned: that people in whose presence the Bishop was chosen / was
that over which the bishop was set: but the bishop was chosen in the presence
off the people off one congregation: therefore the people over which the Bishop
was set / was the people off one congregation. The first proposition is
manifest by Cyprians words / (the people over whom the bishop was to be
set, ovvght to be present for election off the bishop). The second is also
clear: for so much as it could not be with any conuenience / that all the
people off a diocese / or Province / should meet allwaies for the choosing of
their bishop / especially in time of persequution. And therein I will refer my
self to the judgment of the reader / how absurdly the D. says afterward: all
the people of a province or diocese, might meet then withowte peril, or
inconvenience. And where he says there were such metinges at Synodes in
those times: he is abused / considering that the churches met not / but their
governors: and not all / but certain owte off every quarter / as he might
easily know by the practice off all times. For althowghe it was not denied
unto private men to be present at Counsels: yet yt was very rare that they
were found there in any number / unless upon some notable controversy: and
that not by appointment or order taken / as in thelectio^ of their bishop / but
only at their pleasure.

And if yet the D. be off that boldness / that withowte any proof out of
antiquity / he will expound this word all, by some, or (as he doothe in the
next diuis.) by many: and whole by part, and that the smallest part: and
people by cytizens, to the open violence off Cyprians words: yet that all his
starting holes may be stopped / let us further examine the place of Cyprian /
owte of which he would confirm the office off the archbishop. Neither have
heresies, or schisms risen of other occasion, then of that the priest of God
is not obeyed, nether one priest for the time in the church, and one judge for
the time in steed off Christ thovvght upon: to vvho^ if the whole brotherhood
would be obedient etc. To shape an archbishop / or bishop such as is with us /
owte of this place / the D. is compelled to expound this word church, by
Diocese, or Province, Which if it be truly down: then these words also (the
whole brotherhoode) must be expounded of all those which are in the Province /
or diocese. For both the whole brotherhood are those which belong unto that
church: and if there should be any more in Cyprians church / the^ those
contained in these words (the whole brotherhood): yt were no remedy against
heresies / and schisms / to have the whole brotherhood obedient unto the
preiste. If I can therefore show / that these words the 1. li. Epist. 4.
whole brotherhood, signify only one particular assembly: yt must follow
that nether Cyprians bishop is an Archbishop / nor the church there specified
/ a diocese / or Province / but only a particular congregation. In the next
sentence therefore / yt is said: in the election off Sabinus, the bishopric
was given him, by voice off the whole brotherhood. Now considering that the
whole brotherhood did choose Sabinus / and yt is certain that nether the whole
Province / nor dioces chose him: yt is manifest that these words whole
brotherhood, with Cyprian signify not the people off a dioces / or Province /
but off one particular church.

Again in Cyprians words (heresies rise, and schisms begin, off this that
the priest off God is not obeyed) is an other argument to prove / that by
priest must needs be understood / the minister in every several
congregation. For seeing obedience unto this priest / hinders the beginning /
and seed off both heresies / and schisms: and this can not be if obedience be
given only to one bishop in adioces / or archbishop in a Province / onles also
every minister in his particular congregation be obeyed: yt must follow / that
the priest Cyprian speaks of / is the minister off every particular
congregation. For otherwise the remedy against heresies / and schisms (which
his words promise) does not follow. For it is diligently to be weighed / that
Cyprian says not / heresies / and schisms therefore continue in the church /
or therefore are not taken away / becawse the priest is not obeyed: but rise,
have their seeds, and first beginning becavvse, etc. Whereas if he would have
set forth a bishop of a dioces / or archbishop of a Province: he should have
said / the cawses why heresies / and schisms are continued: and not why they
rise. Considering that the virtue off these offices / is phansied to compose /
and decide schisms / and heresies: and that althowgh the people be by them
cured off their heresies / and schisms / when they are fallen into them: yet
they can not by their teachinges / be kept from entrance into them / being so
far off / and seldom or never hearing their voice.

Moreover / as it is said here / there is one priest in the church: so in an
other Cyprian de simp. praelato.
place / there ovvght to be but one pastor in one place, and again / Li. 1.
Epist. 3.
every pastor has a portion off the floock committed unto him, vvheroff he
must give account unto the Lord. If therefore he will not suffer this one priest
in the church, to be applied to more then the bishop off the dioces / and the
archbishop off the Province: yt must follow that in Cyprians time / there were
no pastors off particular churches. For one pastor / and one priest or Bishop /
being all one in Cyprians language: there can be no more off the one / then off
the other. Last off all / it may appear by the council of Cathage in Cyprians
time / that there were diverse Bishops off villages / and small towns. For off
the number off Bishops there assembled / the names off their towns wheroff
they were bishops / being there set down / are scarce four / or five that are
to be found (as I thinck) in any Cosmographer / which reckeneth up the
principal cities / and towns off Africa: and namely there is express mention
off one Ianuarius / bishop off a village called Cesars village. Thus I trust yt
is clear / that by one church, one priest, nether an archbishop of a Province
/ nor bishop off a dioces / but only a minister / or bishop off one particular
congregation / is signified. Thaccusacions off passing forgerie, etc. deserve
no answer.

I have no where reasoned, that one should not be rightly chosen Diuis. 6. Page
358.
bishop, if any be absent that have interest in thelection: my reason is / that
for so much as all the people off Cyprians Bishop / was by the Ecclesiastical
discipline appointed to be present at his choice / and by no good order off
discipline the whole dioces / or Province could be so appointed: therefore the
whole people off Cyprians Bishop / was nether the people off a dioces / nor
Province. And where you have (to show the vanity of my assertion) translated
almost half a side: let the reader consider to what purpose. For where he
notes that Cornelius was made bishop, by testimony of his fellow bishops
thorowghowt all the world: I can not tell for what cawse he should note it.
Onles yt be that because the bishops thorowghowt the world testified their
agreement by letters unto his election / occasioned thereto for that Nouatus
denied it to be lawful: therefore it is not unlike / that the people of a whole
dioces / or province were present in proper person / at the choice off the
Bishop / and archbishop. And if he meant that: he is far short of his reckening:
nether is it made up by his third note / which I thinck tends to the same
end. For where it seems that by these words (and good men) he would have it
thowght there were other people beside the cytisens off Rome / at Cornelius
election: the words are / of ancient priests* and good men in the college:
referring the word college, to good men / as well as to priests. So that by
good men he either means those ancient priests / or some other
ecclesiastical company: where the Answ. restreining college unto the
Priests only / would have his reader thinck / that the people off the
Province were gathered thither / to choose Cornelius archbishop. But this is a
wonderful change / that he which before esteemed it inconvenient / that a
several congregation should^ meet to choose their pastor: is now browght into
such streightes / that he seeks to make the whole dioces / or Province
assemble / for choice off their pastor. His other note (that Cornelius passed
thorowgh all ecclesiastical offices, etc. unto the bishopric) is idly put.
Whether a preacher was the same with a bishop: belongs to an other question /
and is altogether out of season here. For althowgh an Elder which ruled only /
were inferior unto a bishop: yet thereby follows not / that an Elder which
preached / was so. Where he says / I falsefie Cyprian, and that yt is too
great boldness to say, Priuatus was condemned by 90. Bishops of one Province:
the truth is / Cyprian says not they were off one Province. But for so much as
Priuatus was off the same Province with Cyprian / and controversies rising in
every Province / were for the most part voided by bishops of the same: onles a
general Council can be showed / a Provincial is presumed. beside that / it
is unlike that Cyprian / to then tent he might draw Priuatus into greater
hatred / would have omitted that circumstance off General Council / if it had
been. And where he asks / what if there were so many bishops in one
Province? whether yt he co^ciuded thereof / that every several congregation /
had her bishop: I answer that if there were 90. Bishops in one Province off
Afrike / and that were observed then / which either the most commen practice
off all times has tawght / or which was ordained after ward in the Counsels
Carthag 5 ca. 10. Carth. 6. ca. 43.
off Afrike / that the Bishops off every Province being parted into two / or
three companies / owte off every off them certain should be sent in the name
off the rest / whereby a greater number remained at home / then came to the
council: and that be also remembered / that there were diverse places / where
there were Nouatian Bishops: and further that the most part of towns / and
cities being heathen / and Idolatrous had no bishops at all / as yt was in
those days: Ad hereunto that in Stephen Bishop off Romes time / which lived in
the same time with Cyprian / there Augusti. cont. Gaudent.
were innumerable catholic bishops: Lastly in those times of persequutions /
the number off them which professed the Gospel in one town / being for the
most part sofewe / that four or five of the next towns / were scarce
sufficient to make a competent assembly / hable to maintain the ministry: I
say all these things considered / and bound up together: I think yt will
appear unto the indifferente reader / that every congregation where the word
of God was preached / and sacraments administered / had a several bishop. For
if they had been such bishops as ours / althowgh the whole world had been
Christian: a little Arithmetic would have served / to count them. Where he
says / the Patriarche off Antioche, had 160. Bishoprics underneath him: if
all those were in one only Province / I am glad to hear of it. If by a
Province he mean the fourth part of the world / the Patriarche having then
gotten under his gripes / so many metropolitaneships: yt was no marvel
althowghe the bishops underneath him / drowned as many bishoprics. Besides
that it is ridiculous / to allege this example which was long after / against
thestate of Cyprians Bishop. Where he says / by keeping back the place off
Cyprian, I give suspicion off forgerie: I know not how I could have given him
more particular knowledge of it, then in telling him / that yt was in the same
Epistle / owte off which both he alleged his sentence / and I my answer.

First I requiring authority to prove / that by the word Diuis. 7. page 359.
church is understood a Province: he answers all learned writers so
expound yt. He deals but hardly which having al: will not vouchesafe to
show one. for as for those which he makethe show of afterward: yt shall
appear how little they serve his purpose. His next answer is / that it is no
unaccustomed thing to call the church throwghe a province, by name of the
metrapolitane seat of the province. If this were accoustomed / and in those
times wherein Cornelius / and Cyprian lived (for otherwise yt is nothing): why
does he let his cause fall / for want of showing yt. For where he says / he
has showed yt before: there is no word founding that ways. And Eusebius
saying that he did fulfill the office off a Bishop Euse. li. 7. ca. 2.
in the city of Rome / will not suffer the D. to lurk in that corner: onles
paraduenture he will say / the church in the city off Rome / was spread
thorowgh the whole Province. And when Ruffine shows / that the Bishop of Rome
about a hundred and fifty years after (at what time the Bishops had spread the
1. lib. ca. 6
wings of their dominion) had but the churches in the suburbs / and round
about Rome: is it a like thing / that Cornelius had rule off all churches of
Italy? For althowgh the coustome / which the Nicene Council speaks of /
should have been even from Cornelius time: yet yt is clear / that Cornelius
had not government off the churches off all Italy / but only of those in the
suburbs of Rome. For answer unto these bare / and bold sayings* I refer my self
partly to that before spoken / that these words must be understood nether
off Province / nor dioces / but only of particular assemblies: partly / to
that which follows.

After I saying / that for so much as Cornelius, said to have banished one ovvt
of his church, could not banish him ovvt of the Province, therefore church and
Proui^ce be diverse: he answers / thowgh he could not banish him out off the
province, yet he might excommunicate him, from the congregation thorowghowt the
Province. wherein beside that he still presupposes an archbishop / which is in
controversy / whilst he gives Cornelius power to excommunicate / thorowgh
the whole Province: he is also deceived / that thincketh by these words / is
meant that Cornelius did excommunicate Felinus. For he was excommunicated before
/ by the Bishops off Africa: so that Cornelius had not to do / to
excommunicate him. Where for confirmacion of his answer / he asks / whether
he forcibly shut him out of the local church of Rome: I answer / that if he
had remembered that there were then doorekepers / to withstand those that cut
from the church / would enter in: he should not have thought it so strange a
thing / that Heretics were shut forth from the local church: especially
seeing he seems to have allowed dorekepers / as officers necessary for those
times. And althowgh it were permitted unto heretics by Cornelius / and his
fellows / to enter into the local church: yet he might have considered / that
when they offered them selves unto the lords table / Cornelius with his
assistance owght to see them removed. Seeing therefore this not suffering of
Felicissimus to enter into the church / is no excommunication / (as the D.
says) and carries necessarily with yt / that which Cornelius could not do /
throwghe the Province / but only in place where he was present: yt must follow
/ that by the word church, where this was done / a particular place must be
understood / and not as is supposed / either diocese / or Province.

Where I showed / that forasmuch as by church is mente the place, where the
poenitents confessed their faults, that being nether diocese / nor Province /
but a particular congregation / the word church also must note a particular
congregation: the D. answers / that for so much as Nouatus denied forgiveness
unto the fallen, the meaning off Cyprian is nothing else, but that Nouatus did
not receive the^, into the general and catholic church off Christ. Wherein he
has clean ouerturned the meaning off Cyprian / which is not to show (as he
says) that Nouatus would not suffer those that had fallen / to be received
into the lap of the church (which thing was notoriously known of it self):
but to show / what were the impieties which waited upon that heresy /
amongst which he places this / that thereby public confession off faults /
to be made in every particular congregation (a singular exercise off piety /
and true worship of God) was quite taken away. And wherefore in translating my
words to no purpose / nor to no advantage off his / has he passed by so
slyly those words / the threshoulde off the church? For if by confession of
faults in the church / Cyprian mean the general / and catholic church off
Christ: I would gladly know off him / whether the catholic church off Christ
have a threshould: and if it have / where he will assign it.

Last off all / where as owte of these words off Cyprian / they dare nor
approach the threshould off the church, but wander abroad in the Province, I
conclude that the word church, can not be taken for the Province / being
opposed unto yt: he answers / that Cyprian does oppose there / the church
unto heretics / and not unto a Province. This is strange / that by a church
/ Cyprian must mean a Province: and by the word Province, he must not mean
a Province. and in saying / they roued abovvte the Province to deceive, and
spoil the brethren: yt is clear that by Province / are not understood the
heretics in the Province; for brethren be not heretics. Where he would give
to understand / that the Province (if yt be Christened) being the church, can
not be opposed unto the church: in deed if by opposed, were me^ te contrary
/ he had said truly. but when by opposed, or set against / he could not be
ignorant but I mente that which was diverse: he might have known / that as a
Christian diocese may be opposed unto a Christian Province: so a particular
Christian church / may be opposed unto either off both.

I would you would omit nothing which might make for yowr Diuis. 8. Page 361.
purpose: but I would wish that you would not repete one thing so often. For
if they had no good taste at the first: surely by this often seathing / they are
altogether unsavory. Cyprians matter is answered: the division of
ecclesiastical functions into three degrees / bishop / Elder (as you say
priest) and Deacon / I have Diuis 3. page 320.
showed to make flatly against you. There remains here / that I answer unto
Demetrius. which was about the year off the Lord 291. Who if he were bishop
off so many churches / as is supposed: there is the greater likelihood / that
in Cyprians time there might be bishops of the same breed. First if I grant
that he had such a superintendence / over all the parishes off Alexandria and
Egypt / as Cyprian is said of Gregory Nazienzen / almost over all the world:
that is / that for his learning and godliness / he was sowght to off all the
bishops of those parts: the Answ. sees he can gain nothing thereby / to
settle either his bishop / archbishop / or Metropoliran. But I answer / that he
has unfaithfully reported Eusebius / yea and that also pretending to set down
the autors words: as appears / for that he has set them in latin. Euse. 6.
li. ca. 1.
Eusebius very words are these. Laetus was then governor off Alexandria, and
the rest of Egypt: and Demetrius then, newly after Iuliane, received upon him
the Bishops office off the parishes there. Here yt appears that Eusebius
says / that Laetus the magistrate / governed both Alexandria, and Agypt: but
speaking of the Bishopric off Demetrius / only says / he was Bishop off the
paris hes there. which when by common construction / yt may be as well referred
unto Alexandria only / or unto the rest off Egypt only / or to both
together: yt was to great boldness / not only to gather this sense of Eusebius
/ but also to bring him in so speaking. But that the word there, can not be
referred unto the rest off Aegypte / but only has relation unto the
parishes off Alexandria / and that as there are no such words as you ascribe
unto Eusebius / so there can be no such sense as you Imagine: yt may easily and
clearly be understood off that before / and after. For if nether the bishops
of Alexandria before Demetrius / nor those after him unto the times wherein
Cyprian / and Cornelius lived / had that Jurisdiction over Egypt which you
Imagine: then by all reasonable understanding / yt must be esteemed that this
word (there) owght to be restreined unto Alexandria.

Abilius / the third Bishop off Alexandria after Mark had been in that
church / about the year of our Lord a 100. Eusebius Eusebius. 3. li. 21. ca.
Eusebius. 4. li. ca. 1. lib. 21. ca.
affirms to have been bishop off the parish off Alexandria, but of the other
parts of Egypt makes no mention. He says the same off Primus / succeding him
in that bishopric off Alexandria: the same off li. 4. c 4.
Iustus / which succeeded Primus: the same of 4. li. c. 5.
Eumenes which succeeded him: the same off an other 4. li. c. 11
Mark which succeeded him: the same of 4 li c. 19
Celadion which succeeded him: the same off Agrippa / who^ also he calls 5.
li. 9. c.
Agripinus which succeeded him. And where speaking off all the former he said /
they were bishops off the Parish off Alexandria: off 5. li. c. 9.
Iuliane which succeeded Agripinus he says / he governed the churches in, or at
Alexandria uttering the same thing by diverse words. Unto this Iuliane
succeeded Demetrius / off whom is said as before has been showed, yea off
those which succeeded Demetrius / as famous / and as renoumed as he: there is no
such thing. For off 6. li. c. 29
received the ministry which was at Alexandria: likewise of 6. li. c. 35
Dionisius which succeeded Heracles / that he received the government of the
churches which were at Alexandria which Dionysius lived abowte the times off
our Cyprian / and Cornelius / which we have presently in hand.

When therefore the Bishops of Alexandria so famous / are not red to have had
bishoply authority off any Province / but are contained within the circuit off
one city / until the time off Cyprian / and Cornelius: yt appears not only
that the D. has been abused in these words off Eusebius: but that this owght
to be an other mark to know / that nether Cyprian / nor Cornelius had any
Bishoplicke authority at all / further then the cities wherein their churches
were. And withal appears the cawse / why Eusebius. did no more particularly /
restreine the bishopric off Demetrius unto Alexandria: namely for that he had
so often spoken before of the precinctes of that bishopric. The next diu. has
nothing worth answer: being only that which I in few words subscribed unto.
Saving this / that Cyprian was Pupianus bishop: which makes nether whot / nor
kolde unto this question: seeing that Pupianus was no bishop / but one that
sometime had been off Cyprians church. But of answer to my argument (that
forasmuch as Cyprian condemns the pride of Pupian, for that his deed was
like, as if one should be appointed bishop of a bishop, or judge of judge:
there is no news. whereas if yt were not a proud thing / to be bishop of a
bishop / etc. Cypr. did with no good advise / set owte the fault of Pupian by
those words. And that Cyprian complains not off any wrong done to him as
archbishop (which the Ans. afraied to affirm / would have his reader thinck.)
but only as he was Bishop yt appears manifestly by diverse places / in that
he denies that he pressed him with further authority, then that which all
bishops had by succession unto the Apostels. That Cyprian did not obiecte this,
to appointe him self bishop of a bishop, as a proud name, but as a proud
deed: is a poor exception. for if yt were a proud deed / to exercise the
office off bishop over a bishop: yt must be also a proud name / to be called
the bishop: off a bishop.

The Answ. words carry no meaning with them / to conclude that which this
cawse requires. For what means this / one bishop Diuis. 10. etc. page 362.
etc.
off a Province, had no authority over another, but were equal? what is this
to my reason? which is, that forsomuche as the godly vvriters prove the
equality off the bishop off Rome with other bishops, for that they called one
another fellows, and brethren: the bishops off dioceses, and metropolitanes
calling one an other fellovv bishop, fellovv in office, brother, etc, do
thereby declare that there was none which ruled over an other. For onles the
reason be firm in the one: yt is not good in the other. But he answers
further / Cyprian in calling the bishops off his Province fellow bishops, and
brethren, declared thereby the function to be all one. So may the Papists
answer / that the Bishop off Rome called the Bishops his fellows / and
brethren / becawse they had the same function / and not in that for policy
sake they were not subject unto him. But as that / so this is an absurd answer.
The Godly writers use not this reason / to prove that other bishops exercised
the same ministry off the word and Sacraments / with the bishop of Rome
(which the Pope him self confesses): but to prove that they were not under /
but off the same authority with him / which he denies. The next answer
(Cyprian in calling them fellow bishops declares his humble spirit) is I doubt
not / althowgh I can not presently note the place / another buckler off the
Papists against this reason. As if true humility did hinder any / to take
that honor which his lawful office either in church / or commen wealth does
put upon him.

He further answers / that S. Peter calling the Bishops, and Pastors to whom
he wrote fellow Elders, was notwithstanding higher in degree then they. I
grant: but I deny that therefore S. Peter could exercise dominion over them.
When it is said that fellow bishop imports equality: yt is not meant so much
for honor / as for equality in authority that one has over an other. For in
honor the bishop off Rome had some preeminence over the Alexandrine / etc. yt
being granted him to have the first seat in meetinges / which notwithstanding
had no dominion. Therefore this makes directly against the dominion off
Archbishops. For if Peter in degree off ministry above the pastors / in
calling them fellow elders renounced dominion over them: how much more owght
they forbear to use dominion over those / with whom they carry the same yoke /
and degree off ministry? To that out off Cyprian (none of the^ took him self
bishop off bishops) he answers / he means the title off universal bishop:
which how absurdly it is spoken / in diu 28. Page 342.
may appear by that a before spoken off the Africane Council. His second
answer is a pinch at Cyprians authority / for that these words were uttered off
him in that Council, where an error was decreed, whereof hs was chief author.
Where he might with as good right / reject all that ever Cypria^ wrote. For
albeit this were spoken in that Council: yet yt no more pertains / nor has
no more acquaintance with that error / then this that we are justified by
faith alone. If he would conclude that Cyprians authority is no sufficient
proof / considering that being a man he might err in this point / as he did
in another: it is that we willingly grant / and therefore call / and cry upon
the D. as loud as we can / that the whole cause may be tried by the scripture:
from which he flies / as Darckenes before the face off the light.

His third is: by these words none takes on him to be the bishop off bishops,
he mente that one bishop should not tyrannically rule over another. which is
untrue: for Cypr. adds that / as an either thing likewise forbidden. So that
where he says / none does either make him self bishop off bishops, or bind
his fellows by tyrannical fear: the D. off two sentences makes one / and
Cyprians or, he expoundethe that is to say. But does he not see / how still he
ministers weapons unto the Papists / by this frivolous answer? for unto the
godly learned writers / alleging this place to prove that the bishops off Rome
have no authority over other bishops / the Papists may answer with the D. that
all that is mente off tyrannical authority. Fouthly he says / these words
Every bishop has ftee liberty, and free judgment off his own power, are
not mente off jurisdiction, but of judgment, and opinion. As if there were les
danger / in letting a bishop hold what opinion he thincketh good / withowt
controlement of an other bishop: then in letting him govern his church as him
seems best / withowte the same controlement. So that herin the D. flying from
the smoke / falls into the fire. The vanity off which answer appears also
/ by that in Cypr. do simp. praelat.
an other place where he says: there is but one bishopric vvheroff every
bishop holds one part, in solidum.
wholy, fully, in all respects. Likewise in an In the same Treatise.
other place he says / he holds his bishopric off Christ, who is the chief
bishop. And most plainly it is confuted by that I have alleged out off lib. 2.
Epist. 1.
Cyprian: Where in express words / he refers this freedom off power which
every Bishop has / not (as the D.) to the bishops opinion, but unto the
government off his church.

Where for confirmacion off these answers he says / otherwise a bishop should
be exempted from all controlement off Synodes, and other, as well as of
archbishops: the answer is easy. For althowgh Cyprian say no one Bishop can be
judged off an other bishop: yet he denies not but he may be judged off the
church. And althowgh no one bishop have authority over him: yet a Council off
bishops may correct him. And that this is one off those judgments off Christ
Cyprian meant off / and that in those words he does not reserve the judgment
off the bishop offending / unto the day of the general judgment: may be showed
by that he says / Christ set the^ bishops in their charges. As therefore
Cyprian calls the placing off a bishop in his charge by the church / by the
elders theroff / and the next bishops / the placing of Christ: so he means
that judgment given against a bishop offending / by the church / and Synodes /
is the judgment of Christ. That out off Cyprian / wherein the weight off the
argument lies (every Bishop must rule his own flock him self, as he that
shall make account off his deed unto the Lord) he passes by. After to the
words off Cyprian (that nether he, nor his fellows used compulsion toward
any, appointed any law to any: seeing that every one set over the church, has
in government theroff free disposition 2. l. Epist. 1.
of his own will / werof he shall give accoumpte unto the lord: (he says / I
left owte that which gives the solution / and thereupon according to his
coustome / picketh a quarrel to translate the whole sentence: Yet nether
shows one word / nor can show left owte / to make for him / against me.
Only he says undoubtedly Cyprian in saing he would not deal with other
bishops, etc. means those churches and bishops which he had nothing to do
with: which is very strange / seeing he has before made him archbishop /
almost ouerall the world.

After he says / he would not have suffered them if they had been off his own
charge: which is a gross begging off that in question. for yt is debated
whether he had any bishops under his charge. And what manner off interpretacion
is this / we do violence to none, nor appointe laws to none, that is to none
in other Provinces? and every bishop has power of the government of of his
own church, that is every bishop owte off Cyprians province? what a kold
saying should this be / that nether he / nor any of his fellows / used
violence toward bishops off other Provinces? With whom they having so small
intercommuning / could scarce use violence if they would. Or to say they
appointed no laws / to whom they had no coulor to give any? And as this
interprepretacion having lien in the Ans. rack / is pulled out of all the
joints; so that it is utterly false / may appear by that before alleged /
out off the Council off Carthage: Where words of like effect are uttered by
Cyprian / unto the bishops off the same Province he was of. Last of all /
becawse I may not have that credit which the Ans. to understand this place off
Cyprian: yet I trust In loc. commu. c. de potest. minist.
he will believe Musculus. Who of this place / and others concludes / that
when Cyprian vvrote, he did never so much as think off the power off
Patriarchs, off Metropolitanes, off the bishop off Rome: but esteemed that all
bishops ovvght to have like care, and power, every one in his own church. So
beside this testimony / that Cyprians priest was nether Patriarch / nor
Metropolitan: he has also that he was bishop of one church / which is that I
have affirmed. For the authority which the archbishops / and bishops have *
there is an other place: yt is sufficient here to show / that they had no
jurisdiction one over an other in Cyprians times. That out off Cyprian /
towching ministers sacrificing: is before answered.

To Cyprian saying / the unity off the church is interteined Diuis. 12. Page
364.
by consent off bishops one with an other: the D. answers / they agree never
the worse by having a superior above them Albeit they agree never the worse /
yet if they agree never the better: he owght as an unprofitable tree / which
occupies place in the lords orchard / be rooted out. Althowgh it shall (God
willing) appear / that the Archbishops office is the knife which cut the
cords off unity: which both was / and otherwise might have been maintained /
amongst the bishops. The first reason why tharchbishop is necessary / is:
because there may be one to assemble them together. As page 392.
thowgh that was not done before that office was heard off: or it could not be
done conveniently without an archbishop / by appointing one amongst them at
every off their Synodes / who should have authority to call the Synod
following. Which is likewise answer to his next reason / of putting them in
mind off their duties. All this may be see^ / not only by practice of reformed
churches in diverse places / France especially (where Synodes are assembled
from all parts of the realm twice a year / notwithstanding all that dominion
of one minister over an other / pulled up by the rotes): but also in the
primitive church / by that recited of one Malchion. Euse. li. 7 ca. 3.
Who being a simple Elder (so far from the estate of a^^ Archbishop / that he
was not Bishop) was president in the Council off Antioch / assembled against
Samosatenus heresy. If a simple Elder might govern the Bishops: yt shall be
to great shame for them / not to suffer them selves to be governed for the time
by one of their own order / withowt making an archbishop. Whereby appears how
intolerable the D. is: which condemns this order as inconvenient / confused
/ disordered.

Where he says / it can not be but a great help, that one have chief care of
prescruacion of unity: the office off an archbishop can put no further care
for the church upon any / then the Lord puts on him by virtue off the office
off bishop. For if the government off his own church / take not up all his
thowghtes / and cares: whatsoever is left / is due unto other churches by
ordinance off the lord. Forsomuche therefore as every bishop in the Province by
calling off God / cares to the uttermost of his power / for the churches
wheru^to he is associated / and tharchbishop can do no more then what lies in
his power: it follows that there can be no calling off men / which can ad
unto his care for this unity. If he say that this institucion off men /
causes the care commanded off god / the rather performed: first yt is
untrue. for althowghe the ordinances off men / may give a prick to the doing
off things owtwarde: yet they are not hable to move the conscience / and
inward affections / wheroff the care he speaks off / is a fruicte. Then if
it had such force / as to awake his care: yet that should be with no
advantage unto the churches of the Prounce / forsomuche as that would give
occasion unto other bishops / off diminishing theirs: whilst they fancy with
them selves a streighter bond / to provide for the unity off the church in
the archbishop / then in them selves. And so the care by this means revived
in one / should die in a great number. where he adds / as yt is in other
societies: yt has been showed that our Savior Christ / forbad that rule off
one minister over an other in the church / which may be used in the common
wealth. Althowghe I have answered further unto this point / where those
societies are particularly specified.

Where he asks / what if the bishops were divided amongst them sell ues? who
should compounde their controversies? He has his answer / that he may call
them together / in whose hand the last Synod left that authority? And what
if the archbishop him self draw owte off his trace / and be either divided from
all the bishops / or from the better / and sounder part / standing this goodly
order, who shall range him? And when the D. says that tharchbishop can not
deal for appeasing off controversies / but by persuasion: and that composition
which is made by entreaty off parties / may be made conveniently by equals /
what needethe there any superior archbishop? How untruly the Ans. writes / off
the archbishops and bishops authority in our church / to hyde the horns off
their immoderate power / both in this diuis. and that before: the eyes / and
ears off all men are witness. But as he serves tharchbishops / and bishops in
this defense: so for recompense off his pains / he makes them wait upon him:
and having now set them on horseback by and by for shift of answer / he makes
them light / and go a foot with their fellows.

Cyprian says the cause must be heard, where the fault Diuis. 13. page 363.
was committed. the D. that is to be understood of the Province, or diocese.
as if it were not heard within the province / and diocese: when yt is heard
within that particular church / where the controversy grows. Therefore to
make good his answer / thus he must interpret these words (there where the
fault was committed it shall be heard): whersoeuer in the Province / or
diocese the fault is committed / yt must be heard at the archbishops or
bishops palace. The first interpretacion is contrary to the propriety of
speech. For seeing matter rising in a particular church / is said properly to
rise there where yt was done / and can not but improperly / and by figure be
said to rise in the Province / or (...).
diocese: yt is manifest that Cyprian is made withowte any necessity / to
sprake improperly. As for the next interpretacion / yt is clean contrary to
Cyprians meaning. For when he will have the matter there handled / where they
may have both accusers, and witness. that can be by no means understood off
the Archbishops / or bishops consistory. For the parties have not their
witnesses / and accusers there / whether they are co^streined with greaate
charges / and long iorneis to transporte them. Where he says Cyprian speaks
against those which went from Africa into Italy: I prevented that / showing
the reason is general / and serving as well against those / which will pull
their causes unto their hearing which dwell a 100. or 200. miles off them / as
against those which carry them from one country to an other: whereunto he
answers nothing. For if there should be a bare opposition / between Afric
/ and Rome / and not rather between the place where the controversy rises /
and that far of: as lawful as yt is for him to say / Cyprian means not a
particular church where the cawse rises, but the diocese, or Province: so
lawful is yt for me to say / that he means nether diocese / nor province
but only that quarter which makethe the fourth part of the world. So that by
this means / the cause rising in Mauritania / may be judged in Aethiopia:
which is more then 10. times farther a sonder the^ Rome from Carthage. And
consequently yt should follow / that any controversy rising in the church off
England / may be determined at Rome being a part off Europe / as at the place
(by his answer) where the cause rose.

Where he says / there is no Province with us where both the accusers, and
witnesses may not be browght: I grant / if they come and leave their business
at home: if they die not by the way: if the parties be able to bear their
charges. And with these conditions they may be browght further. And by this
exposition off the Ans. the trial made in passing the seas / which the
council off Africa after forbad / may be a great deal more commodious / then
the archbishops. For they which dwell by the seaside / may both with more ease
/ and less charges have end of their matters in Callis / Deep / Ireland / and
Flaunders / then at Canterbury. Yea the trial from Carthage unto Rome / is
much easier: seeing there was but three days journey between Rome / and
Carthage. As appears by that Cato / to induce the Senate of Rome to desiroy
Carthage: held ovvt a fig saying, that was but the third day, sithe^s that fig
grevv in Carthage. Therefore Cyprians argument (by his interpretacion) Plin.
Not. hist. li. 15. cap. 18.
is not worth a shoe buckle / to prove that they owght not to fly from
Carthage to Rome the passage being easter / then from one end of a Province to
an other. Especially making such large Provinces as he does: that is / one to
co^teine 160. bishoprics, page 359.
belike such as ours. Where he says / this reason may serve as well againest
Westminster hall: leaving that as impertinent unto this question / it shall be
sufficient to answer / that besides that there be many causes ended in lower
courts / houlde^ almost in every village: he owght to understand / that
ecclesiastical causes are to be handled with greater speed then civil:
matters of conscience / more then of the pourse: the title of heavenly
inheritance / more then the earthly: of the life to come / then of this. So
that althowgh the trial of civil cawses for the whole realm / were (as he
says) necessary a^ Westminster: yet the same reason will not stand in
ecclesiastical.

In all these places which the Ans. has browght out off Diuis. 13. page 365.
Cyprian / Eusebius / Socrates / it is manifest that one bishop, is opposed
unto heretic bishops. Whereby may appear how like it is which I have alleged
/ that by one bishop / is understood not the unity off nombre / but off
truth in religion. And that there be no doubt hereof / let Cyprians words be
considered. That Cypri. Epist. 8. li. 1.
there should be an other altar appointed, and a new priesthood besides one
altar, and one priesthood, it can not be. Whatsoever he be which gathers
i^n an other place, scatters: yt is adulterous, yt is wicked, yt is
sacrilege, whatsoever the rage off men does institute, vvherby the ordinance
off God is broken. Now except the Ans. will say it is wicked / against the word
of God / adulterous / to have two bishops in one city: yt must follow that
Cyprians words do not bar many bishops to be in one city. And what if it be
showed / that not only in Cyprians time / but in Cyprians church there were
diverse bishops? Augustine speaking of the Donatistes / which separated them
selves from the church / for that they saw certain faults unpunished therein /
says: How did then Cyprian, and other the Lords corn in that church
(meaning Carthage) of unity eat the Lords bread, August. 3. li ad Parm. 2.
ca.
and drink his cup, not with the people only, or commen sort off the Clergy:
but with the bishops themselves, which were covetous ketchers, and which
shall not possess the kingdom off heaven? I would gladly understand what
Bishops they were like to be / with whom Cyprian did celebrate the supper off
the Lord. were they not Bishops off the church off Carthage? If they were: it
appears I have not so vainly expounded Cyprian / as the Ans. would bear his
reader in hand. And althowgh the D. be not able to prove / that there was but
one only bishop in a city in Chysostomes time: yet I grant that was observed
in the most places.

Whether I am able to show that from Christ's time there were two Bishops in
one city, before appeared: now appears what a vain crack it was / that all
the godliest, and best learned expound Cyprians words off an Archbishop, when
not one can be found to testify it. Yet to thend he may have some thing to
maintain this brag / he goes about to make the writers differ from them
selves. For if this place be off the authority that every bishop has in his
dioces (as writers do flatly affirm / in so much that the Artic. 4. diuis. 5.
bishop off Salisbury brings in Cyprian speaking after this sort: For every
bishop (says Cyprian) within his own dioces, is the priest of God, etc):
then yt cannot be understood of an Archbishop. For the authority Cyprian
speaks off / being the highest / and such as could not be controlled of any
other bishop: yt must necessarily seclude tharch bishops authority / which is
above a bishop. And as the Answ. to make Cyprians place serve his turn / was
compelled to expound Priest archbishop, church Province: so to make the bishop
and M. Fox help to bear out his folies / he must expound dioces Province / and
Bishop archbishop. And what man^er of proof is this / to conclude the greater
by the less? if of an archbishops authority he had concluded a bishops / it
had been more probable: but off a bishops to conclude an archbishops / and off
dominion over a dioces (as he pretends) to conclude dominion over one
Province / is far out off square. The next is answered in the beginning.

The first place is / that the bishop upon that of Cyprian, says: confusion,
and sects rise in a Province, or dioces, where the Bishops Diuis. 15. page
367.
authority, etc. Here because the bishop makes mention off Province: he
concludes that he speaks off an archbishop. As if his words may not well be
taken / that the confusion of secres insueth in a whole Province thorowghowt /
because the bishops authority which be theri^ / is despised. For beside that I
have showed that the bishop can not (saving his former sentence which he soft
repeateth) expound Cyprians place off an archbishop: if he had in this place
meant an archbishop / it had been easy to have coupled him with his Province /
as he does the bishop with his dioces. He asks me what I call him, that has
government off a Province? I ask him where the bishop off Sal. says /
Cyprians place is to be understood of that bishop / which has government off
a Province? does the only mention of the word Province* infer an Archbishop?
If he prove an Archbishop / and Province relatiues / so that a man can not name
the one / but he must understand the other: he says some thing. Ad also that
the Ans. deals unfaithfully in this place. For the bishop making his
conclusion both off Cyprian / and of a place off Honorius / Emperor: he
propounds it as the conclusion of Cyprians place only. Whereas if he could
conclude off these words (within a province) an archbishop: yet yt were easy
to answer / that the bishop put in those words / in respect of the place cyted
out of the Emperor / and not in respect off Cyprians. Considering that within
a dousen lines after / he affirms / that Cyprians place is understood off
thautoritie off a Bishop within his several dices: and by whole Brotherhood,
a company within a several dioces.

For that off M. Novvell page 33. beside that whatsoever he speaks there / is
not upon this place of Cyprian / but of an other: I have showed in the former
book / that chief Prelate is not always used for a bishop. And that it is not
altogether unlike but M. Nowell might mean so / appears by that the D.
cyteth out off the 62. and 63. page wherehe takes chief priest and bishop, for
the same. Howbeit because the author him self is alive / and knows best what
he means: I am well content the meaning off his words be such / as him self
shall best like off. Out off M, Fox he can not find so much as a fig leaf /
and therefore tells us how he says, Rome was a patriarchall church, and
therfofore not unlike but Carthage was also: how by a dioces is meant a
Province, and for so much as he allowed an archbishop, yt is like he expounded
Cyprians place of an archbishop. The only rehersall is too long a confutation.
In the end are recited at large the words of M. Philpot. which attributing
unto Cyprian a dioces / declares that he esteemed him a bishop / not an
archbishop. For that he calls him the Nouatians chief Bishop: yt is far from
the estate of an archbishop. He might well call him so in respect of his
singular learning / and piety: or in that he was bishop off the chiefest place
in Afrik. And the same may be said off Cornelius being Patriarch. For
otherwise in authority he could not be: seeing him self confesses / that
patriarchs were appointed at the council off Nice / about 150. years after.
Albeit the truth is / that the appointement of those 4. patriarchall seats /
was not by the Council off Nice / but off Calcedon. Nether does it follow that
if Cornelius were a Pairiarch / therefore he was Prince off many bishops: onles
he will say that becawse Tertull. aduers. Hermog.
Tertullian calls Philosophers Patriarchs off Heretics, and Ierom. praef.
in Tit.
Jerome Tacianus, the Patriarch of Encratites: therefore Philosophers / and
Tacianus bore dominion over the Heretics / or Encratites. He might be so
called in that he was chief father of the church off Rome / where he executed
his office: as Ierom. in 3. cap. Isay.
Jerome witnesses off the Jews Rabbines to have been called Patriarchs: yet
they had no government / or rule / but in the several Synagogues where they
taught.

Now it appears the Ans. can not bring so much as one seely testimony / to
prove this place of Cyprian understood of tharchbishops / or metropolitanes
authority: besides that alleged of Muscu. flatly denying that Cyp. thowght of
any Archbis. or Metrop. but only of every Bishop in his own church: I will ad
the testimony of Bucer against thaccusa. of Choclaeus, and Gropperus to the
Emper.
Bucer / who affirms the very same that I. Showing against the Pope / that
Christ only is universal bishop / he assigns this reason: For he is present
with his sheep, and with every of them, and feeds the^ until the end of
the world: and for this cavvse puts ministers in his place, and that to
every church her several minister. For he did not only give Apostles,
Prophets, Evangelists, and ministers off many churches once: but gives also
daily unto every church off his her ministers, Pastors, and Doctors: and both
instructs, and leads them with his spirit, that they may serve their
ministries, him self only gyuing increase unto their planting, and watering.
For unto every one off them, he has appointed a proper portion off the flock,
as S. Cyprian testified by vvarrant off tradition off Christ, and his Apostles:
and that with this condition, and power, that every one together with his
presbytery, and Clergy should rule his whole flock, as one which should
make account off his own act: not unto the Pope off Rome, but to the Lord.
which is the Prince of Pastors. Amongst vvho^, no man might appoint him self
bishop of bishops, or judge an other, or be judged of an other: whereupon the
judgment of the bishop belonged unto Synodes, not unto one bishop, as long as
the policy off the church given by thapostels, stood. Therefore bishops were
equal, not only in power of the keys (by which fable Latomus would elude
the place of Cyprian) but also in use, and degree off power, and jurisdiction.
In the end / shutting up all that he had said off the metropolitanes / he
says: This is the sentence off the catholic church, concerning the power of
bishopes as well off Rome, as others, grounded on the word off God, approved
by canons, observed off all true bishops. Wherein Bucer affirms that this
portion off the flock which Cyprian speaks off / is the charge off every
minister in his several church: and that by institution off Christ / and his
Apostels / no minister or bishop can have an other bishop to judge him / but
that if there be a fault in him / it is to be judged by Synodes. Thus I leave
to the readers judgment / how it was more easy for the Ans. to say / the
godliest, and learnedest writers expound the place of Cyprian of an archbishop:
then to show it / when it comes to proof. And althowgh he fall flat under the
bourden undertaken in his first book: yet as thowgh he had not half his lode /
he page 550.
has charged him self a fresh. For where before he said / the godliest, and
learnedest expound this of an archbishop: now he says / all learned writers
expound it as he does. It were well there were some reasonable proportion /
between the tongue and the hand. for it can not be but a foul fault / to be so
long tounged / and so short handed.

Before I come to Ieromes testimony / the order off times for the better
understanding off this cause / requires that those both autorities / and
examples be answered / which the Answerer has alleged / both before / owte
off the Council off Nice and Antioche / and after / pa. 470. etc. The next to
the times off Cyprian / is Dionysius Alexandrinus: which (says he) had under
his jurisdiction all the churches in Pentapolis, as Athanasius testifies in a
certain epistle, Apolog 2. First / there is no such thing in all that book
/ nor in no epistle contained therein. The place he means of / is in an
epistle he wrote concerning Dionysius judgment / against the Arian heresy.
Then / yt is not said (as he reports) that all the churches of Pentapolis
were under his jurisdiction: but only that he had care of those churches, or
(as the translators words be) the care of those churches apperteined unto him.
Which what little or no weighte they have to prove archiepiscopall jurisdiction:
shall be seen when we come to the place / where the sense of this to have
care, is discussed. In the mean time yt is to be observed for better trial of
this matter / which I have before noted owte of Eusebius: that he succeeded in
the bishopric off Alexandria unto his predecessor / withowte attributing unto
him any further charge. And when as Eusebius. declares / that he writing unto the
churches in Egipte / wrote unto them by the bare name of the brethren which
were in Aegypte, withowte any title betokening any bond / or knot off
mynisterie toward them: and off the other part writing Euse. li. 6. cap. 46.
unto the churches in Alexandria / intitleth that writing an exhortation unto
his flock: he declares evidently / that he esteemed Alexandria his proper
charge / and that (saving that both in respect Aegypte was his country / and
the peace of his own church was folded up in the welfare of yt) his care for
Aegipte was general / as for other churches.

And the very testimony which the Ans. has alleged / if yt be weighed:
does sufficiently declare how far Dionysius was / front that antoritie ever
the churches off Pentapolis / which he imagines. For there is showed / bow
when he understood off certain bishops there / leauened with the heresy of
Sabellius: he sent messengers to them to call them back from their heresy.
And when they went yet forward more impudently: what jurisdiction doothe he
exercise against them? doothe he cause them to appear before him? send out
the sentence off excommunication / remove them from their charges / suspende
them / at the least until some trial off their amendment? none off all
these: but says / he was by this stubbernes off theirs, compelled to write
against them. And yet if Dionysius might have used this authority / he would
no dowbte: and if he had / Athanasius would by no means have let it pass. For
if he could have alleged / that Dionysius had either deposed / suspended / or
excommunicated those Sabellian bishops: yt had been a singular means to have
stopped the mouth off the Arrians: which would have borne men in hand / that
Dionysius favored Sabellius heresy / and consequently also theirs. And
towching the government off his own church in Alexandria: how far yt was
from that lordly Euse. li. 7. ca. 20.
dominion / the bishops / and archbishop use now: may appear in that he
calls the elders off the church off Alexandria / his fellow elders.

After folowethe one Gregory / which he avouches owte of Eusebius. 7. li. 24. to
have governed all the churches throwghe Pontus first / this word all, is not
found there. Secondly / yt is utterly untrue that he says / he governed all
the churches. For Eusebius ioineth Athenodorus with him / as his match in all
points. So that if there were any archbishop there / it was two headed:
contrary to the archbishops institution / supposed of his patrons. Thirdly / yt
appears in an other place / where Eusebius speaks of them again / that
they were not bishops off all the churches of Pontus / 7. lib. 28. (...).
but had only their parishes / or churches in Pontus. And the cause why Eusebius.
made mention of those only / was (as is there apparent) because they were the
most famous amongeste the Bishopes in those parts: and therefore by all
likelihood chosen owte off the rest / were sent unto the Council off Antioche
/ gathered against the heresy of Sabellius. Therefore he which is said off the
D. to have been ruler off all the churches off Pontus / is found to have but
one only parish in that circuit.

Peter / Bishop off Alexandria follows: which having regard unto the time
wherein he died / was only about eight years / before the Council off Nice.
So that the Answ. in saying he was 20. years before, must be understood of
the time he entered into his bishopric. Of him Epiphanius says / he had the
administracion of all the churches of Aegypte, was archbishop. What manner off
archbishopric / and government this was / may be gathered by that that
Epiphanius says / Miletius was archbishop likewise, and had the government
together with him. And not that only / but that Miletius occupied the second
place in the archbishopricke with Peter. Whereby Epiphanius gives to
understand / that there was the third and fourth / and consequently as many
archbishops / as there were bishops off name / and estimacion amongst them:
which beside their own / procured the good off other churches round about.
This is further confirmed in that Epiphanius (as rendering the cause why he
calls Miletius Archbishop / and to have the second place after Peter) says
/ Miletius seemed to excel the other bishops in Aegypte: And where yt is said
/ that Miletius was under peter: yt is to be understood that he was under
him in honor / and not subject unto him as unto a commander / or as to one
which had dominion over him: as yt shall appear by the Council off Nice after
/ and as the discourse of Epiphanius story / plainly shewethe. For where as
between Peter / and his adherentes off the one part / and Meletius and his
fellows off the other / being shut in in prison for testimony off the trwthe /
there fell a controversy abowte receiving those which had fallen in time off
persequution: Peter (as Epiphanius reports) desired, and made supplication
unto Miletius, and the rest saying, let us receive them, and appoint them a
penance. And when he could not gain his cawse by prayer / and supplication:
he spread owte a veil in the middaste off the prison / and proclaimed by a
deacon / that as many as were off his side* should come unto him: and those
which were off Melitius part, should go to him. Whereupon a fevv joined
them selfs unto him, the greater number remaining with Melitius. In which
count off Epiphanius / there is nether any authority / or dominion pretended
by Peter over the rest / nor any subjection acknowledged off the other. but
there is to be seen contrariwise all felowlike behavior of one toward an
other. And onles this be the property of an Archbishop / to be author off a
horrible schism / and rent in the church (whereas yt is vaunted off him /
that he compoundeth schisms made by other) there appears nothing in Peter in
that whole action / Archbishoplike. If the Answ. say / the prison was no place
where he could exercise his archiepiscopall authority: the reply is easy /
that he might as well exercise yt there / as out off prison. For yt being a
time off persequution / he could use no where any other constreint then by the
ecclesiastical censures: and those (having as appears a company with him in
prison) he might as well use there / as being at liberty.

Hitherto I trust has appeared / that there has been not so much as any
footing / or kold sent either off archbishop / or metropolitan such as ours: yt
follows to examine that out off the Nicene Council, which brings the first
tydinges of the Metropolitanes. Where we having confessed that there were
Metropolitanes / denied that they were like ours how truly / rests to be
considered. First / that which the Answ. can most pretend out off this Council
/ for jurisdiction off Metropolitanes over Bishops off the same Province / is
the bishop off Alexandria, ovvght to have power over the bishops in Egypt,
Lybia, and Pentapolis. These are the sounding words / and which carry the
greatest noise off Metropolitan authority. If therefore it fall out that these
words to have power / bring more show in the eye / then weight in the balance:
then the Answ. is greatly fallen from his hope / which thincketh to reap of
this peace / dominion off the Metropolitan over other bishops. The words which
the D. turns (...)
to have government, signify in that place nothing but to g have chief
dignity, or honor Which is apparent / for that the same thing being
attributed unto Rome / Antioch / and other metropolitan churches / is uttered
by the word (...).
honorable revvard, the same that (...).
dignity in the next canon where be speaks off the bishop off Jerusalem: as
it is also noted off De statu primitiuae Eccl. page 23.
Villerius / where he confirms this signification off the word / (...).
preeminence, out off Plato. This may be further understood / by that Beza
writes upon these words / he gave all these which believed in him this
dignity, or prerogative, that they should be called the children off God. e
Beza upon 1. John.


Now what this dignity / and preeminence was / may easily be seen by that the
bishop of Rome having (...).
preeminence, or dignity over the bishop off Constantinopel / Alexandria /
etc. had nothing thereby more then they / saving only the first place in their
meetinges Seeing therefore these words translated to have power, signify nothing
but to have honor, which consisted only in having the highest place: by these
words off the Council grows nothing to the Metropolitan / but only to sit
in the highest place at meetinges. This may also appear by the same h Council
/ g Council. Nic. can. 5.
where yt is said / that if there rise disorder in any church which is not
compounded, it ovvght to be decided at the provincial Council, which was
therefore to be houlden twife every year: in which faults were to be
corrected, not by the Metropolitan / but by the bishops together. And becawse
the Council here refers us / to that accoustomed before: yt is to be
considered what that was / so far as we have testimony. The bishops assembled
at Nice / browght their quarrels one against an other / Eusebius. 2. li. de vit.
Constable.
and offered them to the Emperor: which they would not have done / at least so
generally / if there had been any such order taken off referring their debates
to the Metropolitan. The Emperor likewise receiving their bills / and answering
that it perteined Sozom. 1. lib. ca. 17.
not unto him to decide those matters: sends them not to their Metropolitanes
to be judged / but adiourneth them to the judgment off God. Yet if there had
been any such authority ecclesiastical off the Metropolitanes: the Emperor /
as he was very religious in those observations / would not by all likelihood /
have failed in that.

Likewise writing jointly to Alexander bishop / and Arius Elder off Alexandria
/ amongeste other things he says: it was not meet they should rule so great
a people, being divided among them selves. Where it is to be observed / that
howsoever these words so great a people be taken / whether for the church off
Alexandria / or for all Agipt / etc. the Bishop governed not alone / but by
consent / and advise of the Elders of that church. Then if the Ans. will refer
this government to the whole countries off Egypt / Lybia / etc. and take it
in that signification he does / for bearing dominion, and commanding the rest:
not the bishop only / but every Elder off Alexandria / had commandment not
only over the Elders / but over the bishops them selves off other churches.
Which if it be absurd: that whereoff it follows / must be likewise. This is
all that I find the Nicene Council gives to the Metropolitan above the rest:
how little it is / and how small a part off that the Answ. presumes / let the
reader judge. That he owght to be no bishop, which is made withowt consent off
his Metropolitan, is a very seely prerogative: seeing yt was the order of the
church in those times / that all the bishops off the Province / should be at
the Theod* 5. li. 23. ca.
making off a Bishop. And as the election off the people was void / if the
Metropolitan were not at it: so was it also if there were not three bishops at
the least present. Let us see now whether the practice of the Metropolitanship
/ will fall out any more fanourable for this pretended jurisdiction.

Athanasius follows: on whom the D. would fasten this archbishopricke: first
/ because Ischaras submitted him self unto him by lettres. As if every one
which has offended an other / doothe by his submission acknowledge him an
archbishop / whom he has offended: and as if Ischaras owght not to have done
as much unto any bishop in the Province / if he had belonged unto his parish
/ as he did unto that of Athanasius. Secondly becawse Arsenius, and those off
his diocese, wrote lettres off submission unto Athanasius. The print off the
diocese is so deeply set in the D. head / that what soever he meets with /
he turnethe into yt. For there is there no mention off diocese / but off a
city. As for the submission he makes / yt is not to Athanasius / but unto the
ecclesiastisticall canons: only he acknowledges him Metropolitan / and that
withowt his sentence he will make no Ecclesiastical decree perteining unto the
church: which we deny not. For we confess Athanas. Apol. 2.
that there were then Metropolitanes. and as Arsenius could not make any
decree to wching the whole church in the province: no more could Athanasius
withowte Arsenius: as has been before out off the former book declared. But
that he was subject unto Athanasius, there is not a word: the clean contrary
is to be plainly seen. For Arsenius in his fare well writes thus; we and
those with us, salute the whole company off sacred men which are in thy
jurisdiction. by which words he manifestly exempteth him self / from the
jurisdiction off Athanasius. Whereupon yt must follow / that the office off
Metropolitaneship in those days / implied no subjection / nor authority to
command / over other bishops in his province. And Athanasius in calling the
bishops there / his fellovv ministres often times: declares Athana. Apol. 2.
in what place he had them / not as subjects / but as his fellows. And that
the A. escape not with that Popish shifte / that Athanasius thereby did declare
his humility: yt is to be seen in that book / that the other bishops do
more then half a dosen times / call him their felovve mynister, barely /
withowte other title. Now if Athanasins not off right / but off his great
humility called him self their fellow mynister: yet the other bishops in so
calling him / when they were subject unto him / and at his commandment / are
to be charged not only as void off Christian humility / but also as
forgetful even off all commen civility / and good manners.

That added off Athanasius visiting off Mariotes, and the Provinces there, as
they are called: pertains nothing unto this question. for there were no
bishops in that place: and what he did in that behalf did not as Archbishop /
but as Bishop: that territory belonging unto Alexandria. And not only
Archbishops / but bishops / yea Elders visited the parishes off other bishops.
As for Tom 1. Council. Constable. Cart. 4. 33. cap.
that the parishes in the territory off Mariotes, had neuer^ bishop, but
belonged unto Athanasius: beside that I have showed that corruptions had
greatly prevailed at that time / it is to be observed that it is there put as a
strange thing / and unwonted that one bishop should have so large grownd. For
unless that be the autors end: there was no cause why he should have used that
kind off speech. Which may better appear / forsomuche as Socr. li. 1. ca. 27.
Socrates speaking off this story / interlaceth the same sentence: when as
speaking off the places off bishops else where / he never mentions any such
thing.

The canons off Arles Council, off that attributed unto the Apostles, and of
Antioch follow. The first / has nothing not granted / and serves for filling
only. The second / supposed of the Apostles / is (...).
the same with that of Antioch. That off Antioch / is first unfaithfully
translated / after untruly gathered upon. For where the Council says / that
the Bishop praesident in the Metropolitan city: should have care of the
Province, because all men which have business use to come from all places, to
the Metropolitan city. he has page 332. turned the words off the Council
vpside down / putting in steed off because all men etc. wherefore all men, etc.
making that the effect which it makes the cause / and the cause which it
makes theffect. The Councils meaning is / that forsomuche as men do usually
for other business / resort to the Metropolitan city: therefore the bishop of
it was most fit / to whom controversies should be browgt. He translateth also
for parish, dioces: and so in steed that the council supposes the bishop to
have under his charge often times / beside those in the town he dwells in /
certain villages which resort unto his church / as in Hitchin / and diverse
other places with us: he to be sure to put in enowghe / supposes by his
translation / that the bishops had a diocese / and their places beside. If by
diocese he mean such as ours: I would gladly know / what those places were /
which the bishops had beside their dioceses: when as in the largeste spread of
bishops / they were notwithstanding tethered within the compass off other
dioceses. If by it he mean a parish / such as every minister with us is
assigned unto: why uses he diocese, to deceive the reader / especially when
the Counsels words pulled him to the word off paris he? If he will excuse
this later fault / and lay yt upon the translatour of the Councels / which
turns Parish. (...). Dioeces.
Dioces: he confirms at unawares that which I said / that at the first a
diocese and parish were often confounded. Howbeit that the Councels words can
not bear that significacion / as we take Dioces / is before declared.

Upon these words he gathers / the hishops are subject unto the
metropolitan, and that the council wills them to be so: which is very page
333. page 471.
untrue, for there is no word in that canon / that proves subjection / much
less expresses. As for the honor which they should give him: I have showed
what it is owte off the Council off Nice: the care for other churches in the
Province comes after to be considered. For the bringing off matters unto him /
which they could not end at home: yt appears by diverse places / that they
were not browght to him to determine / but only to make relation off / unto the
provincial council: and that he could end Triparti. hist. li. 9. cap. 13.
Carth. 4. ca. 25. Co^stanti. 1. cap. 3.
no matter / but which advise off other Bishops in the same Province. In the
Africane Counsel yt was decreed / that if a Aphr. co^c. 87. c.
bishop striving with an other about the territories, entered into them
vvithovvt having resolution of the other bishops: althovvgh he had the peoples
consent, and Metropolitanes letres, he should leese his cause. In the Council
of Sard. conc 9. c.
Sardis / about the same time with that off Antioch / the bishops call their
Metropolitan, brother, and fellovv bishop. What Lordship and dominion can be
gathered off these things / I know not.

And that this was the first institution off Metropolitanes which I have
alleged / and that I have herin not straied from the meaning of the Councels /
may appear by the testimonies Institut. 4. li. 4 ca. sect. 4.
off others / which have spoken off this matter. Calvin says: they were
instituted, for preservation only of the policy: and what that was / he
shows by the bishop / the same in his own church / which the Metropolitan
in the Province. That yt was as the office off a President in a Council, to
propound matters, togather 4. li. 4. c. sect 2.
the voices, etc and to put that in execution, which was decreed by the rest:
denying flatly that he had any dominion over the Elders off the same church,
and affirming that he him self was subject to the company of the elders The
same therefore by his judgment / must be the state off the Metropolitan / In
his asvver to Choclaeus and Groperus: of their accusat. to the Emp.
toward other Bishops. Bucer says / there were certe in bishops assigned to
the chief seats, vvheroff they had a singular care: which did not be have
themselves as bishops over the bishops off those dioceses, but if any of them
faulted: admonished him as one brother does an other, as one fellovv, and
companion in office does an other. And if the bishop admonished, either did not,
or could not amend the fault: he made relation of the whole matter unto the
Synod. After he shows that at the first the excellency, and preeminence off
the bishop off Rome, Constantinople, and Alexandria, etc. was not off power
and jurisdiction, but of knowledge, zeal, care, and help of others: which
those chief bishops did so yeald unto the churches, that they left the whole
right off the bishops office, equal with that they the^ selves executed, unto
every bishop. Bullinger / after he had proved all dominion / primacie / and
maioritie Sermon. 57. upon the Apocal.
/ forbidden by our Savior Christ unto the minister / says: From the
beginning the Apostels, and ministers off the churches which followed the rule
off the Apostels, governed their churches equally, vvithovvte that one was
preferred before an other (which he offers to prove by many testimonies):
and about the council off Nice, and a little before, Metropolitanes by man's
ordinance not to be contemned, were received: which should as it were be
presidentes unto the rest, or rather serve all the rest in calling Synodes.
And yt was very vvarely provided, that he should not be called the primate,
lest any man should think, that he was superior unto other in power, but
in order only.

Wherein almost all the poinctes off the Archbishop / and Metropolitan /
debated between the Answ. and us / are contained. For first / he denies that
there was any preferment of one minister above an other / in the Apostles
times. Secondly he says / the office off the Metropolitan came in a little
before the Council off Nice. Thirdly / that it was not lawful for that
metropolitan to be called primate. Fourthly / that he had no power over the
rest / but served only for keeping of order in meetinges. All which things we
affirm / and the D. denies: and that not withowte a triumph. As for that he
says / this institution of man is not to be despised it appears that he meant
not to commend it / but only to signify that if yt had remained in that
simplicity it might have been the easlier borne: especially / considering they
have no such order off Metropolitanes / with them. The B. off Salisbury / unto
Harding obiecting that the primates had authority Defens. Apolo. 2. pa. 3. c.
5. diuis.
over inferior bishops / answers: they had it by agreement, and coustome, but
nether by Christ, nor by Peter, nor Paul, nor by any right off Gods word.
Whereby not only is confirmed / that which I propounded / off my not variyng
from the godly writers: but also falls the D. dream / that they were
instituted by the Apostles. Yea further appears / that their institution with
authority over other / was unlawful: as that which has no manner warrant out
off the word off God.

Having answered the Counsels / I return unto Ieromes place / as yt is set
down off the Ans. He says / it is a poor refuge to discredit the author. I
spared the author / casting part of the error upon In 3. c. diuis. 16 p. 369.
the times wherein he lived: which I proved corrupter and further from the truth
left by thapostles / by a reason which he could not so much as wrangle with:
althowgh as towching the proof off an archbishop / or bishop such as ours / I
am content the Ans. set up his credit as much as he will. He says / there is
no difference between Cyprians bisbop, and Ieromes. Seeing he will needs have
it so / let one measure be off both: and thereby I trust shall appear / off
that which I have spoken before / that Ieromes bishop is lower by head and
shoulders / then they for whom his authority is houlden out. Howbeit if in
Cyprians time / the bishop only had not the laying on of hands / and
ordeining him that was chosen to the ministry by the church / but the Elders:
and he did nothing in his church, or parish but with advise of Cypr. 10.
Epist. li. 3
the Elders theroff: yt appears that Ieromes bishop / althowgh differing
only from an other minister / in ordeining Elders / and Deacons / had somewhat
encroched upon the bounds off the presbitery / more then Cyprians Lastly he
says / for the corruption off times, this kind of bishop was devised. I
willingly give testimony unto those governors / or at least the most off them
/ that they had a good meaning in that invention off man: but that it was
remedy against the corruptions / I deny. And to the reasons before alleged for
proof thereof / let this be added: that even from the first day / wherein this
devise was established / the corruption in the church was not deminished / but
grew / and got strenght by little / until the whole face of the earth was
covered / and the power off darcknes / in the fulness off Antichrists kingdom
/ wholly settled. Likewise / that the first resistance by any settled church
against that corruption / was by those which abolished that devise off man /
and received the order in the Apostels times / towching the equality off
ministers. As the Bohemians / Merindoles / the churches in Germany / and
Geneua: whose standerd bearers (as partly has appears / and more hereafter
shall) fowght against this stately dominion both of bishops / and archbishops

The next diuis. I leave to the readers judgment / referring him to that
answered in the beginning. In the next / as one whose forehead is more hard
then Adamant / he shameth not still page 371.
to affirm / that this manner off bishop, and archbishop was in the Apostles
time: notwithstanding the author out off whom he draws his proofs /
confesses that at the first there was no difference between a bishop and an
Elder: and that after it was decreed / that in every church one only should
have the name of bishop. If it were the first institution that they should be
one / and the first institution be the Apostels institution: it was the
Apostels institution that they should be all one. if the Apostels did revoke
this institution off theirs: show their hands / bring forth their evidence.
Jerome prouethe by diverse testimonies off scripture / that a bishop and elder
were one / according to S. Paul. Therefore if the D. avoid this authority: he
must show us the Apostels authority in writing. for herin yt is trwe that the
law says / matter of vvriting and record, can not be avoided but by that of
as high a nature. He gathers that this order of bishops / and archbis. was in
thapostles times / because there were schisms then. I have by this reason
proved in an other place / that th^^e were no archbishops: where if he had any
thing / he should have spoken. And how is he bewitched which sees not the
words of his author? For when ad Eua.
Jerome says / this came by custom: he evidently declares that ^^ was not by
determinacion of the Apostels. The same declares in an Epistle unto Iero.
Augustine when he says / the office of a bishop was greater then off an other
mynister, as tovvching the names off honor, throvvghe a custom off the
church, which now has gotten the upper hand. Likewise when Ad vsus Lucif.
Jerome says / this preferment of the bishop is not by any necessity of
law, but for that yt was granted to honor him vvithall: yt is manifest
that yt was not by the Apostlels determinacion. For if yt had been their
institution: yt had been necessary.

After admitting yt was after the Apostels / he proceeds to answer Contr. Prax.
Tertullian which says / that is true which is first, that is false which
is later. But how comes yt to pass / that he anwereth not that alleged owte
off our Savior Christ's e words: which calls the Pharisees unto the first
institution? that Mat. 19. ^^.
was belike to hard for him to byte upon. And the answer unto Tertullian is
absurd. For he brings him in reasoning as he uses: that is / proving the
thing in controversy / by that a like doubtefull. For if the rule of
Tertullian extend yt self no further / then unto things he there speaks of
/ and in debate: his reason is no reason / but a giddie turn about / wherein
altowghe great pains be taken / yet there is no grownde gotten. Whereas
Tertullian prove the / that Praxeas judgment of our Sau. Christ was therefore
naught / because yt was new / and new because yt was not agreing with that
given by the scripture. Moreover his answer to the place / presumes that the
government off the church is not a matter off faith / and salvation: which
is the question. And as for his Fantasies he resembles my reason with / they
have nothing like. For beside that there were Christian magistrates /
baptisinges in churches / communion ministered unto more then 12* in thapostels
times / and off their alowance: the Apostels never tawght that there should be
no Christian magistrates / no baptisinges hut in rivers / no eating off things
strangled / etc. (the contrary off all which they plainly taught / ordeining
only that the Gentiles should support the Jews / in strangled things / abut
they rawght that a bishop and traching elder be all one / and never allowed that
one Pastor should take the name off a bishop from all his fellows within 40.
miles compass. The testimony out off Tertull / makes way for Montanus heresy:
In the ^^ Tractat*
whereof I have spoken before.

Unto the next diuis. he answers not. For yt being plain that the Apostels
tawght / that a bishop and elder were all one: because he had nothing to
answer / he leueth that / and runnethe back to that handled in the beginning /
off the equality off ministers. As for the testimony owte of Zuinglius:
first yt is vntrw / that the Anabaptists obiecte this place against
Zuinglius, which I have pressed him with: secondly / yt is untrue that they
objected unto him in the like case which we do. for in all their
controversies with him / they have not one of those points now debated. And
where he says / Tertullians words serve not / because these degrees are not
against the truth: let him deny if he dare / that this is the truth off God /
that a Bishop / and an other minister off the word / be all one. Then let him
answer whether these sayings (a bishop / and an other minister off the word are
all one: a bishop / and an other minister off the word be not all one) be
opposed / and set one against an other. If he can deny none off these / then it
is justly concluded: that this invention off man / which has made a bishop to
differ from another mynister off the word / is against the truth.

Because I love not that compass off words / which the D. delights in / I
concluded shortly / and yet sufficiently to the understanding Diuis. 20. etc.
page 372. etc.
off any / that does not willingly blindefolde him self. My argument is: The
best deciding off controversies, was in the apostels time: but that was not
by archbishops: wherefore the best deciding of controversies, is not by
archbishops. for proof that yt was not by archbis. / I set down that there
were no archebishops then. Unto this deformed face off reason (as he calls
yt) let us see how formally he answers. First he says / we are not bound
to the form of government, used by the Apostels: and therein refers him
self to that he has / and shall say: where also let him take his answer.
Secondly / that althowghe the Apostels had not Diuis. 19. Page 310.
the name off Archbishops / yet they had the office: which I have showed to be
a shift of the Papists. Then yt is to be observed / how he proves that
thapostels had the office of an archbishop / (...). The mean is consequente to
both the extremes.
and in what good logic. Archbishops have the direction off many churches,
the ending off controversies, etc. the Apostles had the same: therefore the
Apostels were archbishops. by this reason a man may prove not only diverse /
but contrary things to be all one: seeing contraries have diverse things wherein
they agree. So that first this kind off reasoning has the fault of those
ridiculous arguments / which the D. propounds page 316. secondly yt takes
for granted / which is the question. For he presumes that the Archbishops
office keeps the church in godly quietness: which is debated. Thirdly / to
prove the Apostels authority in the churches (which is not in question) he has
made a great muster of testimonies: to prove the archbishops / not a word.
After he cyteth Ambrose / to prove that Apostles are bishops. Yt is great
merueill if he keep good order in the church / for whose establishement the
Answ. is constreined / thus to confound / and make a broile off all: and it is
before confuted.

Howbeit admitting that the bishops succeed unto the Apostels in preaching the
word / and governing the church: I have In 3. Tra. Diuis. 4.
showed how that is a whip to drive the archbishop clean out of the church off
God. And this is here to be observed / that when it is said the bishops
succeed unto the Apostels etc. that must be understood off the Apostles
bishops / and such as they instituted. For what bishops have better right to
succeed the Apostles / then they? But those were (as I have showed) bishops off
singular congregations / bishops which had no superiotitie over their
fellowbishops / as Jerome does confess. In the end he says / If I can prove
by good authority, that one was governor amongst the 12. Apostles: it shall
not seem strange to have an archbishop over a Province. If upon this that one
had government of 12. assembled in a particular place / he can conclude that
there should be one governor off the ministers in a Province: I can with
better reason conclude / that there may be one to govern all the ministers in
the world. For if because one governed twelve / therefore one may govern all
in Province: then becawse one may govern all in a Province / I will conclude
that one may govern all in the world. As towching the number off those which
are governed / there is not so much difference between the ministers off a
Province / and the ministers off the whole church: as between 12. and the
ministers off some whole Province. Towching the distance off place / yt is as
much between a Province / and the wole extent off Christianity: as between a
particular place off an acre breadeth / and some Province. Wherefore this reason
is more favorable to the Pope / then to the Archbishop. Peter's superiority
shall be after seen: where also this sentence of Jerome shall be answered.
Only here let it be observed / that the Answ. has borrowed this reason off
Pope Anaclete / which alleges it to prove Archbishops. Tom. 1: Council. li. 3.
ca. ^. Hierar. ecclesia.
And it is browght also of Pighius against the protestants / which denied that
there owght to be any archbishops: as shall appear herafter more at large.

The place off Calvin / is handled afterward: Bucers upon the Ephesians. I have
answered. That out off his book de Reg. Chapter the same in effect / has the same
answer. Howbeit it is here to be noted / how the D. thorowgh greedy desire off
seeming to say somewhat / puts down with one hand that he sets with the
other. For to the maintenance off the archbishop and bishop / here be browght
two testimonies / one of Jerome / the other of Bucer clean contrary. If Jerome
say true / that the superiority off one Bishop over an other is by coustome,
not by institution off God: then is that untrue pretended out off Bucer / that
it pleased the holy ghost yt should be so. For if it be off the holy ghost it
is the institution of God. The D. therefore must forgo one off these / seeing
that both will never draw in one forowgh. The contrariety with my self, which
the gloss charge me with / is for that page 349. I said out off Eusebius /
that as long as thapostles lived, if any went about to corrupt the doctrine,
they dit it in the darck: and here (out off the Apostle) I affirm / there
were heresies, and schisms. Wherein what contrariety there is / and what a
trifler this is / let the reader judge. saving that if there were any
contrariety: it is not mine with my self / but Eusebius with the Apostle.

The Answ. would gird up his Archbishop in smaller room / that he might seem
les grown out off faschion. He says Diuis. 22. Page 373. etc.
therefore / the archbishop when a schism, or heresy rises, determines yt
according to the law established by the church. Wherein he speaks absurdly /
considering that the church can make no other rule / whereby he may proceed in
decision off schisms / and heresies: then in referring him to the rule off the
scripture. So the sum off this answer is / the Archbishop may not determine
the matter at his pleasure / but according to the word off God. As thowgh the
question were / by what rule controversies should be decided: and not by whom.
For when the controversy at Antioch was referred to the Apostles / etc. in
Jerusalem: it was not permitted unto them otherwise to judge off it / then
according to the word. Now therefore let it be observed how aptly the D.
answers. To abat^ the swelling authority off the Archbishop / I allege that
in deciding controversies / yt is not permitted to any one to determine what is
the will off God in that behalf. The D. says / the archbishop must determine
by the word off God. As thowgh if the matter had been committed to S. Paul
only / it should not have been with the same bond off keeping him to the word:
yet yt was not so committed / as I have alleged. And if he think more succor
for him in the words he used / the archbishop must determine according to the
rule of the church: it is certain also that the company of Apostles / and
Elders in Jerusalem / and what company soever meets together about the
ending of such matters / is subject unto all lawful and commendable orders off
the church / provided for the more orderly proceeding in that behalf. So that
there being nothing here alleged by the D. which agrees not unto the Apostles
/ and Angels themselves: the excessive authority off tharchbishop does still
appear / in that he alone ends controversies / which in the Apostolic
church was not committed but unto many.

For as for that in the next diuis. (he compoundeth not controversies by him
self alone) onles he mean that he has his servants the Chaunceler / and
Archdeacon / or some other off his own ch^^s^* the book set out by
tharchbishop of late / does declare the contrary: and the experience off his
visitacions / and deposing off ministers does openly convince him of untruth.
If he say he is not alone / he has them following him: he must understand /
that becawse either the archbishop carries their voices under his girdell / or
if they use the freedom which is meet / yet the approbacion depends upon the
archbishops beck: he can no more account them to be diverse / then a man and his
shadow following him. And where in his former book he says / the chief office
off an archbishop is to compound contentions, schisms, etc. here being put to
his shift / he changes Page 35^.
his speech / saying / it is his principal office to provide that contentions,
etc. be cut of. Where he adds / or else with the Princes consent he sets an
order in a provincial Synod: If there be any Synod / either to take the
judgment out off his hand / or control the sentence given by him / it is like
to be sore against his will. So that the remedy off this mischief / depends
only upon the Cyuill power: which if either yt be ennemy to religion / or
entangled with the present heresy (as has / and may herafter come to pass):
the church being withowt remedy must languish / and pyne away.

He says / this example of the matter carried to Jerusalem, proves that every
parish within yt self, has no absolute authority to end controversies, but it
behooves to resort unto the chief church: the contrary whereof appears. For in
that they both debated the cawse amongst them selves / and when they could
not agree / decreed to send yt to Jerusalem: yt is sufficiently declared that
they had authority to end it amongeste them / and that yt was not wrunge from
them by necessity off law / or pretense off higher authority: but voluntarily
sent up to Jerusalem. Althowgh for this place in hand yt is sufficient / that
the deciding off controversies hung not upon the mouth off one man / were he
never so sufficient: but were referred unto thassemblies of the Ancients / and
ministers of the word. As for his old shifts of the weakness of negative
arguments of authority, and of examples of the scripture, and thapostolike
church: their folly is opened before. Here he takes on against my unskillfulness
in the scriptures, which referred that unto ministers Diuis. 24. page 375.
which is spoken off all the church. Howbeit if he had co^ferred the text / he
should have found that thapostle speaks of the Prophe these / and not of the
whole church. For he bids that 1. Cor. 11. 29. 31.
two or three of the Prophets should speak, and the other (that is to say
Prophets) should give judgment. Which appears by the reason added / ver. 32.
the sprite off the Prophets is subject to the Prophets. Therefore the D.
corrupts the place / and the argument to prove that not one minster / but
many owght to determine of doutfull causes / is vntowched.

diuis 25. page 375.
Where I pressed him with this / that Ephesians. 4. 13.
unity is fully maintained by the ministeries which God has ordained* he
asks how often I will allege it. If it be a fault in me / to allege one place
often upon diverse occasions: what is it in him to allege one thing so
continually / upon the same occasion? If he would have opened his eyes / he
should have seen that I used an argument proper to this place / and not used
before. For where he pretends the archbishop was ordained to keep unity: I
show that withowt him / unity is perfectly kept: whereunto he answers nothing
but as before. But I will serve his taste / and give him change. For the Apostle
a little before exhorting to unity / brings also this reason: one body, one
spirit, one hope, one Lord, Ephesians. 4. 5.
one faith, one baptism, one God, etc. Whereby appears that the apostle took
these ones, to be sufficient to keep the people off God in unity. And if to
have an archbishop had been so necessary: the apostle should have fowly
forgotten him self / having so fit a place to speak of him. And as this is
aptly opposed / against the pretended peace by a Pope: so is yt likewise /
against that surmised to be browght by the archbishop.

Where I ask / what buckler we may have to hold ovvt Diuis 26. page 376.
against the Papists, which come upon us with the name of traditions off the
apostles, if we admit that there were archbishops ordained by them, vvherof
the scripture makes no mention: he answers there can be no danger in them,
so they be not made necessary to salvation, but such as receive alteracion.
Which althowgh it be clean contrary to that he said before / where he binds
In 2. Tra. according to him ca. 3. page 100.
us to observation of them / as I have showed: yet it shall be sufficient here
to let him understand / that he has utterly barred him self from this answer /
for that he page 35^.
says / this ministry of the Archbishop is necessary, yea most necessary.
Now if it be most necessary, for preseruacion of unity off the church: yt is
plain that it is necessary also for the salvation of yt. For the next diuis.
I have showed Diuis. 15.
how absurdly the D. defends this rouing: where let the reader judge what
difference there is / between our archbishop and Ieromes bishop / which
differed nothing from a commen minister / but that he had the ordeining off
ministers. And here I call once again upon him / to show any godly and learned
writer / which expounds this place of Jerome off an archbishop: to see if he
be any happier in this place / then he was before in Cyprians. The Bishop off
Salisb. Defens. Apol. 4. p. 14. c. 1. 2. d.
affirms / that the very meaning off Jerome is, off every bishop in his
dioces: and Harding in the end beaten down with the light off the place / is
compelled to Arti. 4. diu. 15.
confess it. The next I leave to the reader to judge / by that alleged on

The D. says / I refuse Jerome in a matter off story, yet I deny no part off
his story: wherein he seems to have lost all commensense. For who (in whom
there is any light off judgment) would say it is matter off story / whether
the appointing off one in every church over the rest, is remedy against
heresy or no? I^ pertains to the story that one was placed over the rest at
such time / and place as is set down by Jerome / likewise that the cawse that
moved them to bring in this coustome was for preseruacion off peace: and none
off these is denied. but whether this cawse were well assigned / and whether
this supposed to preserve peace / banished godly peace: is the question. If
this be a matter off story: story has a larger kingdom then ever I heard
off. Yet this he does as absurdly charge me with in 63 di. page 411.
after / in Iustines testimony: where likewise I deny no part off his story.
If this be to discredit men / to say / their authority ovvght not to weigh
further, then yt has weight either off scripture, or some reason grovvnded
theroff: then I have discredited all writers from the Apostels time. For by
these weightes / I have esteemed the best. But I leave to be considered / what a
popish tyra^nie he goes about to bring into the church: which lifts the
credit of any / be he never so godly and learned / above that which I have here
alleged

Where he says / I confound Monarchy with Tyranny, in that I ask whether the
church be not in as great danger, when all is done at the pleasure off one, as
when one pulls one piece and an other an other: yt is but a vain shifting
hole. For althowgh these words (at the Pleasure and lust off one) be for the
most part spoken by way off dispraise / and I willingly confess I used them /
becawse this Ecclesiastical monarchy / seldom or never deserves better: yet
my words following declare / that my comparison is between the Ecclesiastical
government off one / and off many not between one governing tyrannically / and
many moderatly. For supposing that both the Archbishop / and those which
govern in commen be godly / and catholic: I affirm that he being one / is
sooner drawn into error then many / sooner ouercaried with his affection then
a godly company. In answer whereof / and reasons wherewith this is confirmed /
the D. falls flatly into that / wherewith he charge me. For in steed that
he should have marched many godly / and learned ministers with one / he
matcheth him with the multitude / and comme^ sort: and in steed off comparing
one ruling by law / with many governing by the same / he compares him with a
lawles company: and in steed off comparing a little water with much of the
same kind / he compares a little conduite water closed up in lead, with much
fennish and muddy. Which what leaden answers they be / let the reader judge.
For in this path of reasoning which he walks in / a man may prove it better
to have but one eye / then two: becawse some see better with one / then other
some with both.

His answer to that off preferring contention before wicked peace, that we
have the true doctrine, and right administration of Sacraments, etc. and
therefore no contention is to be moved: is as much to the question as if he had
answered off the wether. For the question is not of the estate off our church /
but off all generally: nor whether we have the truth of doctrine / etc. but by
what way yt is best kept. His answer to the similitude of fire stricken by
flintes, is more fond. For I showing by yt / that conte^tion is better then
wicked peace: he answers / the fire stricken may be in such a time that it
may consume the whole country, and that it is madness to light a candell at
noone days. As if the fire off the truth which I spoke off / and so called
Luke 12. 49.
off our Savior / can consume any thing but straw / stuble / etc. or Philip.
1. 18.
the Apostle were not glad that the truth came forth / allthowgh by contention:
or it were noone day when the heavens thorowgh ignorance / and errors are like
an haircloth / which is the time I spoke of. And where having showed that
tharchbishop is not fittest to keep the church in possession off the truth / I
admit by way off disputation that he were the fittest: adding that for so much
as he has as great force to keep men in error when they are fallen into it,
this in commodity ovvght to drive us to some other government: he answers /
a monarchy being the worst kind of government when it rules by affection,
ceasseth not to be lawful when it rules by laws. Where first / I refer the
reader to that before / that it is one thing off the form off church
government / an other of the comme^t wealth: which is answer to all these
slanderous speeches here repeted.

Secondly / the church receives greater damage by an Archbishop keeping yt in
error: then the commen wealth by any outrage off tyranny. For there can be no
tyranny in the government off the common wealth so extreme / wherein there is
not something tending to preseruacion off it / and consequently off the church.
But in the government off an Archbishop fallen from the truth / and in the
swinge off his uncontrolled authority keeping the truth under: there is nothing
but destruction and ruin / withowt step or footing off the favor off God
toward the upholding off the church. Seeing therefore tyranny in the commen
wealth is not so great an ennemy unto the commen wealth / as a church tyrant
unto the truth: there is better cawse to have a Monarchy in the commen wealth
/ then in the church: as that which can not stray so far as the other / from
the end whereunto it was ordained. Moreover / the cawse why the Monarchy in
commen wealth can not be condemned / is / for that it is one off those
gouernementes / which God has established / and allowed by his word. But the
Archbishopric (to let pas that yt is contrary to the word off God) yt is
sufficient in this consideration / that yt has no allowance off the same. For
thereupon follows / that althowgh the abuse off those things which God has
approved / can not destroy the lawful use off them: yet this which has no
further alowance then of the mouth off me^ / may upon experience off evil
husbandry in the church matters / be worthily rejected. So yt may be seen /
that althowghe the Ans. would make one case off a Magistrate / and archbishop:
yet there is as far distance between them / as between heaven and earth. Yt
rests to show / that the archbishopricke has been so far from nourishing
the church peace / that yt has been the knife wherewith all the stringes / and
knottes theroff have been cut in peaces. Against which the Ans. alleges /
first the testymonies off Cyprian, and Jerome. Wherein beside that I have
showed / that they help him not: yt is before declared / that nether Cyprians
bishop did any thing at all / nor Ieromes (the ordination excepted) but by
common consent off all the elders. Not only because they were at making off
the church laws (under which wrinckel the D. would hide the excess off the
archbishops authority): but also for that they had felowlike authority / in the
deciding off controversies which rose in their several churches / according
unto the laws.

After / where I quoted certain places out off the decrees / and other Canons
/ to prove the contention for these offices: the Ans. acknowledges nothing
there / that carries any sound that ways. Albeit the sound was clear enowghe
/ if he had not been deaf of that ear. For to what end both in the Nycene
Council (where the Metropolitanes are first hard of / and when they were yet
in the cradell) and in many other holden more then 200. years after / are
there found so many canons / for the acknowledging off the authority off one
Metropolitan in every Province? For the honor which he should have / the
name he should be called by / for the place where they should sytte at their
meatinges / for the bounds of their circuit? do not all these declare / that
there were which were ennemies to that authority: and that those which were
lyfted up into yt / had continual war one with an other / who should be the
first / who the greatest / who of largeste spread? What means yt also that
they changed the seats so often? so that the second / or third at one Council
/ was fourth at an other / and none at the third: and contrariwise he that was
none before / was chief afterward? What also that the teritoiries appointed by
one Council / were abbridged by an other / enlarged again by a third? Is
there any man of so small conceit / which does not hereby understand / that
this lifting up of one above the rest / was a bone cast of the devil to
cause the ministers fall out one with an other: whereby place was made to
heresies of all sorts / to the utter undoing of the church / and quenching off
the gospel? And if the D. had been off so narrow understanding / that upon
so often / and so diverse decrees in this behalf / he could not conceive the
contentions / which this did breed: yet express words off histories / which
testify generally of the co^tentions for those preeminences / 1. Sozom. 1. ca.
7. li. 2. ca.
of Counsels (as it may appear by the canons off the Aphrican council which I
have alleged: of the Tauritan / which shows that the Fre^she bishops /
strove which church should have the Metropolita^ship / and how the bishop of
Arles / and Vien^a fell out for the same) were ready to have informed hi^ of the
trwth in this behalf. Yea in the discourse of the Council of Nice / whereon
Socr. 1. li. 8. c. Sozom. 1. li. 17. M. Fox. The book of the 70 Arch. (...).
Ephesians. 4. 3.
the chief credit off the Metrapolitane depends / he might have redd how
almost all the Bishops assembled there / had quarrels one with an other. Which
when they were not (as does appear) for diversity off judgment in religion:
yt is easy to understand / that they were for the causes above rehearsed. And
if he could be ignorante of all these: yet our stories at home / which specify
the combats / and going together by the ^ares for these causes / offered unto
him a plentiful proof off all these things. Whherby yt appears / that this
Metropolitaneship was the very apple off contention / in schambling for which /
the church was miserably haled in peaces. Therefore forasmuch as the Apostle
shows / that the trwth is kept by the bond of unity / and yt being most
manifest that these smokie titles off honor / were cawse off contention: yt
follows that so far they are from that pretended / off being bulwerckes
against heresies / and schisms: that they were the principal hooks that
pulled them in.

The Papists say that there may be a bishop of all the whole Diuis. 31.
church / because there may be of a province: I / that there can be page 380.
etc.
nether off one / nor other. They would establishe the Pope by the Archbishop:
and I overthrow the Archbishop by the Pope. This is great ioining with the
Papists. If I would take the advantage off your own words / first that pa.
368.
there is the same reason of one over a diocese, and over a Province, and a
gain that Page 373.
for so much as one was over 12. therefore one may be over a whole province: I
need not seek for further defense / as I have there declared. But against
this M. Calvin, and M. Nowell be browght: which say there is not the same
reason, off one over the whole church, and over a province. let yt be so. For
the one is a more prowder title / then the other: breaks in further into the
the prerogative of Christ / then the other. And if the church must needs be
accombred either with Pope / or Archbishop: let us grant so much to the
archbishop / that to avoid the Popes iron furnaies / we would be content to
grind in his myll: and to a void the scourge off the one / pass by the whip
off the other: yet heroff follows not / but that yt is true I have set down.
For althowghe they are not in all points a like / nor every reason which
concludes the one / concludes the other: yt hinders not but there are
certain reasons / which conclude both a like.

That this point off keeping peace in the church / is one off those which
requires as well a Pope over all the Archbishops / as an archbishop over all
the bishops in a realm: I will go no further then to the causes your self
have assigned. For where I show that unity may be kept without an
Archbishop / you assign two causes / for which in keeping unity yt is meet to
have an Archbishop: the one / to call the bishops together when there is
variance: page 364.
the other / to put them in mind of their duties. And if an Archbishop be
necessary for calling of a provincial council / when there is cause off
assembly / and when the bishops are divided: yt is necessary there be also a
Pope which may call the general Council / when there is division between the
Archbishops / an other cause of general Council. For when the churches of one
Province be divided from other / and the archbishops are at variance: as you
ask me / so I ask you / who shall assemble them together? who shall admonish
them off their duties, when they are assembled? If you can find a way how
this may be done withowt a Pope: the way is also found / whereby the church
is disbourdened off the Archbishop.

Of the autorities you allege / nether affirm that the government of an
Arbishop over a Province / is convenient: only they affirm that there is more
likelihoode in the one / then in the other / and that there were archbishops in
the church when there were no Popes. if one should conclude that becawse a man
may touch the moon with his hand / therefore he may touch the son^e: and yt
be said for answer / that althowghe yt be possible to touch the moon / yet it
follows not so of the son^e: who is there of so little judgment which would
gather of this answer / that one may touch the moon with his hand? And as
this proves that one may overthrow one impossible thing by an other / withowt
teaching either off them possible: so that I have alleged 467. page perteining
to this matter (off one which against him that would allegde Jacobs two
vviues, to prove he might have as many as he list, should answer that
althovvgh he might have two: yet yt follows not that he may have as many as
he list) proves that one may overthrow one unlawful thing by an other /
withowt teaching either off them lawful: which the D. calling yt a ieste,
answers not. And yet yt is manifest that these he his reasons / both here and
there: which may in deed worthily be iested at: albeit there is no word in
the example I browght / that carries the countenance off a ieste.

Unto that I browght of greater necessity off unity in the Diuis 32. page 381.
whole church / then in ane Province: there is nothing answered. here he says
I am greatly deceived, considering that the Pope claims his temporalities by
Constantine, and his supremacy by Peter. If he listed he might have
understood / that diverse Papists which handle that matter off supremacy /
allege Constantines donacion for his temporalities only. I said not that the
Pope makes his claim only by Constantine. Althowgh yt may be showed that
Sozimus (who you say claimed the supremacy over all the Tom. 1. Council. Aphri.
church) made his claim not by Peter / nor by any authority off scripture /
but by the Council off Nice / confirmed by the Emperor Constantine. Where he
says my supposition touching one Caesar over all the realms which have
churches, is but supposed: I marvel that he is ignorant / that Constantine in
the end off his reign / had the Empire whole in his hands: and that Eusebius
li. 10. cap. 9.
all the churches had rest under him: Iero. ad Alges. 11. quaest. Council.
Calcedo^ Act. 1.
that the Emperor off Rome is called lord off all the earth, Lord off all the
world. So that if he would have appointed one bishop over all provinces under
him: the bishop of his appointement should have had more then double the
jurisdiction / that the Pope ever had / when his kingdom was largeste: the
Pope him self making no further claim / then over the churches which bare the
name off Christ / as Pighius him self confesses. Whereupon follows that his
answer often alleged / to put a difference between the archbishop and Pope
(the one takes it to him self, the other has yt of the gift of the Prince)
is not worth a straw.

Where I show that the sufficientest mynister, finding enovvghe to do in one
only congregation: no man can be hable Diuis. 33. page 381.
to vvelde the government off all the churches in a Province: he answers /
that lack off will, or skill of some busy Pastors, to dispatch controversies
which them selves be autors off, lets not but that bishops, and archbish.
may be sufficient for their charges. I make my argument off all / and he
answers off some: I of the most fyt / and sufficient pastors / and he off
unfit. If he have any better answer / we will attend after yt: if not / then
the archbishop is here again taken by defaulte. And when either he must needs
let his Archbishop fall to the ground / or else deny that men off greatest
gifts have found enowgh to do in the government of one congregation: being
both unwilling to grant the one / and ashamed to deny the other: yt is
manifest he crept into this corner. When I show that as the patrons off the
Archb. may allege the supply off Archdeacons, Chauncelors, etc. in their
absence: so the popes advocates may pretend his deputacion off Cardinals,
etc. he answers / that the office off bishop, and Archbishop may be well
excuted so far as yt is convenient for the estate of the church: which is
that in question.

Where likewise otherwhere I alleged to this purpose / Diuis. 15. Page 466.
that his bishop, and Archbishop having their charge assigned by him the same
with a commen pastor, the government only excepted: are thereby bound to
pastoral preaching, and ministering off sacraments in all the parishes off
their jurisdiction, which is impossible: he staggereth to and fro / saying the
bishop has to procure his diocese, is much as in him lies: whereas he is
charged / for laying hand to more then he can gripe: He adds / according to
the laws of the church: he is afraied to say off God. that they preach where,
and when they see yt most convenient: by that rule never also / and no where:
if in their sight yt be convenient. That yt follows not because the
archbishop is bound to minister the word, and Sacraments, therefore he must
do yt in all the parishes of his province: which follows well. For the
bishop appointed by the holy ghost / is commanded to feed the whole flock
committed Act. 20. 28.
unto him / even with the same feading Saint Paul fedd the Ephesians: that
is / with preaching so plentifully / that all might understand the whole will
off God. Wheruppon follows / that his charge is not to feed where / and when
he sees good: but to feed / and that to sufficiency all the people off his
charge: as he that shall answer for the blood off all which perish / for want
of sufficient instruction by his mouth. And if there be (as he says) the same
deutie off the Archbishop toward his charge / as off the bishop toward his:
the same follows in him. for the charge off his Province being a like
committed unto him: by the same reason he is bound to preach in one part / he
is bound in all: if not in all / in none.

Now to return: where he says / preaching, ordeining mynisters, and
suppressing herysies is not committed unto the Archdeacon, Chauncelor, etc. but
such as by rules off the church are permitted them: first / yt is his
continual fault / that he should prove by the law off God / he proves by
the laws of our church / yea and by those which remained off the estate which
was in popery. I might much better allege the laws off the reformed
churches / which have abolished them. And if he will against the reasons
browghte / oppose authority / and binding me for my proofs within the compass
off the word off God / wander him self in the broad feilde off men's laws
in question: yt is time to shuite up the disputation / which is maintained by
such gross begginge. Secondly how will he prove / that he may set over his
charge unto an other: or that yt is more lawful / to committ other things
perteining unto his office / then those which he reserueth unto him self? Or
if he may commit yt / whether he may commit yt to tharchdeacon / so far under
degree of the mynisterie off the Archbishop / to whom those things belong: or
to Chauncelors / etc. which have no entrance into the ministry by any
ecclesiastical institution. all which are showed unlawful / in the book of
discipline lately set forth. And why may not the Pope co^mmunicate his charge
with his Cardinales / as well as the archbishop with his Suffraganes / etc? If
he can show no word why he may do it / but it be only upon constitution off
the church / that he casts the overplus off his bourde^ / upon the neck of
his Chancelour / etc: by the same reason the universal bishop / may discharge
him self upon his deputies.

Where he says / the universal bishop can not ordeine ministers, preach, and
suppress heresies so well thorowgh all the church, as an archbishop in a
Province: I have showed that albeit one be granted more impossible then the
other / yet this also is impossible: which is sufficient to prove that in hand.
And that is here confessed / when he is constreyned to lay one part off his
duty upon his Suffraganes shoulders / an other upon his archdeacons / etc. All
which if he be able to bear him self: why does he drive them unto others? Let
the church at least be discharged off these bourdens. If not: why has he taken
it upon him? If the Pope deserve condemnacion / for taking more upon him then
he is able to do: the Archbishop / and bishops which bear him company in
this point / ca^ not be separated from it. So this reason browght against the
Pope / stands fast against them. Moreover as the Pope can not dispatch his
matters in the whole church / so well as an Archbis. in a province: so can
nether an Archbis. in his Province / so well as a bishop in his dioces / nor he
in his dioces / so well as in a particular co^gregacio^ / do the duties of a
bishop. So that this answer no more shuts out the Pope / then the archbishop
/ or lordly bishop. But he says / the archbishop may have conference with his
archdeacons, and Chauncelours, which the Pope can not. He seems to have
forgotten the conference by letters / and intelligence which the Pope has had
from time to time / so particular / and precise off churches furtheste off him
/ as if he had been in the bosom In his book off the practice off Praelates.
off them: which point Master Tindall has well set forth. And would to God
there were the tenth part off the fruicte off the archbishops conference unto
the good off our church / which has been off the Popes to the overthrow
thereof. And if conference by mouth be necessary: Rome is not so far but as it
has been / so it may be had. For besides that stories aforde us diverse
examples / off churches which have sowght the appeasing off their controversies
/ from places further removed then Canterbury is from Rome: the marchandrise
off unity / owght to be so precious / that we should not doubt to sail for
yt unto the Indes / and Garamantes. so that if there be such a mystery in the
number of one / to keep unity: the distance of place owght not to hinder this
monarchy off the whole church: if for no other cause / yet for this / that
when the archbishops (of whom hangs forsoothe the churches pea^^) are fallen
out: there may be some to accord them. That as the mynisters have lord
bishops / and they tharchbishops: so the archbishops might have a Pope / in
reverence off whose authority / they might easelyer be conioined. And in deed
by so much more yt is necessary in this respect / there should be a Pope over
the archbishop / then either archbis. over bishops / or bishops over ministers:
as the re^te / and division in the^ being chief / is more hurtful then when it
falls amongeste those in lower places. For when schisms and heresies light
amongeste them / they spread so much further / as they with the arm / and
power off their authority / are hable to flinge them further then the other.
The differences between the Pope and the archbishop, serve but for stuffing.
for I excepted in my reply / the corruptions off doctrine: and you owght to
have understood / that superiority of one bishop over all in the catholic
church / chosen by consent / doothe not necessarily draw these accidents of
contempt of Princes, of making their decrees equal with the laws of god,
etc. You should therefore have made yowr comparison / between an universal
Bishop chosen / and not breaking in violently / meinteining the truth / and
not fighting against yt / etc.

Unto that I alleged / that things passing by voice in Diuis. 34. page 382.
the church of Alexandria, the distinction off bishop from the rest off the
elders in the church there, might come in vvithovvte Saint Marckes consent, he
says nothing. And in deed if he had obtained that which he would so feign /
that this alteration was made in S. Marckes time: yet he shall never obtain
this / that S. Mark had his hand in that change: onles he will say / the
Apostells / and Apostolical men were autors off all things done in their
time / in every singular congregation. Unto that I said / the words (from
Saint Marcke) may be taken rather exclusiuely, to shut ovvte S. Mark: he
answers / that none off judgment will grant that: where notwithstanding he
that has any judgment does easily understand / that the words have many
times that significacio^; and that they are so here: I am content it be tried
by the other reasons propounded. I alleged that S. Marck can not be author off
that distinction, because he making those things diverse, which the holy Ghost
made one, should make the story he vvrote suspected. He answers / yt is
certain these were no otherwise distinguished, then the holy ghost appointed
them: which I have showed how shameless yt is. Then / that my collection is
ungodly, to imagine so off the gospel written by the Euangeliste. As yff I did
not in plain words / deteste all suspicion of the vntrwthe off that Gospel:
and therefore cast away his false surmise / which might give occasion theroff.
He says / thereby appears at the least that yt was ancient. I deny not: but
yt is manifest also / that there were other corruptions in some places of the
church / as aunciente.

The Answ. (as his coustome is) takes his pleasure off me / Diuis. 35. Page
383.
because upon the words off Jerome (this coustome was at Alexandria) I gather
that yt was not in other places. As if yt were not manifest that Jerome notes
where yt began: and if it had beginning at Alexandria / yt was there when yt
was not in other churches. If it had had further passage at that time; Jerome
should have done yt injury in co^cealing yt. For it would have made much for
the credit off that distinction. Which I alleging in the next diuis. the Ans.
says nothing unto. Nether is there any so rude an idiote / which knowethe not
that a notable / or unwonted thing said off one man / place / or time / is
spoken emphatically / and excludes all other. But as the D. will not
understand a general proposition / unless yt have the sign (all, or every)
before yt: so he will not understand that any thing is appropriat unto
another / unless yt have these words only, alone, etc. And it is clear how
intolerable the D. is in his insultations / seeing Jerome in saying that this
coustome gat ground by little, Ierom. upon Tite.
and little, declares the trwth of my collection. And where he answers to
that I objected off the confounding oftentimes off priest / and bishop / that
the bishop is a priest, but not contrariwise: he first answers not to the
argument. For this is not to be confounded / when off two things one is
verified of the other / but the other can not return / and be verified of his
fellow. Secondly / his answer is overthrown by his exposition of the place of
Cyprian / which by one priest in the church, understands one only bishop in
a church. for thereby it follows / that either there was but only one priest in
the church of Carthage: or else these words bishop and priest, were all one: so
that whosoever was one / was the other. The next division has not a word to
purpose. for autorities are quoted / to prove that the Apostels appointed
Bishops in diverse churches / which no man denies: yea I have namely alleged
yt before

Where I show that forsomuche as the Archdeacon is reproved Diuis. 37. page 384.
of Jerome / for preferring him sefe before an elder / because the scripture
makes him inferior unto the elder: by the same reason / a bishop is to be
reproved / for that he prefers himself before an elder / which the scripture
makes his equal: he answers / he sees no sequel, nor likelihoode.
notwithstanding I trust there is none that has but his commen sense / which
does not easily understand / that yt is no more lawful for those which are
ordained equals by the scripture / to lift them selves one above an other:
then yt is lawful for him that is appointed to be under / to exalte him self
above his superior. for althowghe he be in greater fault / which being under
exalts him self above / then he which magnifieth him self above his equal:
yet as the ordinance off God cawseth. the one to be unlawful / so yt doothe
the other. The second answer is / there may be degrees amongeste the
ministers, notwithstanding all this, for that Jerome says there was a degree.
This is a very blunt answer. I allege both authority off the scripture / and
Ieromes own reason against the distinction off one bishop from the rest: and
he answers that the distinction is good / for Jerome so says. Thirdly /
althowgh Jerome confess that a bishop and an elder be all one by the
scripture: yet he confesses superiority off a bishop before an other elder.
but he says they are all one by the scripture: and that the bishop is superior
by coustome. And here he stitchethe in a parenthesis. For after he had alleged
Jerome / confessing that a bishop and an elder are all one by scripture: he
adds (as they be in deed towching the ministry). Thereby desirous (as yt
seems) to abuse his simple reader / in making him believe that Jerome mente /
that there was by the scripture difference in policy / between a bishop / and
an other mynister: which overthrows the whole intent of Jerome. For he
shows that this difference (which the D. in other places terms / for order,
and Policy) between a bishop and an other minister / was not by the scripture
/ but by coustome: and began at Alexandria. And seeing Jerome puts a
difference / between the bishop specified in S. Paul / and the bishop in his
time: if the Answ. say that S. Paul's bishop differed from an other minister /
as towching order / and policy: I would gladly know of him / how Ieromes
bishop and he which is now / differs from an other minister. If he answer (as
he has done before) that they differ not as towching the ministry, but as
towching order and policy: the^ he puts no difference between S. Paul's
bishop and Ieromes / which is overthrow of all that Jerome says / and he has
flatly affirmed: where he makes Ieromes page 304.
bishop instituted by the church / after the Apostels times.

After he blusheth not to say / that Jerome makethe a difference between S.
Paul's bishop / and another minister. For althowghe he broilethe / and mingleth
all upon a heap / thincking throwgh confusion off all / to cawse his treachery
not to be seen: yet in di. 39. page 987.
after he does plainly utter yt / in answering Chrysostomes words / the same
with Ieromes. But before I come to his reasons whereby he would prove this: I
will set down the words off Jerome / whereby his unhonest dealing may be
better perceived. Iero. ad Euagr.
First he says / a ministre that is to say a bishop: and a little after / the
Apostle does plainly teach; that a bishop and a minister are all one. And in
an Upon Tite.
other place / a Bishop and a minister are the same: again / Ad Oceanum.
althovvghe with the ancient fathers, bishops and elders were all one. Here
appears manifestly / that Jerome says / a bishop and an other minister be
all one with the Apostell / and with the ancient times: that he expoundethe
one by the other / that he turns one off them upon an other. for as he says
that bishops be ministers: so he affirms that mynisters be bishops.

Now of the two reasons / to prove that Jerome put a difference between a
bishop / and an elder / this is the first: the one is a name of age, and the
other of dignity. which is as much to say / as they differ in deed / because
they differ in name: and that the auncientes / and elders off the people off
Israel / were not their governors / because the name aff auncientes is a name
off age / and the other of honor: or as if the eldest brother were not the heir
/ because the one is a name of age / the other of honor. Whereas Ieromes purpose
is plainly to show / that althowgh the names be diverse: yet the things are all
one. And if there be any dignity shut up in this name bishop / the ministers
are partakers of it: considering that he affirms that they be bishops. And if
there be any inferioritie noted / by the name off elder: the bishop has his
part in yt / for so much as he is an elder. Althowghe the trwthe is / that by
the word (dignity) Jerome mente nothing but an office: and called the name
off bishop / the name off a dignity / becawse (...).
the office drawethe dignity with yt. And because of reverence which the
younger give to thelder / as also for that ministers and bishops / were often
taken from them which were well grown in age: they were called elders. So
that althowgh the name (elder) be the name off age: yet yt draws as much
honor after yt / as the name off bishop.

His other reason is: Jerome says an elder is contained in a bishop: which he
brings as a proof to show / that Deacons are therefore under elders / because
elders and bishops be all one with S. Paul. So that he has not only depraved
Ieromes mind: but drawn his words to a clean contrary sense / of that he
meant. for even / by the same words whereby Jerome would prove they be all one
he would prove them diverse. And althowghe Ieromes manner of speech here be
somewhat hard for that purpose / considering that things which are all one /
can not properly be said to contain one another: yet both by his plain
words in other places / and manifest suite off his disputation / he made his
meaning so well known / that no man (onles willing) could stumble at his
phrase. And if the D. will thus hunt at syllables: yet this speech off Ieromes
is so far from helpinge him / that yt does utterly overthrow all his houlde
he snatcheth at. For where he upon these words in a bishop is contained an
elder, would conclude In Episc. Presbyter continetur.
that every bishop is a minister, but not every minister a bishop: all men see
that in taking Jerome by the lips withowte considering his meaning / the
contrary off that the D. gathers / does follow: that every minister is a
bishop / but not every bishop a minister. For that which is contained under an
other / is more particular / and les then that which does contain: as
because the king is contained in the magistrate / therefore every King is a
magistrate / but not every magistrate a King.

And albeit yt be no marvel / althowghe he which strives with the trwth /
should be stricken with such a guiddines off spirit / that he should not be
hable to discern / not only between the morning / and noone days / but not
between noone days and midnight: yet because the smattering in logic which
this book makes show of / might be so much as not to be so grossly abvsed:
in casting with my self wherefore he should allege this / in the end yt came
to my mind / that by these words (the elder is contained in the bishop) he
would have understood / that the elder is contained under the bishops
government. If he mean so / there is as great oversight in his grammar / as
before in logic: ogicke: considering that the tongue (as I suppose will bare
no such sense / certain is that the author will not suffer yt. For he assigns
as reason why thapostle did not speak of the elder / for that an elder is
contained in the bishop: and therefore speaking of the one / he needed not to
speak of the other. Whereas if he should mean / that he would not speak of an
elder / because he was in the government off the bishop / to order as he
thowght good yt had been a witles saying / unworthy of Jerome (considering that
thapostle speaks of a deacon which is under a bishop). Which shall be answer
to his like dealing with Chrysostom. That Jerome speaks of an archdeacon in
that place / I have before declared.

But the D. asks / why I went about to deface Jerome, if he Diuis 38. page
385.
nether make for our either bishop, or archbishop? for that there could be no
other cause but this. I have showed that I saved him his due / and convenient
honor: the cause why I gave the reader warning / to try him by the rule off
the word off God / was because he seems in some places to allow that
distinction off bishop from an elder / which is diverse from the institution off
the Apostell. After he sets down his places often before repeted / and
asks whether I think those me^te of every pastor in his parish. I have
showed how althowghe upon occasions before recited / there were not in every
congregation at that time a bishop: yet there were in diverse. he says further
/ that the pastor in every congregation from the beginning, had his authority
over his flock withowte any such constitution. I grant he had his
antoritie / but not so sovereign / as after he obtained by this evil custom:
considering that he had an equal part of government / with those joined with
him in the administracion off the church. And this althowghe yt be debated
between us: yet the D. frames his answer as thowghe there were no such
thing. For albeit for the most part there were no more pastors the^ one in a
parish: yet there were more elders. And albeit Ier. speak of those elders
which had the ministry of the word: yet ^^at excludes not those / which were
only for government.

Where he says moreover / the care of the whole flock was committed unto him I
see not how he can conclude thereof / that the bishop was over a whole diocese
such as ours. yt might rather be concluded / that he had charge off one only
congregation: considering that althowghe him self alone were thowght hable to
care for one congregation: yet there is none which would thinck him self alone
/ able to care for a whole dioces. And beside that the churches should be in
miserable case / if none should care for the^ but every bishop in his dioces:
let the D. stretch out the bishops jurisdiction as far as he can / yet I have
showed out off the Emperors letters to the bishop of Alexandria / that the
elders off the same church where he abode / had aioynt care with him over all.
Which is also confirmed by the testimony the Ans. has alleged out off M.
Fox: where not the bishop only / but his church page 331.
also / is said to have the oversight off the precinctes which perteined unto
him. And Jerome him self / showing that the elders upon Tit. 1. cap.
ovvght to govern in commen with the bishop, can not be thowght to give unto
the bishop the whole care of the church / as peculiar unto him alone: onles a
man will make him contrary to him self. For if they have the government in
common with him: they have the care in common / for so much as there can be no
government withowt care. So that where Jerome says / the care off the whole
church was committed unto one: yt must be understood so / as yt may be
level with his other saying: especially when he says / that a bishop differed
from his elder, only in ordinacio^.

Which may appear by the practice off the churches / about the time wherein
Jerome wrote. Council. Carth. 4. ca. 23.
For it was ordained that the bishop should not judge off any matter, but in
presence off his clergy: if otherwise, his sentence should be void. Whereby
appears / that an other 3. Conc. carth. c. 8
canon permitting the judgment off subdeacons, and other inferior orders unto
the bishop alone, must be understood / alone withowt other bishops / not
withowt other assistance. Which is also clear / considering that the Council
opposes the decision off their cawses / unto that off elders and deacons:
which was to be done by six and three bishops / beside the bishop off whom they
were accused. This government in comme^ appears also / in that Council.
carth. 3. ca. 25.
when one off the clerckes would go either to the widow, or virgins, he
must have as well the leave off the elder, as off the bishop. Likewise / that
it Council. carth. 4. ca. 37.
was ordained / that the deacon should acknovvledge him self, as well the
minister unto the elder, as to the bishop. Here it is also to be observed /
what that ordinacion was / wherein only / the bishop differed from the elder:
how poor a thing. For beside that it can not be understood off the election
/ which was commen to him with the people / and the eldership: yt was Council.
carth. 4. ca. 2. 3.
decreed that when there was a bishop to be ordained, two bishops should
hold the book over his head, one other bishop should pronounce the blessing,
and the rest of the bishops with thelders present, should all lay on their
hands. So that either there was an other order at Rome / the^ is here
appointed; or else the bishops preeminence was only to pronounce the blessing /
and hold the book / the elder having as good right to lay on his hands / as
he. Where he says / his place against the Luciferanes, with an other out off
his epistle, is more clear: he brings no reason at all / nether are there
any words to enforce that. Onles by church one understand dioces, or Province
such as ours / which I have showed to be far from the use of those times: or
onles we grant that there can be no schisms / nor heresies in a particular
congregation / whereof there is to good experience: or that yt is impossible
there should be many elders in one church / which I have declared / and shall
(God willing) declare further to be untrue: I say onles these prove an
archbishop / or a lord bishop: there is nothing in those words off Jerome.
And yet the D. that he may help his weak reasons with strong words / must
upon these conclude yt impossible, to expound Ieromes words otherwise, then
off bishop, or archbishop such as ours.

Where he concludes upon that the elders chose one amongeste them whom they
made bishop, as the captain is chosen of the the soldiars, that therefore the
bishop was over diverse congregations: there is no likelihood off reason. And
where to give yt some / he threapeth two things at my hand / the one that
this word elder, signifies only a minister off the word, the other that every
minister of the word had his several flock: he doothe but dalie. For he
knows well that I hold that the word elder / reaches to such as govern
only: and that there were in diverse congregations more then one / which
preached the word of God. Where he says / those which I call obscure villages,
were little cities, such as with us, Ely, or Peterborowgh: I leave it to the
reader to judge / how much I have therein squared from Erasmus Frigida oppidula
/ who calls them peevish little Towns. Where he says / he callethe them
base cities: I am content the reader take which he likes best. For both in
proper speech can not be true: for to call a town / and a little town / and a
peuishe little town / a city: is not for any thing I know / wonted. Howbeit I
will not here strive: yt is sufficient that I have showed / that there were
bishops in other places which were no cities. And even in this the D. lets
fall the Popes decree / which he defends in an other place: which forbids
as well to place bishops in base / and small cities, as in vplandishe towns.

And albeit the D. be not hable by these words of Jerome / nor by any other
which he has browght / to prove that the bishop had any further reach / then
unto one only church: yet (forsomuche as yt is not here question off the
victory / but off trwth: nor what the Ans. is hable to prove / but what may
be proved) I will not deny but in Ieromes times / the bishops upon occasions
before off me alleged / had enlarged their bounds in such sort / that there
were certain congregacions which belonged to their oversight / and whereof they
were called bishops. But I appele first to the institution off God / and use of
the purer times after the Apostles: and then I answer / that a dioces was not
the twentieth part of that which they have now. As appears by that alleged
before out of the Councels / and by that Jerome says / that their elders under
them governed in commen with them: which they could not have done onles they
being hard by / had made one body with them. For nether could the bishop do
any thing in his congregation / withowt the elders: nor they in theirs /
withowt him / but they made one Senate amongst them. The practice whereof is
yet to be seen in certain reformed churches* where the elders off certain small
parishes round about / make one body off Senate with the elders off the
principal town / meeting together once at the least every week. Saving that
they have altogether abolished that evil coustome / which wrong the name of
bishop from all the rest unto one / and granted the ordinacion to him alone:
there being one amongst them which has only this above the rest / when they
assemble together to propound matters / gather the voices / giuethe
exhortations / and that also for a time / and not during his ministry. I have
showed that the argument / wherewith the Ans. would off a bishop conclude an
archbishop / and off one over a dioces one over a whole Province is too bad:
and it is not here to be repeted. This place requires to show / that albeit
the Metropolitan was now received in the East parts: yet either he was not in
the most parts off the weast / where Ierom was: or Jerome did not acknowledge
him. Wherein I will first propound my arguments / and after answer to his
objections.

And first even with the self same places he would prove tharchbishop / is he
ouerturned: as of that against the Lucifer. For if it be certain (which I have
showed) that Jerome speaks off the authority that every bishop has in his
precinct / and plain by Ieromes words / that the authority he speaks off
there / is such as not only has no superior / but no mate: yt must follow /
that above the bishop which Jerome propounds / there can be no archbishop.
Again where he affirms that the bishop, ad Euag.
elder and deacon under the gospel are in the same place, that Aron his
sons, and the Levites were under the law: yt may be concluded that forasmuch
as every bishop in his charge / has the same authority Aaron had / and yt is
certain that there was no ecclesiastical authority over Aaron: therefore by
Jerome there owght to be none above the bishop in every church. Moreover ibid.
upon that he says / that all bishops succeed unto the Apostels / yt may be
reasoned / for so much as the bishops have the places off the Apostels in their
several churches / and it certain that the Apostels had no dominion one over
an other / but equal authority* as both has been / and shall be (God willing
further showed): that bishops owght not to have any bishop to whom they owght
to be subject. Ierom ad Rusticu^ monachum.


Beside this / speaking off the orders in the church in his times / he
reckenethe up deacons, archdeacons, elders, archelders, and bishops. If there
had been any Archbishops where he^ was / or he had allowed of any: there could
never have been so fit a place to have spoken off him / considering that his
purpose was / to show those degrees which were. Seeing therefore he makes no
mention off him: yt is apparent that there was none / or that he allowed off
none. Moreover he puts this difference between Tom. 2. ad Marcell. aduersus
Montanistas.
the Montanistes / and the Catholics: that Catholics had their bishops as the
successors off thapostels, gyuing unto them the first place: but the
montaniste heretics had in the first and chiefest place Patriarchs, in the
second certain which they called Cenones, so that the Bishop with them /
occupied but the third. Now if the bishop was the higheste degree in the
catholic church / and if to have a Patriarche (which the D. says is all one
with a Metropolitan, and Archbishop) over the bishop / was in Ieromes
judgment worthy off this reproach: I leave yt to the readers judgment / what
was Ieromes opinion off the office off an Archbishop: and whether the same blot
which he marked in the rowte off Montanistes / be not in our church / where
there is above the bishop both a Patriarche off England / and a Patriarche
off all England. But because the D. will not suffer him self to be bound
with any cords but off authority: I will annexe his authority / off whom he
would seem to have borrowed the greatest pillor off the Archbishop. Musculus
therefore after he had alleged the sentence off Jerome to Euagr. off equality
off the Bishop off Rome / and Eugubium / etc. concludes thus: Jerome Muscul.
de potestate ministror.
when he vvrote that, did not think off the power off the patriarchs,
metropolitanes, and primacie off the bishop off Rome: but esteemed that unto
every bishop, did belong the same care, and power in his ovne church.

Now to the Ans. shifts. The first is owte off Jerome to Rusticus / that
every ecclesiastical order is subject unto her governors: wheroff I would
gladly know what he concludes. If an Archbishop: there is no appearance. And
the Ans. being so bountiful in translating / has here cut off the sentence
in the m^ddle: for what purpose / let other judge. my answer is therefore /
that he must prove by Jerome that there was an archbishop / or that Jerome
allowed off one: before the sentence off Jerome can profit the Archbishop. His
second is / that the testimony off Jerome touching the equality off the
bishops, does not hurt the authority off the Archbishop: considering that it
is not denied but that every bishop, and minister are equal as towching the
ministry, but not in order, and policy. which distinction althowghe I have
confuted / and showed In 8. Tra. c. 1. di. 21.
also immediately before / that it is clean against the mind off Jerome: yet
here yt is to be observed / that as his argument owte off the place against
the Luciferanes for the Archbishop / is borrowed of the Papists: so this shifte
is Hardinges / whereby he would avoid the force off the bishops answer. Harding
says that tovvching honor, dignity, and power off bishoply order and office,
and off pristhood, as good, and as great a bishop in Apol. 2: part. ca. 3.
diuis. 5.
that respect is the one, as the other: and the bishops off these little
towns, have as great a merit in regard off any their virtues, and as great
power concerning the order off priesthood as the bishop off Rome, etc. Yet
tovvching power and authority off regiment, the Patriarchs off
Constantinople, etc. be above the bishops off other dioceses. The bishop to
this shifte answers with Erasmus / who says that Jerome seems to match
all bishops together, as if they were all equally the Apostells In his scholia
upon that epistle.
successors. And further alleges an other place of Erasmus: where owte off
that place off Jerome he affirms plainly / that the bishop off Rome is above
other bishops, only by riches. If by riches only: then not by government /
as Harding and the Ans. affirm. And where Harding under this word merit /
would hide him self as does the Ans. the bishop answers / by merit is mente
vvithovvt all question preeminence: which he D. alleges / is used off Harding
against the bishop: so yt is Latomus (an other Papists) shifte against
Bucer. unto whom Bucer answers: the Bishops were in every respect at the
first, equal one with an other: as is before alleged.

And where otherwhere he pretends alowance of this Popish Diuis. 42. page 390.
distinction / by the godly writers: the trwth is nothing so. For as touching
Calvin / he has openly depraved him. He only shows upon 2. Cor. 10. verse.
8. that there are diverse degrees off ministers / and that one is above an other
/ as an Apostel above a pastor / which is confessed: but that one pastor is
above an other / which is the question / he has not a word. That out of Heza
/ is only a recital what was done / not what he allowed: considering that (as
has been showed) he utterly condemns those offices off Lord bishop /
Archbish / etc. beside that in showing that they came in process off time after
the Apostles: he hangs the D. cawse on the hedge which would have this
distinction in the time of the Apostles. Nether has Hemingius this distinction
/ where the D. supposes / he only says that they are equal as towching page
420.
spiritual regiment. What they be in external / he refers to another place:
which when the D. brings / he shall have answer. And whenever yt comes I
think yt will overthrow his before: that there are some ministeries of the
word and Sacraments only, some for government also. for althowgh he allow a
government unto him he calls bishop / larger then to an other minister: yet
(I think) he can not show that he shuts out the other owte off the external
government. Ad also / that I have showed / that even when these smokey offices
came first in / nether the Doctor / nor pastor were severed from government
off their several congregation. For that wherein the metropolitan then exceded
the pastor / was a pre-eminence or honor withowt authority: so that even then
/ yt was an evil distinction / off certain ministers off the word and
sacraments only, and certain which did govern.

His third answer is out off the B. off Salisbury: which affirms that there
were archbishops in Ieromes time. But it is to observed / that that assertion
off the bishop / proceeded off mistaking Jerome / and some oversight. Which is
clear by that in 4. Artic 15. diuis
an other place / the bishop auowcheth out off Jerome ^o Nepotian /
archbishops: where there is no mention off Archbishop in any sort. And
althowghe the place which the bishop vouchethe / be in the Epistle unto
Rusticus: yet there is no mention off an Archbishop / as I have before
declared. This assertion therefore can not help the D. which has no better
ground. His last proof is Erasmus / who says that metropolitans have some
upon Ier. to Euag.
dignity above other bishops: an other of Hardinges bucklers against the
bishop in the same place. Where yt is manifest / that Erasmus kept his oulde
coustome / off carrying fire in the one hand / and water to quench yt in the
other: and tempered the truth with some leuaine off the corruption off those
times / thereby to procure saftie unto him / and to his books: whilst those
which could not abide to look upon the truth barefaced / might at the least
bear yt being muffled If the Ans. will make his owtecries / that I discredit
the author when I can not answer them: beside that I discredit not more then he
/ I refer me unto the conscience off all men / whether yt be true which I
have said. And yet do I not say the tenthe part / off that which I could
allege written off him / by men off excellent learning / and zeal.

But let yt be considered / how both corruptly contrary to the mind off
Jerome / and inconstantly contrary to that him self has written off this
place / he has blinded these together. For if it be trw that he has said /
that Ieromes meaning is / that the bishop off Rome differs from other bishops
only in riches: then it is manifest that in authority / he differs not
from the bishop off Eugubium / a small town in the same province. And where he
says / that Jerome in making the bishop off a base city equal with the
rest, refers that to the deacons which in some places were preferred
before the elders: who sees not but that speaking against the truth / he was
so amazed / that words coming from him / reason stickethe yet in his pen.
For what reason is there / that Jerome should therefore say the bishop off
Eugubium was equal unto the Bishop off Rome, notvvithstanding the bishop off
Rome were his superior, because the deacon was preferred in Rome before the
elder? What give is here to join these together? or what cawse was there that
Jerome should speak basely off the metropolitanes authority over the bishop /
because the deacon was preferred before the elder? is there any reason that
because the deacon did injury unto the elder: therefore Jerome should speak
sparingly of the metropolitan / and do him injury also? moreover if this was
the occasion why he spoke so off a bishop / because certain deacons were
preferred before the elders: considering that that coustome was only at Rome
(as Jerome him self declares) why should he make the bishop off Tanais / a
small town in Egypt / equal with the bishop off Alexandria / the
metropolitan city there? and the bishop Rhegium / equal with the bishop off
Constantinople? For seeing that mischief off the preferment off Deacons before
the elders / was not in other places then in Rome there was no cause why he
should speak thus off the^ / if that had been the cause which Erasmus
alleges?

Where he adds / when Jerome says the bishops and elders were equal, that
is to be understood, that the elder was equal with the bishop in that they
were both preferred unto the deacon: I marvel the Ans. is not ashamed to
allege that saying / without all color off truth. For I have alleged diverse
other places owte off Jerome where he speaking absolutely / without respect
off any deacon / affirms the bishop and elder all one in the beginning. And
what a ridiculous disputacion does he make Jerome to hold? For it is all one /
as if a man after long discourse to prove Londe^ and York equal: in the end
should conclude / that York were equal with London / because they be both
greater then Nuington. Now let the reader judge / what unworthy outcries the
D. uses / both before and after / page 390.
off guilful dealing, and shifting the place of Jerome, thereby to drown the
voice of the trwthe: and whether I have interpreted it according to his
natural meaning / and as other godly / and learned have done: and whether he
contrarily / to maintain his first saying / has used shifts partly popish
/ ouerthrowinge the answers off those which have travailed against popery /
as well as mine: partly fond / and childishe / which he would bear out with
page 390. Diuis. 39. etc. p. 387. etc In tract. 3. ^ 4.
Erasmus authority / withowt any weight off reason. Likewise how he after
dallieth in his long translation / and repetition of Jerome / to no purpose.
That a doctor differs from a pastor / has been showed, that he is inferior
unto him appears / not only because the Apostle places him after / where he
does most exactly set down the order off preaching ministers: but also that
Ephesians. 4. 11.
the gifts required for that office / are (as has been showed) less.
whereunto may be added the practice off the elder churches / which esteemed the
doctor always under him whom they called bishop or Pastor. That the elder
which governs only is inferior to the Doctor: appears both in that his
gifts be fewer / and that Timot* 5. 17.
the Apostel gives more honor to him / then to the elder. That Deacons are
under those elders: for that their charge is to Act. 6. 2.
serve the tables only / and therefore but a part off the church / where the
elders government is over the whole. Likewise for that the deacons charge /
being in things perteining to the nourishement off the body: must give place
to that off the elders / whose Heb. 13. 17.
watch is over the sowles. Al which (the ministry off the Doctor only
excepted / which is shut up commonly in the bishop) is confirmed by continual
practice off the church: which upon all occasions off speaking off this
ministry / places the bishop before the elder / and the elder before the
deacon. and precisely the foresaid ad Philadelph.
Ignarius / shows that the deacon is under the elder / thelder under the
bishop: where that thelder which only governs and not only he which
teaches is understood (at which hole the D. would creep out) shall be after
in proper place declared. So appears that order in the ministry / and
diversity off degrees are defined off by the word of God: and that even in the
Ecclesiastical ministry / there is inequality althowgh all pastors be equal
amongeste them selves: and withal that order stands withowt the archbishop /
or any other devised ministry.

Chrysostom. browght by me / is shamfully corrupted / and the corruption opened
in the former diuis. his allegations (there owght to be rulers in the church,
and order to punish faults) so erksomly repeted / are Idle: yt being
confessed / and withal showed / that there is none off those but are done
withowt his either bishop / or Archbishop. where having no reason he falls to
exhortacion / that I would not stand in my conceit, but think the
government off his bishop better then that laid forth by us: if he can
compound with the word of God / with the reformed churches Apostolical / and
present / with the purest writers old and new: I with my conceits (as he
speeaketh) will be ready to hold tharchbishops stirup. That he affirms the
form off government wherein one is above all, necessary in our commen wealth:
althowgh I have showed that I greatly allow of it / yet that yt is necessary /
and that the Prince / and Parliament can Diuis. 5. Page 181.
not upon occasion alter yt / especially without breach off the law off God /
which only makes the necessity we speak of / is an vntrwth / apparent to
all that have ever tasted off holy / or humane letters. And althowghe yt seems
he has couenanted with him self / to speak all he supposes may please: yet
his knowledge answering not his w^ll / he is found here to abridge the
authority off the civil power / which he thowght to have stretched out / and
to bind it to that which the lord left at the liberty theroff.

Where he says / the external government off the church under a Christian
magistrate, must be according to the kind and form of government used in the
common wealth: it partly has / and further (God willing) shall appear / that
the government of the church debated is certain by the word off God / and
unchangeable. As for his bolt so soon shot / and with so small drafte of
reason: yt is broken with the vvinde off his own mouth. For where he makes
the external government throwghe owte his whole book / at the pleasure of
the Prince / which is his principal hold: here he teaches that yt is not in
the princes power onles she will either put of / or divide her crown with
others / to put down the archbishop. for the external government off the
church (says he) must be according to the kind, and form off government
off the common wealth. Whereby also follows / that where the popular estate / or
the rule of the best bears swaie; they can not althowghe they would / have
an archbishop. yea herupon follows / that either the Canterbury / or York
archbishop must leese his head. For yt is concluded off his high divinity /
that as there is but one prince in the whole Realm: so there must be but one
Archbishop. His reason (the Prince can not else be supreme governor off all
estates, and causes ecclesiastical:) to say no more / is senseles / and has
no knot with that whereunto yt belongs. As if when Room had both Emperors /
and consules / the Emperor could not be chief governor off the consuls /
because the Consuls were equal amongst themselves. I confessed yt
inconvenient, that there should be one Caesar over the world / but that yt may
be: he alleges Calvin that yt is most absurd: to what purpose? what
contrariety is here? yt is enowghe for me that there may be / and that
lawfully / a Prince of larger extent of dominion / then the archbishop of his

The D. accuses me off falsehood, for that I charge bim with citing Augustine,

used that large quotacion, only once in Muscul. Cyril. and M. Fox: he could
hardly do yt oftener in the two last / considering that as I remember / he
alleges them once only. but towching Muscul. beside the place I charge him
with / he left his adversary twice to his wide worckes. Where he remembers

Call. he sends to his Institutes / vvithowt any further restreinte as
appears page 132. again page 74. in his former book: for he has quoted yt
in this later. Likewise that Damasus calls Stephen Archdeacon / withowt any
direction page 344. Also alleges Gratian / Polidore / Volateran / vvithowte

to the large feilde off godly interpreters: that diverse times he gives the
book only / where he might give the chap. the chap. only where he might

appear what a hard mouth he has / and how I speak sparingly off this kind
off allegation off his.

Charged here by his fond allegacion off Call. Institut. he answers / I knew
there were sundry editions. I did so: but whether yt be absurd that he should
leave both the best / and most usual to take that which is worse / and in the
hands of few (onles he mente to play under the boorde / that men should not

labored it, and was acqainted with yt) is very simple. For is yt meet that
because he had made his book a little heuier with yncke / he should be wedded
so to yt / as to neglecte the commen commodity? how he is acquainted with yt I
know not: but I trust yt has / and shall appear / that there is no more

nothing but railing words / with repetition off repetitions / and that beside
the matter: considering that the cautions I put off the moderator in the

Archbishops / but as those which owghte to be. In asking scripture for proof,
he dalieth: seeking for that he would not find / as the scholar the rod he must

be overcome hides him self. Wherein he shows a great deal more modesty
then the D. which althowgh he have never a spur of argument either to defend him
self / or to offend his adversary: yet croweth as high / as if the maistrie
were in his hand. But let yt go / let us see his fight. To that I alledgrd
of Peter / chosen by the other Apostels to moderate the two first actions /
Act. 1. 15. Act. 2. 14.
notwithstanding yt be not set down: he answers / yt is wicked to ground
thalteration of the archbishop, and our bishops gouernemente, continued long,
and practiced in the best times of the church, withowt, yea contrary to the
ground off scripture. The long continuance / onles they have salt off the
word off God to preserve them / argues they be rotten / and such as cast an
evil savor. That they were not in the best times off the church / has
before appeared: whether yt have ground owte off the word / that Peter was
chosen by the Apostels / althowgh yt be not expressed: yt may partly appear by
that disputation upon 20 Math. for if all the Apostels were left of our
Savior Christ in equal autoriti^* either Peter took that upon him withowt
calling / or else he received yt off the Apostels. But the first is confessed
vntrw: therefore yt has ground off the word off God / that Saint Peter was
chosen off the Apostels unto the presidentship in those actions. And as yt has
been showed owte off S. Matthew 20. that none off them was higher then other: so
off S. Peter yt appears particularly / in that he / and S. John were sent by
the college of the Apostels: Act. 8. 14
whereas if he had been made chief by our Savior / and that from the ascension
unto his dying day: yt had not been lawful for the Apostels by making him
their Ambassador / to have made him inferior to the res^d^w. I know what the
Papists answer in this poincte: but the D. bancke being discovered / I think
he will change his creditors.

Where he says / yt is contrary to scripture because S. Peter 2. Act. so
soudenly defended the Apostels against the accusation off dronkennes, as he
could not tarry for their voices: it is ridiculous. For I would know first /
what testimony of scripture he has / to prove yt done so soudenly. Then / who
is so sensles as not to understand / that the eleven standing with him / could
not in a trice either by voice / or finger lifted up / cast that charge off
speaking then / upon Peter? so that onles he did as it were take the Jews
words owte off their mouth: no time could want for that matter. He says
further / Act. the 1, and 15. considered, yt shall appear allwaies Peter's
office to speak first, and rule the action: and that he was at no time chosen
thereto by voices, much les at every particular meeting: which first is a gross
petition off that in question. Then if we were not hable to show by the word
/ that our S. Christ did not apoincte Peter chief off the rest: yet by what
either sentence / or word owte off the scripture is he hable to show / that he
was appoincted governor by him over all the rest / during his liffe? Thirdly
/ to leave Acts 15. disorderly alleged / which is to be handled in the very
next division: let him show us how he can prove / that S. Peter was chief in
that actio^ of prayer / where yt is said that all the Apostles lifted up their
voice. likewise in the election of the deacons: where the calling together Act.
4. 24
off the disciples / the exhortacion unto them / the prayer for the Deacons
chosen / the laying on off hands is as indifferently Act. 6. 2. 3 4. 6.
given to all the reaste / as to Peter. All know that one conceived the prayer
in the name off the rest / that one was president in the election. But that
that was Peter more then either John / or James / or any the rest: can not be
showed by one title off scripture: yet our D. does assure us / and (as he
says) out off the scripture / that Peter was the lodesman.

Where I show / that to suppose Peter not chosen by the Apostels / to take upon
him the government / is to do him injury: he answers / he was appointed unto
yt off God, and lawfully. As if to be appointed off God / and lawfully / could
not stand with the Apostels choosing of him: or their election were not the
election of God. For if he mean he was chosen to yt by Christ im^ediatly: it
is that in question / whereof he brings not a lettre of proof. But / this
judgment offmine has no ground off scripture, or either learned, or ancient
authority. What ground off scripture I have / let the reader judge off that
already / and to be alleged in the next diuis. For authority: I have showed
that Musculus (whom he has made his pillor in Page 65,
this behalf) affirming that Peter was in many places the chief, is against
him which says / he was always chief: and for me / as giving thereby to
understand / that this cheiftie varied / and was sometimes put upon other.
Which is also confirmed by Calvin: Insti. lib. 4 ca. 6. 5. sect.
who in saying / the Apostels gave this unto Peter for the most part, that he
should speak first: confirms both that he had his pre-eminence off the
Apostels / and that he had yt not always. Secondly / I have here alleged the
Scoliaste / that all was done by commen consent. Whereto he answers / he
says not Peter was at every assembly chosen chief: which is vain. For if all
were done with consent: then Peter's forespeaking / a part of that which was
done / was likewise. What will he say to Gratian / his good expounder? which in
this cause is more favorable then the Papists he has followed / which fetch
Peter's cheifdome from our Sau. Christ: for he confesses / that Peter was
chosen by the Apostles. Where owte off the scoliaste I showed / that this
Distin. 21.
presidentship off Peter was not done imperiously, with dominion, or power:
he answers no lawful jurisdiction, not of the king him self, is so. Which
smells off Anabaptistrie / and is before confuted. For if the word
(imperiously) which I used / be taken often in evil part: yet may not I
beseech you a Prince / do princelike? which is the word the Scoliast uses.
may not the higher power do things with power? both which the Scoliaste
denies to have been done of Peter. But there is in superiority humility. If
you mean that Princes must be humbly minded / I grant: but if you mean
that humility in Princes / will not suffer to command Princelike / in things
lawful: I deny yt.

He adds / that in rule and authority (meaning civil) there is servitude. If
he mean to the lord / I grant: and then yt is nothing to the purpose. If
that Kings are servants unto their peoples / 1. cha. off this Tra.
which only can have place here: I deny yt / for the cause before assigned.
Where we see again how the D. as if he led Princes in a stringe / makes them
to bear up my Lord Archbishops train. For seeing he sees yt denied him to
rule princelike / or with power: for shifte off answer he wresteth the scepter
owte of their hand / saying the king him self may not do so. if the Scoliast
had said that Peter did nothing tyrannically / nothing with oppression / which
two are as well denied unto Princes / as to bishops: then the D. answer would
have served. But when he says / he did nothing (...).
princelike, nothing by povvr: yt is manifest he tawght / that the rule lawful
in Princes over their subjects / was not meet for Peter over the other
Apostels. Where he adds / the Scoliaste says Peter rose, etc. as one that
had received the Presidentship of the Apostels: to let pas his translation /
which in steed off disciples understood (...).
of all the church / has put Apostles which was peculier then to the 11. he
does but daly. For I deny not that Peter had received yt: but that he had yt
given off our Sau. Christ immediately / or during his liffe (both which are in
controuesie:) there is not a word. Where in the entrance off this diuis. he
says / Peter was in all such assemblies the chief, and in an other place / he
was the chief in every matter: and for proof says / the most off the old
ecclesasticall writers / in that respect count him chief of the Apostels: yt
had page 68.
been good he had showed at the least one. I confess that there are old
writers which call him so: but that they do yt in that respect, I deny. for
the cheifty they give him over the rest / was for his singular zeal / and
other gifts: not as he says for that he had authority over them.

For proof whereof I will propound him / first that Ierom. aduers. Pelag.
Peter was Prince of the Apostels / as Plato was of the Philosophers: likewise
that he Bulling. Dec. 5. se.
was Prince off the Apostels / as Moses / Helias / David / Isay off the
Prophets. Now if Plato were ruler / or had the commandment off other
Philosophers / or if Moses of the Prophets that came after his death: then
Peter also might have the same over the Apostels, but if they be therefore so
called / because they excelled the rest in gifts: then yt is clear / that
these fathers esteemed not Peter chief / for any power or autorny over the
rest. An other says / Cypr. de symplici. praelat.
Peter was that the rest off the Apostels were, off like not office only /
but honor and power: directly contrary to D. page 320.
where he prefers Peter in honor: and contrary to that he both here / and
page 68. althowghe not in the same in words / yet indeed does affirm. Thirdly
/ it is to be noted / that here the D. hand is again with Harding against c
Artic. 4. diuis. 31.
the bishop: to whom alleging that Peter had power over the rest off the
Apostels / the bishop answers: Peter was chief off the APostels as
Aristippus is called chief off Philosophers: that is, the first, or best man
off the company: where he denies that S. Peter was either lord, or Prince, or
had power, or was governor over the rest off thapostels. He adds / from
this opinion that Peter in all such assemblies and in all matters moderated the
rest, was chief, and spoke first, the late writers dissent not. If he mean
the Instit. 4. l. 6. ca. se 5. Bullin. 5. dec. 3. ser. Bez. upon 1. Act. Gualt.
upon. 1 Act.
Papists / I grant: if the Catholic / he brings not / nor (as I think)
can bring so much as one / which says so. Here he has the bishop against him
/ to whom may be added Calvin / Bullinger / Beza / Gualter / with others.

Where I show that James ruled the action Act. 15. and not Peter, considering
that he pronounced the sentence whereunto the rest agreed: he says / first
that Peter spoke before the rest, which is untrue, for there was great
disputacion off both sides before d Diu. 48. page 395. verse 7.
Peter spoke* therefore yt must needs be / that the cawse was propounded by
some before. And so yt is frivolous he alleges out off Calvin / to prove
Peter proloquutor, for that he stood upon this especially that he might
declare thestate of the question. as if the Apostels Synod were so confused /
that a great part of it was spente / or ever the company were informed of the
state off the question. Whereas Calvin means / that S. Peter confirmed pithely
/ the trwth in that question: and not that he travailed to show wherein the
question consisted / as appears by Peter's whole oration. So that Saint Peter's
oration is first set down / not for that he spoke first: but for that he was
the first amongeste the Apostels / and Elders / which S. Luke thowght good to
commit to writing. It is also childish that Peter was moderator, because he
spoke after there was great disputacion: as if every one which comes between
two parties striving to draw the^ to concord / has authority over them:
considering that there is not a word in Peter's oration / which gives the least
ynckling off such authority. beside that to help him self / he shamfully
slaundreth (...).
the Apostels Synod / attributing unto yt a tumult, and bitter contention:
where S. Luke says only great disputacion, which may well be withowt both.
Whether yt be custom off Synodes for the moderator to speak last / and so to
ponounce the sentence gathered upon the former voices: I leave yt to the
judgment off the reader / referring him also to that the bishop writes in
this behalf: who proves (against Harding / which will have Peter Defense of
the Apol. 6. part cap. 4. diuis. 2. Hierar. 3. li. ca. 10. In 3. Tra.
chief) that James was chief, because he gave the definitive sentence. Whereby
also appears that this came either from Pigghius / or Harding / or from some
such popish fen.

After admiting James Moderator / he faith being then bishop by the Scoliastes
judgment, yt was not unmeet he should be moderator within his charge. I have
showed that an Apostle can not be changed into a bishop: and if he could / yet
yt was unmeet that S Peter should leefe his right / whereto (he says) he was
ordained off God, to use from thascention unto his dying day Therefore it is
against him directly: but how against me, he nether does / nor ca^ show.
Beside / it is absurd that an Apostle should give place unto a bishop /
because the bishop is in his charge: considering that an Apostle is in his
charge / in what church soever he come / and that as an Apostle: to whom the
bishop (unless he were by consent chosen to govern the synod) owght to give
place. And if yt be true that it is meet the bishop of the place where the
synod is houlden, should govern the synod: why has he made this before a
necessary cause off In 12. diu. page 364.
having an archbishop / to govern Synodes? The other place off the Acts /
makethe for this matter. For if James assembled the lders / and ruled that
meeting wherein it was determined what S. Paul should do / him self being
present / which was (as shall appear) in nothing inferior unto Peter): he might
by the same right moderate the assembly in Peter's presence. Where I show that
Diuis. 49. Page 396.
this is the superiority which is amongst bishops / and ministers: he
answers / yt is so, but not all. But out of the scripture (wheroff the
question is here) he neither does / nor can show other superiority: so that
here his cause faleth flat.

Where I alleged Master Calvin / that one off the Apostles Diuis. 50. page 396.
indefinitelie, not any one singular person, had the moderation off the rest:
he answers out off him / that it would not be absurd if we confess, that
the Apostels gave pre-eminence unto Peter. Which is but daliaunce. For he
affirms simply / that Calu. Epist. ad Reg. Polo. pa. 140
our Savior Christ meant nothing less, then to make Peter chief off the
rest off the Apostels. Instit. li. 4 6. cap. sect. 7.
Here Having proved that Peter was nothing else, but one of the twelve, that
he was equal unto them, their fellow not their lord, that they had as much
power over him, as he over them: he disputes that if it were granted which
the Papists require / off Peter's being Prince off the Apostles (which he
utterly deniethe): yet yt followethe not which they would conclude / off a
Pope. Likewise he daliethe / in showing what authority the Consul off Rome,
and masters of Colleges have: adding that tharchbishop is content with less.
Where Calvin compares the moderator in the ministers meeting / with the
consulship not in all points / but only in this / that he should propound the
matters / etc. as before. Which appears in an other in diui. 38 page 385. 4
li. 4. ca. 2. sect.
place / and even in this very place when he says / yt is meet that
althovvghe they be all off equal power, yet there should be one as yt were
moderator. And therefore if you would have made yowr archbishops according to
Caluins measure. he owght to have no more pre-eminence before the simplest
pastor / then the Consul which spoke / had before his fellow Consul which
held his peace. Where he says / the prolocutor chosen for the inferior sort of
clergy, yet the Archbishop reteineth still his office: yt shewethe that he is
now but an idol / having put over the duty to other / for which he is supposed
to have been so necessary. But yt is manifest that the Prolocutor in the
synod has all that pre-eminence / which Peter had above the other Apostels:
and therefore which one pastor owght to have above an other / which is that I
browght yt for. The next I answer not.

Where I show his vain argument / that one bishop should be above an other,
because Paul an APostle was above Timothe an Evangelist: Diuis. 52. page 373.
he says that yt houldethe, because they differ not in the administering off
the the word, and sacraments, but in government. Which is untrue: for they
differed in both alike. For as they differed from the Apostles / in that they
governed those only churches over which they were set / where the Apostles
government stretched unto all churches: so they could not administer the word
and sacraments / but where they were appointed / where the Apostles might do
yt in all places. But for further confutation off this distinction / I In Diui.
27. p 314.
refer me to that before. Where I show his argument all one with this: my
Lord mayor is above the Sherifes, therefore one sheriff is above an other: he
says I should have concluded that because my Lord Mayor has rule over the
cytisens, therefore the Apostels superiority over an inferior degree off
ministry, proves that one in the same degree of ministry may rule over an
other: Which is to ridiculous. For if it were (as it is not) a good argument
from civil government unto ecclesiastical: yet to say that therefore one
ecclesiastical officer may bear rule over an other / yea that one may bear
rule over his fellows off the same order / becawse the magistrate bears rule
over private men / cleaneth together as goats dounge. So that if there were
any argument here / yt is / that as my Lord mayor rules over the cytisens: so
yt behouethe the pastor to rule over his flock. The next division is In 2. ca.
off this Tract.
answered. Diui. 54. page 399.
Where he calledged Calu. that upon that Paul willed Titus to appoint Elders /
says Titus was in authority and counsel above other Pastors: and I opposed
Calu. which shows that he did nothing in that behalf vvithovvt the advice
off other pastors, and consent off the churches: he askethe whotly still for
answer. As if it were not answered especially when I showed before / that the
superiority that ministers can have in such meetinges / is only to propounde
etc. as is before declared. Which Calu. do the expressly set forth in the same
place / when he says: S. Paul commanded him only upon Tit. 1. Diuis. 55.
page 399.
to be president or moderator in the election.

The two first sections how shamefullie they be said / I leave to the readers
judgment: in the last / against that I alleged out off the Scoliaste / that
Paul would not have one rule the whole I Will / and therefore not Titus: is
browght first an exposition gone abowte to be confirmed off him / and
Chrysostom / which say that Paul committed unto Titus Crete, and to Timothy
almost all Asia. As if that might not well stand with that / that Titus
governed one city alone. for in that they had authority given them / to
appoint ministers in form aforesaid / in all that circuit / until the
church there were fully established / and a lawful ministry throwghly
planted* there charge in that respect / extended yt self to that whole
circuit. But when the country was divided into several churches / and every
church had a lawful / and complete ministry: he charge before general / is
now restrained unto that one church where Titus made his abode. Even as every
off the 12. Princes / and Aaron which divided the land off Canaan / had before
partition a certain power off all: which after lottes cast had only to do with
that / which apperteined to them in several. A thowgh if yt be granted that
Titus and Timothe continued that large government / during their abode there /
wherein I will not strive): yet considering as has been showed they were
Evangelists / and no Bishops / nor Archbishops: there can nothing grow to them
hereby. For as no man can have government over all the churches which the
Apostels had / but they that have that special office: so none can succeed
into the jurisdiction off Evangelists / but they only which have that
extraordinary ministry. And therefore Calvin in the place before cited off
the D. says / there was not then such equality, etc. but that one did rule
over an other: noting by the word then (which the D. has unfaithfully left
out) that the government which Titus had in Creta / was for those times when
there were such extraordinary callinges.

Where he says / in streightening Titus to one church, I make him pastor,
Diuis. 56. page 400.
which I donie: let him learn that to have charge in one church alone / not a
pastor / unless he be so tied that he can not depart / withowt the church lose
his bond. Which neither Titus was / nor is by any word affirmed off me.
Whether the rest be shamels accusations / let the reader judge. The next /
althowghe unworthy of answer / being but bare affirmacions against my reasons /
is answered in 2. Tra. Diuis. 1. Page 197.
before As for that those words receive no accusations, etc. must needs be
understood of one which has other elders underneath him, and therefore not
off every pastor: yt argues that the D. is spent. For he knowethe that we
hold that every pastor had his elders assistan: which has / and shall (God
willing) appear. Besides that it argues his ignorance off the state of the
elder churches: where (as has been showed) bishops sat in judgment off other
bishops / and elders not underneath them. That there be not a hundredth 1. Tim.
3. 2. and 4. 12. and 5. 10. Tit. 2. 2 Diuis. 59. page 402.
several precepts, in the three epistles to Timothe, and Titus (whereas in
diverse verses there be six / or seven) does well become his bouldnes. Against
reason alleged out off Augustine / that the place out off Epiphanius was of
some false Epiphanius: here is nothing but authority. Howbeit not to strive for
this: before I come to answer yt is to be noted / that this is Pigghius reason
against the church off God / even in the very self same cause which we have
now in hand / towching this sort of bishops. For against the Waldenses first /
and after against Wickleue / which put no difference between a bishop / and a
priest: Pigghius. Hierar. 2 lib. 10. ca.
Pigghius has a treatise in his Hierarche / wherein he pressethe them with this
testimony of Epiphanius. And further says of Wickleue / that therefore he
took away the difference between bishop / and elder / because he could not
obtain the bishopric of Worcester. and in lib controuers. 16. contr.
an other book inueigheth sharply against them / for that they would have
neither Pope / nor primate / nor Archbishop / nor Bishop.

And that yt may yet appear even to the simple reader / that they had the same
cause against Pigghius / and the Papists which we against the D. I offer to
his consideration / besides the two flat testimonies of M Barnes and Hooper in
the preface to the 3. cap.
before cyted / M. Wickleues tenthe article in these words M. Fox
There be 12 disciples of Antichrist: Popes, Cardinals, Patriarckes,
Archbishopes, Bishops, Archedeacons, Officials, Deanes, Monks, Chanons, Friars
and Pardoners. If the D. say that Wickleue spoke that not off the offices / but
off their abuse in popery: that shift will not serve / considering that he
leaves out priests / and Deacons. Whereof the priest especially / doing more
mischeife then diverse which are reckened: yet because he occupied the place
off the pastor in every congregation / which was the ordinance off God / and
was only a deprauacion / and deformity off the true ministry: he spares
him. the other because they were devised / partly herbingers to prepare his
way / partly puruc^ers to interteine his estate: he marked with the black cole
off Antichristianitie. If yt be further said / that Wickleue should by this
means condemn the estate off a bishop / which S. Paul allows off: yt is
manifest that he bet against the lord bishop / which rules over other
ministers in adiocese: considering that he leaves the priest / the deformity
of the teaching minister / which minister is all one (as has been showed) with
S. Paul's Bishop. Beside this reason / they may as well say he spoke not
against the office off Pope / Chanons / Monks / Friars / Pardoners / but only
against the abuse: which is absurd. This to the learned may better appear by
Pigghius discourse: which confesses that the Waldenses / and Wickleue left the
orde^ off priesthode (as they call yt) and that the whole question between them
was not whether lord bishops / and Archbishops did their duty / but whether
they were lawful estates. Whereby appearethe that whosoever was the D. merchant
/ these wares come from one off the filthiest puddels off popery: and withal
that as sone almost / as there was any set and apparent estate of the church /
which proclaimed open war against Antichrist / the letters off defiaunce were
as well sent against the In lib aduers. papat. a Satana fundat. vel Parochis.

judgment, and whatsoever belongethe to the church, equally belongs to all
except that (which Paul teaches) some preacher or Christian may be off a
sounder faith then other, have greater gifts then another, interpret the
scripture better then an other, rule better then an other, preach better, and
have the discretion off spirits more then an other etc. howbeit such gifts
cause no inequality, or lordship in the church Here I will also set down the
judgment off the reformed churches in Heluetia / Zurich / Berne / Geneua /
Polonia / Hungery / Scotland / etc. who having reckened the ministries
specified in scriptures / add: in the times in their confession.
follovving there were many other titles off ministers brovvght into the
church For some were ordained Patriarckes, some Archbishops, other
Suffraganes, also metropolitanes, Archelders, etc. but for all those we pass
not either what they were in times past, or are now: the Apostels doctrine of
the ministers is sufficient for us. If all these churches make no accounte off
these offices / not only as they are now / but when they were at the best if
they esteem them withowt the doctrine of the Apostles: I leave to the readers
judgment what estimacion they had off them / and how the D. would abuse us /
that drawethe the sentences of the chief in this confession / to prove their
conuenie^ce. Neither do I dowbt but that our Archebishops / and Bishops
refusing to join with the rest off the churches in this confession / did it
because they could not digest this morsel especial.

Now to come to the D. that says / Epiphanius calls us heretics: which
pinchethe us. master Wickleue / and the pore Waldenses bare yt at Pigghius hand
/ we must do yt at the D. in deed so much more pinching / as yt commethe from
him / from whom yt least owght. But what remedy: the Lord will look to it in
time. Howbeit because this arrow is (as yt is said) of Epiphanius a man
subject to error / shot out off Pigghius bow / one given up to error / having
no head off the word of God to make yt enter: yt may peradventure raise the
skin / but wound yt can not make. But Augustine reckenethe yt so: but
Augustine reports what he found written. for towching his own judgment he
is flat against Epiphanius: which makes a bishop and an elder differ by the
Apostels institution / whereas Augustine (as I have showed) in 16. diu. page 169.
teaches even as Jerome / that this difference was not by the word of God /
but by custom. now I would know of the D. how Augustine can houlde that for an
heresy / which (to leave the rest) can not be convinced by the word off God /
but only by a custom off the church. And here first he must either let go
his hold of Jerome / or this of Epiphanius. For if yt be trw that Epiphanius
houldeth / that a bishop and an elder differ by the Apostels institution: then
it is false which Jerome and others hold / that they were all one at the first
/ and that the difference came by custom. Contrariwise if Jerome in that point
say true (as in deed he does): then Epiphanius authority falls. Secondly /
if the D. will prejudice this cause / for that Epiphanius a Catholic thowght
them to differ by the word off God / where Aerius an heretic thowght them all
one / or else in that Augustine reckeneth that amongst his heresies: by the same
reason he must prejudice this trwthe / that we owght not to pray / or make any
oblation for the dead. For both lib. 3: Tom. 1. 75. haeres.
Epiphan. esteemed him an heretic for his judgment in that behalf: and ad
quod vult Deu^ haeres. 53.
Augustine reports this as one off his heresies / which is catholic doctrine.
So that Pigghius might use this authority better / which condemnethe as well
the one / as the other: then the D. which houldethe (as I think) for
Catholic / that which Aerius the heretic affirmed / and for heretical /
which Epiphanius the Catholic condemned.

The flower off Epiphanius reasons / browght before / is answered: now the D.
distressed / brings forth tag and rag. for towching Epiphanius saying (the
bishop by imposition off hands begets fathers 1. teachers to the church,
where the priests begat only sons: yt is but asking off that in question
/ when Aerius holding them both one by Gods institution: the imposition off
hands belonging unto the bishop / must needs be affirmed to apperteine unto
the elder. neither does Epiphanius answer the reason out off S Paul / that
Timothe was ordained 1. Tim. 4. 14
by imposition off hands off the company off elders. Likewise that browght
off a bishop above an elder, because 1. Tim. 5 1
S. Paul wills Timothe not to rebuke an elder: to let goo other faults as
many as are words in the sentence / yt is absurd that he refers that unto
an elder by office / which is spoken of an elder by years / and refers that
to the public minister which is understood only off a private membre off
the church: as appears manifestly by the opposition off a young man / and
after off the elder woman. So I leave to be esteemed / what good cause the D.
has to cover his face / in that wheroff he so greatly vaunteth. The next
division is Tract. 3. cap. 3 de Evangelist, etc.
answered. In the next / I leave it to the reader whether the D. order has the
heels upward: which after endeavor to show the necessity / the causes / yea
the examples off a thing / sets him self to prove that it was. Althowgh if
this be his trim order / he has kept it evil. for Chrysostom browght for
confirmacion off the first / comethe after Jerome / which is browght to bear
up his second. 61. diui. page 409.
That Ignatius bishop was but off one particular congregation only / I in the
praef. to the 3. ca. off this Tractat.
have showed: and therefore the words (over all) pressed off the D. as they are
off 4. lib, 1. ca Hiera.
Pigghius from whence this was taken / are understood of those within his
particular church. Besides / the kind of speech may be easelier drawn unto
the whole world / then off a diocese / or province: for the reason assigned in
my diuis. 7. page 357.
former book: That the bishop owght to be above the elders which only
governed / and deacons: is confessed. if he were above the teaching elders /
that was by custom: whether good or bad / let it be judged off that said.
Howbeit that that be granted: yt makes nothing to prove a bishop over a
diocese / much less an Archbishop.

When the bishop in every church / or (to speak as the D.) in every diocese,
was the Chief / above whom there could not by Diuis. 62. page 409.
this Ignatius be any higher bishop in earth: I leave yt to the readers
judgment how absurd the D. is / who says that Ignatius does not overthrow
his Archishop. for thereby he affirms / that albeit the bishop off the Diocese
were the highest bishop that could be upon earth: yet there might be an other
higher then he. Also how fond he is in his reason / that for as much as an
archbishop is a bishop: therefore Ignatius allowing one, allowethe the other.
When yt is manifest by his own confession / that Ignatius speaks off one
only sort off bishops / either of one particular church / as the trwthe is: or
off one diocese / as he imagines. So that his argument is / Ignatius allowethe
one sort off bishops: therefore the Archbishop. all one as if a man should say /
he has a kind off fish in his moate / therefore a whale fish.

The D. detected / in that Iustins president was neither bishop Diuis. 63. Page
410.
off diocese / nor Archbishop off Province / but of one congregation: for
excuse says / he browght the place to prove there might be superiority over
the ministers. Where first his trim order, that all my logic, and Rhetoric
is not able to move, is too pitiful. for how childishe is yt / after so long
travail to prove a bishop over the ministers off a diocese / and tharchbishop
of a Province / in the end to endeavor to prove / that there may be
superiority? as if any man would deny this that granted the other: and yt is
to set the fondacion upon the lover. yet I would know off him what meanethe the
word (this) whereby appears not only that he browght yt to prove
superiority: but the superiority either off a bishop over a whole diocese /
or an Archbishop over a Province: considering that this is the superiority
which he speak of before / and im^ediatelie after. Secondly where I both by
the use of the scriptures / and ancient writers showed the word Brethren, not
taken for the governors but the people: observe how vainly he answerth / that
Iustine meant the ministers, and deacons by brethren, because he calls the
people after by the name off people. As if the rest off the church were not
called both in scripture / and other writers / by diverse names. Thirdly how if
it be granted / that Iustins president had superiority over the minister: yet
how fondly yt is concluded / that yt is lawful / because yt was. Then how his
weapons fetched from Master Beza / have always their edge toward him / and
his cause. For he alleges him to prove that Iustins president did govern the
rest / and had the name off bishop: which in the same place flatly condemns
that policy / as is declared. Lastly / in 33. diu. Page 347.
how by this answer / he makes every pastor off a congregation to handle the
gouernemen: which before he took from him / when he shuts him up in the
administracion of the word / and samentes only.

Iustines writings compared as I compared them / with the holy scripture /
are as I said a ditche: I added the reason / that there was in them not a little
mudd off errors / which the D. could not answer: otherwise I acknowledge him
both godly / and learned. Master Beza sought not the word president in
Iustine, but shows how Timothe did the office at Ephesus / which Iustines
president did: which was meet / considering he had a higher ministry then
any there. So that althowgh Timothe above the degree off a bishop / kept that
presidentship continually during his abode: yet there was no reason that one
Pastor off the same degree with other / should take that upon him. If he were
the true Ignatius / he should in deed be before Justin: but to let pass other
exceptions / with M. Caluins sharp censure off him: yt is absurd to ascribe
to Ignatius S John's scholar / that vain boaste / off being able to Ignat. ad

differences between virtues / powers / Thrones / etc. Diui 64 page 411.
That priest is no fit name for a minister off the gospel, is towched after:
that the names proper to our S. Christ / can be communicated with man / is
absurd / and before confuted: where also the name off Prince / a peace off
Prince off Priests, is showed unfit (...)
fer the ministry. That there may be one Archbishop over bishops / as there is
one bishop over pastors / has no part trw / as has been showed: only let
yt be noted / that the reason here for the Archbishop / is Defense Apol. part.

before and page 471
after / to prove our Archbishops jurisdiction (that one had care of the whole
Province) here is pursued. whereunto I answer here / that care does not
necessarily draw jurisdiction / or rule over that cared for: seeing that there
is no minister (I might have said also no magistrate) yea no private membre /
which owght not to have / and show forth a care / off all the churches which
are in Christendom / every one according to the means which the lord has
given. The Prince with his power / the minister with his conforte / and
instruction / the private man with the wealth God has blessed him with / at
the least with his prayer: the communion off saints / and fellowfeeling in
the members off one body / requiring this. Hereoff we have example in 1. Tom.
Council. carth. 3.
Aurelius / which says he had care off all churches. Bouins a Popish friar /
or Monk I well remember not whether / tawght in this point in the same schole
with the D. in esteming that care off churches implied rule: least the bishop
off Rome should be hurt by that speech / expounds all churches, all in
Affricke. Our D. h alleging this place / because in taking care in his sense /
for rule with authority / he should page 471.
in travailing with the Archbishop have browght us forth a Pope: in steed off
all churches, puts many churches. so that he will never want: for if his
places be to streite for his Archbishops measure / he settethe them upon the
teinter hooks: if to wide / he laiethe them in water and shrinkethe them. But
what should I stand in confuting this? seeing yt is so far off that care
prouethe rule / and dominion: that it is seen not only in one equal over an
other / but even in servants over their masters. As for that that is said /
Chrysostomes care restreined here to certain places, can not be understood
off such a general care as comprehends all churches: I answer that the care
off his own church being properly commended unto him / it is mete that as the
churches next do most affecte his / bettering it commonly if they be good /
making yt worse if they be nawght: so in that general care over the rest /
there should be such dispensation / as to have a greater care over those / then
over the rest: as we see in wise Princes / more careful off the borderers /
then off those further removed from them. In which degree yt is not improperly
spoken / that he had the care off such churches rather then off all.

His four notes out off Theodoret / depend upon these wodes (the same care):
so that if yt fall out that Chrysostom had not the same rule over Thracia /
Asia / etc. which he had over Constantinople: then those words spoken off the
government he had in that city / are idle to prove the same in Thracia / etc.
But first the D. cries out of corruption, craft, and either ignorance, or
malice. good words Master D. I pray you. For ignorance yt is no great matter
/ I am content you say that I borrowed two greek words off my neighbors. But
why corruption, etc? did I not set down words sufficient to confute your
untrue dealing / which instead of care / put down rule? was I bownd to set
down more in greek / then you surmised in English? yea could I have set down
the word you require / with any sense unto the reader: unless I had set down
(as you now) the whole story / and so have given your cause greater color
then your self knew of then? I help you diverse times with arguments which
you make much of: but will you bind me to do so always? I have more color
to cry out of you / which to prove In the next din.
Chrysostom governor of these places / voluntarily cite Socrates trippinglie
/ vvinding up in these words (et caetera) which is your ruin / and which
manifestly confuteth the largenes you suppose off the bishop off
Consiantinoples metropolitaneship. Therefore seeing this bitterness must be vented
/ you at least should have waited some better opportunity. now let us see
whether these words (he had the same care over Thracia, etc that he had over
the church off Constantinople) will entitle Chrysostom lawfully to as great
authority over one / as over the other. For the discussing vvheroff I must by
thy good leave gentle reader / fetch this matter somewhat higher.

The Socr. li. 5. ca. 8.
Council off Nice / bounding and butting the metropolitaneships decreed / that
the bishop of Constantinople (which it calls the great city) should be
metropolitan over Thracia / certain other over Pontus / others over Asia: to
the nombre off ten metropolitaneships. This order was confirmed by other
councels off Constantinople / and Ephesus / as they are Vieler. de statu Primit.
observed: and continued until the council off Calcedon which most
confusedly / and disorderedly throwghe extreme Ambition off the bishop off
Constantinople / drowned almost all these ten / in his one only sea. Where
also yt was ordained by the same Council of Nice / that the Metropolitanes
should be off equal power / and not one under an other: this Council made one
Metropolitan over a nombre. Where further it was ordained by diverse Counsels
/ as has partly before / and partly may appear by c Theodoret / lib. 5. 23
cap.
that the Metropolitan off every Province / should be chosen by the bishops
theroff: this Council makes the bishop of Constantinople / to have the
appointement off all metropolitaneships / within the compass alleged by the D.
Moreover where the same Nicene Council / with sundry others ordained / that
the bishops of the Province at the least three / should be at the ordinacion
off every bishop: this Council give the yt in the bishops off the Barbarians
(meaning as I suppose Scithians) unto him off Constantinople. Now if the D.
will make Chrysostom accessory unto this famous robbery / if guilty off all
this confusion / and disorder off the breach off so many Canons off the Nicene
/ and other Councels / and finally if he will make him a Pope: he does him
that injury which I would be loathe. For where unto me / alleging that if he
were Archbishop off all these churches, he was off more then ever the Pope, in
his greatest pride: he answers that I am greatly deceived, for that Phocas
the Emperor made all these churches, and all other subject to the Pope, and
appointed him head off all: I answer that he is greatly deceived. Considering
that the Empire being divided into the east / and weast Empire / more then 250.
years before Phocas made Boniface the third Pope: Phocas could not having his
Empire for the most part in the east / where the churches were most ruined /
make all or half the churches subject unto Boniface. So that yt is manifest
that Chrysostom (by his saying) metropolitan off all Asia, and a good part
off Europe: must needs have more under him / then Pope Boniface. What the Pope
claimed, is nothing to that I set down: which spoke precisely off that he was
/ and not off that he claimed to be. Therefore if he build upon Chrysostomes
supposed metropolitaneship: he does manifestly allow a larger circuit unto a
bishop / then ever any Pope had.

If I would have sought to have discredited Chrysostom: I might have answered
that yt was no marvel / thowghe he exercised such dominion / considering
that both Socrates / and Camerarius after him / which commend diverse virtues
off his lib. 6. c. 4
affirm him to have been a proud man. But considering that him self opposes
the Emperors large dominion / to a bishops charge in one city: I chose that
sense which I setdowne. Neither are there any words either in Theodoret / or
the Centuries / so strong to carry the metropolitaneship over all these places
/ to Chrysostom: as Nazianzenes words before handled / are to carry in diu.
26 page 340.
the metropolitaneship off almost all the churches in the world / unto
Cyprian. For these words he had the same care, can not be understood as the
D. would / that he did the same things in all places which he did at
Constantinople. For how could he teach / and rebuke sin in all that circuit /
as there? deprive and excommunicate in proper person / as there? so that will
he nil he / the words must have a restreint in respect off those before. as
for the greek word he translateth he governed, which signifies he adorned:
unless he have some singular license / i^ is for a translation (...)
especially / too riotous. althowghe if that were there: yt drawethe no
metropolitan authority / as has been showed in Cyprians example. I grant
Sozomenes are more pressing / which speakethe off his deposing off the bishops
in Asia: and if to maintain my former answer I would say / he deposed them
not by his authority / but by his counsel / as Diophantus said off the
Plutarch. de instit. pueror.
city of Athenes ruled by him, because Themistocles his father which ruled
yt, was guided by his mother, and his mother by him: and thereto allege that
he is called the Doctor off the vvoride by the same 5. lib. ca. 32.
Theodoret / when notwithstanding he could not be an authorized doctor off
such a compass: yt would peradventure be more then he can well answer. But if he
will as he does / make that his pattern to frame his Archbishop by: he makes
us a faicrer but to shoot at / then before: the archbis. being made thereby in
authority off breaking canons off the best Counsels / by putting in and
putting owte off his absolute power / not infeferior unto the pope of Rome /
and in compass off dominion above him / and a fatter Pope then he. And beside
that it is but trifling / to fetch examples off Archbishop like government /
four hundrethe years and a half after Christ / or there about / where the
question is off three hundrethe: I have showed how dangerous yt is / to build
upon the examples off those times: especially when even in this point off
broad dominion / before Chrysostomes time there was an intolerable excess in
the bishop off Antioche: which beside Chrysostomes compass / had also all
Theodor. li 5. ca. 23.
Illyricum.

Towching Ireneus embassage into Phrigia: the D. eye is not simple. For after
Eusebius. had showed that there were Ambassadors 5. li. ca. 3. and 4.
sent by the french churches / to those off Phrigia: he adds as an
augmentation / that they were also sent to the bishop off Rome. After to the
end the embassage might have more authority / he shows how Ireneus was sent
being commended unto the bishop off Rome: to the end (as may easily appear)
that his letter also obtained with theirs / the churches might be the rather
moved. Whether I have followed the Scoliastes meaning / towching every hishop
having a several congregation: I refer me to that I have before alleged.
The D. answer to Homil. 3. in Act.
Chrysostom which places the bishops charge in one city (that he does but
show how the Bishop is subject to as many afflictions, as the Emperor, and
that he puttethe no difference between the Bishop and the Emperor) is but a
cavil. For his purpose is to show / what are the manifold troubles that
accompany the mynistery / thereby to pinche those which seek after yt: and
that he does with an argument off comparison / in that being but bishop off
one city: yet he is subject not only to so many, but to more troubles then
the Emperor / which has so large government. Now if bishops authority should
be extended / as the D. estemeth Chrysostomes: who sees not that his
comparison halteth down right? considering that there were few Emperors / or
rather none since Constantine / that ever had so large dominion / as this
ascribed unto Chrysostom. For against this argument yt might have been easily
replied / off those which lay in wait for the ministry / that seeing one was
able to govern so many whole countries / and nations: yt could not be so hard
a matter / to govern one only city.

I could not here be put to shifte, seeing where our question is off 300. you
fetch your proufes off 400. whether I have said Diuis. 67. page 415.
true: let the reader judge. Where I allege the first act off the Calcedon
Council / that the bishops cried that Theodoret was no bishop: be alleges
the 8. act, that he was. If yt be page 65.
a simple answer to set one author against an other: yt is much more simple
to set one authority at variaunce with yt self / withowt showing any way of
reconciliatio^. That the Council did well in conde^ning that Theodoret /
appears for that he had Euag. 4. lib. ca. 38.
written against Cyril / even in that Cyrill wrote against Nestorius errors: in
which respect his Council. Ephesians.
books were commanded to be burnte with those errors. And this was not only
done by the Council off Calcedon / but by that also off Ephesus / and
Constantinople: so that here are three condemnations passed against him / for
one absolution. And that what manner off one? verelie which appears to have
been throwghe the favor off the Emperor Martian. For what if he revoked his
heresy there / as he had (I thinck) done before in the Council off
Constantinople: yet as I have showed / there was no cause why he should be
trusted with such a great charge / no not in the D. judgment (I suppose) so
soudenlie / and withowt further trial. Which I say not to discredit his true
repentance / and learned writings: but only to show / how totteringlie the D.
Archbishop is set.

Where I alleged that the Emperor Theodosius, and Vale^tinian commanded him
to keep him to his own church only: his answer is fond / that the Emperors
meaning was, that he should not come to the Synod. For are these two all one:
to keep him self to his own church only, and not to come to the Synod??
When he might come to the synod / althowghe he kept not him self to his own
church only: which he could not have done / if they had been all one. Where
he says / yt appears that the Emperor gave that charge, that he should not
come unto the Synod but called: yt makes nothing to the purpose. For that
may well stand with that I alleged / off his keeping to one church only. And
in deed there had been small wisdom / to have forbidden him the Council in
respect off the heresy he labored off: and yet to have suffered him to
govern such a mighty people. When I expounded tares, hipocrites: I had not
the book before me / but trusting therein to Theodoretes knowledge in the
scripture / esteemed that he meant them / off whom the parable is understood:
that is those / off whose either corruption in life / or doctrine / the church
can have no certain knowledge to proceed against / or to give (as he did)
sentence upon. Neither is he yet purged off the suspicion: considering that yt
can hardly be believed / that there was not in 800. churches one only heretic.
And if there were not: yet yt was hard for him to have such knowledge off so
many churches / whereby he might give so precise a sentence: especially if they
be compared with ours / which often have heretics even under there nose / and
either see them not / or look throwghe their fingers.

Where to declare the vnlikelihoode off our bishops with Diuis. 68. Page 416.
the^ in times past / Theodoret bishop 26. years is showed to have had never a
halfepennie, etc: his answer is / he professed voluntarily poverty. Whereto I
have little to reply / but that the D. for advantage spares not the honor of
his authors: it being a great reproach in so great wealth as the D. supposes
he might lawfully have had / to be so beggarly. The next I leave to the readers
judgment. That the office off Archbishop / and Patriarck / by Calvin was
nothing but to assemble the Synod / propound diu. 70. 71 page 418. in diu. 38.
page 385.
the matter / gather the voices / etc. I have showed. condemning those names in
the general / he must needs condemn them in the particular: for in both
those names / the word off dominion is put / which he condemns. That he
condemns the office with us / is clearer then the sun: and that in diverse
sorts / first general in that upon the Apostles words (no man may take
honor but he that is called as Aaron) he denies Upon the Heb.
yt lawful to set up any government in the church at the pleasure off men,
vvithovvt waiting for the commandment of God and that the church office
devised vvithovvt his commandment, and express ordinance, is unlawful.
Whereby appears that the admonitions allegacion / which the D. Diuis. 11. page
462.
other where calls gross, is in effect as fine as Caluins. Secondly in that
he does in flat words declare / Inst. 4. li. ca. 4. s. 4:
that the holy ghost took great heed / that one should not so much as dream
off principality / and dominion in the government of the church. Thirdly in
that he Upon the Philip. 1.
does precisely mislike / that any should have postorall charge over a
Province: which he declares yet more manifestly / when he Inst li. 4. ca. 6.
se. 2.
says the government of the high priest which was over one nation* being
a figure off our Sau. Christ, ovvght not to be follovved Whereby appears how
vntrwly he charge me Diui. 16. Page 467.
otherwhere / with falsifiyng Calvin, for saying that his judgment is, that no
one should be minister off a whole nation. That Upon Philip: 1.
only which he likes off / and confesses to have been done according to the
word off God / is that when there were controversies to be voided / one had the
pre-eminence to assemble the company / etc. which pre-eminence we have before
confirmed / so far is yt from us / that we can not abide yt.

That it can not be drawn further / appears by that in the beginning off
this treatise: where it is manifest he streineth him self / to speak
honorably off the manner off discipline in the elder churches: yet he says / 4.
li. ca. 4. sec. 1.
there was almost nothing against the word off God. And further / that
althovvgh there may be some lack in their orders: yet because they did it often
good mind and erred not much, it is good to gather yt. Moreover towching that
institution which off all other is most plausible / and least princelike / that
one in a church should have the name off bishop / which notwihstanding (as
has been showed) had no dominion / nor authority to command the rest / he
says: Upon 1. Philip.
that authority had no institution, nor ground ovvt off the word of God.
Whereupon yt is manifest / those words off Calu. (the old bishops did frame no
kind off government but prescribed in the lords word) can not be drawn
further then I have said. Where he expounds Caluins words / every singular
body off church, a dioces or province: yt is (as all the rest off these
divisions) a shameful bouldnes / considering that Calu. does in express
words / shut forth a province: and in calling it a singular body, used most
propre words to set forth a congregation which assembled into one place / may
at once be fed at one mouth.

Where also otherwhere he supposes Calu. meant by Provinces, such as are
under diverse governors, because one Province in one particular page 468.
church, in one kingdom, under one Prince, is but one body, etc. to omit his
absurd speech / that a province is in a particular church, instead that he
should have said / a particular church is in the province: let it be observed
that in making the whole church in a kingdom / but that singular body Calu.
speaks off: he makes notwithstanding the church in one province / which is
the half off that / yea every diocese to be that singular body. So that one
singular / and vndiuisible body off a church / must be twenty / and one off
them also co^teining an other: which is absurd. yea by this means the church
in a 100. Provinces being under one Prince / shall be but one singular body.
His reason that he can not mean a particular parish, because every one has
not many ministers: is a cavil. For it is enowghe that there were diverse in
some churches (as in the church off Philippes wheroff he spoke) to draw him to
that consideration. Besides that there was (as shall appear) in the particular
churches / appointed by the word off God an eldership: amongst whom it was
meet the same order should be kept. Where he supposethe Calvin to have
thowght the church off Geneua with all those belonging unto yt, to have made
but one body off a church: all see the D. poverty / driven to leave his wide
works / to seek some comfort in his thowghtes / only known to the lord. If
I should use the advantage off that he spoke / and I heard off vndowbted
witnesses / that althowghe he had no pre-eminence before the lowest Mynister /
but only to propounde the causes / gather the voices / etc. and was chosen
thereunto every two year: yet he misliked that that small pre-eminence should
so long remain with one / as which in time might breed in conuenience:
likewise that I heard my self off Master Beza which misliked off yt for the
same cause / affirming it convenient that it should be done by every Pastor
off the same resort in his week / wheroff there be also other witnesses: I say
if I should use this advantage / a great deal more honest then his: all see
how that change of preside^tes which he derideth / and will have my only
fantasy, should beside the scripture alleged / and use off the churches in
France / have the approbation off these godly learned men. But when in deed
he deride the their judgment written: I have small hope that he will bear any
reverence to it only spoken. Neither require I that he esteem any thing theirs
/ which can not be convinced out off their writings: let him wreste and wring
/ wind and turn his worst.

But that we be not straight with him / admit Calvin so thowght: does yt
follow that becawse he esteemed a singular body off a church / scarce 20.
small parishes lying round about / wheroff every off the ministers at the least
meet once a week / both for exercise off prophecy / or interpretacion off
the word / and to hold common consultation: that therefore he esteemed the whole
dioces off London / or Province off Canterbury where there are many thousand
parishes / might conveniently grow into one particular body / to be governed
off one Pastor. Truly this is but kolde reasoning. Where I charged him with
vnfaithefull dealing, for leaving ovvt that vvvich Calvin notes (that the
office off Archbis. and Patriarck was rarely used) to cover his
vnfaithfullnes: he alleges the later edition, which has not that sentence.
Which is partly answered in Diui. 43. page 391.
before: but ad this also that even the noted book which he followed / had
thus much off that sentence / Althovvghe it may not be passed by in this
disputation. There wanted only this (it was very rarely used) and that
throwghe the printers fault: considering that withowt yt there is no sense /
nor knot with that before or after. Therefore if there had been any love of the
trwthe in him: meeting with such a gap / he would have sowght to have made yt
up in the later edition. His shift (Calu referrethe that to the patriarcke,
and not to the Archbishop / because there was small cause off exercising his
authority: is only said / and in deed contrary to thanthors words and
meaning. Words / for that giving that note off his disputation there, which is
both off the Archbishop / and Patriarch: yt must follow by all likelihoode /
that the note also is of them both. Against his meaning manifestly: for he
placing both their offices / in propounding matters unto the Synodes / which
for their hardness could not be ended of few: and gyuing them nothing to do
more then their fellows / but that: it must follow that the oftenest Synodes
wherein the archbishop was president / being rare / and but twice a year: his
office also was off very rare use. Whereby appears that Caluins mind was to
show / that the archbishops and Patriarchs office / endured only but the time
off the Synod: which ended / he had no authority but in commen with other
bishops / until the next synod. So that althowgh they were not chosen at
every action: yet Caluins judgment stands / that both those offices were but
off rare use.

The D. only trifleth in Hemingius. For we affirm degrees Diuis 72. page 419.
off ministry off the word / grant also that there were Patriarchs / but
deny them to have been immediately after the Apostles: which Hemingius does not
(as he untruly says) affirm. That that church abolishing the Patriarch and
Archbishop kept the distinction between the bishop / an other ministers off the
word / which the church browght in / is confessed: but that it owght not so to
be is before declared: althowgh the bishops there in respect off the height off
ours / are but dwarfes. His answer to that Hemingius says / that S. Luke 22.
puts a difference between the office off a Magistrate, and ministers, and
that dominion is altogether taken away from these: is very fond. His reason
out off the Hebr. is before answered: so that his unfaithful dealing in
Hemingius remains. If there be no circunstance in M Fox alleged Diuis. 73.
page 422.
by the D. which give further answer: I stand to that before made / and refer
it to the readers judgment: especially seeing to that alleged / where M. Fox
flatly condemns the degrees off primates, metropolitanes, and archbishops as
ambicious, the D. can not answer. In saying he went about to corrupt him
Master Fox. p. 96
with his praise, I do M. Fox no injury: yt being no fault to be assaulted /
but to be overcome, Whether I do the D. any let the reader judge.

Articles against the D.

is manifest. his shift wherewith he would accord him self with the bishop: is
is before bewraied. That the taking away off the Apostels / Prophets / and
Evangelists / hinders In Tra. 3. page 229.
not the perfect number off preaching ministers has been declared: beside that
yt is gross to say that the division is not perfect because certain parts of
it are not now extant: as if the law of dividing extended not it self to
things both past / and to come. He that parts the church into that before:
and under the Gospel: does he therefore make an evil particion / because there
is now no church before the Gospel / that is / under or before the law? Here
the D. leaves Diuis. 3. Page 424.
the bishop to his own defense / towching that he affirmed a bishop not
contained in the place to the Ephesians. The division there being given (as has
beue said) off those ministers only which with government handle the
word: both here / and in the fifth division the D. does but trifle in the
examples off the elder and deacon: seeing we hold / and will (God willing)
show them not to have to do with the word. Where hereuppon he would bring in
his archbishop, and archdeacon: yt is but repetition off that in di. 18. 19.
page 309. etc.
before / where he has answer. If there be a preaching elder, not contained
under a Pastor: seeing he makes a Pastor. and Doctor all one (onles he fly to
his fancy off Apostles / etc.) there is by his saying a preaching ministry
/ not tawght in the scripture. If there be / let him show it.

Where I gave the Catechizing unto the Pastor: I will have it meant where there
is no Doctor: otherwise I have in the second Diuis. 4. page 425.
edition amended that / assigning yt as more proper to the D. So that the
Doctor being instituted to the Ephesians. he whom they called Catechist / which
tawght the grounds off religion / is likewise: albeit S. Pa. calls al manner
of preaching Cathechising. Gal. 6. 6.
That public reading in the church is as solemn a matter as Catechizing the
youth, is a piece off the former frenzy (reading is as good as preaching)
already confuted. That a reader has been counted necessary is said withowt
proof: and if it were / it was falsely counted: there being no necessary
ministry not specified in the scripture. And when they were first /
notwithstanding them / the church ministry was (as has been showed) divided
into bishops / elders / and deacons: so that they came not then so much as into
account of the ministries. If they be convenient at any time: that there is
scripture to warrant them / even as the Sexten that kept the church door key
has been In the 1. Tract.
showed. That the archbishops, archdeacons, and our bishops have no succor by
this / being supposed the principalest ministeries / and therefore such as owght
to have been commanded: has been likewise disputed / where these colewortes
are answered. In this Tract. c. 1.
That the Deaconship as I take yt is no government, but a simple service, is
idly alleged / contrary to nothing here set down. Yt may seem against that
alleged before / where I comprehend it under the ministers which govern
only: which I did not to set it in 36. din. page 816.
in the same kind off government with the elders / but for that yt ordering
the church money / and ouerseing the poor / might in a general signification
be so called.

If the D. can show one lettre / that I ever wrote or spoke / that the place to
the Ephesians. contains all things necessary for the church: Diuis. 6. page 426.
then this that he writes may have place. If not: then he is unworthy to
receive answer / seeing he has been given to understand / how far we extend
that place. Therefore whether there were Public churches, Pulpits, Schools,
universities in Christian congregations, pertains not to the question /
althowgh it has partly / and might further be showed: only I give the reader
warning that Judge. ^. off those said to handle the pen, whilst I gave to much
credit to translations / was not so fitly alleged / to prove universities. The
three next diuis. are idle repetitions / before answered. Where I showed that
one high priest was ordained over the Jews, only that he might represent
our S. Christ, chief off Diuis. 10. page 428.
the whole church: the D. answers / he was also for policy, and
government. His reason (our Savior Christ came not to take away
ecclesiastical policy) ^s vain: as thowgh there could be no ecclesiastical
policy / onles one minister were ruler over a whole nation. After he cites
Calvin in the same faith he is wont. For his words (no reason compels to
extend that to the whole world profitable in one nation) are only
understood off that government in Jury before our Sau. Christ's coming.
which is manifest in that he says / that example ovvght not to be follovved,
considering it was done in respect that the high priest was a Instit. lib. 4.
ca 6. s^. 2.
figure off our Savior Christ, and the priesthood being translated that right
is likewise. And after: that example off the priests government over the
whole nation / was but for a time. ibid. se. 3.


That the pressing off the example off the high priest amongst the Jews,
draws a Pope: I leave to be considered off that before written: especially
seeing the high priest was not only governor off the Jews / when they were
pa^ed in the land in 31. diu. page 380 Act. 2. 4.
off Canaan: but even then also when (as it is known) they were scattered
thorowgh out all nations in the world. For as S. Luke says it to have been /
immediately after the ascension off our Sau. Christ: so was it many years
before his coming into the world. So that he which will frame an Archbishop by
that example / establishes the Ecclesiastical charge off one / over those
which were scattered thorowghowt all the corners off the earth. It would be
also observed / how here the D plaieth on both hands. For when we reason
sometime only off the proportion off the law to the gospel / other sometime
off the perpetual law off God: we receive answer that we are Jewish ennemies
to the liberty of the church. But where there is any thing under the law /
coming within a furlong off his cawse: he gripeth it for gospellike / and which
owght to be followed. I see / that M. Nowel thincketh a Metro poltane may be
over a Christian province, as the high priest was over the Iwes: wherein / I can
be but sorry that all the Godly learned / are not off one mind. As for Hyperius,
he seems to reason upon a supposition: that if the example off the
government off the high priest under the law should be followed (which he
before denied): that then a man might conclude an Archbishop over a Province /
but not a Pope over the whole church. This to be his meaning I thinck the D.
him self will accord me: else let him tell me what to Hypperili. 3 meth Thed.
answer to him / that says: that yt is not red in the scripture / that ever
any off the Apostels / took unto him self authority or primacy over the other
Apostels / but that a most perfect equality is showed to have been in all: that
Christ did prescribe them equal offices in all things: that that manner of
dominion which was not in thappostles Hypperius 4 lib. de ratione stud. Theolog.
time owght not to have been admitted in the ages which followed. Likewise what
he will answer to him / which condemns as new found orders Archdeacons
Archelders and vicares. Whereof the 2. first have (as I haueshewed) better
testimony of their auncientie then the Archbishop: and are / if not off the
same birth / yet off the same kind that he.

Where I show the titles of chief off the Synagoge, of the Diuis. 11. page 429.
Sa^ctuarie, of the hovvs of god, to make directly against him, considering
that particular churches are now in steed off the^, and therefore there ovvght
to be such not in every Province or dioces but in every particular
congregation: the D. as amazed speaks he can not tell what. First / that the
Jews had particular Synagoges, as we particular congregations, and that I have
confessed that before. As if I had any where denied it: or had not even here in
effect affirmed it: or it helped him for answer / which is the ruin off his
cause. For their Synagoges being the same that our particular churches / in
every one off them being not one / but many princes: the urging off that
example / brings diverse chief governors / or archbishops in every particular
church. Then he says / one Christian commen wealth is but one church, which is
untrue. For first althowgh the church be in a Christian commen wealth: yet
nether is the commen wealth the church / nor the church the commen weaith as
shall appear. Besides / I have showed that the scripture (off whose manner off
speech the question is) uses not to call a Province / or dioces / a church:
but either the whole universal / or else a particular congregation. Thirdly if
it were so / yet the answer is insufficient. For if the name off the house off
God / were common as well to a church in a Province / as in a particular
congregation: yet what right has he to pull the ecclesiastical priesthood
more to his provincial / then to our particular church? He says / the
superiority amongst the priests: and Levites, is by the civil law of Moses.
Which declares him ravished off all judgment: it being manifest that they
were either Ceremonial / or Ecclesiastical laws / wherewith the Lord disposed
of the degrees of the ministry: whereof the Ceremonial being abolished / and
therefore the chieftie off one priest over all / we willingly retain the
ecclesiastical.

Where to that alleged off Princes off the families off Levites, I replied
that the Lord vvoulde by those titles as by lively pictures, imprint in the
Ivves understanding the chieftie off our S. Christ: he answers / that makes
nothing against their offices. Yes: for that those that would conclude thereof /
one chief / now amongst the ministers in a Province / are thereby put to
silence. Where he adds / so the estate off a Prince over a land should be
abolished: be is frivolous / considering that that government / has other
stays off the ordinance off God. Where that chieftie amongst the ministers /
has nothing but that it was ceremonial. And if my answer like him not he
shall have the bishops / as little for his advantage which says: The Prince of
the families does not signify In 4. Art. Diui. 31.
any governor, or one endued with power, but only the first and best man
off the company. He complains that the Bishop speaking off the name, I drive
it to the office. If he had been awake he should have perceived / that the same
reason I assigned why there was primacie in the ministry off the law / unmeet
for ours: serves also to show why they might have the title off Princes /
which ours may not. For being the counseil of God / in that superiority to
peint forth the chieftie off our Savior Christ: it was most convenient that
that should be also written in the names.

Where I showed the distribution off the Levites offices, Diuis. 12. Page 430.
not made off David, but by express commandment off God: he says the Bishop
has answered, that such negative arguments are but weak. So he brings him
in answering this reason after his in tract. 1. di. 1. p. 77
death: for in his life it was not propounded. Howbeit I have showed how the
argument holds: and that the D. shift / is Hardinges against the bishop /
confuted also by the bishop. Nether did the bishop condemn here simply
negative reasons / but that negative which supposed there owght to be no name
of archbishop / because there was none under the law: which he might worthily.
For I showed that we mean nothing less / then to conclude that / of the
precise government off the church under the law. Nether is mine an argument
off one example but of comparison. For if David a figure off our S. Christ / a
man after Gods own heart / a Prophet / would not meddle with altering any thing
in the ministries / withowt Gods word: what man is he that shall dare do yt /
withowt the same warrant? By the Printers small oversight / in putting 1. for
2. the D. has stumbled upon a notable, place that Iosaphat appointed Levites,
etc. for deciding the Lords causes not only in Jerusalem, but for the whole
country, and made Amaries the priest chief over them: yet no commandment red
of, so to do. Which is vntrw. For Iosaphat did nothing but commanded off the
Lord by Deuteronomy. 17 8. etc.
Moses; that there be in Jerusalem an Ecclesiastical Senate whereof the high
priest should be chief unto which they should resort in difficult cases / not
able to be voided at home. For otherwise 2. Chro. 19: 5.
there was a Senate erected by Iosaphat in every strong city off Jury.

Diui. 13. Page 430.
The Jews church vvanted nothing to that perfection, vvherin the Lord would
have it then, and many things were undecided by the express word off God:
be friends / and do well agree. For both the perfection of yt then / as ours
now / stands: if things co^sta^t defined upon / there be also general rules
left in his word / whereby things variable by circumstances / may be compassed.
Diui. 14. page 431.
In the next reason / for causes there assigned / I will proceed no further /
but leave it only to the readers judgment: Diuis. 15. page 432.
likewise whether I have showed / that there were universities amongst Gods
people / before our S. Christ's time: and whether the D. if he had wherewithal
/ would not contrary it. That Schools are civil in heathenish commen
wealths, and Ecclesiastical in Christian: is poor divinity. for so a
Schoolmaster teaching Tere^ce / or Professor reading Aristotle is become an
Ecclesiastical officer: which has nether ecclesiastical election / not
ordinacio^ / and is often chosen only of him that founded the School. Yea
every one that reaches to play on instruments / whereby me^ may be apter to
sing the lords praises: is one off the D. Eeclesiasticall officers. His reason
(schools are like the first nources of the true knowledge off God) is not
good. For beside that the Fathers house is the first nource / not the school:
by this reason the Father off the howshold that nourtereth his sons / yea the
mother that brings up her dawghters in the fear off God / should be
ecclesiastical officers: which are only oeconomicall / or house governors.
Diui. 16. page 432. in Tract: 3. cap. 3.
That bishops can not come in place off thapostles / seeing they were together
with the Apostles: is unanswered. That the D. alleges off Apostles being
bishops: is b before answered / althowgh it be nothing to purpose. for to have
confuted the reply / he should have showed that all bishops are Apostles:
where his places be / to prove Apostles bishops. For it follows not if all
Apostles were bishops / that all bishops should be Apostles.

Where I show that Archbishops could not come in place off Apostles, if they
were (as Erasmus supposes) in their time; Diuis. 17. 433.
because they should so prevent the time, not waiting for the Apostels death:
he answers / where the apostels could not be them selves, there they
appointed other: which is fond. For how follows / it / that because they
appointed others where they could not be them selves / therefore they appointed
archbishops? As if they might not appoint Evangelists: or in every particular
church a Bishop. Off Bishops appointed by the Apostles / to conclude Archbis I
have in 10. d. page 304.
showed how sikly it is: likewise how that bishops being the Apostles in 3.
di-pag. 231.
successors / is to be understood. Diui. 18. page 433.
Against my reasons / that there is more liberty in instituting things in the
commen wealth: here is nothing but bare denials. In answering generally off
all offices in the commen wealth / a man not utterly forsaken off his judgment
/ must needs know that I had answered the example off Saul. Diui. 19. page
434.
The answer to Chrysostom, is made in di. 55. page 339. and 66. 413
before. Where I show that Titus presidentship in ordination off bishops,
implies not perpetual government, if it did, yet not to help the
archbishop. yt is the D. part to show / that judgment and government be all
one, seeing he imagines it a staff off his cawse. But the reader may see /
that allthowgh the D. keep open shop still: yet his wares are uttered long
sythens. For I beseech you in this defense off the bishops answer / besides his
own colewortes / and bare repeticion off the Bishops reasons / with some yeas
/ and naes: what has he worthy the invention of the meanest? To the next
diuis. Further then I have I will not answer: the next also I leave to the
readers judgment.

THe Council off Antioch / repeted here with the commentary is answered. Where
I show no need with us of archbishops, CAP. V. Diuis. 2. page 436.
considering that the cause why they were ordained (to call Synodes and
propou^d the cavvses to be handled in the^) is ceased with us* the D. in
proving that Emperors called general Counsels, shoots fair / but comes
nothing nere the mark. For althowgh some provincial Counsels were called by
the Emperor: yet yt is manifest both by the Counsel of Nice and by this I
alleged / Cap 5. Can. 20.
(that decreed there should be 2. provincial Councels every year / wherein the
Metropolitan should give warning to the rest / that the bishops might not
hold a counsel withowt his knowledge) that the Metropolitan with the bishops
advise / might hold a Provincial Council. It was done I grant / by consent
/ and sometime by express confirmacion off the Godly Princes: as in other
things perteining to the ministry their authority assisted / when men refused
to come to the bishops / who were not able to compel them: but the order off
it was with the Bishops. This althowgh it were not in the 9. canon, yet when
the D. knew it was in that council (as appears by his precise denying off it
to be in that canon, where otherwise he would have said in that Council): it
appears that he uses less synceritie in these holy matters / then the
Heathen ^n their profane. For Alexander counseilled Plutarch: in his life
(...).
to set upon Darius in the night / answered that he would not steal the
victory: but the D. concealeth from his reader / even that which he knew my
answer must needs discover.

Where he says / our metropolitan calls Synodes, althowgh not provincial,
and propounds the matters: first is nothing to the purpose. for calling only
diocesan Synodes / he does nothing which a simple bishop may not as well as he*
and therefore no cause why / there should be an archbishop in this respect.
Secondly / all know that those Synodes he speaks off / are houlden for the
most pate by deputies at his appointement. So / that which the D. utterly
condemns in the Discipline we propounde / touching the choosing off a
president every Synod / is done here / and that at the plrasure off one man /
not by consent off the mynisters: yea by appointement off one for the most
part no Ecclesiastical person / in matters perteining to the ministry.
Thirdly / I would know by what right / the archbishop may call his diocesan
Synodes* if by Ecclesiastical / then why not also the Provincial?
considering that they are of one kind / either both Ecclesiastical / or both
cyuill. If he do yt by civil authority: why does he not as well wait for the
magistrates commandment in one / as in the other? He says / the archishops
office consisting in sundry other things besides calling Synodes, propounding
matters, ouerseing the limits: owght not to cease althowgh he do none off
these. Yt being manifest that these were the chief cawses / under pretense
wheroff he was browght in / and especially to thend that controversies / and
contentions amongst the mynistrie / by Synodes called / and ordered by him /
might he ended: yt must follow that if we may spare him for these / we may
easily be with out him for the rest: and so this is not for the amendment /
but for the overthrow off his surisoiction. Because we agree in the matter /
and I have before showed that Tract. 4. Diuis. 2. page 237.
the metropolitanes were appointed to ouersee that none passed his bounds: I
omit the injury he does in supposing that I send him to the ninth Canon for
that matter / when as the word there by all indifferency / owght rather to be
referred to the council in the text / then to the canon in the margent.

Where I say that this oversight off limits / may be withowt an archbishop: he
says / yt may be best by him: whereoff let the reader upon the former
allegations off both Sides / judge. where he affirms yt no good argument
against the archbishop, that he does not keep the old Canons out off use with
us: seeing our archbishop houldeth off those in times past / and has for his
chiefest defense that there where archbishops in times paste: all see / if
there be not the same causes off them now that were then / how at the least
this hold is thrown down. Where I show that our archbishop in giving
licenses to preach in a dousen dioceses at the least breaks the same order
for the keeping vvheroff he was ordained: he answers / yt is profitable.
Where beside the untruth Tractat. 3. and 4.
before showed / he condemns that order off the Council off Constantinople /
that Soc. 5. li ^^ 8.
decreed against that wandering: and overthrows one off the cawses wheruppon
the metropolitans office stands. Diuis. 3. ^37.
That / part off the difference of the metropolitan from other bishops, rose
off the commodity off the city, and for that yt was honored with the
Emperors court: is manifest. by the increase and decrease / lifting up and
throwing down off the authority off the Patriarch all seats. That the
Emperor might make the metropolitan seat which he would, I well understood,
seeing I set it down Diui 20. page 3^2.
before: but the question to / where yt is meetest the Archbishop should be /
if there must be one. And my reason was / forsomuche as the place most fyttest
/ has well and happily wanted him: therefore our church may be well without
him. His trifling in the two translations / argues that to fill up / he cares
not if his reader peele strawes: for nothing ^ether off them / is against that
I setdowne.

The cauil against my order / becawse I come from the council of Antioche back
to Cyprian: is too simple. For yt is not (as his) for one Diuis 4. page 438.
matter / but for diverse; beside that / I reprehended him for that yt skilleth
much to observe the order off times / when question was off the time / and
antiquity of tharchbishop / Whether Cyprians words do flatly forbid any one
bishop to have authority over an other / much les over all: I leave yt be
judged off that 3. ca. off this tra.
before. 2. c. 2. tr.
likewise how honest an exception yt is against this sentence / that yt was
spoken in a Council where an error was decreed: also in 2 ca off this treatise.
what sense I called Cyprian metropolitan: further how vntrwe yt is that 3. ca.
off this treatise.
he which denies the authority of one bishop over an other, exempteth the
ministers either from cyuill, or ecclesiastical subjection, or punishment.
Lastly / what a 2. Tract. 6. cap.
cauil yt is / that when the correction of the disorders in the ministry is
given to the cyuill magistrate, the prince thereby is ouercharged. Now if the
reader find upon the discourse before / that the church well governed in
Cyprians time / had no archbishop nor metrapolitane that had authority over
others / when there was most need / considering there was then no christian
bishops: Then yt is manifest / that there is now les cawse / when we have a
Christian magistrate: which alleged here by me / the D. him self (althowgh he
had good will to bite at) durst not come near.

His cavil that I alleged this canon, falsely attributed unto the Diuis. 5.
page 439.
Apostels, is answered: beside that I 2. Tract.
show that yt being falsely assigned to them / is notwithstanding the true
canon off the Council off Antioche. The Canon is as I have alleged / nothing
nether added nor diminished, which might disadua^tage the D. cause any ^ote.
whether the bishop according to that canon / may do that which apperteineth
unto his own parish without the archbishop: whether the archishop takes
matters out off their hands / concludes them not making the bishops prime /
contrary to the tenure off that canon (which the D. denies). I leave to the
readers judgment / his especially which has seen the merchandise / and
trafique off his courts. And it may partly appear by the book off the 7^.
archbishops / where Canterbury is made the head off all our churches, all
bishops sworn to canonical obedience off that archbishop and defense off all
Privileges and liberties of that seat* Where the bishop off London is his
deane to call synodes, to publishe his decrees, to make return off
thexecution: Winchester his Chauncelour, Lincoln his vice chancelour,
Salisburie his chanter, Worcester his chaplain, Rochester his cross bearer
when that bagage was. Where his authority is said to have no certain bounds
but almost as him self lists with other such archbishoplicke / and
vnministerlike loftines / reckened / and earnestly avouched / and yet
notwithstanding (as he says) sparingly touched: to thend belike that it might
have an easyer defense. And if the lord bishops are his vassa^e^ the poor
ministers what place shall they have?

His repetitions I will not touch. The authority out off the Diuis. 6. page 440
counterfaicte Higinus, as I noted him / (that the metropolitan should condemn
no bishop before the matter heard, and discussed by the bishops of the
Province) makes for us more then if yt had been out off the true Higinus:
considering that the archbishop in the counterfaicte Higinus time / being
growe^ much our of fashion / was yet girded in les room then ours. The like
87. cap.
restreincte off his authority was in the Africane Council. How fond the D.
answer is / that our archbishop puts none out withowt due proof, is

Diuis. 7. page 440.
Where missing the number off the Canon / I alleged out off the Council off
Antioch / that the metropolitan had not so much as the casting voice, when the
bishops were equally divided: he answers / there is no mention off equality
off voices, as thowgh he were ignorant / that matters in Counsels / passed by
the more part off voices. For So Much therefore as the Council upon the
division off the bishops judgments / wills that other should be called: yt
is to be esteemed that that was / because the bishops were equally parted. Where
he says / thereby a metropolitan had authority over more provinces then one, yt
follows not. For beside that the cano^ is of all metropolitans / so that
whatsoever any off them might do in an others precinct / that the other might
do in his: by this accounte the elders / yea the Deacons had authority over
the bishops: considering that they accused / might call other Council. 3.

bishops the^ their own. Where he saieh / thautoritie of our metropolita^ and
bishops, is nothing increased but decreased, for so much as nether he nor all the
bishops can deprive a bishop withowt the consent of the Prince, yt is not to
purpose / seeing all the bishops in the world may not / nor ever could off right
remove a bishop by force / if the Prince would keep him in. Our question is of
the ecclesiastical sentence of deposicion. And if he mean that a bishop
heretic / schismatike / or corrupt in manners / may not be proceeded against
by an ecclesiastical sentence off deposition / yea off excommunication (if the
case require) onles the Prince will consent: beside that his endeavor off /
flattery is to manifest: his meaning is to cut out the archbishop so / that he
shall do nether more nor les then will agree with his ease / and whereby he may
shifte the Cross from his shoulders. For all know that Christian princes may
be / and sometimes are drawn to favor those / whose pastoral government
can not be but harmefull unto the church: in which case the Ecclesiastical
censures owght not to sleep / to thend that allthowghe he can not be removed:
yet the church after he be descried / and condemned for such as he is / may
fly from him. That the bishop may excommunicate an elder, belongs to an
other tractate: that he may depose an elder, is vntrw: and has appeared in
that the council off Carthage decreed / that an elder accused by 3. Conc. cap.
8.
his bishop, might call 6. other bishops, and the deacon three: and likewise may
by an other / which decreed that being condemned Council. Sard. c. 17
off his bishop either by right or wrong, he might appeal unto other bishops.
Beside that / I have showed that he might hear no cause withowt his clergy:
therefore those condemnations by the bishop / must be understood if he be duly
/ and according to the order prescribed condemned. He abuses also his reader /
in that he would prove the bishops authority greater / because it was forbidden
to those put out by him, to go to the Emperor. Considering that the same
canon gives them remedy against the bishop in a greater assembly: yea even
against a whole Synod in a more general then it.

Whether the 4. First principal differences / between the bishops in times

off that has been alleged. Likewise off the fifth / upon that which has and

That alleged out off the Council of Hispalis / touching that the elder

observed in the Africane churches in Possido. in vita August.
Augustines time. And that yt endured until the year off the Lord 659. when
there were ^rosse corruptions, tends to further condemnation off our Bishops
/ further out of fashion in that behalf / then those degenerat ones. and if
this Council be not to be alleged for the corruptions, then how comes yt /
that Volufianus in the year ^65 / a bishop off a corrupter estate / (whose
mass is grosser / then that off this Council) is made so godly a man? yt is
well known / that later Councels then this / and therefore (for the most part)
corrupter: are cited off the godly learned / as testimonial traces of the
Syncerity in purer times. That the elder by this canon, willed off the bishop
might preach in his presence, is vntrw: only yt is said / that with the
bishops commandment he might give absolution to the penitent / which was then
(as now with us) an other thing from preaching. That there has been no time
wherein there have been more preaching bishops, then now with us: onles all be
preachers / is vntrw. seeing an unpreaching bishop was wont (as M. Call. proves
Instit. 4. l. ca. 4. 3 se.
(to be a mo^ster / and cried out on in very corrupt times. If our bishops be
compared with the Popish in this poincte: they may be thowght dutiful. but
diverse compared with bishops off ancient time / may well be accounted domb.
Considering their often preaching / the traces wheroff are to be seen diversely:
namely in the Council off Ments / before by me alleged. Whereunto serves M.
Hoopers saying / that the church at the beginning upon the eight co^*maund.

bishops horses be a brideling.

If the rare preaching off some / be but Men's fault and not the offices: then
our Archbishops whether off synistre favor or as gyltie them selves / play
their parts evil. Considering that diverse fault openly in this even the chief
point off their office / and have had for any thing I have heard / good
peniworthes off yt. Where still appears how dangerous yt is to the church /
to lay such weight off the churches welfare in one man. In the next diuis. let
the reader judge how vntrw yt is / that there were bishops off 100. churches in
the Apostels times. the two next are answered. Whether these devised degrees /
were in the praef. to the 3. ca. of this tr.

namely off that in M. upon Phil. ca. 1.

the holy doctrine of the Son off God, confirmed in the Nycene Conncell: I have

showed That I do confess here the kind of government by elders to have
ceased, or that one Bishop was over a whole diocese, before the council off
Nice: is utterly untrue. The next let the reader likewise judge.

Where he says I repeat Basile the poor metropolitan, and Theodoret the pore
bishop for want off others, let him know that this was the estate of the most
apparent bishops at the Nicene council / whom the emperor made so much off
touching their apparel vile, vile to look to: of Athana. Apol. 2.

have been rich: yt is true they with their competent houshoulde / owght to be
honestly provided for / lest the care over the flock should be drawn to
things off this life. I grant also that they may be rich: but I deny that
they owghte to grow rich by the ministry. yt owght to suffice them as 1.

the Apostle says to live off the gospel, not Ier. upon Titus. Ier ad Oceanum.
to riot, not to have a^ lordly estate, not to be rich by yt: as yt is both
expounded and confirmed off Ierom.

Di. 16. 17 page 446.
Where I showed out off the ancient 4. carth. 14. 15. ca. Tyron c. 5
Counsels / that the bishops should have a little house nere the church, their
household stuf after the common sort, table, and diet poor, not give them
selves to feasting, get their estimacion by good conversation: he answers one
of the councels decreed that the clerckes should get their living by some
occupatio^, not meet for our days But it decreed not that the bishops / or
ministers of the word should do so / but only Clerks: in which number were
readers / dorekepers / acolouthes / exercistes and other such / which having
light charges in the church / were fashioned in the Bishops house to the
ministry. These having a great part off their living (as shall appear) off
that appointed for the bishops house: were commanded to get the rest with
their hands at such times / as were nether hinderance unto their office / nor
their further advancement in learning: as it is to be seen in those Canons.
Now if they afters dinners and suppers or others times wherein they nether
executed office nor were so fyt to study / occupied them selves in some art /
werby they gained part off their living / and those Clerckships were needful:
I see no great inconvenience in that order. At the lest in the time and
country in which the D. would lurk: there is no difference. If there had been
any material: he owght to have showed yt. for what cause can he assign why our
bishops should live more lordly then those? both living in the peace and wealth
off the church / and under Christian magistrates. They sowing also more
liberally then ours / why should they reap more scantly? especially seeing
diverse off their Countries were better hable to fournishe them off that riot
then ours is.

Where also he would make men believe / that they are come to this excess by
Christian princes liberality, the trewthe is otherwise. For they to whom they
succeeded in this princely estat: came to this wealth by church robbery. Saying
yt is easy to prove / by diverse as well gifts off the Emperors an others / as
by statutes and prerogatives (made in favor off the church): that yt was very
rich in time off those bishops. Therefore that he alleges otherwhere for the
continuance off these large revenues to one bishop, lest Page 471*
our bishops (as some in Augustins time) should take occasion of pillag^^ is
absurd. Yt is high time that he were (to speak no grievous lier) vnbishoped:
which will take occasion off pillage / having to live on a hundredth pound a
year. And as yt is obscrued that the In the book entitled the Discipline,
etc.
church goods were committed unto the bishops trust / to this end that he
taking so much as would honestly maintain him / should bestow the rest upon
diverse other church necessities: so the same appears / in that it was 4.
conc. Cart. c. 32 Sozom. lib. 3. c. 9. Athanas. 2. Apol.
ordained / that the bishop should use the church goods as things given to
him to keep, and not as his own. Also by the examples off Athanasius and
Augustine: where off for the first falsely accused of the turning away off the
corn given to the church unto his own use: was answered by the Council
assembled at the Alexandria / that he had nothing but the travail in disposing
off yt. The August. Epist. ^0.
other showing how the Donatists had not only their own when they returned
unto the church / but also off the church goods: adds that the church goods
were both theirs and his, seeing he was poor as well they. But if (says he)
we possess privately as muthe as may suffice us, then the church goods are
none of ours, but the poores: off which goods we have the ordering, and do
not challenge them as proper unto us, which is a damnable abuse,

Further the bishops in times paste for that portion allowed unto them / kept
not only them selves and their own houshoulde: but nourished in their houses
/ and at their tables / the foorsaid Clerks: as appears in Possido. invit.
Au.
Augustines example / with whom they were at one table / in one house / and off
the same charges. I leave the testimony of the Roma. cap* 3.
Council: that (of the churches goods divided into 4. parts) gives one of
them unto the bishop and his brethern. Which althowgh yt be corrupt / and not
of the auncientie pretend: diet in a case not in question / and which has
confirmacion off the former times / I might a great deal better use then the
D. has done his counterfaictes. The testimony off M. upon the eight command.
Hooper shall suffice: who says that the bishops household was the schole or
treasurehouse off good ministers, to serve the word off God, and
administration off Sacraments. Thus appears that the difference between our
bishops / and them in times past / is not as is pretended / in that the
churches were then poor, and now rich: but partly in that the goods which
served before for diverse necessary Uses off the church / serve now to the
lording and unnecessary statelines off one. Partly also in that those bishops
having a college off scholars in their howses / which were the seed and store
off the ministry / nourrished them at the same trencher with them: ours (the
Clerks or scholars being thrust out) devour al them selves.

And that it is not as (he says) in the circumstance of time and country,
Even as he has heard godly men in in times paste / forbidding this stately
pomp and wealth off bishops in other ages: so he might have red yt forbidden
of those of our age. Call. inst. 4. lib ca. ^. sect. 17.
M. Calvin writes thus: how the bishops in times paste rioted not in
superfluous wealth: that one voice of the Synod off Aquileia. Where Ambrose
was president (the poverty of the lords mynisters is glorious) does
sufficiently declare. Verily the bishops had then riches, vvhervvith they might
have made the church to have a Sightly port: if they had thovvght that that
had been their trvve ornament. But when they knevve that nothing is more
contrary to the office of a pastor, then to shine and swell in dayintie fare,
costly apparel, many servants, princely palaces: they followed and embraced
humility and modesty, yea poverty yt self, which Christ consecrated
amongeste his ministers. And after: was yt meet that they should follow the
magnificence off Princes in the number off waiting men, bravery of houses,
costlines of fare and apparel: whose life ovvght to have been a singular
example off frugalitie, modesty, continency and humility? how much did
this abhor from their office: whom the eternal decre off God forbids to
desire fylthy lucre, and to be content with a simple kind off living:
alleging to that purpose the canons off the Carthage Council / which I have
set down: and there to calling the bishops of these times / which
notwithstanding the D. says were for those times.

He might also have red off the godly learned with us: which condemn yt flatly
/ in our both country / and age. For the knowledge wheroff: let the reader
resort unto the seventh Article off Master M. Fox in the book off M. Tindal,
etc.
Barnes. Likewise to that Upon the 8. command.
Master Hooper says that the fourth part of the bishoprike were enovvgh for
the bishop: and that the magistrates which suffer such abuse off those goods
be culpable off the fault. Further / to that an M. Elm.
other calls them to the tenth part off their bishopric: when he bids
them come down from their thovvsandes, and take the^ to their hundredes. And
if it be so as M. Hooper says: yt is so far from that this abundance is
commodious unto the common wealth, and honor to Prince (as he 473.
other where says) that it draws the wrath of God upon the Prince / and
consequently upon the common wealth. Beside that / the D. can show no one
point wherein yt is honorable to the Prince: but only barely affirms yt. And
yt is manifest that yt being incommodious unto the church: yt must needs be
damagable unto the state: the good and Godly wealth wheroff / is the Princes
honor.

Where he says riches, fair houses, and costly furniture be no hindrances to
a godly man, to do his dewtie: oneles he say a bishop / and by reason / off
his ministry / he speaks not to purpose. if so: then yt is before confuted /
and more at large purswed off the forsaide book off discipline. That Hypocrisy
and pride, lies hyd under the name off poverty, is from the matter / not
only because the poverty which the Council speaks of / is none such / that
had not sufficient and honest maintenance (as may appear in Possid. in vit.
August.
Augustines manner off living / which was at the making off the Carthage
Canons): but also because they spoke not off a pretended poverty / but off
that which (meet for the estate off a bishop) should be no further in show /
then in deed. Althowgh yt were better for the church / that this pride lay
hid: then to have so many witnesses off yt / in their howses hanged. Their
tables and cupbordes spread / their garments died with it / and their manner
off life both at home and abroad proclaiming yt. He says also that bishops
were wealthy then: becawse feasting was forbidden them. In deed they were
welthy stewardes / but poor lords: great Baylifes / but small proprietaries
This he might well have gathered / which is trw: that even then / there were
which (not content with an honest meintenance) aspired to further magnifice^ce
in their howses / household stuf / and fare / then was sitting for bishops: and
that under color off getting estimacion to their office. which appears both
in the for said canons made for that purpose: and in Ad Nepotianu^.
Jerome.

Where he says that the doctrine off the Gospel is much more purely
professed by ours, then it was by the oulde Bishops: and for proof alleges
here these Counsels / and g otherwhere / that opa. 472.
almost all the most ancient fathers, yea the most off the auncientest
bishops believed an abode upon earth a thousand years after the rising again:
that almost all the Greek both bishops and writers and the most part off
the Latins, were spotte with free will, merits, invocation off Saints, etc.
Where first let yt be observed / how rowgh (as in other places before) be is
with the old writers / when it serves for his purpose: and what equity there
is in this man which cries out / if I do but tread as yt where off one off
their heels / when he at one stroke almost all / at once / by condemning them
off error in the matter off justification (the foundation off religion) and off
free will (which he h says is likewise) stricketh them deadly in the head.
Secondly ^ page 83.
observe / that he does yt untruely. For beside that he is not hable to show
the most part off both Greek and Latin most ancient writers after Papias,
infected with that error off a 1000. years: to say that the most part off
the most ancient bishops were so / is a notable slander. And seeing that the
writers speak doubtfuly of merits / invocation off Saints / and free will /
sometime for / and sometime against them: likewise seeing that diverse things
under there names are none off theires / but heritiks / which partly corrupted
their books / partly set forth other under their credit: they deserved to be
somewhat more gently handled. And yet these are they forsothe / whose authority
is the best argument in divinity: page 200.
and from which althowgh we appeal to the scriptures / and in appealing cry
in the D. ears / yet he is deaf / and will not hear. But I think from
henceforth we shall hear no more off Tertullian says yt etc. onles reason be
annexed / and that out off the word off God.

Thirdly yt is to be observed / how unequally the comparison is made. for in
steed that he should have compared the corruptions off the bishops off one
province / with the corruptions off ours: to make our bishops Son to shine /
he matcheth yt with the cioudes off errors / assembled out off all the world /
and that by the space off 450. years / as is to be seen. To this cosideration
page 473.
does pertein / the erors off some before noted / the insincere preaching of
some others / partly by allegories / wherein they are as fond as the fondest
off the aunciente: partly by vain pomp and ostentatio^ / that was not in them
/ which althowgh they were studied in all good letters / yet in their homilies
to the people / behaved them selves as if they had known nothing but Jesus
Christ. Lastly so many of them as shall be found to maintain all therrours in
this pack of the D. I dare will pronounce that they are deplier plo^ged in
error then any of those old bishops / which keeping the foundation erred in the
rest off the building wheroff (upon that alleged off both parts) let the
judgment be the readers. What their honesty off life is, which is another
point wherein he compares ours with the elder bishops / I will not further
Page 473
meddle: especially seeing that whether there life be good or bad can hardly be
hidden. Althowgh for any imperfections he shows that way in the fathers: he
might as well have made ours equal with thapostels them selves / amongst whom
there was contention as amongst the old bishops. That the 5. Canon of the 2.
Council of Conc. Ty ro^ 3 can 5.
Tyron he stombled one is against me, and my likes which leave our calling, is
from the purpose / and vntrw as has been showed. That my collector deceived me
in the council, because yt is nether the first nor second, is mere trifling:
seeing my allegacion is maintained / yff yt be (as yt is in deed) the third:
this fault being by all lykelihood some others then mine / Considering that I
found yt trwly noted in my paper book from whence I took yt. I may rather say
that his deceived him / and was herin somewhat to well skilled in Greek: which
for Hierapolis a City in Phrygia / wheroff Papias was bishop / told him that
he was of Jerusalem. page 473. Diuis. 18. page 447. Cart. c 34


Where I compared the council which decreed that no bishop sitting in any
place should suffer a mynister or elder to stand* with the behavior off our
bishops toward the ministers: he staggereth on this and that side. But his
drifte is that yt is the bishops right / that they should stand and he sit:
wherein he accuses the council off gyuing yt away from them. Then he will
have yt in their discretion, that yt may (belike) serve for a brake to break
proud stomachs. But what if the bishop being proud / the ministers be humble:
surely by this reason yt should be rather in their discretion / to make the
bishop sit or stand before the^: For they often beaten with poverty / learned
humility: which he throwgh sudden wealth / (if he had any before) may easily
forget. If there be such high minded ministers: yt is meet their pride be
otherwise corrected / then by this vncanonicall crowching both to blow up the
bishops heart in pride / and to draw the rest with their ministry into
con^^mpt: whilst both equal in office / and sometime superior in gifts /
they have harder intertainement off them / then many off the better sort off
Servants have at the hands off their masters. So that where they are by the
law off God / the bishops fellows: the poor ministers think them selves
well dealt with / if they may be admitted for compagnions off his servants: as
if my lord bishop only were Shepard over the people / and all the rest were
Swinardes. I omit that some of them are content that a Justice off peace / yea
off Quorum, (as I have heard) stand before them with their cappes in hand:
which how near yt is to dispising off powers / wheroff the Apostle speaks /
let all judged. Iud. 8. v.


To that alleged off the train off waiting men before and after, condemned
in all bishops in the person off Samosatenus Diuis 19. page 447. Eusebius. 7. li.
ca. 30.
he answers / he was condemned for having Soldiers, and for walking the
streets. which is frivolous. For there was no more likelihood off a captain
in him; then in our bishops / saving that where he was waited upon with spears
/ peradventure according to the serving men's fashion off the country: ours
are followed with swords and bucklers. He is generally there spoken against for
his pomp: as that he was like unto men in vvorldly dignity, and made him a
throne or pulpit like a Prince. And for his men / not only because they had
spears but because they were in great number. Now if this were damnable in a
bishop to be like a ptince or worldly potentate: yt is manifest that our
bishops for their train / are under the same condemnation. Gregory also
althowgh Ruffin. 1. lib. ca. 19. Athana. Apol. 2.
not in the same chap. off Ruffin / entered as well as George, and before him /
with a troop off men into the bishoprik off Alexandria / out off which
Athanasius was wrongfully put: and that is with other things reproched him /
althowgh they were lent by the governors. He says it appears by these
examples / that bishops had riches and authority: which is absurd / seeing him
self confesses / and the story makes mention / that they enjoyed this by
unjust means / and church robbery. I grant the bishop was steward off great
abundance / but not to his own use.

That every teacher in the church was called Rabbi: those Diuis. 20. page 448.
know / which have any skill in the tongue from whence it was taken. So that
what honor the D. can draw to the ministry by that word / grows no more to
the bishop then to all other teachers: and it contained a profession off
obedience, in respect off those that were tawght / not in respect of one
teacher toward an other. If the Evangelists had turned it Lord which I
corrected in the second edition) yet the degree off superiority signified by
this word Lord must be very small. Seeing yt was used by a women off honest Ioh.
20. 1^
estate / to one whom she supposed no other but a gardener. Where therefore he
would prove that the word Lord given to Athanasins by the Synod signifies some
high degree and authority / becawse the Emperor and his nobles were called
only Lords withowt other addition: he trifleth / seeing it is manifest by that
alleged / that with the^ being a common title almost to the basest sort of men
/ yt had no such honor shut in yt as he pretends / but was great or small /
according to the persons yt was applied unto. So that or ever that word will
help him / he must show that the bishops then were set in great owtward
dignity.

Where also he would make the reader believe / that the Synod called
Athanasius Lord off the priests of Alexandria: yt is but to abuse him: when
that word (as the greek) is given to any of mean estate / and is as much with
us as Sir. And not with us alone / but in diverse other countries / which
speak so to any of mean condition: yet the D. turns it always my Lord.
Whereby he lordeth those / which have no lordship to maintain them nor man to
wait upon them: yea (as I have showed) thus we shall have my Lord gardenkeper:
then which what can be more ridiculous. And that it was not the Councels
meaning / to make Athanasius Lord off the elders in Alexandria* appears
manifestly by that I have alleged off the elders off Alexandria: which call
him their fellovv minister withowt any other title. Wherein they should be too
unmannerly and undutiful / if he were (as it seems the D. would bear us in
hand) their Lord. Which dalying may yet better appear / in that Alexander
bishop off Alexandria writing to Athanasius / when he was but deacon / or elder
at the most: writes. To Athanasius Lord and beloved son^e: So that if Dominus
must needs be a Lord: then my Lord bishop must by the same reason that he
would be called Lord / call the elders or Deacons / Lords likewise. So there
shall be Lord Bishop / Lord Elder / Lord Deacon: which as it is ridiculous /
so it tuneth not with the bishops note off honor / which the D. fights for.
And this is also answer to my Lord Paulinus: beside that Lord is not referred
unto the pronoune yovvres, as if the council had said Athanasius was the
elders Lord. And if it were / yet if he will thereupon conclude / any
superiority of him above thelders off his church: he must by the same reason
say / that one simple bishop had superiority over an other / seeing Eusebius
bishop / calls Paulinus his fellow bishop his Lord: which is absurd and
condemned off him self.

Now I have showed him how bishopes were called most honorable Theod li. 5.
cap. 8.
Lords, he has gotten two or three places where are found titles to the same
effect: which is idle / seeing that was confessed. To my answer that Lord with
them was no other title, then might be given to a man off mean degree: he
says / most honorable Lord was only given to those in great authority, which
is only said / and may easily be confuted / in that Alexander bishop off
Alexandria the Metropolitan city / vvriting to all the church ministers / not
bishops only / called them most honorable fellovv Socr. li. ^. cap. 6.
ministers. That he says it was not grudged at then that bishops were called
by the same titles, that Princes: is very plain language / and needs no
commentary to show the meaning / saving that he durst not utter all. For if he
would have applied his place: he should have said / yt was not grudged at
then that bishops were called by more lofty titles then th Emperors: seeing
the title he presses for the bishops / is most precious Lords, and the
Emperor as he says was only called Lord.

That the house off salutations / was within the bounds off the Diuis. 21. page
449.
church appears not in Theodoret. His reason / because the houses perteining
to the bishopric were nere the church, is weak. For althowgh all howses
perteining to the bishoprik were near: yet there might be some near / not
perteining thereto. H^^beit if it were belonging to the church / in that word
there / is no such note off excellency / whereby yt deserves to be the porters
lodge of our bishops palaces. To that off the bishops bestovving the church
goods upon loitering serving men, which should be bestovved upon the
universities, and poor both ministers, and other: he says / and only says
that their number off serving men tends to the defense off the realm, honor
off the prince, and their own good education. off the princes honor: yt is
answered. strenght to the realm, they can not be: seeing the men should be /
althowghe they were not nourished by the bishop: especially seeing the bishops
house / is an unfit schole to train up to warfare. And if the former
necessities were helped / and yt thowght meet that the church goods should
serve the realm that way: all see that yt would rise to more profit / if some
were nourished off them / in profession off a Soldier / then that in waiting
upon the white Rochet they should rather become white liuered / then fashioned
/ for that service. Beside that the bishops countenance being so profitable as
yt is made / and placed a great part in this suite off men: it is manifest
that his pomp houlding diverse at home / which otherwise might be in the field
weakeneth rather then strenghneth the realm. For the education they get under
them: the corrupt religion of some / the want of Catechizing others ignorant
in the principles of religion / the leudnes of diverse / the idleness off the
most part / which is in the eyes of all give to plentiful a confutation off
that part. wherein let the reader observe / how unmeet they be to govern
dioceses / and Provinces / which have their proper houses so evil ordered:
especially seeing 1. Tim. 3 ^.
the Apostel will not trust him with one parish / which rules not his
own house well. And the trwth is / that the church mynistery is of that
trauaill and care / that yt will not suffer the bishops gifts (be they never
so great) to be spente in the houshoulding and masterlike charge off such a
number: which was no doubt one cause why both the scripture / and the old
Canons / shut out the bishops from this pomp.

Where he says / the universities, ministers, and poor may otherwise be
provided for: when that is browght to pas / and in such sort as a sufficient
number ^f learned men may be nourced up to fournish both the church off there
ministers / and common wealth off her magistrates / the overplus may (as M.
Upon the 8. command.
Hoopers counsel is) goo to maintenance off Soldiers, or other necessary
uses / advised off by the common wealth. That the canons browght against the
bishops pomp, reach to university colleges, forasmuch as there were none
such then, as we have now, is vntrwe: considering that with other universities
every bishops house was (as has been showed) a college off Students in
divinity: and yt is otherwise insufficient. For I reason not against their
pomp / because yt was not used in times paste, but because yt was forbidden.
And if he can show / the reuenews off Colleges forbidden by the Godly
councels: then yt had heue somewhat he says. Ad also that if the pomp and
riot off Colleges / werelike the bishops: yt were likewise worthy / to be
spoken against. Jerome / cited against the pomp of bishops receives answer /
that he spoke against the abuse and not thuse. Ieromes words be these: let

a foul shame, that before the gates off pore and crucified Christ, Who also
eat of other men's meat, the Consuls Sergeantes and Guard should wait: and
that the ruler off the Province, should dine better at thy house then in the
palace. But if thou pretend to do these things, to the end to beg for the
poor: the Secular judge will give more to a church man which kepethe
measure and is frugall, then to one which is rich: and reverence more thy
holiness, then thy riches, Or if the ruler be such, that he will not hearken
to the churchmen ctauing for the poores relief, but when he is amongst the
cupps: I will gladly want such a benefit: and beg off Christ instead off
the judge, who is better and sooner able to help then the judge. I omit that
he inueighethe against a church man / which poor before / becomes rich by
the church: and living very homely before / after uses delicate fare / with
other things to that end.

Whether this were one cause off the bishops stately pomp Diuis. 22. page 450.
that (certain noble and rich men rece^^ed to the mynistery, and living
somvvhat like their former estates) others assaied to be like unto them:
whether an other cause were for that it being Diuis. 23. 24. 25. page 451.
amongst the heathen priests before yt came into the church off the Christians

vvhilest other bishops were made somevvhat suitable unto her, which she could
not have done if (other bishops left in the simplicity vvherin God had
appointed them) she had been as an ovvle amongst the rest of the birds: I say
whether these three / are amongst the causes off bringing in the bishops pomp
into the church / I leave to the readers judgment. Considering that the D.
beside begging / and dissembling the matter / which I goo abowte to prove:
has nothing. That Christians might as well be thowght to have followed Maximinus
in building churches, as in sufficiently providing for the ministers: is to
simple / seeing we deny him not sufficient provision. But if he esteem nothing
sufficient, onles he be maintained as a lord: let him learn off S. Paul / what
is sufficient / and so he shall (I doubt not) fall from his 1000. to a 100. unto
these three 1. Tim. 6. 6. 8. upon 4. Ephesians.
causes off the bishoplike statelines I will here ad the fourth: worthy to be
observed. M. Bucer showing the incommodities which came / by that the bishops
were received to bear civil offices. says: after they began to occupy the
place off princes: they challenged also to them selves their pomp and bravery.
So let the reader judge how trw yt is that I said: that our archbishops,
bishops, etc. besides the names, have almost nothing commenvvith those of elder
times: and how if the old bishops were alive, they would not know one
annother. For that they would think ours princes, and ours vvoulde esteem
them as hedge pri^estes. What I allow, off the oulde Canons, and what I
disalow, althowgh Diuis. 26. page 452.

yt in this Tractate.

The first diuis. I o^^it. In the next / to that the Apostle called CAP. VI.

the Corint. to a mo^^rate estimacion of the ministers (mean betvveen contempt
and to much exalting them) upon occasion that the false Apostels were to much
lifted up: he says / yt was a partial affection to wards their teachers not
in respect off any title, which is frivolous, for if it be denied generally /
that they should not be so mounted: then the way is stopped against titles and
offices, and other means whatsoever / whereby that may grow. Beside that the D.
is afraied as appears by his answer to be browght unto a moderation and mean
between contempt and excessive estimacion. Where I show / that as the false
Apostels pomp in preaching, lifting them up above the faithful ministers,
caused the faithful ministers to be contemned: so the pomp of our bishops,
lifted up above the rest off the pastors, to be a ready way to bring their
mynisterie ovvt off credit: and that as that gave occasion to the Corinthes to
say, I houlde off such a teacher, etc. so this gives occasion to say, I vvil
believe my Lord Bishop or my lord Archbishop, whatsoever our parson say: for
they be wise men and learned: I say to all this beside wandering and unlikely
slanders there is not a word: seeing I trust / it appearethe to all / that we
give no occasion by any pomp that the people in magnifying off us should
condemn others.

The next division I leave to the reader. Where against the Diuis. 4. page 455.
D. slander off the Admonitions intent to take away princes, I showed that his
practice against us, is the same with the Pharisees against our Savior
Christ, which being rubbed for their ambition accused him as no friend off
Caesar. He answerethe that we are not Christ, which is ridiculous / that the
case is not like, whereof let the reader judge: seeing he is (as they were)
honor pricked. Whether our Archbishop dvvell as far asonder almost, from the
civil magistrate, as Rome and Jerusalem: let the reader judge off that
alleged. likewise what a co^ning stargaser the D. is / which saw in the star
off my forehead that the admonition intended the overthrow off the civil
magistrate. The next off the canon off Antioche Council, is answered, but
where I show that that Canon is not like to be justifiable considering that it
sovvght falsely, ^^edite off the name off the apostels: he answers not. Onles
this be his answer: that yt is the natural Canon off the apostels. And in
deed his words so sound / for thus he says. That canon off the Apostels is
repeated in this council: as diverse off the Nice be repeated off other
councels. Which how shamfully yt is spoken: may appear off that we have before
disputed off the antiquity off the metropolitan. How dangerously to the
overthrow off our faith / whilst we are borne in hand / that there be canons
of the Apostels not contained in the canonical scripture: all that have
judgment / may understand / and yt is in part Tract. 1.
before declared. I omit that yt is clean contrary to his doctrine off the
archbishop: whereby he makes him an officer / changeable at the will of the
Prince. For if that be thApostles Canon: there is no ministry in the hold
scripture / which has better evidence for an unchangeable perpetuity / then
yt.

That M. Bucer is wholly for us in this point: I refer the reader Diui. 6. page
457.
to that Diui. 15. page 367.
before written. The place alleged here would have made little for him: if he
had not kept his custom. For where Bucer speaks off obedience to be given
by the bishops to the metropolitan: he has left out these words after their
manner. By which conning / he may prove the Acthiopian afaire: man because he
has white teeth. For all see: that M. Bucer by these words / delaied the
authority off the metropolitanship. And if they were not plain enowgh: yet
others in the same place are. that the patriarchs were set over the
metropolitanes, as they upon the Ephesians.
over the bisho* but that nether, could do any thing save only admonish those
over vvho^ they were set: and if they obeyed not, to complain of them to the
synod. After he condemns / that the Patriarchs took unto them the ordination
off the bishops nigh them: and by means thereof, by little and little gat some
jurisdiction over those bishopes, and their churches. So appears / that if
there be any difference here (touching these offices) between us / and M.
Bucer: yt is only / that where we affirm yt good / that the presidentship
should be chosen at every meeting / as that which comes nearer the apostels
example / and more safe against Tyranny: M* Bucer may seem to make yt a
standing and continual office / set ^^ in one man. For as towching his
authority / wherein the chief poinct off the controversy lies: yt finds as
small grace with M: Bucer / as with us.

Whatsoever is here / is Diu. 42. page 390.
answered: saving the contrariety assigned Diuis. 7. page 458.
between this / an Apostle was above an Evangelist, and that there was chiefrie
even amongst the apostels / in that one labored more / and had more excellent
gifts then another: which how manifest an argument yt is that the archbishop
has robbed him off all sense let the reader judge. Saving also that he
signifies that the difference between the Apostels must be in authority not
in excellency off gifts or labors. Considering that there was amongst them
in those poinctes a most perfect equality. Which how absurd yt is may be
considered in that some had the gift off continency / which other some had
not / some travailed with their hands for their living / which other did not:
and in that S. Paul / is said expressly to have labored more then they all. To
the next beside bare affirmations 1. Cor. 15. 9.
and slanders often repeted: he answers nothing. To the ninth: I answer not.

That the greek word 2. Gal. 2. signifies for the most part Diuis. 10. page
461. (...).
to seem: can not be denied. Whether there be any necessity to change this
usual and ordinary signification in that place: I leave to the reader. Seeing
first the same word in that chapter / is twice so turned: where the same both
matter / and persons are spoken off. seeing also yt is confessed / by M. Beza
which corrected yt: that the apostle speaks not according to his own but
according to the sense off his adversaries. Thirdly / seeing the cause which
moved Erasmus and M. Beza to depart from that translation for that there is
nothing joined to declare, vvherin that seeming and appearance should be) is
not so urging. For S. Paul uses often such short / and cut speeches: which
are to be supplied by other places off his: as M. Beza him self shows in the
same chap. verse. 6. I omit the number off interpreters / which have followed the
oulde in this behalf. Howbeit I confess / that if I had known that I had in
this point to do with the Geneua / M. Bezas / and Erasmus translation / and
Budies authority: I would (for reverence off their learning) have use* an
easier word in dissenting. nether will I strive about yt / wit^ ^he D. yt
making little either off or on / to the matter in hand: seeing the reason
(alleged by the adm. and maintained by me) stands still against the
archbishop. For if Saint Paul / were in nothing inferior unto Saint Peter /
one of those chief there mentioned: and if the making of S. Peter / to have
authority over Saint Paul / be the overthrow of S. Paul's argument: then yt
follows / that thadm. aptly alleged that place against the archbishop.
Nether can it be alleged / to prove any degree of honor the in ministry, not
only because the price which the Galatheans had off those by suggestion off
the false Apostels / was excessive in that they preferred those three before S.
Paul: but also for that off men in the same degree and authority one may justly
be honored more then an other / in respect off gifts more excellent in him
then in the rest.

Where I showed / that our Sa. Christ's calling is auowed Diui. 11. page 462.
Heb. 5. 5. 6
just because yt was contained in scripture: he says the apostel only showed
by scripture that he intruded not him self but was called off God. Where the
testimonies put as causes off this that he did not glorify him self: must be
also cawses off his vocation / and that in such sort that if those and such
like testimonies had not been / his vocation could not have been justified.
where he says none can justify his calling if it were not lawful withowt
such a personal testimony as our Sau. Christ had: we press not all the
circumstances. There being no more in that kind off office / but he alone: the
testimony off it / must needs be personal. Yt shall be sufficient for him:
to show that the Archbishops have the same testimony off the word / which the
bishops or pastors. To the next I answer not: In the next / there is nothing
but bare affirmacions / answered Diu. 31. page 380. Diuis. 33. Page 381.

To that alleged that if all the church were in one Province, and one over
them all in travailing with an archbishop he should bring forth a pope: he
answers / that can not be, the church being scattered throwghout the world.
Which I grant / having respect unto Gods election / and calling hidden from
us: but that the church established in a visible and apparent from / may not
(which God fo^^id) be browght into one land / I hitherto hear no reason, he
says further / that the church after the ascension being in Jerusalem only,
if yt had had one bishop, should by my reason likewise have had a pope: which
is untrue. For we join with the pastor / (and that in equal authority of
government) thelders off the church: condemning al monarchical government in
the pastor. The rest is Diu 32 page 381. Diuis. 41. page 389.
a^swered. The next / is Diui. 33. pa. 381.

Accused for charging the adm. to have used the papists reasons, he says he
may well do yt: but reason he can show none. He denies that he would prove
one archbishop over a province by one king over a realm: yet beside he flatly
Diu. 41. page 389.
affirms that the form off government in the church must be according to
that of the common wealth, driven to the wall / yt is his common refuge / that
by the same reason we east away Archbishops, we may likewise depose kings.
His whole answer almost here / is cloured off diverse divisions before: where he
has Diu 43. page 390. Diuis. 50. page 396. Diuis. 70. page 417.
reply. And yet such is his forehead / that althowgh he have here set before
me a charger off Colewories: yet for answering them with repetition off one
line / in as few words as if I had only referred him to the former treatise /
he shameth not to say / that I use nothing almost but repetitions. Diu. 18.
page 469.
To that alleged out of Calvin / that the church does clean one part unto
an other under our Sau. Christ's dominion, according to the order and form off
polici^e, which he has prescribed, and therefore not by a bishop of a diocese
or archbishop, as those which he praescribed not: he answers / that he
speaks off the spiritual government, and not off the external. whereby he
makes Calvin a trifling disputer. For the Papists which will have the pope a
ministerial head under Christ / Confess that he alone governs inwardly and
secretly by his spirit: but that their pope is a means / whereby he does yt.
Therefore Call. in saying that / that is done by the order and form off policy
prescribed off God: stopped up that corner against them. And beside that yt
will be hard for him to show / that the inward working off God by his spirit
is called an order and form off policy: let him answer where that order and
form off policy off the lords secret working with his spirit / is
prescribed: seeing the work thereof / is as the voice of the wind which we
hearing can John. 3. 8.
not tell from whence yt comes nor whet^^^ yt will: and seeing the lord
commanding his ministers to do their dwtie / reserueth to him self the
manner and order / how and when he will work in wardly. Secondly he answers
that this policy off our Bishop and Archbishop is praescribed, althowghe not
particularly expressed in his word: as if the force off this word prescribed
were not more then / contemed / and as much as his particularly expressed. But
I have d 70. 71 page 4. 7.
showed / that he requires also / that al church officers be expressed in the
word: and what expressed means is before ^. Tract.
observed. The reader to make up his mouth with / and as yt were for a ban
quetting dish. has the next whole chapter off repetitions. which is in the 2.
and 3. ca. off this Tract.
answered / and so is the di. 16. 17 page 446
next unto yt.

Thus we are (by the grace off god) come / to an end off this treatise /
wherein let the reader judge / whether yt has been proved that the offices off
archbishops and archdeacons be unlawful / that they came not into the church
300. years after the ascension off our Sa. Christ: that there names are
likewise unlawful by the word / forbidden by ancient councels / not to be
found in any ancient writing before 400. years approached. Further whether
that every congregation / owght to have a bishop: that one only may have two
or more: that they owght all to have like titles and authority. Saving that in
their meetings for orders sake one by consent of the rest governs that action
/ in such sort as is declared. That all these points off the bishop have
ground off the word off God / and most off the^ showed to have remained some
time after thapostels / and the traces long after. Finally / whether that even
the elder Bishops when they were declined from the synceritie off gods
ordinance / and the archbishops and archdeacons which he never ordained: were
much more tolerable then ours: as those whose authority was without comparison
les / and pomp. none at all.

Throwgh desire off making no great change off the order laid forth by the
Doctor / vvherby the reader should be much troubled in collatio^ of our books:
and partly for that my papers went so sone to the print^ vvherby I could not
correct that my self afterward misliked at is come to pas that there are
diverse things vvherin by order, it might have been, better provided for
memory. Which, I have partly endeavored to help, by this direction: vvherby yt
shall not be uneasy, to find any off the principal points, contained in this
book.
THe scripture is a perfect rule off all actions / which can fall into ma^s
life / as well in defining things / vnnariable / as in giving rules / whereby
things variable by circunstance / may be compassed page lvij. etc. Whether
refer that / wherein is showed what of Moses law remains / page xciij.
Likewise that the Acts of thapostles / are necessary for us to follow page clv.
As appears namely / in the government off the church disputed throwghowt the
whole book: and in that community they used / which is not now Anabaptisticall
cc. viij. Hither also refer / that yt is the virtue off a good law: to leave as
little as may be / in the discretion off the judge xciiij. Also that yt is one
thing to be expressed: and an other / to be commanded in the scripture xlv.

Whereupon the argument off auto^^^ie off the scripture / is good 43. 81: But
nawght from men: especially in divine matters / xviij. and xlvij. Whether refer
that the Godly writers and holy martyr died in error vj. Wheroff the example
browght by me off free will / is handled 54. an other browght by the D. off the
millenaries althowgh he in part / slaundereth the old fathers in that behalf
delij.

Discipline Civil.
THe magistrate ought to be seuerer / in punishing offenses under the gospel:
then under the law cxj. cxviij. Neglecters off the word / are punishable by the
word lxx. The law off capital punishements / remains xcviij. Contemners off
the word / ought to be put to death lxviij. Murderers cij. Incestuous / and
adulterous persons c. The punishing off the breaches off the second Table by
death / and not off the first: is to begin / at the wrong end cxvij.

Discipline Ecclesiastical.
THe Ecclesiastical discipline is prescribed in the word / as the doctrine
ccccxl. As Well under the gospel as under the law ibid. Amplified by comparison
off the Ark / Tabernacle / Temple ccccxliiij. Confirmed by examples off David /
and Solomon / which attempted nothing in the church government / without the
expres word off God / ccccxliiij. Also / off others / lxxxvj.

That the form theroff / owght not to be allwaies / according to the form off
the common wealth cxxx. clix. ccxcviij. dciiij. That yt is not allwaies
convenient / that the form of the commen wealth / should beframed to the form
off the church government ccxxvij. That the church government / is one off
the three marks off the church liij. That yt is safely taken / from the
Apostels times: and dau^gerously from the first 500. years after them. That
the external government off the church / is evil distinguished from the
spiritual. That / yt hinders not the civil discipline ij.

Calling.
THe callinges vn^^ the mynistery / are defined off in the word of God. For
tha(...) ^ gifts necessary for the government off the church / fall into the
offices prescribed in yt 462. Where are rehearsed the proper gifts / whereby
they are severed amongst the^ selves. This is also showed / by that it is not
lawful / to diminish those the lord has set: and therefore not to ad unto them
cccclxiiij. Likewise by the demand the Pharisees made unto John ccccxxxvj.

A calling lawful / and yet extraordinary. page xxx^^j. The Apostels /
Prophets / and Evangelists are evil distinguished / by the D. cccvij. There
can be none off these functions now withowt an extraordinary calling ccciij.
The same could not be a bishop / Evangelist and Apostle at once cccxviij.
Epaphroditus was no Apostle / in that sense that S. Peter was ccciiij. An
Evangelist could not withowt his fault be made a bishop much les could an
Apostle 321. Timothe was an Evangelist and no bishop cccxij. The abusing off
the writers / both old / and nue: to prove Apostles / Prophets / and
Evangelists ordinary ministers cccxxvij. What manner a men they were / which
after those sent forth into the whole world / called them selves Apostles
cccviij. Hereupon / we refuse the callinges of Archbishop otherwise called
Metropolita^ / and our kind of bishop / Archdeaco^ / and deane: as those which
taken even for the very principal church officers / have no ground in the word
of God Proved / in that they are contained in nether of the places off the
Ephesians / or Corinthians / where all the ministeries Ecclesiastical are
described / ccc^xlix. ccccliij. Whether refer / that the archbishop and bishop
are nue ministeries ccccxxxviij. Likewise that the first step / to this kind
off bishoprik / began at Alexandria: and not in Sion or Jerusalem / and that it
was after the Apostles times dxlviij. Also the first step of pre-eminence to an
archbishoprik / over many bishops: was but a little before the Nicene Council
cccclxxxv.

That both this bishop and archbishop / had their beginning by bare custom:
and not by the institution off God / cccclxxxv. dlxviij. These two last points
being expreslie showed off the bishops / and archbishops: may be easily
understood to be true in the Archdeacons / and deanes by that dj. dxxxvj.
diiij. Yt is further showed off the archbishop that h^ was not (in steed of
Archflamins) instituted by S. Peter (as (...) pretended) cccclxix. Where is
showed that there were no Ar^^^lamins under the Romain Empire cccclxxj. not in
England / especially in the time supposed cccclxxij. We refuse them also / for
that they exercise dominion. Forbidden precisely unto Ecclesiastical persons
20. Mat. and 1* Pet. 5. ccccxxj. ccccxxxj. Declared in the example off S. Peter
which had no authority given him above the rest off the Apostles / but was in
such respect equal dcvij.

Here are confuted / the ends off instituting this authority. Whereoff one is
pretended / to assemble the Synodes / and to propound the matters dcxij.
dlxxxij. Whereto belongs / that of those otherwise equal / it is meet (to
avoid confusion) that one by choice of the rest / should rule the action: and
that yt is not meet / that this should be perpetual ccccxxij. Which is
con^^^ed by the example off S. Peter / chosen thereto by the Apostles / and not
perpetually dcxcvij: made plain by the examples off the elder / and french
churches now dxi^x. The other pretended cause is to remedy contentions
ccccxlv^ij* dxlix. dl. dlxxi^ij dlxxxij. Here also is showed / that he is the
cause off contention dlxxix. Which being showed in the bishop and archbishop:
pertains in part also / to the archdeacon / and deane.

Further against this dominion serves / that they are fellow servants /
fellow brethren in office ccccxx viij. dxlv.

Also / for that order / and degrees / stand withowt them ccccxxvij dcij. This
is further declared by comparison of the elder archbishops / and bishops with
ours dxciiij. dcxliiij. Namely of Cyprians dxlvj. and Ieroms dlxviij. Likewise
of the elder Archdeacons / with ours dij. And deanes with ours diiij.

That the Nicene Council / is far from mainteining / the authority off our
metropolitan dlxij. So are the Councels off Antioch / and Arles dlxv. That
Epiphanius Archbishop / stood not in authority: but in excellency off gifts
dlx.

Here upon we condemn (as in all Ecclesiastical ministers) so in these four /
al lofty titles: as those which are annexed to dominion. Whereunto pertains:
that names are not always indifferent 408 And first / the giving high titles
of civil honor: as those which put a differe^ / ^^ between the civil and
ecclesiast. officer ccccvj. ccccxxiij: As forbid* (...) precisely 22. Luke
cccciiij / namely / that the bishop / Archbishops / and (by the same reason)
deanes / ought not to be called lords / having regard to the use of our
country ccccvij. dclv. Also that the title off Prince / part off the
Archbishops / and Archdeacons name: breaks upon the possession off the civil
magistrate ccccvij.

Secondly / in Ecclesiastical titles / we deny unto them to be called heads
off the churches. Where is showed first / that that title agrees unto no
simple creature. The causes wheroff are ccccxij. The absurdities which follow
the giving off it to any other then to our San. Christ / ccccxj. The
approbation off writers nue and old that he is only head ccccxiij. The same
showed off the name off Archbishop / cccix. Hitherto belongs that it was not
so sone in the west parts / as in the East / ccccxciiij That yt is not showed
to have been given to any (but with condemning off yt) in any allowed writer
until about 380. years / ccccxcv. Whereto pertains / that nue writers /
gyuing yt to ministers of elder times / are showed to have done it according to
the times / wherein / not whereoff they wrote / cccclxxxj. ccccxcv. Likewise /
that the name metropolitan / is not off the same value with archbishop.
cccclxxxvij. And that it is not showed to have been / before the Council off
Nice ccccxciiij. Also that the Councels off Carthage / houlden about ccl. and
400. years: do forbid this name ccccxcviij. Finally hither pertains / that
off the counterfeit canons / off the Nicene Council handled cccclxxxviij. And
the counterfeit book off Ambrose / which mentions the archbishop ccccxcj.
Likewise the name of Arch deacon / is not showed / until about 400. years /
page 502. Nor off the deane / until about the same time / page diiij.

Furthermore / upon this that dominion is forbidden them: is also forbidden /
their other pomp off lije. Whereof unto the three causes assigned in my former
book xcviij: Is added the fourth ^^0 off this book. This is showed by
comparison off the elder bishops with ours in their apparel / houses /
household stuf / fare / train off men dcxlxij / etc. Further that the most
part off the riches / wherewith this pomp is maintained: is the commen treasure
off the church / for mainteinance off the mi^sters which want / off the poor /
and off the universities: and the in this point / they have succeeded unto those
/ which got the (...) sacrilege dcxlix.

Further we refuse the archbishop and archdeacon: for that they have larger
charges / then they are or can be sufficient for. Hitherto pertains that all
the ordinary ministers owght to be appointed to a place: and that that place is
a particular congregation / no diocese / nor province / ccxcvj. ccclx Where the
D. corruption drawn from the Papists is confuted. Hither also pertains /
that Denis did not divide parishes / Provinces and dioceses ccclviij. Hither
also pertains / that by the word off God there may and owght (if the case
require) be more bishops in one particular congregation / ^^n one dxxvij. The
traces theroff in the church / long after the Apostles time / page dxxviij.
dl^^.

Likewise that there owght / (by the word off God) to be in every particular
congregation one bishop / dxv. Hither refer the causes / off the falling away
of this order: which were naught dxx. Likewise / that care over churches /
infers not necessarily charge over them dcxxij. That the jurisdiction they
had out off their particular churches: was nothing but a reverend estimation
page dxxxij. Hitherto pertains / the use off the church / long after the
Apostels times ccc. Also that the elder bishops / were called bishops off
parishes cccclxxv^ij. The examples off Demetrius dxlij. off Cyprians bishop /
a^most through the whole 3. chapter off the last Tra. off Cornelius 540. 556.
of Dionysius Alexandrinus 558 Gregory 5^9 Peter Alexandrinus ^60, Athanasius
56^ Ambrose 492. Al which alleged by the D. as bishops off provinces / were
either of one particular church / or off the churches in one only ci^^e: or (at
the least) had far les compass by the twentieth part / then our bishops. This use
is showed to have continued in the Deacons diij.

We are also confirmed in this refusal / by authority off a nombre off the
reformed churches dcxviij. off the Godly writers / which have particulerly
spoken against / either all / or some of these offices. As Jerome 598. M.
Wicleue 616. Luther 617. Barnes / and Hooper 526. Bucer 556. 567. 662. Musculus
549. 598. Calvin 566. 613. etc. 629. The bishop off Salisbury 568. Beza 505.
Bullinger 426. 567. Hitherto belong ^^ that the answerers reasons in this
cause / are drawn (almost (...) from the Papists. Namely from Pighius /
Harding / and other ^^pistes / against the Catholics 414. 426. 446 573. 616.
622. And from Harding / against the bishop of Salisbury. 425. 430. 453. 472.
497. 500 599 601. 611. 612.

Ecclesiastical election.
IT owght to be / with consent of the church: first for that yt is / the
institution off God. This is showed out off the 14. Acts 194. Here is disputed
off the signification of lifting up of hands 199 Also out of the 8. 1.
Corinthes 209. and Acts 6 134. for that the lightest charges off the church
were not done but by consent off yt: where the exception taken from Pigghius is
answered. Likewise out of j. Acts 12^. Considering that in that / Election
which was made immediately by the lord / the churches judgment was not passed
by. This is strenghtned by Nomb. 8. 220. Leuiticus ^. Nombers 20. 222. Hitherto
pertains that which the D. alleges to the contrary out off Titus 1. and
Timoth. 1. 5* cclxv. drawn from Pighius cclxx. Whereto belongs that the
scripture sometime attributes to the chief in an action / that is common to
more then to them: confirmed by the manner off speaking both in scripture and
otherwise: also by the judgment of Calvin / Musculus 196. Beza 135. Bullinger
197. Further that which the D brings out off 13 Act. taken from Hosius
cclxxxiij. Likewise that the form off the Election should be other now: then in
time off the Apostels ccxxxv. Where the number off Christians / and (throwgh
the number) tumult in elections is confuted. Also that of the difference of
religion and manners / between Christians then and now: taken from Hosius ccxlj*
Where is handled / the shutting forth of papists / Dronkards and Whoremongers
Further that the estate off the church: was not then popular ccxlix That the
confirmation off the election by the magistrate / alters not the form cclxij
Hither also refer / the counterfeit Ambrose: drawn from Pighius / off the
diuersyty off government off the church then / and now cclix.

This is confirmed / of the effects off the church Election: because yt
breeds assurance off the minister / in his calling: makes the people / more
obedient to him / as Musculus confesses cclx. Causes the Godly / to love him
(...): and bridleth the Hypocrites from outrage against him ^xix. Hitherto
refer that the D brings off the supposed contention / that this will breed
cxxxiiij cxlvij cclxxxviij. Likewise of the comparison / between the effects
off our bishops elections: with those off the churches cxlvij. ccxxvij.
Likewise that the errors off the churches election: may be commodiously
remedied by the churches hard by / by the Synodes / and (if they fail) by the
magistrate 23^.

That it is the churches liberty as Musculus says cclx

Also / that the consent off the parliament / touching the bishops election: is
not the churches ecclesiastical election: Where the D does but mock the church
ccxxv.

That certain things / ar variable in this election: hinders not the
perpetuity off the churches consent cxxxvij That the ignorance off the church
is not such / as both hinder the churches election cxi. cxlvj. ccxxix. Nether
corruption of religion such cxivij. Nor of affections. ccxxix.

This is also showed by comparison off the churches election with that which is
commonly done in civil affairs ccxxiiij. confirmed by Peter Martyr ccxxviij.

Last off all this is confirmed / by old custom ccxx. by Councels Nycene
cclvij. cclxxxiiij. Constantinople / Carthage / Toledo / alleged page xxxvij.
off my first book: off Paris / Orleans with diverse other / ccxx. Emperors
decrees cciij / Ignatius cciij. Cyprian cxxv. ccx^ij. Where is / the D.
exception taken out off Pigghius / Gregory Nazianzene / Ambrose ccixxx.
Chrysostom cxciij. Jerome cclxxvj. Augustine cclxxviij. The exception against
which testimony is taken from Pigghius. Oecumenius ccij Luther ccxiiij.
Archbishop off Reins / ^usanus / Celestinus / Leo ccliij.

Off the autorities / which he uses: that off Chrysostom upon the 6 off the
Acts / is answered cxciij. That out of his book de sacerdorio / and S. John
drawn both from Hosius cclxxxviij. ccxcj. The rest either are nothing to
purpose / or are showed flat against him / for us: as the Canon attributed to
the Apostles / off the Ancyran / and Antioch can Council ccxv^ij. Calvin cxxvj.
ccxvj. ccxxij Zuing^^us and Bulllinger cxcvj. Beza cxci^ij. Musculus ccixiij.
and toe example off the Tigurine election ccixv. Differing in some point f^^m
us are showed greatly against him.

Examin^^^on, an other part off election.
That the ecclestasticall ministers examination / is instituted in the word: is
showed out off Acres j. cxxj. 6. Act cxxvij. 1. Timothy iij. cxliiij. Whether
pertains / the example off Jeroboam clxi. Althowgh they be known / yet meet
they should be offered unto yt cxxij. yea and examined / althowgh some good
knowledge be before exxviij.

That it owght not to be made by one only: as appears by the former
testimonies Hither belong the reasons of ignorance / corruption in religion /
and affection / noted in the former title: as those which are common to this /
as well as to the churches consent in election. This is explaned / by comparison
off Civil affairs res. cxx^x / etc. clix. Confirmed by example off S. Paul
xvj. Act. cliiij. Whether pertains / that alleged of the D. that S. Paul was
received at the testimony of Barnabas 160. Especially this examination owght
not to be made by the Archdeacon / in the election off a bishop cliiij. And
that the receiving of a bishop at his testimony / came from Rome cxliij.

That in the examination with us / the church is utterly shut out: howsoever
the D / pretend otherwise cliiij.

Known adulterers owght not to be received into the mynistery clxxvj. Nor
ministers fallen into Idolatry cxlv. The law of Moses / in that behalf: owght
rather to be observed under the gospel / then under the law cixxvj. The ends
hereof clxxiiij. Here is handled / the example of Judas clxviij. clxxiiij. The
Pharisees clxviij. Off S. Paul and Peter clxxiiij. Likewise are handled S.
Peter's denial clxxvij. and the gentiles Idolatry clxxxiiij. Increased by the D.
to the end that the Popish Idolatry should semeles. Likewise / that the decree
off restoring ministers fallen into Idolatry: was not of the Council of
rebaptization clxxxij. That they which are nue come to religion owght not to be
received to the ministry off the word clxxx.

That a prouf may be taken off the bishops ability in teaching / before he be
ordained. cl. That if they be not able to teach: they owght not by the word to
be ordained ccclxvij.

Hither perceineth / that is unmeet / to ^own mynisters their Care chism
ccclxiiij.

Hither belongs the treatise off rea^ing the holy scriptures where first is
showed / the use of reading them in the church ccclxxv. That reading off them
is not able ordinarily to hold the people from pining ccclxiij. Nether can
reading of prayers / or admynistration off the Sacraments withowt preaching /
ccclxiiij. That simple readers / ordained for pastors: can not properly be
called watchmen ccclxxvj. That reading is not preaching ccclxxxvij. Against the
phrenefie / that bare reading is better then preaching / clxxxv. That bare
reading is not so good / as preaching / ccclxxiiij not to the learned them
selves / ccclxxxiiij. much les reading of the homilies / cccxciij. Which are
not meet to be red in the church openly cccxcij. As are not also the Apoctypha
ccxcviij: especially considering their corruptions / page cccc.

Hither pertains / the judgment off the churches / off unlearned ministers
ccclxiiij.

The causes off the unlearned mynistery / with us ccclxiij. ccclxv. ccclxxj.

Ordination.
ORdination does not belong to the bishop alone cclxxiiij.

Against the Bishop commanding to receive the holy ghost in ordeining ccxcij.

Residence.
IN the residence off the ministers / that off the Pastor is particularly
handled 4. Tract. page cccxxx. Where our reasons are maintained.

That it is the institution off God in the old Test. cccxlij. In the nue
cccxliiij. That the calling of the church (which is also the lords) is to that
place only cccxxxij. That he owght to be reside^t / that thereby greater love
might be wrought cccxiv: That having better knowledge / off the estate off his
flock he may better do all duties toward them cccxxxix. That with seeing the
blessing off God / he might be stirred to further diligence cccxlv: That his
flock having more famyliaryty might have easier acces ibid. That he might be
(...) ^^mple of life cccxliij.

Proved also by, ^o^tinual duty off preaching: Whether pertains that treatise
/ wherein / is showed; that yt is convenient yt should always god before the
administering of the holy Sacraments cccxlviij. Hither may be referred the
comparison of the diligence of the elder Bishops in preaching / dcxlvij.
Whether also refer the unlawful power of the bishop / towching licenses to
preach: whereby yt is in his will / whether he will give the pastor leave to
preach or no: considering that it is a necessary duty of the pastor / and the
principal cause off his residence cccxlj. That he must admonish both the
wicked / and the godly: strengthen both the weak and the strong cccxlj. Comfort
in temptation cccxlvij. Therefore that the bare reading off the scripture is no
sufficient supply in his absence cccxliij: Nether his care cccxxxij. That the
conscience off the pastor and contentement of the people: is no good rule off
doing these duties cccxxx.

Nether belongs that the pastor owght not to go here / and there to preach:
where he thincketh good. Where is showed / that God does not always call to
places where one may do most good: no not in the extraordinary callings /
much les in the ordinary cccxxxvj. That this going about to preach (as yt is
assigned of the Answerer) takes away the difference between the pastors
calling / and the extraordinary functions cccxxxij. That those extraordinary
callinges do not make against the pastors residence / as yt is assigned off us
cccxxxj. cccxxxix: That they rather make for yt cccxxxij. cccxxxiij. cccxxxv.

That ordinary deputies are ouerthrown by this residence / cccliiij whether
may be referred / that dlxxxvj. of deputies: Likewise pluralities of benefices
ccclvj. Hither refer / that absence for some causes / and some conditions: do
not overthrow reside^ce cccliij.

This is also proved / by comparison of shepardes / and watchmen cccxxxvj.
Where is showed / how shamefully the answerer abuses the doctrine off Gods
holy election: and of final perseverance of those / which are once called
cccxxxviij. Also that by his answer the pastor after he has admonished them
need never come to them: nor yet leave any deputy cccxli.

Likewise off the eye / and soul cccxlvij. (...) yt as is precious a work to
keep those gotten / as to get other ^^ich be in ignorance: and more agreeable /
unto the pastors of^e.

The authority off Councels / and fathers cccxxxiiij. cccliiij.

Ecclesiastical correction.
A part off that Ecclesiastical discipline / which stands in corrections: is
commanded is. Math. 66.

To note only the errors / corruptions and shameful falsifyinges of the D. in
such sort as he has pretended in my book: were to make a new book. But
because there is much void paper / I will give the reader an assay only / of
those contained in the treatises which I handle in this book. And those shall be
not off the capital matters between us: but off such as are browght to underset
them / quoted according to his own book whereby yt shall appear / that for the
defense off this cause he troubles heaven yt self: and in earth overthrows
both estates / Civil / and Ecclesiastical.

THe whole law of god generally, is abrogated, pa. 121. li. 39.

The scripture speaks not one word off preaching or baptizing privately or
openly, page 89. line 6.

The scripture has not commanded, nether can yt be by necessary collection
theroff gathered: whether we should receive the communion clothed or naked,
page 24. line 21.

The scripture has appointed no discipline for the correcting off such as
shall contemn the hearing off the word and common prayer, page 88 line 47.

He matcheth the judicial laws off god, given unto the Ivves: with the
Turckes laws, page 149 line 32.

HE alovveth th(...) sentence off Cyrill which condemns the justice off g^
^ishing those by aeternall death which suffered corpor^^^ ^ath under the law
page 149. line 48.

He matcheth the ^ou^^shing off says by consideration off the creatures,
with popish imagety, page 571. line 2.

TO maintein the sole election off the bishop: he would have the free
elections off magistrates, in cities and Borovvgh Towns taken away, page
171. line 49.

VVherby he will have the form of government off the common wealth framed
unto the form off the church: vvheroff notvvithstanding and that most vntrvvly
he accuses me.

Likewise that under the gospel there is no punishment off the body laid upon
a transgressor: but that if he repent, so that he may seem worthy to have the
punishment vvithdravvn, he may find forgiveness, page 150. line 9.

No man what crime soever he has committed: is to be secluded from any
lavvful vocation if he repent. And by vocation: he means public office, page
146. line 23.

The external government off the church, under a Christian magistrate: must
be according to the kind and form off government, used in the common wealth,
pa. 389. li. 5. which (beside the absurdity) utterly overthrows the
liberty: which him self pretends that the church has, in disposing off yt.

In the Apostels times, yt was permitted to all men: to preach, the word off
God, page 191. li. 16.

Beside Pastors there are now with us, Apostles Prophets, and Evangelists,
page 229. line 6.

ALthovvgh there were a sufficient number off able men to supply the places of
the reading ministers: yet the reading ministers, ovvght to keep their places
still page 485. lin. 5.

The word, is as effectual red: as preached Page 569. lin. 23. To those,
which understand the scriptures: they are as vvhot and lightsom red, as
preached, page 573. li. 34.

public reading in the church, is as solem^^ matter: as Catechizing the youth,
page 425. lin. 43.

Yt may be, that some men be more aedified (...) simple reading off the
scriptures* then by sermons pa^^. ^80. li. 30.

To that I say, that nether homilies, nor Apocrypha are to be compared either in
goodness within them selves, or fruict to the hearers, with the scripture or
reading thereof: he answers that that makes against sermons, as well as
against homilies: and rather against sermons, then against them, Page 717 li.
52. VVherby he affirms, that homilies are both better in them selves, and
more fruiteful to the hearers: then sermons.
