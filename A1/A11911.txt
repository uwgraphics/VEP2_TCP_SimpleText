Lucii Annei Senecae Tragedia prima quae inscribitur Hercules furens nuper
recognita, and ab omnibus mendis, quibus antea scatebat sedulo purgata, and in
studiosae inuentutis vtilitate^, in Anglicum metrum tanta fide conuersa, vt
carmen pro carmine quoad Anglica lingua patiatur pene redditum videas.

Per lasperum Heyvvodum Oxoniensem.

The first Tragedy of Lucius Anneus Seneca, entitled Hercules furens, newly
perused and of all faults whereof it did before abound diligently corrected,
and for the profit of young scholars so faithfully translated into English
meter, that ye may se verse for verse turned as far as the phrase of the
english permits

By Jasper Heywood studient in Oxford.

TO THE RIGHT honorable Sir William Harbert of the honorable order of the
garter knight, Lord Harbert of Cardyffe, Earl of Penbrocke and one of the
Queens majesty's most honorable Pryuie council his daily Orator Iaspper
Heywood wissheth prosperous health with encre^se of honor and virtue.
THe most excellent and famous learned clearke Erasmus of Roteroda^ among so
many learned volumes which he in his life time wrote, with such excellency,
that they yet do and ever shall preserve the name and renown of so worthy a
man, even for that only thing won not the least praise among learned me^, nor
deserved least thank of posterity, that he so well and truly translated
out of Greek into latin two tragedies of Euripides, whereof the one is named
Hecuba, and the other Iphiginia. For as all men that can judge of that work,
must needs highly commend him that has so lernedly done it so must all
studientes of the Greek tongue needs render him great thanks, that has
opened the^ such a gate thereto When I therefore (most honorable Earl)
considered with my self that such a man of whom the world yet after his
death resowndes, disdaind not sometime to leave even the study of the divine
scriptures to turn his pen a while to the profit and furthera^ce of youth, I
thought it not repugnant to my duty if I should also for a time set a side ye
books of old Philosophers, Aristotle and Plato, and once endeavor to show my
self so loving to my countreye, as to help for the small tale^t that god has
given me, to conduct by some means to further un dersta^di^g the vnripened
schol lers of this realm, to whom I thought it should be no less thankful for
me to enterprete some latin work into this our own tongue, then for Erafmus in
Latin to expound the Greek, to them that are already good and perfect
latinistes. Neither could I satisfy my self, til I had through out this
whole tragedye of Seneca a grave and wise wri ter so travailed that I had in
englysh given verse for verse, (as far as the englysh tongue permitts) and word
for word with the latin: whereby I might both make some trial of my self, and
as it were te^h the little children to go that yet can but creep. Which
thing when I had brought to pass, and fully finished this little work, I
thought with my self how greatly it might auail me, to have the authori tie of
some noble man, my shield against the sting of evil to^gs. wherefore when I
considered that your honor so greatly favored lerni^g, that ye vouchsafed to
se^d unto the vniuersi tie of oxford, of which I am a member, your derest and
eldest son my lord Henry whom I have there well known, and so to trade him in
time of tender years, that hysriper age, might both give your honor cause to
joy i^ him and us to tha^k your honor for him, I have presumed upon hope of
pardon formi boldness, ye rather for his sake to dedicate this simple work
unto your honor, as well to signify the poor good will of a scholar, as
also to render to your honor most humble tha^ kes, that it has plesed so
honorable an Earl to honor our university of Oxforde, with the presence of
such a yo^g lord so worthy a Gentleman. The which my attempt I trust your
honor will for this the rather pardon, that although this simple work, which
I here offer be far unworthy to be of your honor received, yet is it a meet
gift for me to present: who as I am a schol ler, so ca^ I give nothing but a
scholars gift, namelye the practice of my pen, the which beseching your
honor none otherwise to accept the^ Christ accepted the two mites which the
poor woman offered in the temple, I end with prayer to him, for the prosperous
continuance and increase ofyour lordshippes honorable estate and dignity.

FINIS.
The Argument of this Tragedy.
Juno the wife and sister of Jupiter, hatyng his bastard brood, comes down
from heaven, complaining of all his injuries done to her, devising also by what
despite she may vex his base son Hercules. And having by experience proved,
no toiles to be too hard for him, finds the means to make his own hand his
own vengeance. Hercules therefore returning now from hell (from whens he was
enjoined to fet Cerberus.) And finding that the tyrant Lycus had invaded his
country, destroieth the tyrant. For the which victory as he sacrifices to
his gods, wrathefull Juno strikes him into a sudden fransy: where with he
being sore vexed, thynkyng to slay the children and wife of Lycus, instead of
them, kills his own wife and children in his madness. This done he
sleapeth. Juno restores to him again his wits. He being wakte, seeing his
wife and children slain by his own hand, at last also would kill himself.

ACTVS PRIMVS.
Juno, sola. Trimetri Iambici. SOror Tonantis, (hoc enim solum mihi
Nome^ relictum est) semper alienum Iouem,
Acte^pla summi uidua deserui aetheris,
Locu^que coelo pulsa pellicibus dedi.
Tellus colenda est, pellices coelum tenent.
Hinc, Arctos alta part glacialis poli,
Sublime classes sydus Argolicas agit.
Hinc, qua tepenti vere laxatur dies,
Tyriae per vndas vector Europae nitet.
Illinc, timendum ratibus, ac ponto gregem,
Passim vagantes exerunt Atlantides.
Fera coma hinc exterret Orion deos:
Suasque Perseus aureas stellas habet.
Hinc clara Geminisigna Tyndaridae micant:
Quibusque natis mobilis tellus stetit.
Necipse tantum Bacchus, aut Bacchi parens,
Adiere superos: nequa pars probro vacet,
Mundus puellae serta Gnossiacae gerit.
Sed vetera querimur: vna me dira acfeta
Thebana nuribus sparsa tellus impiis,
Quoties nouercam fecit? ascendat licet,
Meumque victrix teneat Alcmene locum,
Pariterque natus astra promissa occupet,
In cuius ortu mundus impendit diem,
Tardusque Eoo Phoebus effulsit mari,
Retinere mersum iussus Oceano iubar:
Non sic abibunt odia. viuaces aget
Violentus iras animus, and saeuus dolor
Aeterna bella (pace sublara) geret.
Quid bella? quidquid horridum tellus creat
Inimica, quicquid pontus, aut aer tulit
Terribile, dirum, pestilens, atrox, ferum,
Fractu^, atque domitu^ est: supat, and crescit malis,
Iraque nostra fruitur: in lauds suas
Mea vertit odia: dum nimis saeua impero,
Patrem probauit. inde, qua lucem premit,
A peritque Tethys, qua ferens Titan diem,
Binos propinqua tingit Aethiopes face,
Indomita virtus colitur: and toto deus
Narratur orb. monstra iam desunt mihi,
Minorque labor est Herculi iussa exequi,
Quam mihi iubero: laetus imperia excipit.
Quae fera tyranni iussa violento queant
Nocere iuuen^? nempe pro telis gerit
Quae timuit, and quae fudit: armatus venit
Leone, and Hydra: nec satis terrae patent,
Effregit ecce limen inferni Iouis,
Et opima victi regis ad superos refert.
Parum est reuerti, foedus vmbrarum perit.
Vidi ipsa, vidi (nocte discussa inferum,
^t dite domito) spolia iactantem patri
Fraterna. cur no^ vinctum, and oppressum trahit
Ipsum catenis paria sortitum Ioui?
Ereboque capto potitur, and retegit Styga?
Patefacta ab imis manibus retro via est,
Et sacra dirae mortis in aperto iacent.
At ille (rupto carcere vmbrarum) ferox
De me triumphat, and superbifica manu
Atrum per vrbes ducit Argolicas canem.
Viso labantem Cerbero vidi diem,
Pauidumque solemn: me quoque inuasit tremor,
Et tetra monstri colla deuicti intuens,
Timui imperasse. leuia sed nimium queror,
Coelo time^dum est, regna ne summa occupet,
Qui vicit ima. sceptra praeripi^t patri,
Nec in astra lenta veniet (vt Bacchus) via:
Iter ruina quaeret, and vacuo volet
Regnare mundo. robore expenso tumer,
Et posse coelum viribus vinci suis,
Didicit ferendo: subdidit mundo caput,
Nec flexit humeros molis immensae labor:
Mediusque collo sedit Herculeo polus.
Immota ceruix sydera, and coelum tulit:
Et me premente, quaerit ad superos viam.
Perge ira, perge, and magna medita^te^ opprime,
Congredere, manibus ipsa iam lacera tuis.
Quid tanta mandas odia? discedant ferae:
Ipse imperando fessus Eurystheus uacet.
Titanas ausos rumpore imperium Iouis
Emitte: Siculi verticis laxa specum.
Tellus gigante Doris excusso tremens,
Supposita monstri colla terrifici leuet.
Sublimis alias luna concipiat feras.
Sed vicit ista. quaeris Alcidae parem?
Nemo est, nisi ipse. bella iam secum gerat.
Adsint ab imo Tartari fundo excitae
Eumenides, ignem flammeae spargant comae,
Viperea faeuae verbera incutiant manus.
I nunc superbe, coelitum seeds pete.
Mouenda iam sunt bella, clarescit dies.
Humana remne: iam Styga and manes, ferox
Fugisse credis? hic tibiostendam inferos.
Reuocabo in alta conditam caligine
Vltra no centum exilia discordem deam.
Qua mugit ingens montis oppositi specus,
Educam, and imo Ditis e regno extraham
Quicquid relictum est. veniat inuisum scelus
Suumque lambens sanguinem impietas ferox,
Errorque, and in se semper armatus furor.
Hoc, hoc ministro noster vtatur dolor.
Incipite famulae Ditis: ardentem incitae
Concutite pinu^: and agmen horrendu^ anguib'
Megaera ducat: atque luctifica manu
Vastam rogo flagrante corripiat trabem.
Hoc agite, poenas petite violatae Stygis,
Concutite pectus: acrior mentem excoquat,
Quam qui caminis ignis Aetneis furit.
Vt possit animo captus Alcides agi
Magno furore percitus, nobis prius
Insaniendum est. Juno cur nondum furit?
Me, me sorores mente deiectam mea
Versate primam, facere si quidquam apparo
Dignum nouerca: iam odia mutentur mea.
Natos (reuersus) videat incolumes, precor,
Manuque fortis redeat: inueni diem,
Inuisa quo nos Herculis virtus iuuet.
Me pariter, and se vincat, and cupiat mori
Ab inferis reuersus. hic prosit mihi,
Jove esse genitum: stabo, and vt certo exeant
Emissa neruo tela, librabo manum:
Regam furentis arma, pugnanti Herculi
Tandem fauebo. scelere perfecto licet
Admittat illas genitor in coelum manus.

ACTVS SECVNDVS
Megara: Trimetri Iambici. OMAGNE Olympirector, and mundi arbiter,
Iam statue tandem grauibus aerumnis modum,
Finemque cladi. nulla lux vnquam mihi
Secura fulsit, finis alterius mali
Gradus est futuri: protinus reduci nouus
Paratur hostis, ante quam laetam domum
Contingat, aliud iussus ad bellum meat:
Nec vlla requies, tempus aut vllum datur,
Nisi dum iubetur: sequitur apprime statim
Infesta Juno. nunquid immunis fuit
Infantis aetas? monstra superauit prius,
Quam nosse posset. gemina cristati caput
Angues ferebant ora, qnos contra obuius
Reptauit infans, igneos serpentium
Oculos remisso pectore, ac placido intuens,
Arctos serenis vultibus nodos tulit:
Ettumida tenera guttura elidens manu,
Praelusit Hydrae. Maenali pernix fera,
Multo decorum praeferens auro caput,
Deprensa cursu est. Maximus Nemeaetimor
Gemuit lacertis pressus Herculeis Leo.
Quid stabula memore^ dira Bistonii gregis?
Suisque regem pabulum armentis datum?
Solitumque densis hispidum Erymanthi iugis,
Arcadica quatere nemora Maenalium suem?
Taurumque centum non leuem populis metu^?
Inter remotos gentis Hesperiae greges,
Pastor triformis littoris Cartesii
Peremptus, acta est praeda ab occasu vltimo,
Notum Cithaeron pauit Oceano pecus.
Penetrare iussus solis aestiui plagas,
Et adusta medius regna quae torret dies,
Vtrinque montes soluit abrupto obice,
Etiam ruenti fecit Oceano viam.
Posthaec adortus nemoris opulenti domos,
Aurifera vigilis spolia serpentis tulit.
Quid saeua Lernae monstra, numerosummalu^?
Non igne demum vicit, and docuit mori?
Solitasque pennis condere obductis diem,
Petrit ab ipsis nubibus Stymphalidas.
Non vicit illum coelibis semper tori
Regina gentis vidua Thermodoontiae.
Nec ad omne clarum facinus audaces manus
Stabuli fugauit turpis Augiae labor.
Quid ista prosunt? orb defernso caret.
Sensere terrae pacis authorem suae
Abesse tetris: prosperum, ac foelix scelus
Virtus vocatur, sontibus parent boni.
Ius est in armis, opprimit leges timor.
Ante ora vidi nostra truculenta manu
Gnatos paterni cadere regni vindices,
Ipsumque Cadmi nobilis stirpem vltimam
Occidere: vidi regium capitis decus
Cum capite raptum. quis satis Thebas fleat?
Ferax deorum terra, quem dominum tremi^
E cuius aruis, eque foecundo sinu,
Stricto iuuentus orta cum ferro stetit:
Cuiusque muros natus Amphion Jove,
Struxit canoto saxa modulatu trabens:
In cuius vrbem non semel diuum parens
Coelo relicto venit haec quae coelites
Recepit, and quae fecit, and (fas sit loqui)
Fortasse faciet, sordido premitur iugo.
Cadmaea proles, ciuis atque Amphionis,
Quo decidistis? tremitis ignauum exulem,
Suis carentem finibus, nostris grauem?
Qui scelera terra, quique persequitur mari,
Ac saeua iusta sceptra confregit manu,
Nunc seruit absens, fertque quae ferri vetat:
Tenetque Thebas exul Herculeas Lycus.
Sed non tenebit: aderit, and poenas petet,
Subitusque ad astra emerger: inueniet viam,
Aut faciet. adsis sospes, and remees tuis:
Tandemque venias victorad victam domum.
Emerge coniux, atque depulsas manu
Abrumpetenebras, nulla si vetito via,
Iterque clausum est, orb diducto redi.
Et quicquid a^ nocte possessum later,
Emitte tecum. dirutis qualis iugis
Praeceps citato flumini quaerensiter
Quondam stetisti, sciffa cum vasto imperu
Patuere Tempe: pectore impulsus tuo
Huc mons, and illuc cecidit: and rupto aggere,
Noua cucurrit Thessalus torrens via.
Talis parents, liberos, patriam petens,
Erumpe, rerum terminos tecum afferens,
Et quicquid anida tot per annorum gradus
Abscondit aetas, read, and oblitos sui,
Lucisque pauidos antete populos age.
Indigna te sunt spolia, si tantum refers
Quantum imperatu^ est. magna, sed nimiu^ loquot.
Ignara nostrae sortis. vnde illum mihi,
Quo te tuamque dextram amplectar diem
Reditusque lentos, nec mei memores, querar?
Tibi o deorum ductor, indomiti ferent
Centena tauri colla: tibi frugum parens
Secreta reddam sacra: ribi multa side
Longas Eleusi tacita iactabo faces.
Tum restitutas fratribus rebor meis
Animas, and ipsum regna moderantem sua
Florere patrem. siqua te mayor tenet
Clausum potestas, sequimur: aut omnes tuo
Defend reditu sospes, aut omnes trahe.
Trahes, nec vllus eriget fractos deus.

Eris inter istos: qui tamen nullo stupr^
Laesere thalamos.

Ly. Quod Ioui, hoc regi licet:
Ioui dedisti coniugem, regi dabis.
Ette magistro non nouum hoc discet nurus,
Etiam viro probante meliorem sequi.
Sin copulari pertinax taedis negat,
Velex coacta nobilem partum feram.

M. Vmbrae Creontis, and penates Labdaci,
Et nuptiales impii Oedipodae faces,
Nunc solita nostro fata coniugio date.
Nunc, nunc cruentae regis Aegypti nurus,
Adeste multo sangnine infectae manus:
Deest vna numero Danais, explebo nefas.

L. Coniugia quonia^ peruicax nostra abnuis,
Regemque terres, sceptra quid possint, scies.
Complectere aras, nullus eripiet deus
Te mihi: nec orb si remolito, queat
Ad supera victor numina Alcides vehi.
Congerite syluas, templa supplicibus suis
Iniecta flagrent: coniugem, and totum grege^
Consumat vnus igne subiecto rogus.

A. Hoc munus a te genitor Alcidae peto,
Rogare quod me deceat, vt primus cadam.

L. Qui morte cunctos luere supplicium iubet,
Nescit tyrannus esse: diuersairroga.
Miserum veta perire, foelicem iube.
Ego, dum cremandis trabibus accrescit rogus
Sacro regentem maria votiuo rogem.

A. Proh numinum vis summa, proh coelestiu^
Rector, parensque, cuius excussis tremunt
Humana telis, impiam regis feti
Co^pesce dextram: quid Deos frustra precort
Vbicunque es audi nate. cur subito labant
Agitata motu templa? cur mugit solum?
Infernus imo sonuit e fundo fragor:
Audimur, en est sonitus Herculei gradus.

Chorus. Choriambici seu ^sclepradaei.
Fortuna viris inuida fortibus,
OQuam no^ aqua bopis praemia diuidis?
Eurystheus facili regnet in otio,
Al^mona gei^us bella per omnia,
Monstris exagitet coeliferam manum:
Serpentis relecet colla ^rocia,
Deceptis referat mala sororibus,
Cum somno dederit per^giles genas,
Po^s d^itibus praepositus Draco.
Intrauit Scythiae multiuagas domos,
(...) gentes patri^s sedibus hospitas:
Cascauitque freti terga rigentia,
Et mutis tacitum littoribus mare.
Illic dura carent aequora fluctibus:
Et qua plena rates carbasa tenderant,
Intonlis teritur semita Sarmatis.
Stat pontus vicibus mobilis annuis,
Nauem nunc facilis, nunc equitem pati.
Illic qua viduis gentibus imperat,
Aurato religans ilia baltheo,
Detraxit spolium nobile corpori,
Et peltam, and niuei vincula pectoris,
Victorem posito suspiciens genu.
Qua spe praecipites actus ad inferos,
Audax ire vias irremiabiles
Vidisti Siculae regna Proserpinae?
Illie nulla Noto, nulla Fauonio
Consurgunt tumidis fluctibus aequora.
Non illic geminum Tyndaridae genus
Succurrunt timidis sy dera nauibus.
Stat nigro pelagus gurgite languidum
Et cum mors auidis pallida dentibus
Gentes innumeras manibus intulit,
Vno tot populi remige transeunt.
Euincas vtinam rura ferae Stygis,
Parcarumque eolos irreuocabiles.
Hic qui rex populis pluribus imperat,
Bello cum peteres Nestoriam Pylon,
Tecum conseruit pestiferas manus,
Telu^ ter gemina cuspide praeferens:
Effugit tenui vulnere saucius,
Et mortis dominus pertimuit mori.
Fatum rumpe manu: tristibus inferis
Prospectus pateat lucis, and inuius
Limes det faciles ad superos vias.
Immites potuit flectere cantibus
Vmbrarum dominos, and prece supplici
Orpheus, Eurydicen dum repetit suam.
Quae fyluas, and aues, saxaque taxerat,
Ars, quae praebuerat fluminibus moras,
Ad cuius fonitum constiterant ferae,
Mulcet non solitis vocibus inferos,
Et surdis resonat clarius in locis:
Deflent and lachrymis difficiles Dei:
Et qui front nimis crimina tetrica
Quaerunt, ac veteres excutiunt reos:
Deflent Eurydicen Thraeiciae nurus.
Flentes Eurydicen Iuridici sedent.
Tandem mortis, ait, vincimut arbiter.
Euade ad supetos, lege tamen data,
Tu post terga tui perge viri comes,
Tu non ante tuam respice coniugem,
Quam cum clara Deos obtulerit dies,
Spartanique aderit ianua Taenari.
Odit verus amor, nec patitur moras.
Munus, dum properat cernere, perdidit.
Quae vinci potuit regia cantibus,
Haec vinci poterit regia viribus.

ACTVS TERTIVS
Hercules. Trimetri Iambici. OLucis alme rector, and coeli decus,
Qui alterna curru spatia fla^mifero ambiens
Illustre laetis exeris terris caput,
Da Phoebe veniam, si quid illicitum tui
Videre vultus: iussus in lucem extuli
Secreta mundi: tuque coelestum arbiter,
Parensque, visus fulmine opposito tege.
Et tu secundo maria qui sceptro regis,
Imas pete vndas: quisquis ex alto aspicit,
Terrena facie pollui metuens noua,
Aciem reflectar, oraque in coelum erigat,
Portenta fugiens: hoc nefas cernant duo,
Qui aduexit, and quae iussit. In poenas meas,
Atque in labores, non satis terrae patent
Iunonis odio: vidi inaccessa omnibus,
Ignota Phoebo, quaeque deterior polus
Obscura diro spatia concessit Ioui.
Et si placerent tertiae sortis loca,
Regnare potui. noctis aeternae chaos,
Et nocte quiddam grauius, and tristes Deos,
Et fata vici, morte contempta redii.
Quid restat aliud? vidi and ostendi inferos:
Da, si quid vltra est, tam diu pateris manus
Cessare nostras Juno? quid vinci iubes?
Sed templa quare miles infestus tenet?
Limenque sacrum terror armorum obsidet?

AMPHITRYON. Hercules. Theseus. Trimetri Iambici. VTrumne visus vota decipiunt
meos?
An ille domitor orbis, and Gtaium dec',
Tristi silentem nubilo liquit domum?
Estne ille natus? membra laetitia stupent.
Onate, certa, and sera Thebarum salus,
Verumne cerno corpus? an fallor tua
Deceptus vmbra? tune es? agnosco toros,
Humerosque, and alto nobilem trunco manum.

H. Vnde iste (genitor) squalor, and lugubribus
Amicta coniux? vnde tam foedo obsiti
Paedore nati? quae domum clades grauat?

A. Socer est peremptus: regna Lycus possidet.
Natos, parentem, coniugem leto petit.

H. Ingrata tellus, nemo ad Herculeae domus
Auxilia venit? vidit hoc tantum nefas
Defensus orbis? cur diem questu tero?
Mactetur hostis: hanc ferat virtus notam,
Fiatque summus hostis Alcidae Lycus.
Ad hauriendum sanguinem inimicum feror.
Theseu resist, ne qua vis subita ingruat:
Me bella poscunt. differ amplexus parens,
Coniuxque differ: nunciet Diti Lycus
Me iam redisse.

Th. Flebilem ex oculis fugs
Regina vultum, tuque nato sospite
Lachrymas cadentes reprime: si noui Herculem,
Lycus Creonti debitas poenas dabit.
Lentu^ est, dabit: dat: hoc quoque est lentu^, dedit.

A. Votum secu^det, qui potest, nostrum deus,
Rebusque lassis adsit. O magni comes
Magnanime na ti, pande virtutum ordinem:
Quam longa moestos ducat ad manes via,
Vt vincla tulerit dura tart areus canis.

TH. Memorare cogis acta, securae quoque
Horrenda menti, vix adhuc certa est fides
Vitalis aurae, torpet acies luminum,
Hebetesque visus vix diem insuetum ferunt.

A. Peruince Theseu quicquid alto pectore
Remanet pauoris, neue te fructu optimo
Frauda laborum. Quod fuit durum pati,
Meminisse dulce est. Fare casus horridos.

T. Fas omne mundi, teque dominante^ precor
Regno capaci, teque, quam totairrita
Quaesiuit Aetna matter, vt iura abdita
Et operta terris, liceat impune eloqui.
Spartana tellus nobile attollit iugum,
Densis vbi aequor Taenarus syluis premit.
Hic ora soluit Ditis inuisi domus,
Hiatque rupes alta, and immenso specu
Ingens vorago faucibus vastis patet,
Latumque pandit omnibus populis iter.
Non caeca tenebris incipit primo via.
Tenuis relictae lucis a tergo nitor,
Fulgorque dubious solis afflictic adit,
Et ludit aciem: tale non dubie solet
Praebere lumen primus, autserus dies.
Hinc ampla vacuis spatia laxantur locis,
In quae omne mersu^ pereat humanum genus.
Nec ire labor est, ipsa deducit via.
Vt saepe puppes aestus inuitas rapit,
Sic pronus agger vrget, atque auidum chaos:
Gradumque retro flectere haud vnquam sinunt
Vmbrae tenaces. intus immenso sinu
Tacito quieta labitur Lethe vado,
Demitque curas: neue remeand^ ampliu^
Pateat facultas, flexibus multis grauem
Inuoluit a mnem. Qualis incerta vagus
Maeander vnda ludit, and cedit sibi,
Instatque dubious, littus, an fontem petat.
Palus inertis foeda Cocyti iacet.
Hic vultur, illic luctifer bubo gemit,
Omenque triste resonat infaustae Strigis.
Horrent opaca fronde nigrantes comae,
Taxo imminente, quam tenet segnis Sopor,
Famesque moesta tabido rictu iacens,
Pudorque serus conscios vultus tegit,
Mctus, Pauorque, Funus, and frendens Dolor,
Aterque luctus sequitur, and morbus tremens,
Et cincta ferro bella: in extremo abdita
Iners senectus adiuuat baculo gradum.

A. Estne aliqua tellus Cereris, aut Bacchi ferax?

T. Non prata viridi laeta facie germinant,
Nec adulta leni fluctuat Zephyro seges.
Non vlla ramos sylua pomiferos habet.
Sterilis profundi vastitas squalet soli,
Et foeda tellus torpet aeterno siti
Rerumque moestus finis, and mundi vltima:
Immotus aer haeret, and pigro sedet
Nox atra mundo, cuncta moerore horrida.
Ipsaque morte, peior est mortis locus.

Am. Quid? ille opaca qui regit sceptro loca,
Qua sede positus, temperat populos leaves?

Th. Est in recessu Tartari obscuro locus,
Quem grauibus vmbris spissa caligo alligat.
A font discors manat hinc vno latex:
Alter, quieto similis (hunc iurant Dei)
Tacente sacram deuehens fluuio Styga:
At hic tumultu rapitur ingenti ferox,
Er saxa fluctu voluit Acheron inuius
Renauigari. cingitur duplici vado
Aduersa Ditis regia, atque ingens domus
Vmbrante luco tegitur: hic vasto specu
Pendent tyranni limina, hoc vmbris iter:
Haec porta regni: campus hanc circaiacet,
In quo superbo digerit vultu sedens
Animas recentes. dira maiestas deo:
Frons torua, fratrum quae tamen specimen ge rat,
Gentisque tantae: vultus est Illi Iouis,
Sed fulminantis: magna pars regni trucis,
Est ipse dominus: cuius aspectum timet,
Quicquid timetur.

A. Verane est fama, inferis
Tam saeua reddi iura, and oblitos sui
Sceleris nocentes, debitas poenas dare?
Quis iste very rector, atque aeqni arbiter?

T. Non vnus alta sede quaesitor sedens
Iudicia trepidis sera sortitur reis:
Auditur illo Gnosius Minos foro,
Radamanthus illo: Thetidis hoc audit socer.
Quod quisque fecit, patitur: authorem scelus
Repetit, suoque premitur exemplo nocens.
Vidi cruentos carcere includi duces,
Et impotentis terga plebeia manu
Scindi tyranni. quisquis est placide potens,
Dominusque vitae seruat innocuas manus,
Et incruentum mitis imperium regit,
Animoque parcit, longa permensus di^
Foelicis aeui spatia, vel coelum petit,
Vellaetafoelix nemoris Elysii loca.
Iudex futurus sanguine humano abstine,
Quicunque regnas. scelera taxantur modo
Maiore nostra.

AM. Certus inclusos tenet
Locus nocentes, vtque fert fama, impios
Supplicia vinclis saeu^ perpetuis domant^

TH. Rapitur volucri tortus Ixion rota:
Ceruice saxum grande Sisyphease det.
In amne medio faucibus siccis senex
Sectatur vndas, abluit mentum latex,
Fidemque cum iam saepe decepto dedit,
Perit vnda: in ore poma destituunt famem.
Praebet volucri Tityus aeternas dapes:
Vrnasque frustra Danaides plenas ferunt.
Errant furentes impiae Cadmeides:
Terretque mensas auida Phineas auis.

AM. Nunc ede nati nobilem pugnam mei.
Patrui volentis munus, an spolium refert?

T. Ferale tardis imminet saxum vadis,
Stupente vbi vnda segne torpescit fretum:
Hunc seruat amne^, cultu, and aspectu horridus,
Pauidosque manes squalidus gestat senex:
Impexa pendet barba, deformem finum
Nodus coe^rcet, concauae squalent genae:
Regit ipse conto portitor longo ratem.
Hic onere vacuam littori puppim applicans,
Repetebat vndas: poscit Alcides viam,
Cedente turba: dirus exclamat Charon,
Quo pergis audax? siste propera^tem gradum.
Non passus vllas natus Alcmena moras,
Ipso coactum nauitam conto domat,
Sca^ditque puppem: cymba populorum capax,
Succubuit vni: sedit, and grauior ratis
Vtrinque Lethen latere titubante bibit.
Tunc vasta trepidant monstra, Centauri truces,
Lapithaeque, multo ad bella succensi mero.
Stygiae paludis vltimos quaerens sinus,
Foecunda mergit capita Lernaeus labor.
Post haec auari Ditis apparet domus.
Hic saenus vmbras territat Stygius canis,
Qui terna vasto capita concutiens sono,
Regnum tuetur, sordidum tabo caput
Lambunt colubri: viperis horrent iubae,
Longusque torta sibilat cauda Draco:
Patira formae. sensit vt motus pedum,
Attollit hirtas angue vibrato comas:
Missumque captat aure subiecta sonum,
Sentire and vmbras solitus. vt propior stetit
Jove natus, antro seditincertus canis,
Et vterque timuit. ecce latratu graui
Loca muta terret, sibilat totos minax
Serpens per armos: vocis horrendae fragor
Per ora missus terna, foelices quoque
Exterret vmbras. soluit a laeua feros
Tuncipse ^ictus and Cleonaeum caput
Opponit, ac se regmine ingenti clepit.
Victrice magnum dextera robur gerens,
Huc nunc, and illuc verbere assiduo rotat:
Ingeminat ictus: domitus infregit min^,
Et cuncta lassus capita submisit canis,
Antroque toto cessit. extimuit sedens
Vterque solio dominus, and duci iubet.
Me quoque potenti munus Alcidae dedit.
Tunc grauia monstri colla permulce^s manu,
Adamante texto vincit^ oblitus sui
Cust os opaci peruigil regni canis,
Componit aures timidus: and patiens trahi,
Herumque fassus, ore submisso obsequens,
Vtrunque cauda pulsat anguifera latus.
Post quam est ad oras Taenari ventu^, and nitor
Percussit ocu los lucis ignorae, bonos
Resumit animo's victus, and vastas furens
Quassat eatenas: pene vectorem abstulit,
Pronumque retrouexit, and mouit gradu.
Tunc and meas respexit Alcides manus,
Geminis vterque viribus tractum canem
Ira furentem, and bella tentantem irrita,
Intulimus orbi. vidit vt clarum aethera,
Et pura nitidi spatia conspexit poli,
Oborta nox est: lumina in terram dedit,
Compressit oculos, and diem inuisum expulit,
Aclemque retro flexit, atque omni petit
Ceruice terram: tum sub Herculea caput
Abscondit vmbra. densa sed laeto venit
Clamore turba, frontibus laurum geren^
Magnique meritas Herculis lauds canit.

Chorus. SAPPHICI HENdecasyllabi.

NAtus Eurystheus properante partu,
Iusserat mundi penetrare fundum:
Decrat hoc solum numero laborum,
Tertiae regem spoliare sortis.
Ausus est caecos ad^us inire,

Quantus Eleum coit ad tonantem,
Quinta cum sacrum reuocauit aestas:
Quanta cum longae redit hora noctis,
Crescere and somnos cupiens quietos,
Libra Phoebaeos tenet aequa currus,
Turba secretam Cererem frequentat,
Et citi tectis properant relictis,
Attici noctem celebrare Mystae:
Tanta per campos agitur silentes
Turba. pars tarda gradiens senecta,
Tristis, and long a satiata vita:
Pars adhuc currit melioris aeui,

Et comis nondum positis ephebi,

Caeteri vadunt per opaca tristes:

Actus Quartus.
Hercules. Theseus, A^phitryon. Megara. Trimetri ^ambici. VLtrice dextra fusus
aduerso Lycus
Terram cecidit ore: tu^ quisquis comes
Fuerat tyranni, iacuit and poenae comes.
Nunc sacra patri victor, and superis feram,
Caesisque meritas victimis aras colam.
Te, te laborum socia, and adiutrix preco^
Belligera Pallas, cuius in laeua ^iet

Soror sagittis aptior, Phoebus lyrae:
Fra^erque quisquis incolit coelum meus,
Non ex nouerca frater. huc appellite
Greges opimos, quiequid Indorum seges,
Arabesque odoris quidquid arboribus legunt,
Conferte in aras: pinguis exudet vapor,
Populea nostras arbor exornet comas.
Te ramus oleae fronde gentili tegat
Theseu: Tonantem nostra adorabit manus.

TH. Dii conditores v^bis, and syluestri^
Trucis antra Ceti, nobiles Dirces aquas,
Laremque regis qui aduenae Tyrium colis.

H. Date thura fla^mis.

A. Nate mana^tes prius
Manus cruenta caede, and hostili expia.

HE. Vtinam cruorem capitis inuisi deis
Libare possem, gratior nullus liquor
Tinxisset aras: victima haud vlla amplior
Potest, magisque opima mactari Ioui,
Quam rex iniquus.

A. Finiat genitor tuos
Opta labores: detur aliquando otium,
Quiesque fessis.

H. Ipse concipiam preces,
Jove, meque dignas. stet suo coelum loco,
Tellusque, and ether, astra inoffensos agant
A^terna cursus: alta pax gentes alat,
Ferrum omne teneat ruris innocui labor,
Ensesque lateant: nulla tempestas fretum
Violenta turbet: nullus irato Jove
Exiliat ignis: nullus hyberna niue
Nutritus agros amnis euersos trahat.
Venena cessent: nulla nocituro grauis
Succo tumescat herba: non saeui, ac truces
Regnent tyranni: si quod etiamnum est scelus
Latura tellus, properet: and si quod parat
Monstru^, meu^ sit. Sed quid hoc? medium diem
Cinxere tenebrae, Phoebus obscuro meat
Sine nube vultu. quis diem retro fugat,

Ignota profer^ vnde tot stellae polum

Iraque totus feruet, and morsus parat.
Iam rapiet aliquod sydus: ingenti minax
Stat ore, and ignes efflat, and rutilat iubam
Ceruice iactans. quidquid autumnus grauis,
Hyemsque gelido frigida spatio refert,
Vno impetu transiliet, and verni petet,
Frangetque Tauri colla.

A. Quod subitum hoc malum est?
Quo nate vultus huc, and huc acres refers?
Acieque falsum turbida coelum vides?

H. Perdomitatellus, tumida cesserunt freta,
Inferna nostros regna sensere impetus,
Immune coelum est, dignus Alcidae labor.
In alta mundi spatia sublimis ferar:
Petatur ether, astra promittit pater.
Quid si ^garet? non capit terra Hercule^,
Tandemque superis reddit, en vltro vocat
Omnis deorum coetus, and laxat fores,
Vnavetante. rrcipis, and reseras polum,
An contumacis ianuam mundi traho?
Dubitatur (...) etiam vincla Saturno exuam,
Contraque patris impii regnum impotens,
Auum resoluam. bella Titanes parent
Me duce furentes: saxa cum syluis fer^m,
Rapiamque dextra plena Centauris iuga.
Iam mo^te gemino limitem ad superos agam.
Videatsub Ossa Pelion Chiron suum:
In coelum Olympus tertio positus gradu

A. Infandos procul
Auerte sensus: pectoris sani parum,

H. Quid hoc? gigantes arma pestifera moue^t,
Profugit and vmbras Tity', ac lacorum gerens
Et inane pectus, quam prope a coelo stetit?
Labat Cythaeron, alta Pallene tremit,
Marcentque Tempe. rapuit hic Pindi iuga,
Hic rapuit Oethen, saeuit horrendum minans
Flammifera Erinnys: verbere excusso sonat,
Regisque adustas propius, ac propius sudes
In ora tendit: saeua Tisiphone caput
Serpentibus vallata, post raptum cane^
Portam vacantem clausit, opposita face.
Sed ecce proles regis inimicilatet,
Lyci nefandum semen: inuiso patri
Haec dextra iam vos reddet. excutiat leaves
Neruus sagittas: tela sic mitti decet
Herculea.

A. Quo se caecus inuergit furori
Vastum coactis flexit arcum cornibus,
Pharetramque soluit: stridet emissa impetu
Arundo, medio spiculum collo fugit,
Vulmere relicto.

H. Caeteram prolem eruam,
Omnesque latebras. quid morot? maius mihi
Bellum Mycenis restat, vt Cyclopea
Euersa manibus saxa nostris, concidant.
Huc eat, and illuc aula, difiecto obice,
Rumpatque posts: columen impulsum labet:
Procumbat omnis regia. hic video abditum
Gnatum scelesti patris.

A. En blandas manus
Ad genua tendens, voce miseranda rogat.
Scelus nefandum, triste, and aspectu horridum,
Dextram precantem rapuit, and circa furens
Bis, ter rotatum misit. ast illi caput
Sonat, cerebro tecta dispersa madent.
At misera paruum protegens natum sinu
Megara, furenti similis e latebris fugit.

HE. Licet Tonantis profuga condaris sinu,
Petet vndecunque temet haec dextra, and feret.

A. Quo misera pergis? quam fuga^, aut latebras petis?
Nullus salutis Hercule infenso est locus:
Amplectere ipsum potius, and blanda prec^
Lenire tenta.

M. Parce iam coniux precor.
Agnosce Megaram, nat^s hic vultus tuos,
Habitusque reddit: cernis vt tendit manus?

H. Teneo nouercam: sequere, da poenas mihi,
Iugoque pressum libera turpi Iouem:
Sed ante matre^ paruulu^ hoc mo^stru^ auferam.

M. Quo tendis amens* sa^guine^ fundes tuum?

A. Pauefactus infans igneo vultu patris,
Perit ante vulnus: spiritum rapuit timor.
In coniugem nunc claua libraturgrauis:
Perfregit ossa, corpori trunco caput
A best, nec vsqua^ est. cernere hoc audes nimi^
Viuax senectus? si piget luctus, habes
Mortem paratam. pectus in tela indue,
Vel stipitem istum caede monstrorum illitum,
Convert. falsum, ac nomini turpem tuo
Remove parentem, ne tuae laudi obstrepat.

T. Quo te ipse genitor obuium morti ingeris?
Quo pergis amens? profuge, and obtectus late,
Vnumque manibus aufer Herculeis scelus.

H. Been habet, pude^di regis excisa est domus.
Tibi hunc dicatum maximi coniux Iouis
Gregem cecidi: vota persolui libens
Te digna, and Argos victimas alias dabit.

A. Nondum litasti nate, consumma sacrum.
Stat ecce ad aras hostia, expectat manum
Ceruice prona. praebeo, occurro, insequor,
Macta. Quid hoc est? errat acies luminum,
Visusque moeror hebetat. an video Herculis
Manus trementes? vultus in somnum cadit
Et fessa ceruix capite summisso labat,
Flexo genu: iam totus ad terram ruit,
Vt caesa syluis ornus, aut portus mari
Datura moles, viuis? an leto dedit
Idem, tuos qui misit ad mortem, furor?
Sopor est, reciprocos spiritus motus agit.
Detur quieti tempus, vt somno grauis
Vis victa morbi, pectus oppressum leuet.
Remouete famuli tela, ne repetat furens.

Chorus. Anapaestici, Adonii duo.

FINIS.
THE FIRST ACT.
Juno alone. ISyster of the thunderer, (for now that name alone remaynes to
me) Jove evermore as though deuorste and gone,

And temples of the highest air as w^we shunned have,
And beaten out of skies above the place to harlots gave.
I muite go dwell beneathe on ground, for hoores do hold the sky.
From hens the bear in part above of y^ye p^le full hye,
A haughty star the greekysh shypps by seas does guide about.
From this way, whe^s at spryng time warm the days is loased out,
Europ^es bearer through the waves of Tyria shynes full bright.
From th^s, their stormy fearful flock to shypps, and seas affright,
The wandryng daughters here and there of Atlas upward swaye.
With staryng bushe of hear from hens Orion gods does fraye:
And Perseus eke his glyttryng stars of golden gloss has here.
From hens the twynns of Tyndars stocks do shine, a sign full clear:
And at whose birth first stood the ground that erste went too and fro.
Nor only Bacchus now himself, or Bacchus mother lo,
Have clymbde to gods: least any part should from rebuke be free,
The skies the Gnossian strumpets crounes do bear in spite of me.
But I of ollde contempts complain: me, one dire, fierce, and shrewde
Thebana land, with wicked brood of Jove's base daughters strewde,
How often has it a stepdame made? though up to heaven should rise,
The conqueryng drabbe Alcmena now, and hold my place in skies,
And eke her son to promysde stars obtain the woorthye way,
At birth of whom the staying world so long deferrde the day,
And Phoebus slow from morning sea begoon to glyster bright,
Commanded long in the ocean waves to hyde his drowned light:
Yet shall my hates not leave them so. a wrathful kyndlyng rage
His mind in madness shall stir up, and ire that may not swag^
Shall evermore (all peace laid down) wage wars eternally.
What wars? what ever hydous thing the earth his ennemy
Begetts, or what soever sea, or air has brought to sight
Both dreadful, dire, and pestplent, of cruel flercest might,
It Is tierde, and taemde: he passes all, and name by ylls does raise,
And all my wrath he does enjoy: and to his greatter praise
He turns my hates: while tedyous tails to much I him beehest,
He proves what father him begot. both the^, where light epprect
Has sea, and where it showde again, where ^an day does crayne,
And with his brande approchyng near does dye those Aethiops twain,
His strength vntamde is honored: and god each where is he
Now calde in world. and now more (...) of monsters want to me,
And labor less to Hercles is t'accomplyshe all my will,
Then me to bydde: at ease he doothe mine imperies fulfill.
What cruel hestes of tyrant now so fierce a young man may
Prevail to hurt? for lo he bears for weapons now away
What once he fearde, and put to flight: he armed comes at side
With lion fierce, and Hydra both: nor land suffiseth wide,
But broake he has the thresholde lo of that infernal Jove,
And spoils with him of conquerde king be draws to godds above.
But that's but light, broke is the league of sprightes that there do dwell.
I saw my self, I saw him lo (the night now gone of hell,
And Ditis taemde) throw out abroad before his fathers sight
His brothers spoils. Why draws he not ^ppreste and bound by might
Himself in chains that equal things to Jove by lotte does hold?
And bear the rule of captyue hell, and way to Styx unfold?
Up opened is from lowest ghosts the backewarde way to shye,
And sacred secrets of dire death in open sight do lie.
But he (the dreadful den of sprights break up) full fiercs and stout
Even ^uer me doothe triumph l^, and with proud hand about
The ^oule black dog by Grekishe towns he leads from hell away.
When seen was ugly Cerberus I saw the fadyng day,
And fearful soon: even melykewyse a tremblyng dread oppreste,
And lookyng on the fylthy necks of conquerde monstrous beast,
I feared much mine own behests. but light things I complain,
For heaven I may be frayde, least he may get the highest rain,
That lowest won. the sceptors from his father will he take,
Nor he to stars (as Bacchus dy^) his way will gently make:
The way with ruin will he seek, and be in empty skies
Will reygne alone. with force displayde his haughtye heart doothe rise,
And he, that heaven it self, by force of his might gotten be,
It bearyng learnde: quight underneath the world his headsette he,
Nor ones his shoulders bowde, the payse of such a mighty mas:
And mydst of heaven on Hercles neck alone lo settled was.
His neck vnwryde the stars above and skies did only stay:
And me likewise oppressyng him, to Gods he seeks the way.
Go Ire, go on, and beat him down that great things doothe invent,
Match thou with him, and with thy hands now thou thy self him rent.
Such hates why dooste thou meditate? Let all wild beasts now go:
And weary Eurystheus now be free from geeuyng charges me.
The Titans daryng once of Jove to break the imperye
Send out: let loase the den abroad of mount of Sicilye.
The Doricke land that with the turn^ of giant quakes afraid,
Let it bring forth the dredefull necke^ of mon^er vnderlayde.
Let yet the haughty moon above some other beasts beeget.
But these he overcame. seekst thou a matchet' Alcides yet?
There Is none, except himself: let him against him self rebel.
Let present be from bottom deep vpraysde of lowest hell
The Eumenides, let flaming locks of theyrs the fyres out flyng,
And furious hands beestowe about the strokes of vypers styng.
Go now full proud, and skale the skies to seats of godds make way.
Now must thy battles wage^ be, full clear lo shynes the day.
Despise ma^s works: think ye fierce wight that hell and souls allow
Thou haste escapte? nay here I will an other hell the show.
In deep myste hyd I will call up from bottom low of hell
Beyond the ways of gylty ghostes rebatefull goddess fell.
where as the roaryng dreadful den resoundes with cries about,
From deepest bond of Ditis reign beneathe I will fette out,
what so is left. Let hateful hurt now come in anger wood,
And fierce imptetie em^rewe him self with his own blood,
And error eke, and fury armde against it self to foght.
This mean, this mean, let wrath of mine now use to show my might.
Begin ye servants now of hell: the fervent burning tree
Of pyne shake up: and set with snakes her dreadful flock to see
Let now Megaera bring to sight: and with her mournful hand
for burning roage bring out of hell a huge and direful brande.
Do this, require you vengeance due, and pains of hell his spoil,
Stryke through his breaste: let fiercer flame within his bosom boil,
Then which in Aetna furnace beats so furiousely to see.
That mad of mind and witles may Alcides driven be
With fury great through pierced quight, my self must first of all
Be mad. Wherefore does Juno yet not in to ragyng fall?
Me, met, ye Furies, systers three thrown quight out of my wit
Cosse first, if any thing to do I do endeavor yet
For stepdame meet: let now my hates be turnde an other way.
Let him (returnde) his babes behold in safety, I you pray,
And strong of hand come home: I have now found the day at length,
In which may greatly me avail the hated Hercles strength.
Both me, and eke him self let him subdue, and wyshe to dye
Returnde from hell. yea let it here be my commoditye,
That he of Ious begotten is: here present will I stand,
And that his shafts go straight from bow, I will direct his hand:
The mad man's weapons will I guide, Even Hercles fyghtyng (...)
At length I Will aid. This gylt once done then leefull is that so
His father may admytte to skies those gyltie hands of his.

THE SECOND ACT.
Megara. QGuyder great of heaven, and of the world o judge full hye,
Yet now at length apoynt a mean^ of careful myserye,
And end of our calamity. to me yet never day
Has careless shynde, the end of one affliction paste away
Beginning of an other is: an other enemy
Is forthwith fownde, before that he his joyful famylye
Return unto, an other fight he takes by behest:
Nor any respite given is to him nor quiet rest,
But while that he commanded is: straight him pursues she
The hateful June. Was yet once from toil and labor free
His infantes age? the monsters lo he vanquysht has and slain,
Before he knew what monsters meant. The skaled serpents twain
Their double necks drew on toward him, against the which to rise,
The infant crepte to meet with them, the serpents glyttryng eyes
Like fire, with quiet careless breast he lookyng fast upon,
With cou^tnance clear, hard wrested kkots of them he caught anon:
And stranglyng then the swellyng throats of them with tender hand,
To Hydraprelude made, the beast so swyfte of Maenale land,
That with much gold bare up full bright his beautified head,
Is caught in course. of Nemey wood likewise the greatest dread
The lion pressed with Hercles arms has rearde with dreadful cry.
What should I speak of stables dyre of steedes of Bystonye?
Or king cast out him self for food his horses fierce to fill?
And brittled beast in thick topps wont of Crymanthus hill,
The boar of Maenalye, the woodds of Arcady to shake.
And bull that did no little dreads to hundred peoples make?
Among the flocks of Hesper land that hens far distant be,
The shepherde of Cartesian coast of tryple shape to see
Is slain, and driven is the pray from farthest part of weaste,
Cithaeron quakte when by him past to sea the well known beast.
He being bid to make by coasts of summer son his way,
And parched lands whche sore with heat does boil the myddell day,
The mountayns brake on either side and rampters all undone,
Even unto swyfte and ragyng sea has made a way to roon.
Then entryng in of plenteous wood the pleasant gardeyns gaye,
The wakyng dragons golden spoils with him he brought away.
The Lerna monsters numerous ill what need to tell have I?
Has he not him with fire at length subdewde, and taught to dye?
And which were wont with wyngs abroad to hyde the day from sight,
Even from the clouds he sought and drove the Srymphale birds to flight.
Not him subdewde who ever lies in bed unmatched at night
The wyddowe queen of them that took to Thermodont their flight.
Nor hands that well durst enterprise his noble trauayles all
The fylthy labor made to shrynke of foul Augias hall.
What veil all these? he wants the world which often defended he.
And th'erthe well knows the woorker of his quietness to be
Away from earth: the prosperous gylt that bears happy swaye,
Is virtue callde, and now the good to wicked do obaye.
The right does stand in might of arms, fear treads down the law.
Before my face with cruel hand even presently I saw
Reuengers of their fathers reygne the sons with swoorde down cast,
And of the noble Cadmus eke himself the ofspryng last
Then slain: I saw his regal crown at once from him away
With head byreft. Who Thebes alas enough bewail now may?
The fertile land of godds, what lord now quakes it for to know?
Out of the fields of which sometime, and fruitful bosom low.
The youth vpsprong with sword in hand preparde to battle stood:
And walls of which Amphion one of mighty Jove his brood,
Has buylt with sowndyng melody in drawyng to the stones:
To town of whom the parent chief of Godds not only ones
Heaven being left has come, this land that godds above always
Receyuds, and which has made them godds, and (leefull beete to say)
Perhapps shall make, with loathsome yoke of bondage is priest down.
O Cadmus stock, and citezens of old Amphions town,
Whereto are ye now fallne? dread ye a cowardly exul thus,
His coasts to dwell in lachyng, and to ours injurious?
Who through the world pursues the gyllts and wrong by sea and land,
And cruel sceptors broken has with just and ryghtfull hand,
Now absent serves, and what he ea^e in other doothe sustayns:
And now does vannyshr Lycus hold of Hercles Thebes the rain.
Yet shall he not: he shall come home, And him with vengeaunte quight,
And sudden ryfe to stars: he will Soon find the way to light,
Or make it else. return thou sat, repair to thine in haste:
And conqueror to conquerde house yet come again at last.
Rise up my spouse, and darkness deep repellde of helly shade
Break up with hand, if no way may for thee kept back be made,
And passage be shette up, return with world vprent by might.
And what soever lythe possessed byneathe in darkest night,
Send out with thee. as when the topps of haughty hills undone
A hedlong passage making through for hasty floude to roon
Thou sometime stoodst, wha^ with great might of thine asunder broake
The Tempye woods wide open lay: and beaten with thy stroke
Of more renowns.

MEG. what wretches (...) most chiefly wyshe of all,
They soon believe.

AM Nay what they fear to much least it may fall,
They think it never may be shoonde, nor rydde by remedy.

MEG. Belief is ready still to dread the woorser myse^ye.
Deep drownde, and whelimde, and farthermore with all the world full low
Oppressed down, what ways has he to light again to go?

AM. What way I pray you had he then when through the burning cost,
And tumblyng after manner of the troubled sea up toste
He went by sands: and freate that twyse with ebb away doothe slyppe,
And twyse vpflowe: and when alone with his forsaken ship,
Fast caught he stuck in shallowe foordes of shelfy^ Syrtes sand.
And (now his ship on ground) did pass through seas a foot to land?

MEG. Injurious fortune virtue most of men most stout and strong
Doothe seldom spare: no man alive Himself in safety long
I Will give the secret sacrifyce: to thee with much faith lo
Long fire brandes at Eleusis town full sylent will I throe.
Then to my brethern shall I think to be restoarde again
Their sowles, and eke himself alive and guydyng of his rain
My father for to flouryshe yet. if any greater might
Deo keep thee shette, we follow thee: with thy return to sight
Defend us all, or else to hell draw down us all to thee.
Thou shall us draw, no god shall raise us up that broken be.

AMPHITRYON. MEGARA. O Faithful fellow of our blood, with chaste true
faythfulnes
The bridebed keeping, and the sonns of haughty Hercules,
Conceive in mind some better things, and take good heart to thee:
He will come home, as after all his labors woonteth he,
The mownt, now here, now there fell dow^ and rampire rent of stay,
The ragyng brook of Thessaly did roon a new fownde way.
Thy parents so, thy soons, thy land repayryng home to see,
Break out, and lowest bond of things out bryngyng thens with thee,
And what soever greedy age in all these long years race
Has hyd, show forth, and ghosts that have forgotte their former case,
And people up before th^e drive that fearful are of light.
Unworthy spoils for thee they are, if thou but bring to sight
What bydden is. great things, but far to much I speak for me,
Unwotyng of mine own estate. when shall I hap to see,
The day when thee, and thy right hand, I may embrace again,
And slow returns, nor yet of me once myndefull, may complain?
To thee for this O guide of godds, untamed bulls shall bring
Their hundred necks: to thee O queen^ of fruits on earth that spryng
To peryls great and dangers may so often times out cast.
Whom chance doothe often ouerslippe, the same yt fyndes at last.
But cruel lo, and grievous threats even bearyng in his face,
And such as he of stomach is, doothe come even such of pace,
Proud Lycus who the sceptors shakes in band of other king,
The plentuous places of the town of Thebes gouernyng,
And every thing about the which with fertyle soil does go
Sloape Phocis, and what ever doothe Ismenus ouerflo^,
What ever thing Cith^ron seethe with haughty top and hye,
And slender Isthmos isle, the which between two seas does lie.

Lycus, Megara, Amphitryon. NOt I of native country bowres Possess the
ancient right
Unworthy heir nor yet to me are noble men of might,
The grandfathers, nor stock renownd^ with titles hy^ of name,
But noble virtue: who so boastes of kynred whence he came,
Of others virtue makes his v^wnte. but got with fearful hand
My sceptors are obtaynde: in swoorde does all my safety stand.
What thee thou wottst against the will of cytesyns to get,
The bright drawn sword must it defend. in forayne counttey set
No stable kingdom is. But one my pomp and princely might
May ratifye, once ioynde to me with regal torche full bright,
And chambers Megara: of stock of such nobilitee
Let vpstarte state of mine take shape. I do not think that she
Refuse it will, or in the bed with me despise to lie.
But if with proud unbridled mynd^ thee stubberne do deny,
Then quyght I purpose to destroy the house of Hercules.
The hate of men will then my pride, and peoples speech oppres.
Chiese knacke of kingdom is to bear Thy subjects hares each one.
Lets prove her then, chance given has To us a place alone.
For she her head in fold of daple full sad and woefully
Enwrapt, the gods that are her guydes for succor stands fast by,
And at the side of her doothe lean A^cides father true.

MEG. What thing does this destroier of our stock, again a new
Prepare? what proves he?

LY. O queen That name renowned hye
And title takste of regal stock, full gentle and easyly
A little while receive and bear my words with pacient ear.
If always men eternal hates should one to the other bear,
And rage beeg^on, out of the heart should never fall away,
But th'happy still should armor hold th'unhappye still obaye,
Then shall the battayles nothing leave: with wide fields then the lands
Shall lie vntyllde, with vnderlayde to housen fyrybrande
Then ashes deep shall over whelme the buried people all.
Expedient is to conqueror to wyshe that peace befall:
To conquerde needful, partener of the kingdom come to me:
Letts ioyn our mynds, take here this pledge of faith and truth to thee:
My right hand touch. Why whishtest thou with cruel face and mood?

MEG. Should I abide, that I the hand sprinkte with my fathers blood,
Should touch and double death enbrewde of both my brethren? nay
First shall son rise extinguishe quyght, And weste shall bring the day:
First faithful peace between the snowes and fyres there shall be tryde,
And Scylla shall t'Ausonius first join his Sicilyan side,
And first, the fleeyng floude that with swyfte turns of course deothe flow
Euripus, with Euboik wave shall stand full still and slow.
My father the empire, brethern, house, Thou haste me clear berefte
My country to: what may be more? one thing to me is left,
Then brother, father, kingdom, house, that deerer is to me
The hate of thee: the which to me with people for to be
In commune, woe I am: how great is mine allonely part?
Rule on full proud, bear up full hye thy sprights and haughty heart:
Yet god the proud behind their backs does follow them to wreake.
I know the The bane kingdoms. What should I the mothers speak,
Both suffryng, and aduentryng gylts? what double myschefe done?
And myxed name of spouse at once, of father and of son?
What bretherns double tents? or what as many roages also?
The mother proud of Tantalls brood congealde in mournyng lo,
And sorry stone yet flows with tears in Phrygian Sipylye.
Himself like wise erectyng up his skaled head awrye,
Even Cadmus measuryng throughout th'Illyrian lands in flight,
Behind him left of body drawn long slyniye marks in sight.
All these examples wait for thee: rule thou as lykes thy will,
While thee our kyngdoms woonted fates do call and often hapte ill.

LY. Go ^o, these fierce and furious words thou woman mad refrain:
And imperies of princes learn of Hercles to sustain.
Though I the sceptors gotten by the force of war do bear
In conquryng hand, and all do rule without the law his fear
Which arms subdue, a few words yet to thee now speak I shall
For this my cause: thy father did in blouddy battle fall:
Thy brethren fell: the weapons keep n^ measurable stay.
For neither easyly tempred be, nor yet repressed may
The drawn swoordes ire: the battles does the blood delyght out shed.
But he yet for his kingdom fought, we all together led
With wicked lust: yet the end of war is now complained lo,
And not the cawse. but no we let all remembrance thereof go:
When conqueror has weapons left, the conquerds part should be
To leave his hates. No^ I that thou with lowly bended knee
Me reigning worship should, require: Even this does me delight,
That thou thy myseries do bear with mind so s^oute upright.
Thou for a king a sp^use art meet, letts join our bedd^ anon.

MEG. A tre^blng cold does run throughout my bloudlesse lyms each one.
What heinous thing comes to mine ears? I fearde not then at all,
When (all peace broake) the noise of war did by the city wall
^sounde about, I bare all that vnfeare fully to see,
I fear the weddyng chambers: now I captyue seem to me.
Let heavy chains my body grieve, and ^ke with hunger long
Let lyngryng death be slowly brought, yet shall no force full strong
My truth subdue: for even thine own^ (...) will I dye.

LY. Does then thy husband drowned in hell give thee this stomach hye?

MEG. Thehells allow he touched, that he
The heyght again might get.

LY. The heavy payse oppresses him
Of all the earth full great.

MEG. He with no burdeyn shall be pressed, that heaven it self ^ustaynde.

LY. Thou shall be forced.

M^. He wo^s not how to dye, that is constraynde.

LY. Speak, what may rather I prepare then weddyng new for the
More ^oyall gift*

MEG. Thine own death else, or else the death of me.

LY. Then shall mad woman dye.

MEG I shall then to my husband go.

LY. More then my sceptors is to thee a servant loved so?

MEG. How many has this servant ^ayne of kings with handye stroke?

LY. Why do^he he yet a king then serus, and still ^ustayne his yoke?

MEG. Take once away the hard behests, what is virtue then at la^e?

LY. Doo^e thou it virtue count, to be to beasts, and monsters cast?

MEG. ^is virtues part, to tame the things, that all men quake to know.

LY. Him great things braggyng, darkness deep o^ (...) press full low.

ME. There never may from grownd to stars an easy passage be.

LY. Of whom be got, the housen then of godds through pearceth he?

AM. O wretched wife of Hercles great, thy words a while now spare.
My part it is, the father of Alcides to declare,
And his true stock. yet after all of man so stout as this
So famous deeds, and after all Appeasde with hand of his
What ever Titan risen up, Doothe see, orels at fall,
And after all these monsters taemde, and Phlegrey sprynkled all
With wicked blood, and after godds defended all on hye,
Is not his father yet well known? Or Jove do we beelye?
Believe it yet by Iunoes hate.

LY. why dooste thou sclawnder Jove?
No mortal kynred ever may be myxte with heaven above.

AM. To many of the godds in skies is this a common trade.

LY. But were they ever servants yet, before they godds were made?

AM. Of Delos isle the shepherde los the flocks of Pherey fed.

LY. But through all coasts he wandered not abroad as banyshed.

AM. Whom straying mother first brought forth in wandryng land to sight.

LY. Yet Phoebus did no monsters fear, or beasts of cruel might.

AM. First dragon with his blood embrewde the shafts of Phoebus lo.
How grievous ylls even yet full young he bare, do you not knoe?
From mothers womb the babe out thrown with lyghtnyng flame from hye,
Even next his lyghtnyng father stood forthwith above in sky.
What? he him self that guydes the stars, and shakes the clouds at will,
Did not that infant lurk in den of hollow caued hill?
The byrthes so great full troublous price to have lo^ allways ought:
And ever to be borne a God, with cost full great is bought.

LY. Whom thou a myser seeste, thou may Know him a man to be.

AM. A myser him deny ye may, whom stout of heart ye see.

Ly. Call we him stout, from shoulders hye of whom the lion thrown
A gift for maiden made, and eke his clubbe from hand fell down,
And painted side with purple weed did shine that he did wear?
Or may we him call stout of heart, whose staryng locks of hear
With ointme^t flowde? who hands renownde and known by praises hye
To sownde unmeet for any man of timber did apply,
With barbarous mytar cloasyng in his forhed rownde about?

AM The tender Bacchus did not blushe abroad to have laid out
His brayded hears, nor yet with hand full soft the Thyrsus light
For to have shook, what time that he with pace vnstoute in sight
His long trained barbarous garment drew with gold full fair to see.
Still virtue after many works is wont releaste to be.

LY. Of this the house of Curitus destroyde doothe witness bear,
And virgins flocks that brutyshly by him oppressed wear.
No Juno did commawnde him this, Nor none Eurystheus lo.
But these in deed his own woorks are.

AM. Yet all ye do not knoe.
His work it is with weapons of his own hand vanquyshed
Both Eryx, and to Eryx ioynde Anteus Lybian ded:
And aultars which with slaughter of the strangers flowyng fast,
Busyris well deserved blood likewise have droonke at last.
His deed it is, that he that met the wownde, and swoorde is flayne
Constraynde to suffer death before those other Geryons twain.
Nor one allonely Geryon does with one hand conquerde lie.
Thou shall among these he: which yet with none adulterye
Have wedlock hurt.

LY. What is to Ione to king is leefull thing:
To Jove thou gaufts a wife, thou shall now give one to a king.
And even of thee she shall it learn to be a thing not new,
Her husband even approuyng it the better man t'ensewe.
But y^ she stubberne to be matched with me deny it still,
Then even by force a noble child Of her beget I will.

MEG. O Creons ghosts, and all ye godds of th'howse of Labdacus,
And weddyng torches blasyng bright, of wicked Oedipus,
To this my weddyng give ye now our woonted destenies.
Now, now ye bloody daughters all of Egyptes king likewise,
Be here whose hands desyled are with so much blood out spylt:
One daughter lacks of Danaus, I will fill by the gylt.

Ly. Because that stubburnely thou dooest refuse my weddyng so,
And fearste a king, thou shall know what the sceptors now may do.
Enbrace thine aultars, yet no god shall ever take away
Thee from my hands: no not although with world vpturned, may
Alcides victor yet again to gods above return.
The wodos on he apes together cast, let all their temples burns
Even thrown upon their heds: his wife, and all his flock at last
With vnderlayed fire, let one wood pyle consume and waste.

AM. This only bowne I father of Alcides ask of thee,
Which well may me beseem to crave, that I first slain may be.

LY. Who all appoynts with present death to have their punishment,
He tyrant wotts not how to be: more sundry greeues invent.
Restrain the wretched man from death, command that th'happy dye.
I, while with beams preparde to burn the pyle increases hye,
Will him with vowyng sacrifyce that rules the seas entreat.

AM. Oh chiefest power of godde, and oh of heavenly things so great
The guide, and parent eke, with whose thrown thunderboltes do shake
All things humane throughout the world, of king so cruel slake
The wicked hand: but why do I to godds in vain thus cry?
Where ever thou be hear me soon. why starte so sodaynlye
The temples thus with mouyng sha^ Why roareth out the grownde?
The noise of hell from bottom deep byneathe has made a sownde:
We herd are, lo it is the sownde of Hercules his pace.

Chorus. O fortune hatyng men of stoutest breast, how ill rewards do thou to
good deuyde?
Eurystheus raynes at home in easy rest,
Alcinenaes son in every battle tryde,
To mu^sters turns his hand yt skies did stay: and cruel necks cuts of of
hydous snake,
And apples bryngs from systers mokt away, when e^ce to sleep his watcheful
eyes betake,
Did dragon set rich fruit to ouersee. he past (...) Scythia^ bowres y^ stray
abroad,
And those that in their countries strangers be and hardened top of frolen
freat he croade,
And sylent sea with banks full du^me about. the waters hard w^t there their
floods to flo.
And where before yt ships full sails spread out is worn a pathe for Sarmates
wyld to go.
The sea does stand to move in course again, now apt to bear the ship, now
horsemen bold
The queen yt there does over wydows rayn, yt girds her womb with girth of
glittryng gold,
Her noble spoil from body drawn has she and shield, and bands of breast as
white as snow,
Acknowlegyng the conqueror with knee. with what hope drawn to hedle^g hell
allow,
S^ bold to pass the vnreturned ways s^st thou Proserpines rain of Sicylye?
With southern wid, or western there no se as arise with wave and swellyng
surges hye.
Not there of Tyndars stock yt double brood two stars the fearful ships do
aid and guide. with gulf full blak does stand yt slothful flood and when pale
death with gredyteeth so wide

Unnu^bred nations has set down to sprights with one boat man all over feryed
be.
God grant thou may of hl subdue yt tights
And vnreueked webs of systers three,
There king of many people reigns he, who when thou did with Nestors Pylos
fight,
Pesti^erous hands applide to match we thee and weapon bare with triple mace
of might:
And pricked with little wound he fled away, and lord of death himself did
fear to dye.
Break fate by force: and let the sight of day to sorry sprights of hell
apparentlye, and porche vnpast show way to gods above. the cruel lords of
sprights with pleasant song

And humble bown full well could Orpheusmoue while he Eurydicen them craves among.
The art yt drew woods, birds, and stones at w^ which made delay to floods of
flitting flight
At sound whereof the savage beasts stood still with tunes vnwo^t does ghosts of
hell delight
And cleerer does resounde in darker place: and weep with tears did gods of
cruel breast:
And they which fautes with to severe a face do seek, and former gylt of
ghosts out wrest:
The Thracian daughters wails Eurydice^. for her the judges weeping sit also.
We co^querd ar, chief king of death said the^ to godds (but under this
condition) go,
Behynd thy husbands back keep y^ thy way, look thou not back thy wife before
to see,
Tha^ the to sight of gods has brought yt day and gate of Spartane Taenare
present be.
Love hates delay, nor could abide so long. his gift, he lost, while he
desires the sight.
The place yt could be thus subdewd we song that place may soon be ouercom by
might.

THE THIRD ACT.
Hercules. QComfortable guide of light, and honor of the sky,
That co^passyng both hemyspheres with flaming charyot his
Thy radiant head to joyful lands about the world doste bring,
Thou Phoebus pardon give to me, if any unlawful thing
Thine eyes have seen: (commanded) I have here to light out fette
The secrets of the world: and thou of heaven o guyder grette,
And parent eke, in flashe out thrown of lyghtnyng hyde thy sight.
And thou that gouernest the seas with second sceptors might,
To bottom synke of deepest waves: who so from hye does see,
And dreadyng yet with cowntnance new the earth defylde to be,
Let him from hens turn back his sight, and face to heaven uphold,
These monstrous syghts to shoon: let twain this mischief great behold,
He who it brought, and she that badde. for paynefull toils to me,
And labors long, not all the earth thowght wide enough may be
For Iunoes hate: things vncome to of all men I did see,
Unknown to son, and spaces wide that dark and shadesull be
Which woorser poale geeues dyrer Jove to reign and rule theryn.
And yet if third place pleasyd more for me to enter in,
I there could reign. the Chaos of eternal night of hell,
And worse then night, the doleful godds I have that there dood ^ll,
And fates subdude, the death contemnde I am returnde to light.
What yet remaynes? I saw and showde the spryghts of hell to sight:
Appoynte, if ought be more, doste thou my hands so long permyt
Juno to cease? what thing bydst thou to be subdued yet?
But why do cruel sowldyars hold the holy temples wide?
And dread of armor sacred porche beset on every side?

Amphitryon, Hercules, Theseus. Do either else my great desires delude and
mock mine eyes?
Or has the tamer of the world and greeks renown likewise,
For sooke the silent house, besette with cloud full sad to see?
Is this my soon? my members lo for joy amassed be.
Oh son, the sure, and sauegarde late of Thebes in mysery,
See I thy body true in deed? or else deceyude am I
Most with thy spright? art thou the same^ these brawnes of arms I know,
And shoulders, and thy noble hands From body hye that grow.

HER. Whens (father) happs this vglynes, And why in mournyng cladde
Is thus my wife? how happs it that with fylthe so foul bestadde
My children are? what myserye doothe thus my house oppress?

AM. Thy father in la^e is slain: the kingdom Lycus doothe possess.
Thy sons, thy parent, and thy wife to death pursues he.

HER. Ungrateful land, does no man come that will an ayder be
Of Hercles house? and this beheld so great and heinous wrong
Has the aided worlds? but why wear I the day in playnt so long?
Let th'enmy dye: and this renown let strength obtain in haste,
And of Alcides enmyes all let Lycus be the last.
I driven am to go to shed the blood of enmye out.
Watch Theseu, that no sudden strength beeset us here about.
Me wars require. enbracyng yet defer O father dear,
And wife defer them: Lycus shall to hell this message bear
That I am now returnde.

THE. Shake of O queen out of thine eyes
This weepyng face, and thou sens that thy son is safe likewise
Thy droppyng tears refrain: if yet I Hercles ever knew,
Then Lycus shall for Creon pay the pains to him full dew.
It Is light, he shall: he doothe: and that's to light, he has it done.

AM. Now god that can them bring to pass, speed well our wyshes soon,
And come to help our weary woes. O noble hearted mate
Of my stout son, of his renown declare us all the rate:

How long a way doothe lead to place where sorry sprights do dwell,
And how the hard and heavy bonds the dog has borne of hell.

THE. The deeds y^ do constrayne to tell, that even to mind secure
Are dreadful yet and horrible, scant yet the trust is sure
Of vital air, sore blunted is the sharpness of my sight,
And dulled eyes do scant sustain to see th'vnwoonted light.

AM. Yet Theseus throwghly overcome what ever fear remaynes
In bosom deep, nor do thou not of best fruit of thy pains
Beguylde thy self. What thing has once to suffer been a care,
To have remembered it is sweet. those dreadful hap declare.

THE. All right of world, and thee likewise I pray that bearste the rain
In kingdom wide, and thee, for whom All rownde about in dayne
Thy mother throughout Aetna sowght, that secret things allow
And hid in grownde, it freely may be lawful for to show.
The Spartane land a noble top of hill aduaunceth hye,
Where Taenarus with woods full ^hycks the sea doothe ouerlye.
The house of hateful Ditis here his mowthe doothe ^pen set,
And rocks of hill about doothe gape, and with a den full grette
A huge and gapyng clefte of grownd^ with jaws full wide doothe lie,
And way full broad to people all does spredde to pass thereby.
Not straight with darkness does begin The way that blyndes the sight.
A little lyngryng bryghtnes lo behind of late left light,
And dubtfull glyttryng yet of son afflicted falls allow,
And mocks the sight: such light is wont undoubtedly to show
The dawne of day, or twylyght else at edge of euenyng tide.
From hens to hollow places void Are loaste the spaces wide,
To which needs peryshe must all kind of men that once are thrown.
Nor it a labor is to go, the way it self leads down.
As often the shypps against their wylles do the toss the swellyng surge,
So down ward does that hedlong way, and greedy Chaos urge:
And back again to draw thy pat^thee never do permytte
The sprights who what they catch hold fast. allow within doothe flytte
In channel wide with sylent foorde the quiet lake of lethe,
And cares does rydde: and that theremay to escape again from death
No mean be made, with many turns and wyndyngs every way
Foldes in his floode. in such sort as with wave unsure doothe play
Maeander wandryng up and down, And yeldes himself unto,
And dowbtfull stands, if he toward bank, or back to spryng may go.
The soul and fylthy peole to see of slow Cocytus lies.
On the one the grype, on the other side the mournful howlet cries,
And sad luck of the unhappy Strix likewise resoundeth there.
Full vglyelye in shady bows black locks of lethsome hear,
Where Taxus tree does over lean, which holds slothful sleep,
And hunger sad with famysht law that lies his place to keep,
And shame to late does hyde his face that knows what crimes it has,
Both fear, and quakyng, funeral, and frettyng ragyng wrath,
And mournyng dyre does follow on, and tremblyng pale disease,
And boystrous battles set with swoorde: and hid beyond all thease
Does slothful age his lyngryng pace healpe forth with staff in hand.

AM. Of corn and wine in hell allow is any fertile land?

THE No joyful meades do there bring forth with face so green and fair,
Nor yet with gentle Zephyrus wagges ripened corn in the air.
Nor any tree has there such bows as do bring apples out.
The barrayne compass of deep soil full filthy lies about,
And withred with eternal drought the loathsome land does wa^e
And bond full sad of things, and of the worllde the places last:
The air unmoved stands, and night sytts there full dark to see
In slothful world, all things by dread^ full horrible there be.
And even far worse then death it self, is place where death doothe bide.

AM. What? ^e that does those places dark with regallsceptor gwyde,
In what seat set, does he dispose and rule those peoples light?

THE. A place there is in turn obscure of Tartarus from sight,
Which mist full thick with fearful shade doothe hold and ouergoe.
From hens a double parted stream from one wellspryng doothe floe:
The tone, much like a standing poole (by this the godds do swear)
The which the sacred Stygian lake with silent floude doothe bear:
The the other fierce with tumulte great is drawn his course to go,
And Archeron with ragyng flood^ the stones dryues to and froe
Unsaylable. with double foorde is rounoe about besette
Against it Ditis palayce dyre, and manspon house full grette
In shadefull wood is covered: from wide den here the posts
And thresholds of the tyrant hang, this is the walk of ghosts:
This of his kingdom is the g^te: a field about it goes,
Where syttyng with a countnaunce proud^ abroad he doothe dispose
New sowles, a cruel majesty is in the god to know:
A frownyng forhead, which yet of his brethren bears the show,
And so great stocks: there is in him of Jove the very face,
But when he lyghtens: and great part of cruel kingdoms place,
Is he himself the lord thereof: the sight of who^e does fear,
What ever thing is fearde.

AM. Is fam^ in this point true, that there
Such rygours are, and gyltie ghosts of men that there remain
Forgetful of their former fault, have their deserved pain?
Who is the rector there of right, and judge of equitye?

THE. Not only one extorter out of f^utes in seat set hye
The judgments late to tremblyng sowles doothe there by lotte awarde:
In one appointed judgment place is Gnossian Minos hard,
And in an other Radamanthe: This ^ryme doothe A^ac bear.
What each man ones has done, he feels: and guylt to the author theare
Returns, and th'hurtfull with their owns example punn^ht be.
The bluddy cruel captains I in prison shette did see,
And back of tyrant impotent even with his peoples hand
All t^rne and cut. what man of might with favor leads his land,
And of his own life lord reserues his hurtlesse hands to good,
And gently doothe his empire guide without the thyrst of blood,
And spares his soul, he having long led forth the lyngryng days
Of happy age, at length to heaven do^the either find the ways,
Or joyful happy places else of fair Elysius wood.
Thou then that here must be a iudg^ abstain from man his blood,
Who so thou be that raygnest king: our gyltes are there acquytte
In greater wise.

AM. Doothe any place prescript of lymite ^h ytte
The gyltie ghosts, and as the fame reports, does cruel pain
The wicked men make tame that in eternal bonds remain?

THE. Ixion rollde on whyrlyng wheel is ^ost and turned hye:
Upon the neck o^ Sisyphus the mighty stone does lie.
Amyd the lake with thyrsty jaws ol^de Tantalus theryn
Pursues the waves, the water stream^ doothe wette and wash his ^hyn,
And when to him now otte deceyude it doothe yet pr^myse make,
Straight ^ytts the ^ood: the trute at mowth his famyne doothe forsake.
Eternal food to ^leeyng ^owle doothe Tityus heart give s^yll:
And Danaus daughters ^oo in vain their water vessels fill.
The wicked Cadmus daughters all go ragyng every wa^e:
And there doothe greedy rauenyng bird the Phi^y tables fraye.

AM. Now of my son declare to me the noble worthy fight.
Bryngs he his wyllyng uncles gyfts, or Plutoes spoils to sight?

THE. A dyre and dreadful stone there is the slothful foordes fast bye,
Where sluggysh freate with wave astoond full dull and flow doothe lie:
This lake a dreadful fellow keeps both of attire and sight,
And quakyng ghosts doothe over bear An aged ugly wight:
His bearde unkempt, his hosome foul deformde in fylthy wise
A knotte byndes in, full lothesome stand in head his hollows eyes:
He fery man doothe steare about his beat with his long ore.
He dryuyng now his lyghtned ship of burden toward the shore,
Repaires to waves: and then his way Alcides doothe require.
The flock of ghosts all geuyng place: Alowde cries Charon dyre,
What way attemptest thou so bold? thy hastenyng pace here stay.
But natheles Alcmenaes son abydyng no delay,
Even with his own poale bette he doothe full tame the shypman make,
And clymes the ship: the bark that could full many peoples take,
Did yield to one: he satte, the boat more heavy like to break
With shyueryng joints on eythersyde the lethey floode doothe leake.
Then tremble all the monsters huge, the Centaures fierce of might,
And Lapythes, kyndled with much wine to wars and blouddy fight.
The lowest chanelles seeking out of Stygian poole a down,
His lerney labor sore affright his sertyle heddes doothe drown.
Of greedy Ditis after this doothe then the house appear.
The fierce and cruel Stygian dog doothe fraye the spirits there,
The which with great and roaryng sounds his hedds vpshakyng three,
The kingdom keeps: his ugly head with fylthe full foul to see
The serpents lycke: his hears be foul with vypers (...) among,
And at his crooked wrested tail doothe hysse and dragon long:
Like ire to shape. when him he wy^ his pace that way to take,
His bristle hears he lysteth up with fierce up bended snake:
And sownde sent out he soon perceyues in his applied ear,
Who even the sprights is woon^to sent. as soon as stood more near
The sonn^ of Jove, the doubtful dog strayte couched down in den,
And each of them did fear. behold with doleful barkyng then
The places dumme he makes a dred, the threatnyng serpent stout
Through all the fields about does hysse: the bawlyng noise sent out
Of dreadful voice from triple mouth, even spryghts that happy be
Does make afraid. from left side then strayte way undoes he
The cruel tawes, and lions he^d once slain in Cleon field
Against him setts, and cover doothe himself with mighty shield.
And bearyng in his conquer^ng hands a sturdy clubbe of oak,
Now ^ere, now there he ^olleth him about with often stre^:
His strypes he doubles: he subdewde his threats assuaged all,
And all his heds the weery dog at once full low let fall,
And quight out of the ^enne he fed. full greatly feared (...)

The dog the watche^ keeper (...) the kingdom dark, at leng^
Laythe down his ears full so^ affrayde: and suffryng to be lend,
And eke acknowledging his lord, following with lowly hedde,
With tail that snakes thereon doothe bear he both his sides doethe smyght.
But after that to Taenate mouth we came, and clearenes bright
Had stroke his eyes of light unknown, good stomach yet again
He takes althowgh onse overcome, and now the heavy chayn^
He ragyng shakes: he had almost his leader plucked from place,
And hedlong backwarde drawn to hell, and moved from his pace.
And even to my hands Hercles then his eyes did backewarde cast,
We both with double joined strength the dog out drawn at last
For anger wood, and battles yet attemptyng all in vain,
Brought up to world. as soon as he the clear air saw again,
And spaces pure of bright fair poale had once beheld with eye,
The night arose: his sight to grownde he turned by and by,
Cast down his eyes, and hateful day forthwith he put to flight,
And backewarde turnde away his look, And straight with all his might
To th'erthe he falls: and underneath the shade of Hercles then
He hyd his head. therewith there came a great resort of men
With clamor glad, that did the bay about their forhedds bring:
And of the noble Hercules deserved praises sing.

Chorus. EUrystheus born with swiftned birth in have, did bid to bottom of the
world to go:
This only lackte of labors all at last, to spoil the king of third estate
also.
The dongeons dark to enter ventred he, where as yt way to sprights far of does
bring
Full sad, and wood so black and feared to be: but full with flock full
great him followyng.
As great a prease as flock in cities streets, to see the plays of Theater
new wrought:
As great as at Eleus thundrer meets, when somer fifth yt sacred game has
brought:
As great as when comes hour of longer night, and willing quiet sleeps to be
extent,
Holds equal Libra Phoebus chariots light, a sort the secret Ceres do
frequent,
And from their howsen left do have to cum, the Atticke priests the night to
celebrate:
Such heap is chaste beneth by fields so dum, with age full slow some taking
forth their gate
Full sad, and fylld with life so long now led: some yet do run the race of
better years,
The virgins yet vnieynde to spowses bed, (...) yonglings eke on who^ grow yet
no hears
And infa^t lately taught his mothers name.
To these alone, (that the^ y^ les might fear)
Is granted night to ease with foreborne flame. the rest full sad by dark do
wander theare:
As is our mind, when ones away is fled the light, when each man sorry feels
to be
Dep^ ouerwhelmd with all the earth his head. thyck Chaos stands, and darkness
foul to see,
And color ill of night* and slothful state of silent world, and d^uers
clouds about.
Let hoary age us thither bring full late. no man comes late to that, whence
never out,
When once he is come, turn again he may. to have the hard and heavy fate what
vayles?
This wa^dring beape in wide lands far away, shall go to ghosts: and al shall

First hour, y^ gave the life, it loast again.
TO Thebes is come the joyful day, your aulters touch ye humbyllye,
The fat fair sacrfices slaye. maids ^yxte with men in cumpanye
Let them in sole ^ne flocks go royle: and now with y^ake laid down let
cease
The tyllers of the fertyle soil.
(...) is with hand of Hercles peace between the morn and Hespers glade,
And where son holdyng myddle seat, does make the bodies cast no shade.
What ever grownde is ouerweate with compass long of seas abowght,
Alcides labor ^aemde full well. he over foordes of Tartare browght
Returnde appeased being hell. there is remaynyng now no fear,
Naught lies beyond the hell to see.
O priest thy staryng locks of hear^ wrappe in with loved poplar tree.

The fourth Act.
Hercules, Theseus, Amphitryon, Megara, WIth my reue^gyng right hand slain now
Lycus lo the grownde with groueling face has smit: the^ who soever fellow
fownde

Of tyrant was, partaker of his pains did also lie.
Now to my father sacryfyce and godds victor will I,
And aulters that deserve it, with ^ayne off^yngs reverence.
Thee, thee O mate of all my toils I pray and my defense
O warrefull Pallas, in whose left hand thy clear shield Aegis shakes
Fierce ^hretes, with head that each thing stone that looks upon it makes.
Let ^amer of Lycurgus now, and of read sea be hear,
That point of spear with yuye green in hand doothe couerde bear:
And two godds power, both Phoebus, and his sister too I pray,
The sister meeter for her shaftes, but he on th'harpe to play:
And what soever brother else of mine doothe dwell in sky,
Not of my stepdame brother. bring ye hither by and by
Your plentuous flocks, what ever have all the Indians fruits browght out,
And what sweet odours the Arabickes do get in trees about,
To th'aultars bring: lett^ vapor fa^e and ^ume smoke up full hye,
Let rownde about the poplar tree my hears now bewtifye.
Let th'olyue bow thee hyde with braunch^ accustomde in our land
Thescu: for forthwith reverence the thundrer, shall my hand.

THE. O godds the buylders of the town, and which of dragon fell,
The wild woods denns, and noble wa^ likewise of Dirces well,
And Tyrian house enhabite eke of stranger wandryng king.

HER. Cast into fyres the trankencense.

AM. Son first thy hands flowyng with blouddy slaughter, and the death of
enmye puryfye.


HER. Would god the blood of hateful he^ Even unto godds on hye
I might out shed, for lycour lo more acceptable none
Might th'aulters stayne: nor sacrifice more ample any one
Nor yet more plentyfull may be To Jove above down cast,
Then king unjust.

AM. Desire that now thy father end at last
Thy labors all: let quietness At length yet given be,
And re^ to weery folk.

HER. I will the prayers make, for me
And Jove full meet. in his due place Let stands the haughty sky,
And land, and air, and let the stars drive forth eternallye
Their course vnstayde: let restfull peace keep nations quietlye,
Let labor of the hurtlesse land all iron now occupye,
And sooprdes lie hid: let tempest none full vyolent and dyre
Disturb the sea: let from the skies no flashe of lyghtnyng fire
Fall down while Jove full angry is: nor yet with winter snow
Increased floode the grownde vpturnde and fields quight overthrow.
Let poisons cease: and from hensfoorth let up from grownde arise
No grievous herb with hurtful sap: nor fierce and fell likewise
Let tyrants raygne: but if to sight some other mischief bring
The grownde yet shall, let it make haste: and any monstrous thing
If it prepare, let yt be mine. but what means this? myd day
The darkness have encloasde about, lo Phoebus gothe his ways
With face obscure withowt a cloud. who dryues the day to flight,
And turns to east? from whence does now his dusky h^d the night
Unknown bring forth? whence fyl the (...) so many rownde about
Of daytyme stars? lo here behold my labor first full stout
Not in the lowest part of heaven the lion shyneth bright,
And fervently does rage with ire, And byttes prepares to fight.
Even now lo he some star will take* with mouth full wide to see
He thretnyng stands, and fyres out blows and mane up rustleth he
Shaking with neck. the harvest sad o^ shape, what ever thing,
And what soever winter c^llde in frosen time doothe bring,
He with one rage will ouerpasse, of spryng time bull he will
Both seek, and break the necks at once.

AM. What is this sudden ill?
Thy cruel cowntnance whether son Doste thou cast here and there?
And seeste with troubled daselde sight false shape of heaven appear?

HER. The land is taemde, the swellyng seas their surges did assuage,
The kingdoms low of hell likewise have felt and known my rage,
Yet heaven is free, a labor meet for Hercules to prove.
To spaces high I will he borne of hawghtye skies about:
Let the air be skaelde, my father does me promise stars t'obtayne.
What if he it denyde? all th'earthe can Hercles not contain,
And geeues at length to godds me calls of own accord behold
The whole assembly of the godds, and does their gates unfold,
While one for bydds receyuste thou me, and openest thou the sky,
Or else the gate of stubborn heaven draw after me do I?
Do I yet doubt? I even the bonde^ from Saturn will undo,
And even against the kingdom proud of wicked father lo,
My grandsyre loase. let Titans now prepare again their fight
With me their captain ragyng: stones with woods I will down smyght,
And hye hills topps with Centaures full in right hand will I take.
With double mountain now I will a stayre to godds up make.
Let Chiron under Ossa see his Pelion mowntayne grette:
Olympus up to heaven above in third degree then set
Shall come it self, or else be cast.

AM. Put far away from thee
The thowghts that owght not to be spoake: of mind vnsownde to see,
But yet full great, the furyows rage assuage and lay away.

HER. What means this? the gyantes d^ pestiferous arms assaye,
And Tityus from the sprights is fled, and bearyng torn to see
And empty bosom, lo how near to heaven it self stood he?
Cythaeron falls, the mountain hye Pallene shakes for fear,
And torn are Tempe. he the tops of Pindus cawght has here,
And Oethen he, some dreadful thing threatnyng doothe rage about
Crinnys bryngyng flames: with strypes she soundes now shaken out,
And burned brandes in funerals, lo yet more near and near
Throws in my face: fearce Tisyphone with head and ugly hear
With serpents set, now after dogg^ fet out with Hercles hand,
That emptye gate she has shette up, with bolte of fyry brande.
But lee the stock of enmiows king doothe hydden yet remain,
The wicked Lycus seed: but to your hateful father slain
Even now this right hand shall you send^ let now his arrows light
My bow out shoot: it seems the shaftes to go with such a flight
Of Hercles.

AM. Whether doothe the rag^ and fury blind yet go?
His mighty bow he drew with horns together driven lo,
And quyuer loaste: great noyese makes with byolence sent out
The shafte, and quyght the weapon flewe his myddle neck torowghowt,
The wownd yet left

HER. His other br^ods I overthrow will quyght,
And corners all. What stay I yet? to me a greater fight
Remaynes then all Mycenes lo, that rockye stones should all
Of Cyclops being ouerturnde with hand of mine, down fall.
Let shake both here: and there the house, with all stays overthrown,
Let break the poasts: and quight let shrink the shaken pyller down:
Let all the palayce fall at once. I here yet hydden see
The son of wicked father.

AM. Lo his flattryng hands to thee
Applyeng to thy knees doothe crave his life with pyteous moan.
O wicked gylte, full sad, and eke abhorde to look vppone,
His humble right hand caught he has, and ragyng rownde about
Him r^lled twyse, or thryse has cast. his head resoundeth out,
The sprynkled howses with the brain of him thrown out are wet.
But she poor wretch her little son in bosom hydyng yet
Lo Megara, like one in rage doothe from the corners flee.

HER. Thowgh runnagate in bosom of the thundrer hid thou be,
This right hand shall from every where Thee seek, and bring to sight.

AM. where go thou wretch? what lurkyng denns, seek^e thou to take, or flight?

No place of sauegarde is if once be Hercles styrde with ire:
But do thou rather him enbrace, and with thy meek desire
Assaye to assuage him.

MEG. Husband spare us I beseech thee now,
And know thy Megara, this son thy cowntenaunce doothe show,
And bodies pytche: beholdst thou how his hands up lyfteth he?

HER. I hold my stepdame: follow on dew penawnce pay to me,
And bownden Ione from fylthy bond^ deliver free away:
But I before the mother will this little monster slaye.

MEG. Thou mad man whither go thou? will thou thine own blood sheade?

AM. The Infant with fathers fyry face astonnyde all for dread,
Dyed even before the wownde: his fear^ has took away his life.
And now likewise his heavy clubbe is shaken toward his wife:
He broaken has the bones, her head from blocklyke body gone
Is quight, nor any where it stays. darste thou this look vppone

To long lyude age? if mournyng do thee grieve, thou have then lo
The death preparde. Do thou thy breast upon his weapons throe,
Or else this clubbe with slaughter staynde of monsters slain that be,
Now hither turn. thy parent false, vnfytte for name of thee
Kyd hens away, least he should be to thy renown a let.

THE. Which way y^ father toward thy death dooste thou thy self cast yet?
Or whyther go thou mad man? flee, and lie thou cloasely hyd,
And yet from hands of Hercules this only myschiefe ryd.

HER. It Is well, the house of shameful king is now quyght overthrown.
To thee O spowse of greattest Jove I have lo beaten down
This offered flock: I gladly have fulfyllde my wyshes all
Full meet for thee, and Argos now geeue other offryngs shall.

AM. Thou have not son yet al performde, fill up the sacrifyse.
Loeth offryng doothe at th'aultars stand, it waytes thy hand likewise

With neck full prone: I give my self, I roon, I follow lo.
Me sacrifyce. what means this? his eyes roll to and froe,
And heaviness doothe dull his sight. see I of Hercules
The tremblyng hands? down falls his face to sleep and quietness,
And weery neck with bowed head full fast doothe downewarde shryuke,
With bended knee: now all at once he down to grownde doothe synke,
As in the woods wild asshe cut down, or bulwark for to make
A haven in seas. Lyuste thou? or else to death doothe thee betake
The self same rage, that has sent all thy famylye to death?
It is but sleep, for to and froe doothe go and come his breathe.
Let time be had of quietness, that thus by sleep and rest
Great force of his disease subdewde, may ease his grieved breast.
Remous his weapons servants, lea^ he mad get them again.

CHORUS. LEt the air co^plain, and eke y^ parent great of haughty sky, and
fertile lad throughout,
And wa^dryng wave of ever moving freate.
And thou before the^ all, which lands about
And train of sea thy beams abroad do throe with glyttryng face, and makst y^
night to flee,
O fervent Titan: both thy settyngs lo and rysyng, has Alcides seen with
thee: and known likewise he has thy howse^ twayn. from so great yls release ye
now his breast,

O godds release: to better turn again his ryghter mind. and thou O tamer

O sleep of toils, the quietness of mind, of all the life of man the better
part,
O of thy mother ast^ey wynged kind, of hard and pinyng death that brother
art,
With truth mingling the false, of after state
The sure, but eke the worste foreteller yet:
O father of all things, of life the gate,
Of light the rest, of night and fellow fytte, that comst to king, and servant

And gentlye cherysshest who weerye be,
All mankind lo that dreadful is to dye, thou do co^strain long death to
learn by thee. keep him fast bound with heavy sleep oppressed,

Let slo^ber deps his limbs untamed bind,
Nor sooner leave his unright ragyng breast,
The^ former mi^d his course again may find.
Lo laid on ground with full fierce heart yet still
His cruel sleeps he turns: and not yet is
The plague subdewde of so great raging ill:
And on great clubbe the weery head of his
He wont to lay, does seek y^ staff to find
With empty hand, his arms out casti^g yet with moving vayn: nor yet all rage

And virtue to the man, else let be so his mind with moving mad tossed every way:
Let error blind, where it begoon has, go. for nowght else now but only
madness may
Thee gyltlesse make: in next estate it stands to hurtles hands, thy mischief
not to know.
Now strooken let with Hercules his hands thy bosoms sound: thine arms y^
world allow were wo^t to bear, let grievous strips now smite with co^quryng hand:
and loud co^plaini^g cries

Let the air now here: let of dark pole and night the queen them hear, and who
full fiercely lies
That bears his necks in mighty chains fast bound, low lurking Cerberus in
dep^st cave.
Let Chaos all with clamor sad resound, and of broad sea wide open wasting
wave.
And the air that felt thy weapons better yet,
But felt them thowgh.
The breasts with so great yls as these beset, with little stroke they must
not beaten be.
Let kyngdoms three sound with one plai^t and cry, and thou necks honowr, and

His arrowe strong long hanged up on hye, and quiuers light, ye cruel strypes
now smyght on his firce back, his shoulders strong and stowt let oken clubbe
now stryke, and poaste of might with knots full hard his breasts load al about.
let even his weapons so great woes co^plain.

Not you poor babes mates of your fathers with cruel wou^d reue^ging kings
again: (praise, not you your lims in argos barriars plays,

Are taught to turn with wepo^ strong to smight, and strong of hand: yet eue^ now
daring lo the weapon of the Scythian quiver light

With steady hand to paise sent out from bow, and stags to perse y^ save the^
selves by flight, and backs not yet full maend of cruel beast.

To Styg^a^ havens go ye of shade and night, go hurtles souls, who^ mischief
has oppressed
Even in first porche of life but lately had,
And fathers furye. go unhappy kind
O little children, by the way full sad
Of tourneye known.
Go, see the angrye kings.

The fyfthe Act.
Hercules, Amphitryon, Theseus. WHat place is this? what region^ or of the
world what coaste?
Where am I? under rise of sa^ne, or bond else vttermoste
Of th'ycy bear? or else doothe here of sea of Hesperye
The fardest grownde appoynte a bond^ for the ocean sea to lie?
What air draw we^ to weery wight what grownde is vndersette?
Of truth we are returnde from bell. whence in my house down bette
See I these bloody bodies? has not yet my mind of cast
Thinfernall shapes? but after yet return from hell at last
Yet wander does that helly heap before mine eyes to see?
I am ashamde to grawnte, I quake, I know not what to me,
I can not tell what grievous ill my mind before does know.
Where is my parent? where is she with goodly chyldrens show
My noble hartye stomakt spowse? why does my left side lack
The lions spoil? which way is gone the cover of my back?
And self same bed full soft for sleep of Hercules also?
Where are my shaftes? where is my bow? Them from me living who
Cowlde pluck away? who taken has the spoils so great as these?
And who was he that fearyd not even sleep of Hercules?
To see my conqueror me lykes, yt lykes me him to know:
Rise victor up, what new son has my father gotten now
Heaven being left? at birth of whom might ever stayed be
A longer night, then was in mine? what myschiefe do I see?
My children lo do lie on grownde with bloody slawghter stayne:
My wife is kyllde: what Lycus does the kyngedome yet obtain?
Who durst so heinous gyltes as these At Thebes take in hand
When Hercles is returnde? who so Ismenus waters land,
Who so Acteons fields, or who with dowble seas beset
The shaken Pelops kingdoms doste of Dardan dwell on yet,
Healpe me: of cruel slawghter show who may the author be.
Let rage my ire on all: my foe he is, who so to me
Shows not my foe. doste thou yet hydd Alcides victour lie?
Come forth, even whether thou revenge the cruel chariots his
Of bloody Thracian king, or if thou Geryons catell quyght,
Or lords of Libya, no delay there is with thee to fight.
Behold I naked stand, althowgh even with wy weapons lo
Thou me unarmed set upon. wherefore f^eeth Theseus so
And eke my father from my sight? their faces why hyde they?
Defer your weepyngs, and who did my wife and children sley
Thus all at ones, me tell. Wherefore O father do^ thou whushte?
But tell thou Theseu, but Theseu with thy accustonide trust.
Each of them sylent hydes away their bashefull cowntnawnces,
And pryuelye they shed their tears. In so great yls as these,
Of what owghte we ashamde to be? does ruler yet of might
Of Argos town, or hateful band Of sowldyars ap^e to fight
Of Lycus dyinge, us oppress with such calamytee?
By praise of all my noble acts I do desire of thee
O father, and of thy great name approude to me always
The prosperous power, declare to me, who did my hou should slaye?
Whose pray lay I?

A. Let thus thyue yls in silence ouerpas.

HE. That I should unrevenged be?

AM. Revenge often hurtful was.

HE. Did ever man so greuows ylles without revenge sustain?

A. Whos'euer greater feared.

H. Then these, O father yet again
May any greater thing, or else More greuows feared be?

AM. How great a part is it thou wo^st, Of thy calamitee?

HER. Take mercy father, lo I lift to thee my humble hands.
What means this? my hand flees back, some priuye gylte here stands.
Whence coms this blood? or what does mean flowyng with death of chyllde
The shafte, enbrewde with slawghter onc^ of Lerney monster kyllde?
I see my weapons now, the hand I seek no more to wit.
Whose hand could bend this bow but mine? or what right arm but yt
Could stryng the bow, that unto me Even scantely doothe obaye?
To you I turn: O father dear, is this my gylte I pray?
They healde their peace: it is mine own.

AM. Thy grievous woe is there,
The crime ^hy stepdames: this myschawnce no fawte of thine has here.

HER. From every part now father throw in wrath thy thunders might,
And of thy son forgetful now, with cruel hand requyght
At least thy nephews: let the world that bears the stars sownde out,
And let both the one and the other p^ale, flyng down thy flames about:
And let the banks of Caspian sea my bownden body tear,
And greedye foul. Wherefore do of Promethens lack hear
The rocks? with huge and hawtye top let now prepared be,
Both feedyng beasts and fowls, the side Of Cawcas torn to see,
And bare of woods, the isle that bridge Of Scythe that thereby stands
Simple gas ioynes, both here and there Let it my bounden hands
Stretch out abroad: and when with course returnde accustomdlye
They shall together drive, and shall the rocks toss up to sky
With banks together being thruste, and eke the myddle seaye,
Let me between the mountains lie unquiet restless stay.
But building up with wood thrown on a heaped pyle on hye,
My body thus with wicked blood besprynkt, why burn not I?
So, so yt must be done: to hell I Hercles will restore.

AM. Not yet his heart astonyde lackes his ragyng tumulte sore,
But wraths has turnde: and which of rag^ is property and ire
Against him sellfe he rages now.

HER. The furies places dyre
And donge on deep of sprights in hell and place of tormentrrye
To gylty ghosts, and banishment if any yet do lie
Beyond Erebus, yet unknown to Cerberus and me,
There hyde me grownde: to farthest bond^ of Tartarus to see
To tarry there I Will go. O breast of mine to fierce and ^wte:
Who you my children thus disperst^ through all my house abowte,
May worthyly enowghe bewail? in all my euylls yet
This countnaunce hard, can never weep. a swoorde now hither set,
My shafces reatche hither, hither reatche my mighty clubbe also:
To thee my weapons break I will, to thee my son, atwo
I Will knappe my bows, and eke my clubbe this block of heavy wayght,
Shall to thy spryghts be burned lo: this self same quyuer frayght
With Lerney shaftes, to funeral of thine shall likewise go.
Let all my weapons penawnce pay, and you unhappy to
Even with my weapons burn I will, O stepdames hands of mine.

Th. who ever yet to Ignorance has given name of crime?

Her Full oftentimes did error great the place of gylt obtain.

Th. Cys need to be a Hercles now, this heap of ill sustain.

Her. Not ^o has shame yet given place with furye drowned quight:
But peoples all I rather should drive from my wicked sight.
My weapons, weapons Theseus, I quickly crave to me
withdrawn to be restoard again: if sownde my mind now be,
Restore to me my weapons: if yet last my rage of mind,
Then father flee: for I the way to death my self shall find.

Am. By sacred hollye kynreds rights, by force and duty all
Of both my names, if either me thy brynger up thou call,
Or parent else, and (which of good men reverenced are)
By these boar heates, I thee beseech my desert age yet spare,
And werye years: of house fallen down the one alonely stay,
One only light to me, with ylles afflicted every way
Reserve thy lelfe: yet never has there happened once of thee
Fruit of thy toils: still either I the dowtfull seae to see
Or monsters f^arde: who ever yet bathe been a cruel king
In all the world, to ghosts allow, and aulters both hurtyng,
Of meys fearde: the father of thee absent still, to have
The frut^, the towching, and the sight, of thee atlength I crave.

He. wherefore I longer should sustain my life yet in this light,
And linger here no cause there is: all good lost have I quight,
My mind, my weapons, my renown, my wife, my sons, my hands,
And furye to. no man may heal and loase from gyltye bands
My mind defyellde: needs must with death, be healde so heinous ill.

Th. will thou thy father slay?

He. Least I should do it dye I will.

Th. Before thy rathers face?

He. I taught him mischief for to se.

Th. Thy deeds markyng rather that should of all remembered be,
Of this one only crime I do a pardon of thee crave.

Her. Shall he give pardon to him self, that to none else it gave?
I being bidden praise deserud, this deed mine own does prove,
Help father now, if either else thy pietye thee move,
Or else my heavy fate, or else the honor and renown
Of stained strength: my weapons bring, let fortune be thrown down
With my right hand.

Th. The prayers which thy father makes to thee
Are strong enough, but yet likewise with weeping lo of me
Be moved yet: arise thou up, and with thy wonted might
Subdue thine yl^: now such a mind unmeet to bear upright
No evil hap, receive again: lo now with manhood great
Thou must prevail, eueri Hercules sorbyd with ire to fret.

HE. Alive, I hurt: but if I dye, I take the gylt also.
I have to rydde the worllde of crime, even now before me so
A wicked monster, cruel, and untamed, fierce, and stout
Do the wander: now with thy right hand begin to go about
A great affayre, yea more then all thy twice syx labors long.
Yet stayste thou wretch, that late against the children waste so strong,
And fearful mother? now except restoarde my weapons be,
Of Thracian Pindus either I will tear down every tree,
and Bacchus hollye woods, and tops of mount Cythaeron hye
Burn with my self. and all at once with all their housen I
And with the Lords there of the roofes, with gods of Thebes all
The Thebane temples even upon my body will let fall:
And will be hyd in town vpturnde: if to my shoulders might
The walls themselves all cast thereon shall fall a burden light,
And couerde with seven gates I shall not be enough oppressed,
Then all the wayght whereon the world in middle part does rest,
And parts the Gods, upon my head I Will turn and ouerthroe.
My weapons geeue.

Am. This word is mete for Hercles father lo.
With this same arrowe slain behold thy son is tombled down,
This weapon cruel Juno lo from hands of thine has thrown,
This same will I now use. lo see how leapes with fear affright
My wretched heart, and how it does my careful body smight.
The shafte is set there to, thou shall a mischief lo do now
Both willing it, and wotting: tell, what thing commaundest thou?
I nothing crave, my dolor lo in safety stands now.
To keep my son alive to me that only do can thou
o Theseu, yet I have not s^apte, greatst fear that happen can.
Thou can ^e not a myler make, thou may a happy man.
So order every thing thou dooste, as all thy cause in hand,
And fame thou may well know in strayg^ and doutfull case to stand:
Thou ^iust, or dyest: this slender soul that light is hense to flee,
we^yed with age, and no less bet with grievous isle to see,
In mouth I holoe. so slowlye to a father with such stay
Does any man give life? I will no longer bide delay,
The dedlye sword throughout my breast to stryke I will apply,
Here, here the gylt of Hercules eue^ sownde of mind shall lie.

Her. Forbear O father now, forbear, withdraw thy hand again.
My manhood yield, thy fathers will, and Imperye sustain.
To Hercles labors now likewise, let this one labor go,
Let me yet live lift up from ground ^hafflicted lymmes with woe,
o Theseu of my parent: for from godly touch does fle
My wicked hand.

Am. I gladly do this hand embrace to me.
By this I being stayed will go, this moving to my breast
I Will slake my woes.

Her. what place shall I secke roonaga^e for rest?
Where shall I hyde my self? or in what land my self engraue?
What Tanais, or what Nilus else, or with his persyan wave
what Tigris violent of stream, or what fierce Rhenus flood,
Or Tagus troublesome that flows with I bear treasures good
May my right hand now wash from gylt? although Mae^tis collde
The waves of all the Northen seae on me shed out now wollde,
And all the water thereof shoolde now pass by my two hands,
Yet will the mischief deep remain. Alas into what lands
will thou o wicked man resort? to East, or western cost?
Each where well known, all place I have of banishmente quight lost
From me the world does flee a back, the stars that spdelyng ro^n
Do backwarde drive their turned course, even Cerberus the soo^
(...) better countnaunce di^ b. hold. o faithful friend I say
o Theseu, secke some lurkyng place, farce hence, out of the way.
O thou awarder of men's gyltes what ever judge thou be
That hurtefull men do love, repaye a worthy thank to me:
And my deserts. I ^hee beseech, to ghostes of hell again
Send me that ones escaped them: and subject to thy rain
Restore me yet to those thy bands. that place shall me well hyde:
And yet even that place knows me well.

Th. Our land for thee does did.
There Mars, his hand acquit again and made from slaughter free
Restoarde to armor: lo that land (Alcides) calls for thee,
which wontes to quight the gods, and prove them Innocent to be.
