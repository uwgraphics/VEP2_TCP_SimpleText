To his most excellent Majesty concerning these proiects of the Author.
BY knowledge true I did prefer,
unto your highness proiects three
Of mickle worth, exceeding far
the subtle sleight of Enmity.
She seeks my truth for to suppress,
And I to Wisdom for redress.
Where reason is by knowledge found,
your highness pleasure to fulfill:
Extending many a thousand pound,
in secret known to Art and skill,
Should single wits thereiudge or deem
where knowledge wants or has not been.
I am not of that learned lore,
of Riplie, Kellie, and other more;
Whose learned worke^ are gone before,
figuratively, Imeane not so,
But plainly in a homely style,
showing the truth deuoide of guile.
In plow-mans painful toil,
my skill is something good:
And in the art deuoide of guile,
my mind not wavering stood.
Lo yet my heart could not discearne,
by glosing words that skill to learn.
By duty I do bow and yield,
by rigors rage I nothing see:
By guilefull guiftes that has been sild,
brought to the baits of flattery:
My sight not dim, though blind I am,
and lives on earth a simple man.
I am not known, nor will not be,
but as the Bird who sees the net:
I fall into each ieopardie,
and none but God the same can let,
Therefore good King know most just,
in God above I put my trust.
For if with gold I had been fed,
my sellfe had had a passing part:
And eke my senses had been led,
from learning of that noble art
Of knowledge, which so many know,
unto the end it proves not so,
For knowledge is a sccret thing,
and knowledge is a virtue great:
And knowledge does make wisdom spring
and knowledge it is whereof we treat.
The love and life of every thing,
with due obedience to our King.
Blisse-full thy hap, thy life, and eke the days,
as David did to God, give thou thy praise,
Who was, who is, everlasting seeing,
Rules Princes dead, and those now alive being.
A Description of the manner how to mend highways.
THis Treatise and description of High ways, for these parts of his Majesty's
Kingdom of Great Britain, with their diverse and several plat-formes,
frames, order, and manner of making of them, whereby all the said highways
shall or may be made more sound and strong, pleasant, and comfortable for all
manner of wayfaring iourneying, or traueling with Carts and carriages, or
other ways by these said highwaies, All which is herein plainly laid open
and made manifest by Thomas Proctor Esquire. In this his Treatise is set down
for the general good and helpful instruction of al Countrime^, and for all
places, and chiefly and most needefully, where there is great lack and want
of good ways, and where there are very little or no good ways made: as in
Holland in Lincolne-shire and such like: and to the daily continual great
grief and heart breaking of man and beast, with charges, hindrances, wearing
and tyring of them, and sometime to the great and imminent danger of their
lives, and often spoil and loss of goods, and also in some places else where,
great hurt and spoil of Fences and grounds, with riding and going over the
Corn, and such like, by shifting and seeking the best way diversely: all which
by these means are, or may be remedied and prevented: And although it may be
that in the foresaid places, or some of the^, there has been bestowed the
yearelye great allowance of so many years past, with the yearelye labors and
charges thereof, and thereto by the laws appointed and provided with the
benevolence of so many well disposed persons, desceased, which have given for
and toward the making, mending, and repayring of high ways, in diverse and
sundry places of this his Majesty's said kingdom, with diverse other
voluntary helps, besides, the said great allowance of men, and matter
fitting to these yearelye and common days labor and works, etc. The
aforesaid considerately looked into, he finds no reason why there should be
any ill ways. Notwithstanding, all which, or much thereof has been bestowed to
little or no purpose, but much thereof utterly lost both cost, work and
stuff, for want of meet matter, or orderly manner in disposing the same in
their said works, as appears too manifestlye in most of those their works
at this day. And as he by his practice and costs, has found true and proved:
That the labor of twenty fix able persons, that are ready in their work,
and well disposed thereunto with Pick-are, spade shouell, rake and rammer,
chipaxe and Augur, to be chosen and taken out of every parish, and so forth
generallye out of all such numbers, of all usual and common days labors,
etc. Orderlye to be set to work in this his manner, with their carts and
carriages according, with some boys and maids to help, where cause requires,
shall or may suffice to make half a furlong yearelye, and as much good and fair
way, and dispatch them, to the bettering of the worst and foulest ways to be
made good and strong in every parish, as twice so many should or could have
done heretofore in this proportioned work and orderly manner without this
said prescribed manner and order herein made known. And here withal is to
be remembered that one principal and chief cause of al bad and foul ways is,
that the rain water or other water does lie and rest upon ye highwaies (not
orderlye and soundlye made) which with the working of cart wheels and others,
does pierce down more deeper into the said ways, and so more and more does
soften and rot the same, as by daily experience is seen and known. And also
that the ditches and common showers are not yearly cleansed so as is needful,
which are the best helps to draw and dreane the waters off and from the most
part of all highwaies and grounds (as in reason there should be) and by his
Matesties laws ought to be done; which not having been done orderly is one
reason of, and whereby much of their former labors and charges with their ways
and works are wasted, as aforesaid, and little good way to be found, whereas
these foresaid things otherwise prevented, then once well made and stronglye
done, though but a furlong yearelye in every parish so to be made, so as one
parish may be helpful unto another next adjoining with men or money, of the
surpulsages of other greater parishes, to supply the wantes of the lesser
parishes, at the rate here in this his book expressed so as by help one of
another, there may easilye be performed yearelye forty rodds at the least in
every parish, and so yearly by little and little hereby all former labors
and charges which have unprofitably been wasted, shall be cut off, and all
such future labors and charges shall be prevented and saved to some needful and
profitable uses: For this said work once well made and done, must needs be
better and cheaper, then yearly still a making and doing, and never well made
and done, so as it ought to be, and as is by the laws therefore appointed,
intended and meant.

The neglect and necessity whereof, and the love to his country in this his
last age and years, has enforced him hereunto, out of his care, charge,
pains and practice, to make known the same. The effects whereof does and may
appear with other his studies and labors for the general good of all in this
his book duelye or indifferently considered, to the making and bettering, as
is aforesaid of all highwaies, thereby to be made more sufficient and durable,
more easy, with much lesser matter, stuff, charges, and expenses the^ ever
heretofore has been done (by their common days labors) which by Art and
action doing, will and may cut off and save very much of the yearly charges and
labors of former times and works, as aforesaid.

First therefore a platform and foundation must be cast and made in
cawsy-wise, that is to say, to be made a rodd broad at the least, whereupon two
carts may meet and pass one by another, and on either side the said cawsie of
that bredsh, to draw a ditch of 3. foot depth, and 4. foot broad, and that
earth which shall be so dug, must be cast up from the said ditch to ye midst
of ye cawsie of a rod broad, proportionally, that the midst and height of the
said way may be in breadth one yard, and higher by two foot in the midst, then
at the outward sides or edges of the same: the higher ye midst and lower the
sides, the drier and better way to void the water, which water is the only
rotting and spoiling of al high ways, and the only loss of al charge and
common days labors heretofore yt no good way has been made and continued for
want of true manner and form, and due consideration hereof in their former
works.

Secondly this cawsie, if it be of a clayish soil, or of such like slimy or
spungy earth, it must be wrought and cast up in ye winter season, that it may
have time to settle and join firmly and soundly together, and so being cast
and made as before said, that no carts be suffered to pass upon it, til the
spring time, or that the earth thereof be dry and hard, for marring and
breaking his shape and form made as beforesaide, for if in Summer it shall be
cast, it will rise in such hard clottes and tough great lumpes, as will
hardlye with great labor and much ramming be disgested and brought to a good
foundation, but at a far more greater charge then the before said, when the
earth is soft and kindly to dig and join together.

The which thus cast and made in winter as before, besure the^ that your
forenamed ditches on either side the said Cawsie be so artificially and
hansomelye contrived, made and cleansed of filth and soil, that the rain water
which shall fall from the said Cawsie, may have a speedy Current in those
ditches, and so falling into ditches which must be made by some good judgment
of workmen, or other instrument to that purpose, that the said water from
thence may have a good and speedy passage to the next ditches, and so from
ditch to ditch, gutter to gutter, or other conueyances of water to the common
shoares, and so to the next brook or maine stream adjoining to the said
works or any of them.

Thirdly, if your ground or earth in any of your ways to be made, be
gardenlike moulde, soft, sandye or crumbling, or such like short earth, then
will that sort of earth with small labor of ramming of it self, with treading
and going upon it in their labors and works, settle and join soundly
together, and especially after some good shewres of rain fallen thereupon,
which then will be a good foundation presently, to frame and bind in with
Timber, woodrailes or powles, as to place, lay, fill, and cover with stones
gravel, sand, or small wood to be cut of Billet or faggot fashion, or any
other hard or dry matter to be had or made by art or otherwise (according to
the plenty or necessity of every soil and place) as in diners, and in
every sundry several manners, sorts and forms of works and workings, in this
his book is declared, showed, and plainly set down in their places for
every one to follow and work thereafter accordingly: al which manners and
empty places of all those wood frames you do use, must be filled as you see,
either with wood, stones, Iron-cinders, Ironstones, Geauel stones or other, and
so filled. Lastly to be well covered over with small grauel, rubbish or sand, or
any other stones broken small. And here is to be considered, that in every
parish one with another there are to be estimated of unspeakable or unknown
numbers of householders plowes and carts to be rated at three shillings every
cart, and therefore so many men for their work of highwaies, to be rated but
at 8. pence every man the day, besides the help of women and children, fit to
serve in this work as heretofore have done, for gathering of stones and
carrying of matter and stuffes with bowls, creeles and baskets and such like,
for to fill hollow places according to their accustomed and yearly usual manner
heretofore in repayring of high ways, which yearly amounts to a great sum.

From amongst which numbers of householders, plowes and carts before said are to
be chosen or made for this work two and fifty men, with 12. carts, and 12 men
part of ye said 52. for the service of 6. days to bring in matter and stuff
likewise according to the custom of the yearly repairing of high ways in
every parish, and that the^ every cart and man so serviceable in these
works, to be rated for their 6. days labor, but as aforesaid, after three
shillinges the day for every cart so serving, and the rest of the said
laboring men being 38 to be rated as aforesaid after eight pence the day, of
which number of 38. there must be 20 at the least of very sufficient able men
of some good judgment in their own labors: If such be wanting they must be
chosen and hired to do such work as ye surueyor or surueyors of ye said work,
shall direct and appoint in every parish according to these his rules in this
his book under written. Likewise out of ye said rest of 52. now remaining,
being now but 20.12. must be sufficient laborers with shouels, pickare and
spades, for making and fitting the said platform and foundatition in manner
and form (as before said) to be ready for the second work, to be laid, made
and framed upon, to be filled with earth, and fast rammed for shrinking.

These last before said, 20. such able men will dig ditch, cast, level,
plain, and make ready, and finish forty rods, which is a furlong in all the
said sire days, according to the Statutes heretofore made, of and for the
works of every year for every parish yearly this work during, but seven
or tenn years space, which after the said account of forty rods in every
parish yearly to be wrought and made as before said; will make good, fill,
and dry up al foul, hollow and bad places with a small yerelye charge and
labor to be maintained, passable, good and fair for ever after, where
heretofore the labors and costs of such great numbers of householders plowes
and carts for these fifty years past have been spent and lost, and little or
few good ways made in any such order, manner and form.

If the ground, soil, or earth be clayish, or destitute of stones, a binding
must needs be made for this work of wood, framed and made and likewise
filled with wood, as appears by the platformes heareafter discribed: That is
to say, poles of young wood, or rayles of base Timber, of length eighteen
foot, and in thickness or compass round about some ten or twelve inches one
with another, or less where wood is scant, and if they shall lack of that
length, to take two short, to make one long, so as when they are framed and
made fit, and pinned down with stakes with wodden pins through them, they may
be a rod square at ye least within the said frame and crossed with such like
timber made fast as is needful, according to the platformes and sundry manners
of works and working in this his book plainly set down.

Also it is to be considered, that if any such matter and stuff fit for the
said work, cannot be had within two miles of the said work, as is most
commonly to be had within that compass in most places and parishes
therabouts, being diligently sought for, yet nevertheless 12. carts will
suffice within their six common days labor, at two miles off, to bring in
sufficient loades of such matterof stones, wood, or other dry or hard matter,
as will perform the yearly accomplishment and finishing of one furlong of the
worst way every year in every parish, being forty rods a year: and if it
be at a mile off, or from the work, then six carts will perform as much as
the other twelve: if but at half a mile from the said works or Cawsie, then
three carts are able to perform the said carriages, as in stonye or wood
countries, where such stuffes or stones are near at hand. And then there and
in such places, so much money, labors and charges is spared and gotten after
three shillings in every cart by day, more then in other parishes, where it is
not so easy to be had, and so likewise in the men's labors of every householder
after eight pence by day, co^taining great numbers in their former labors of
their said highways, besides women and children, as aforesaid, yearly
heretofore so inconsiderntely consumed and spent: all which charges hereby so
saved, some part thereof to be employed and reckoned for wood for the said
frames and strong binding, and making of the said cawsie and highways with
their belongings, and all the rest so saved to be at his Majesty's good
pleasure, to whose most gracious favor, he humbly submits himself, and to
the good consideration of all his loving country men, for this his skill and
pains taken so diversely to his cost and charge in setting forth this his
manners of high ways, with his other proiects of water, for making of any
dry town to have waters brought unto them, or near unto them, or bringing
one river to or near unto another, as Thames to or near Seuerne, or Seuerne
near or to Thames at an easier rate then any other, for botes, lighters and
bardges with their ladings and carriages to pass too and froe with Seacoales,
which are as well in his majesty's forest of Deane as in Wales, are plenty to
be had near there abouts, for transportation at a reasonable rate, with other
more such like places (as now from New Castle in way of Decay) and also for
making of Iron in quality and quanty good and merchantable, according to the
nature of the mine, with a third part of wood-coles where it may be spared, or
otherwise with out any wood coals at al at great profit, such as thereon may
be gained, 33. shillings upon every tun, as the prise of Iron there now
goes, or three shillings upon twenty, upon every return where the same
shall be made, for the general good of his majesty's kingdom and Subjects.

All which, or any of them, he shall show and perform the trial by actio^ and
working of workmen, with clear appearance of the benefits and profits thereon,
and therein to his Majesty if he shall be called thereto, and thence to any
other that shall desire to be satisfied therein, that shall be fit and
furnished therefore.

A trial and true performance of all the before said, may be made under
sixty pound expenses fully to satiffie, every one of capable understanding.
These being true, as true they be,
not set to work is great pity,
But scorn and blame such works they have,
where envy knowledge does deprave.


These frames hereafter following (being made of Wood) do represent every
one of them a rod of ground square, where they shall be made in wood
countries, and where there is wood to be had, may all of them, or any of them
be filled with wood, cut billet or faggot fashion, with hurdles or wattles, with
bauins or brush wood, or such like for want of bigger, being unbound and well
placed and laid, and then well covered over with other matter, and in manner as
is declared with small gravel, or gravel stones broken small, Iron-stone,
Iron Cinders, sandy stone, thalke or lime, or any other hard or dry matter,
made by art out of killnes: as brick, hard tile, Potshardes or other earth,
sand or any rubbish whatsoever: the dryer, harder, and smaller, the better and
fayrer the way will be.

These figures here under, every of them representing a rod of highway
squar,e bound with poles of young wood, or railes, crossed diversely as you may
see; are to be filled within with wood, stones, grauel, or such like matter, as
best may be had diagram of roadbed structure depiction of ditch bordering

These li^^wise as you see here under figured, are to be filled with stone^ or
wood, and rammed hard down as Pauiers do, and then well ouercouered with
grauel, small stones or sand, Iron-cinders: or other, the smaller, the better
the way. diagram of roadbed structure with wood, stone, etc. fillers depiction

These frames of wood and hurdles, or wattles made of spring wood, are of small
price, when they are well made and ioynted together one to another, and must be
laid and placed as the ground rises and falls in his kind, and as it lies
before the way is made, shall neither need trunckes, neither bridges: the
reason being, the water in these ditches running by the cawsie and frames, may
pass very well over the said ways in those low places and bottomes, and not
stay, but speedily pass and follow their current, into the next ditches to
the common shewres, not hurting the ways. depiction of wattle framework These
are to be likened to the sheepefold hurdles, and four of these will serve a
rod way.



These frames heereunder bound about, and crossed as you see, is first to be
filled with all stones and covered as a foresaid. diagram of crossed framework

This about of hurdles is an easy, strong, and cheap way, and is good for
clayish or spungie grounds or any other.

This single frame being only bound with poles or rales, on the out sides, as
you see of the way, must be strongly staked and pinned down, and the^ filled,
spread and covered over with ye aforesaid matters and especially with
Iron-cinders, which will make no illway; and is so plentiful in wood Countries,
near unto the high ways, where there shall need no other matter in those
parishes, and well made, will endure with small repayring, but it must have
many loads of stones, more matter and stuff, then any of the before said
works, because it will shrink and yield quicklye with ye water and wheels,
and such like weight of horse and cariages. diagram of framework for roadbed

And lastly in those Countries and places, where there shall lack, and is not,
or cannot be found, stones, gravel, sand, or young spring wood, to make
frames, and to be cut billet or faggot fashion, neither Iron cinders, or any
such like hard and dry matter to fill and cover therewith, as in Holland in
Lincolnoshire and such other. That there, and in such places, they must make or
cause to be made, kilnes like lime kilnes, brickkilnes, Tile, or Potter kilnes,
wherein they must burn with sea-coales, pets or Turns, claye or earth, and
make hard matter thereof, of hardness poterlike: the bigger of which matter
shall make the upper part of the way upon the foundation thereof, and the
smaller thereof to cover again vpermoste above the other greater before said,
and so ram and settle the same close together on their highways there and
in such places, where their greatest care in their works must be to leave
their ways high in the midst, and so even and hansome, that no raine-water or
ouerflowinges shall tarry or abide upon their cawsie or high ways, but fall
speedily into their ditches, as is most meets and prescribed to all high
ways, and in these places, and in such like, where there is little wood or
none to be had for heipe thereof, it shall be very good and profitable that
there the inhabitants or dwellers near, or other ways shall plant and set
young plants of willowes or other, as shall be most meet or fitting
therefore, al along by the sides of the said highways and ditches, which will
grow and yield in short time, yearly help to the mending and repayring of
the same said high ways, wattles and with hurdles.

The benefits and profits that shall or may arise unto his Majesty and
subjects, here by art and action doing, if set on work accordingly.
HIs Majesty by his most royal authority, and there under this prescribed
manner to be performed and done. There shall be good and fair ways made,
which since the making of such good laws, hitherto these 50. years past and
more, has not been made and done accordingly, so as is now hereby taught and
set forth how to bre done, and most of them may be finished within the time
prescribed, or thereabouts: where by from henceforth may be faued many
thousand loades of matter and stuff, charges and labors, and so thethy and
there through many thousands of pounds yereiy, If but rated after three
shillings for every Cart, out of such numbers as are set usceable to this said
work, by his Maisties Laws and statutes appointed. And likewise, if but after
8. pence the day for every man, out of the aforesaid great numbers so
serviceable as before said, and yet notwithstanding sufficient left for the
yearly repayring of the said ways for ever, and the rest so saved whatsoever,
may be otherwise necessarily employed to other uses according to his majesty's
good pleasure, or as shall be found most meet by his majesty, and his most
honorable privy counsel.

Also for waters, Rivers and their benefits.
THese said waters or small rivers made for Boats and lighters to pass, that
is to say, from one river to or near unto another, or from one City, town
or place, too or near unto another, or into one another, where the same shall
be found meet and needful: as from Thames too or near unto Seuerne, or from
Seuerne to or near unto Thames, as also from Sarisburie, Stampford,
North-hampton, Berry, Wakfield and Leedes, or Oxford, as also from the river of
Lee, near unto Stock-bridge, to or near unto Clarken-well lying, and being on
the north side of London: all which or any of them may be done accordingly, and
any of the which he will undertake to do at an casterate, and better cheap
then any other shall do, not using his way and manner. For that he sees in
other men's works, labors and manner, much unprofitably spent, which may and
might be spaced and saved, all which the general and necessary uses whereof
are many: as for transportation and carrying of coals, Sea-coales, wood,
Lead, Iron, corn and grain, Flax, Hemp, Woollen and Linen cloth, with
many diverse and sundry commodities, whereby a custom or rent may grow unto
his Majesty, and case of charges and benefit by charges, and other benefits by
interchange of commodities to diuere Towns, shires and places, whereby men
every where may be stirred up and provoked diversely to seek and find out
such commodities whatsoever their Country shall afford and bring forth to
the proffiting of themselves and others, And also by this means, that carried
for five shillings, which now upon every tun carrying costeth twenty, which
then there shall or may be saved to help them upon their commodities. The
greatness of the manifold benefits, that hereby shall, may or might grow, he
leaves to the good consideration and profound judgment of the best and
wisest, and to the good understanding of all in general. The said rivers or
streams wheresoever, to be made a rod or perch broad at the least, at 250.
pound a mile, or better cheap, as before said: not offending, impeaching, or
hurting Milles, dammes, wears or streams or fishings, neither ouerflowing any
man's grounds otherwise then their ordinary courses or passadges, but rather
bettering those men's grounds diverse ways, through which the said waters shall
pass, to the multiplying of water to the said Mils and grounds in Summer, and
in dry places and seasons, and multiplying of fish and foul: and upon
agreement or reasonable request made, he shall and will be ready with one of
his Sons, named Elias Procter, of good and suffictent skill, and experience in
the said works, or one of them, upon some convenient warning given, or
procurement before made, to come and to show and make and set forth the said
water courses, or passages, or any of them, for the better satisfying of the^
rod by rod, how and which way ye same shall or may be done, whereby the owners
through whose grounds ye same shall pass may be agreed and co^pounded with
therefore, yielding him or them but reasonable and necessary charges for the^,
their man and horses for their coming and going for some 15. days or
therabouts, as shall be found but meet and reasonable.

These hereunder does declare and make known the benefits and profits that shall
or may arise upon the making of iron, if the same shall be made with and after
the direction of the said Author in act and action, with true performance
accordingly.
FIrst to make Iron with a third part of wood-coales, where spring woods are,
and may be spared for the benefit of the owners, or else to make Iron without
any wood-coales at all, where there shall arise profit upon the work And making
of good and usual marchantable Iron, according to the quality of the mettle
of the mine there, to every one, or to any one that shall lay in and employ
stock and money thereon to all needful and necessary uses fit and meet for
the same, upon the return of every tun so made, 20. shillings: or three
shillinges upon the return of every twenty shillings so wrought and made
into Iron, as before said, of clear profit, after the rate as the ordinary
price of Iron there now goes, where the same Iron shall be made or wrought,
and so much Iron weekelye there to be made, wrought and laid by, to be
delivered orderlye to secure and benefitte the said stock and work, weekly
after that rate, and to counteruaile, free, and discharge all other the
ordinary weekly charges, that shall be employed and dispensed therein, with
the profitt thereof and thereunto due, and so forth from week to week from
time to time forth and forwards according: the said stock so continued, and
the work still retuned, and going forwards. And so he shall perform unto the
^a^de work and profit yearelye the same (...) yearly of such bar iron.

To his Majesty for Farm or Rent.
Where any such work shall be builded, erected, and set up upon his majesty's
waste lands or commons, with water and water courses, Fuel, and Iron-stone,
and for peate and all other necessaries fitting thereunto, to make rawe-Iron,
bare-Iron, as is said, and for farm rent twenty pound a year, yearly for
the said farm, whereas now there is scantly any thing at all to be had or
made thereof: and likewise to every Lord or owner for farm, as beforesaid
unto his Majesty 20. pound the year for such like farm and necessaries,
where now there is scantly raised any rent thereof at al. And lastly the
Author, explainer and master of these his proiects, thinks and esteems
