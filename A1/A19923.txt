LONDON, Printed for I. S. 1599.

HYMN I. Of Astraea.
E arly before the day does spring,
L et us awake my Muse, and sing;
I t is no time to slumber,
S o many Joys this time does bring,
A s time will fail to number.
B ut whereto shall we bend our Lays?
E uen up to Heaven, again to raise
T he Maid, which thence descended
H ath brought again the golden days,
A nd all the world amended.
R udenesse it self she does refine,
E uen like an Alchymist divine,
G rosse times of Iron turning
I nto the purest form of gold:
N ot to corrupt, till heaven wax old,
A nd be refined with burning.
HYMN II. To Astraea.
E ternall Virgin, Goddess true,
L et me presume to sing to you.
I oue, even great love has leisure
S ometimes to hear the vulgar crew,
A nd hears them often with pleasure.
B lessed Astraea, I in part
E nioy the blessings you impart,
T he Peace, the milk and honey,
H umanity, and civil Art,
A richer Dower then money.
R ight glad am I that now I live,
E uen in these days whereto you give
G reat happiness and glory;
I fafter you I should be borne,
N o doubt I should my birth day scorn,
A dmiring your sweet story.
HYMN III. To the Spring.
E arth now is green, and heaven is blew,
L iuely Spring which makes all new
I olly Spring does enter,
S weete young Sunbeams do subdue
A ngry, aged winter.
B lasts are mild, and Seas are calm,
E uery meadow flows with Balm,
T he earth wears all her riches,
H armonious birds sing such a Psalm
A s ear and heart bewitches.
R eserue (sweet Spring) this Nymph of ours
E ternall garlands of thy flowers,
G reene garlands never wasting;
I n her shall last our states fair spring,
N ow and for ever flourishing,
A s long as heaven is lasting.
HYMN IIII. To the month of May.
E ach day of thine, sweet month of May,
L oue makes a solemn holy day:
I will perform like duty,
S ince thou resemblest every way
A straea Queen of beauty.
B oath you fresh beauties do partake,
E ithers aspect does Summer make:
T houghts of young Love awaking
H earts you both do cause to ache,
A nd yet be pleased with aching.
R ight dear art thou, and so is she,
E uen like attractiue Sympathy,
G aines unto both like dearness;
I ween this made Antiquity
N ame thee, Sweet May of Majesty,
A s being both like in clearenesse.
HYMN V. To the Lark.
E arly cheerful, mounting Lark,
L ights gentle Usher, mornings clarke,
I n merry Notes delighting:
S tint a while thy Song, and hark,
A nd learn my new Inditing.
B ear up this Hymn, to heaven it bear,
E uen up to heaven, and sing it there,
T o heaven each morning bear it;
H aue it set to some sweet Sphere,
A nd let the Angels hear it.
R enownd Astraea, that great name,
E xceeding great in worth and fame,
G reat worth has so renownd it,
I t is Astraeas name I praise,
N ow then, sweet Lark, do thou it raise,
A nd in high Heaven resound it.
HYMN VI. To the Nightingale.
E uery night from Even till Morn
L oues Quirister amidde the thorn
I s now so sweet a Singer,
S o sweet, as for her Song I scorn
A pollos voice, and finger.
B ut Nightingale since you delight
E uer to watch the Starrie night,
T o all the Stars of heaven,
H eauen never had a Star so bright,
A s now to earth is given.
R oyall Astraea makes our Day
E ternall with her beams, nor may
G rosse darkness overcome her;
I now perceive why some do write,
N o country has so short a night,
A s England has in summer.
HYMN VII. To the Rose.
E ye of the garden, Queen of flowers,
L oues Cup wherein he Nectar poures,
I ngendred first of Nectar:
S weete nurse-child of the Springs young hours,
A nd Beauties fair Character.
B est Jewel that the earth does wear,
E uen when the brave young Sun draws near,
T o her hoate Love pretending;
H imselfe likewise like form does bear,
A t rising and descending.
R ose of the Queen of love beloved;
E nglands great Kings divinely moved,
G aue Roses in their Banner;
I t showed that Bewties Rose indeed,
N ow in this age should them succeed,
A nd reign in more sweet manner.
HYMN VIII. To all the Princes of Europe.
E urope the Earthes sweet Paradise:
L et all thy Kings that would be wise,
I n Politic Devotion:
S aile hither to observe her eyes,
A nd mark her heavenly motion.
BRAVE Princes of this civil age,
E nter into this pilgrimage:
T his Saints tongue is an oracle,
H er eye has made a Prince a Page,
A nd works each day a Miracle.
R aise but your looks to her, and see
E uen the true beams of Majesty,
G reat Princes, mark her duly;
I fall the world you do survey,
N o forehead spreades so bright a Ray,
A nd notes a Prince so truly.
HYMN IX. To Flora.
E mpresse of flowers, tell where a way
L ies your sweet Court this merry May,
I n Greenewich garden Allies:
S ince there the heavenly powers do play,
A nd haunt no other Valleys.
B ewty, virtue, Majesty,
E loquent Muses, three times three,
T he new fresh hours and Graces,
H aue pleasure in this place to be,
A boue all other Places.
R oses and Lillies did them draw,
E r they divine Astraea saw;
G ay flowers they sought for pleasure:
I n steed of gathering crowns of flowers,
N ow gather they Astraeas Dowers,
A nd bear to heaven that treasure.
HYMN X. To the month of September.
E ach Month has praise in some degree;
L et May to others seem to be
I n Sense the sweetest Season;
S eptember thou art best to me,
A nd best do please my reason.
B ut neither for thy Corn nor Wine
E xtoll I those mild days of thine,
T hough corn and wine might praise thee;
H eauen gives thee honor more divine,
A nd higher fortunes raise thee.
R enownd art thou (sweet month) for this,
E mong thy days her birth day is,
G race, plenty, peace and honor
I n one fair hour with her were borne,
N ow since they still her Crown adorn,
A nd still attend upon her.
HYMN XI. To the Sun.
E ye of the world, fountain of light,
L ife of day, and death of night,
I humbly seek thy kindness:
S weet, dazzle not my feeble sight,
A nd strike me not with blindness.
B ehold me mildly from that face,
E uen where thou now do run thy race,
T he Sphere where now thou turnest;
H auing like Phaeton changed thy place,
A nd yet hearts only burnest.
R ed in her right cheek thou do rise;
E xalted after in her eyes,
G reat glory there thou show:
I n the other cheek when thou descendest,
N ew redness unto it thou lendest,
A nd so thy Round thou go.
HYMN XII. To her Picture.
E xtreame was his Audacitie;
L ittle his Skill that finished thee,
I am ashamed and Sorry,
S o dull her counterfeit should be,
A nd she so full of glory.
B ut here are colors red and white,
E ach line, and each proportion right;
T hese Lines, this red, and whiteness,
H aue wanting yet a life and light,
A Majesty, and brightness.
R ude counterfeit, I then did err,
E uen now, when I would needs infer,
G reat boldness in thy maker:
I did mistake, he was not bold;
N or durst his eyes her eyes behold;
A nd this made him mistake her.
HYMN XIII. Of her Mind.
E arth now adieu, my ravished thought
L ifted to heaven, sets thee at naught;
I nfinit is my longing,
S ecrets of Angels to be taught,
A nd things to heaven belonging.
B rought down from heaven of Angels kind,
E uen now do I admire her mind:
T his is my contemplation,
H er clear sweet Spirit which is refind,
A boue Humane Creation.
R ich Sun-beame of th'aeternall light,
E xcellent Soul, how shall I wright;
G ood Angels make me able;
I cannot see but by your eye,
N or, but by your tongue, Signify,
A thing so Admirable.
HYMN XIIII. Of the Sunbeams of her Mind.
E xceeding glorious is this star;
L et us behold her Beams a far
I n a side line reslected;
S ight bears them not when near they are
A nd in right lines directed.
B ehold her in her virtues beams,
E xtending Sun-like to all Realms;
T he Sun none viewes too nearely;
H er well of goodness in these streams,
A ppeares right well and clearly.
R adiant virtues, if your light
E nfeeble the best Judgments sight,
G reat splendour above measure
I s in the mind, from whence you flow:
N o wit may have access to know,
A nd view so bright a treasure.
HYMN XV. Of her Wit.
E ye of that mind most quick and clear,
L ike Heavens eye, which from his sphere,
I nto all things pryeth,
S ees through all things every where,
A nd all their natures tries.
B right Image of an Angels wit,
E xceeding sharp, and swift like it,
T hings instantly discerning:
H auing a Nature infinite,
A nd yet increasd by learning.
R ebound upon thy self thy light,
E nioy thine own sweet precious sight:
G iue us but some reflection;
I t is enough for us, if we
N ow in her speech, now policy,
A dmire thine high perfection.
HYMN XVI. Of her will.
E uer well affected will,
L ouing goodness, Loathing ill,
I nestimable Treasure:
S ince such a power has power to spill,
A nd save us at her pleasure.
B e thou our law, sweet will, and say
E uen what thou will, we will obey
T his Law, if I could read it:
H erein would I spend night and day,
A nd study still to plead it.
R oyall free will, and only free,
E ach other will is Slave to thee:
G lad is each will to serve thee:
I n thee such Princely power is seen,
N o Spirit but takes thee for her Queen,
A nd thinks she must observe thee.
HYMN XVII. Of her Memory.
E xcellent Jewels would you see,
L ouely Ladies? come with me,
I will (for love I owe you)
S hew you as rich a Treasure,
A s East or West can show you.
B ehold, if you can judge of it,
E uen that great Storehouse of her wit;
T hat bewtifull large Table:
H er memory wherein is writ
A ll Knowledge admirable.
R eade this fair book, and you shall learn
E xquisite Skill if you discern,
G aine heaven by this discerning;
I n such a memory divine,
N ature did form the Muses nine,
A nd Pallas Queen of Learning.
HYMN XVIII. Of her Fantasy.
E xquisite curiosity,
L ooke on thy self with judging eye,
I f ought be faulty leave it,
S o delicate a fantasy
A s this, will straight perceive it.
B ecause her temper is so fine,
E ndewed with harmonies divine:
T herefore if discord strike it,
H er true proportions do repine,
A nd sadly do mislike it.
R ight otherwise a pleasure sweet,
E uer she takes in actions meet;
G racing with smiles such meetnesse;
I n her fair forehead beams appear:
N o Summers day is half so clear,
A dornd with half that sweetness.
HYMN XIX. Of the Organs of her Mind.
E clipsed she is, and her bright rays
L ie under vailes, yet many ways
I s her fair form revealed;
S he diversely her self conueyes,
A nd cannot be concealed.
B y Instruments her powers appear
E xceedingly well tuned and clear:
T his Lute is still in measure,
H olds still in tune, even like a sphere,
A nd yields the world sweet pleasure.
R esolue me, Muse, how this thing is,
E uer a body like to this
G aue heaven to earthly creature?
I am but fond this doubt to make,
N o doubt the Angels bodies take,
A boue our common nature.
HYMN XX. Of the Passions of her Heart.
E xamine not th'inscrutable Heart,
L ight Muse of her, though she in part
I mpart it to the Subject;
S earch not, although from heaven thou art,
A nd this an Heavenly object.
B ut since she has a heart, we know
E uer some passions thence do flow,
T hough ever ruled with Honor;
H er Judgment reigns, they wait below,
A nd fix their eyes upon her.
R ectified so, they in their kind
E ncrease each Virtue of her mind,
G ouern'd with mild tranquillity;
I n all the Regions under Heaven,
N o State does bear it self so even,
A nd with so sweet facility.
HYMN XXI. Of th'innumerable Virtues of her Mind.
E re thou proceed in this sweet pains,
L earne Muse how many drops it raynes
I n cold and moist December;
S umme up May flowers and Augusts grains,
A nd grapes of mild September.
B ear the Seassands in memory,
E arths grasses, and the stars in Sky,
T he little moares which mounted
H ang, in the beams of Phoebus eye,
A nd never can be counted.
R ecount these numbers numberless,
E re thou her virtue can express,
G reat wits this count will cumber,
I nstruct thy self in numbering Schools;
N ow Courtiers use to beg for fools,
A ll such as cannot number.
HYMN XXII. Of her Wisdom.
E gle-eyed Wisdom, life's Loadstarre,
L ooking near on things a far;
I oues best beloved daughter,
S howes to her Spirit all things that are,
A s love himself has taught her.
B y this straight Rule she rectifies
E ach thought that in her heart does rise:
T his is her clear true mirror
H er looking glass, wherein she spies
A ll forms of Truth and Error.
R ight princely Virtue, fit to reign,
E nthroniz'd in her Spirit remain,
G uiding our fortunes ever;
I f we this Star once cease to see,
N o doubt our State will Ship-wrackt be,
A nd torn and sunk for ever.
HYMN XXIII. Of her Justice.
E xil'd Astraea is come again,
L o here she does all things maintain
I n number, weight, and measure:
S he rules us with delightful pain,
A nd we obey with pleasure.
B y Love she rules more then by Law,
E uen her great mercy breeds awe:
T his is her Sword and Scepter,
H erewith she hearts did ever draw,
A nd this Guard ever kept her.
R eward does sit in her right hand:
E ach Virtue thence takes her Garland
G ather'd in Honors garden:
I n her left hand (wherein should be
N ought but the Sword) sits Clemency,
A nd conquers Vice with pardon.
HYMN XXIIII. Of her Magnanimity.
E uen as her State, so is her Mind,
L isted above the vulgar kind:
I t treades proud Fortune under,
S un-like it sits above the wind,
A boue the storms, and Thunder.
BRAVE Spirit, large Heart, admiring naught
E steeming each thing as it ought,
T hat swells not, nor shrinketh:
H onor is always in her thought,
A nd of great things she thinks.
R ocks, Pillars, and heavens Axel-tree,
E xemplifie her Constancy;
G reat changes never change her:
I n her Sex fears are wont to rise,
N ature permits, Virtue denies,
A nd scorns the face of danger.
HYMN XXV. Of her Moderation.
E mpresse of kingdoms thongh she be,
L arger is her Sovereignty,
I f she her self do govern;
S ubiect unto her self is she,
A nd of her self true Sovereign;
B ewties Crown though she do wear,
E xalted into Fortunes chair,
T hron'd like the Queen of Pleasure:
H er Virtues still possess her Ear,
A nd counsel her to Measure.
R eason, if she incarnate were,
E uen Reasons self could never bear
G reatnesse with Moderation;
I n her one temper still is seen,
N o liberty claims she as Queen,
A nd shows no alteration.
HYMN XXVI. To Envy.
E nuie go weep, my Muse and I
L augh thee to scorn; thy feeble Eye
I s dazzled with the glory
S hining in this gay poesy,
A nd little golden Story.
B ehold how my proud quil does shed
E ternall Nectar on her head:
T he pomp of Coronation
H ath not such power her fame to spread,
A s this my admiration.
R espect my Pen as free and frank,
E xpecting not Reward nor Thank;
G reat wonder only moves it;
I never made it mercenary;
N or should my Muse this burden carry
A s hyr'd, but that she loves it.
FINIS.
