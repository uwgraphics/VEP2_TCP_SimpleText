A CONCENT of Scripture, by H: BROVGHTON.



TO THE MOST HIGH AND MIGHTY PRINCE ELISABET, BY THE GRACE OF GOD, QVEENE OF
England, France, and Irelande, defender of the faith. etc.
THE whole Book of GOD (most gracious Sovereign) has so great an harmony,
that every part of it may be known to breath from one Spirit. Al sounds the
same point: that by CHRIST the son eternal, we are made heirs of life: whom
they that know not, abide always in wrath. Prophecyes in every age, the first
larger, the later narrower, all briefly told, all for event fully recorded:
these show the constancy of this truth. The like reuolutions are of Abraham,
Jacob and his children together, of Sems house: and again to Iapheths sons,
and all families: wherein the former be stampes of the later: so that in one
speech, an other thing also is spoken. These show the eye of JEHOVAH, and his
spirit. The kinredes, places, and times, the lyghtes of narrations, are
registered so profitably: that it should be a blasphemy to affirm any one to
be idle. Our LORD his Fathers are recorded from Adam, by David and Nathan, to
his Grandfather Ely: likewise they, after whom he is heir to the kingdom of
David, Salomons line so long as it continued: and afterward they who from
Nathan were heirs to Salomons house. So other Families, who came all of one,
as from them all come: they by Moses and the Prophets be plentifully
expressed. In like sort the places of their dwellinges are clearly taught. The
course of time is most certaynely observed: even to the fulness, the year of
salvation, wherein our Lord dyed. Of which time the very hour was foretold
by an Angel, not seven years before, but seauentie times seven years. Dan
9. 24. To this all, other Ebrewes and profane Greeks, bear witness strongly
against them selves. These helps be stars in the Story. The frame of all
this, with coupling of joints and proportion of body, will much allure to
study, when it is seen how about one work all Families, Countries, and Ages,
build or pull down: and find the kindness or severity of GOD. For this work
I endeavored, to call ancient Ebrewes and Greeks, to further the buylding of
justice and peace, to come from Salem and Athens, to these ends of the earth,
the possession of Christ: to speak in England the tongue of Eber and Iauan.
This my pains, I humbly present to your Majesty.

Your Majesty's Subject, HVGH BROVGHTON.

To the Reader.
FOR the better understanding of DANIEL, who mentions large Kingdoms, and
pictureth them: this Table of the North part will give some light: which
shows where NOE his sons dwelt, by the notes which you see at them. Those
Families give names to great Realms, and are found in Greek Heathen writers:
placed of them as in this Table. The Kings which DANIEL speaks of are joined
to their pictures. A short Chronicle is added: but the brevity will require
diligence. A. B. C. D, printed in the Pictures, are expounded over the Bear,
and placed in the Chronicle over the tree.

in their doctrine of life eternal: which as from one mouth teach, how that
stands in knowing the true GOD, who is but one; and the sending of JESUS
CHRIST. All Families were hereby to look for grace, in all Countries and Ages.
Some special the holy Writers do mention, The old world, and the world

for the old world, and the world now. Ten of the first are Fathers, not
only to our LORD, but to all Nations. They were al faithful, and should
move their Children to bear in their breasts VRIM and THVMMIM, Faith and
Love. They had Abel an ensample of being faithful unto death for Christ, to
find an eternal crown of life. Cain and his house warned them of their
corruption, taken from Parents, that they should look for regeneration. Job.
22, 16. 1. Pet. 3, 19.
The destruction of the men that delyted in Caines ways, whose bodies wrinkled
by the deluge, whose spirits are in prison: These show that the eternal
spirit of Christ, has in long patience a ^ust kingly anger. Of this old
World, the Writers old and new, teach the same. Their places are little
mentioned: but Our Fathers ages. The beginning of Genesis is fitted to the
capacity of children.
our Fathers ages are wonderfully laid down by the heavenly Father, teaching
us as babes be taught. Thrice they are reckoned: how old they were when they
begat their son: how long they lived after: and how much those two numbers
make. This shows that the Story is penned for the simple and children. The
sundry comparisons will occupy the wysest. The old Families of the world now,
are set forth sufficiently. Sem keeps a name until Christ Luke 3.
Sem keeps in one line a name until he comes, who is blessed for ever:
whose name none knows but him Apo. 19, 12.
felfe. Genesis 9. Babel.
Unto Sem and his blessing al his Families, Iapheths and Chams were to look:
they soon turned aside. For, buyldyng BABEL to make them selves a Shem or
name, despising SEM, they found a Shame. Their tongues became seauentie of
one: their dwellynges were parted accordyngly: their whole state was a
Confusion, and they perished for ever, that repaired not to Sems Tents. The
first Families Moses names, and their places: which the Prophets describe
where they dwelt, by their merchandise, Virgil Geor. I (...) under Assure and
Catrim are comprehended the general oppressors: and the Churches chief
stories are in the lov^ and high Ierussalem.
as to Tyrus Eze. 27. or by their Wars. The Heathen kept still a memory of
these first points, but full of fables. Coeum and Iapet, they bear in mind,
whom they call the sons of the earth: Sem they forgate, and all above. The
Families scattered from Babel, left their names upon their Countries, which yet
abide in Greek writers. Their Wars general against the faithful, Moses
prophesied, under Assure, and Cittim. The Prophets and Apostles record what
fell out. Cities here, chiefly two for name are to be marked: the low
JERUSALEM, (which the faithful still held, or looked to hold, until the LORD
came) and the high JERUSALEM buylt by the GOSPEL every where, which Cittim or
Italy, that destroyed the low, should labor always to besiege, till GOD
sendes his enemies a final destruction. The course of times with the Lord his
nation was truly kept of the faithful and faythlesse. From the creation to
Abraham's promise: thence to the coming from Egypt, to the foundation of
Salomons Temple, to the Captivity and burning of the Temple, to the return to
build it: The generatie is in Math, (...) and Luke 3. for the 490 year. Dan.

and thence to the death of our Lord. For every partition of these times,
ancient consent of Hebrews and Greeks may be brought. I will labor to set
forth all these points brefly, from the beginning, following the order of time
measured by Stories of our Lord his kindred. The places of ancient dwellinges
shall be joined in one Map, of the north part, when Chams house, Sems, and
Iapheths, all three in Daniel fight with the ancient kingdoms against the
blessed of Sem and kingdom of Christ. That Map was to be larger in breadeth
then the quantity of this Book. One Map was to be made of the oldest
names: and an other with later names of dvve^lers. The Romans are not in the
Image Dan. 2. or beast. Da. 7.
In it Pictures are graven, only of the tyrannous kingdoms that Daniel
speaks of, who are consumed by the birth of our Lord, whereof the Romans are
no part. For all the Image, and fourth Beast was to perish before the
incarnation of Christ. Jews do conclude against us, against truth, and their
own salvation upon that our error. Doubtless Rome in the end reuiueth their
impiety, following their manners very near: whereby many have thought Daniels
Prophecy to blame the Romans. For playnnes and distinction herein, I will in a
Map of an other quantity set down Rome, and some other later names of
Countries, with some ancient, as the story shall require: and compare also by
most lively Pictures out of Scripture, the Romans with Daniels Kingdoms. This
whole View I call A CONCENT OF SCRIPTVRE, because it would show that. Through
the book are other Titles touching time and person, for the present matter.
And whereas I often compare briefly, later writers with former: to show the
Reader how he him self may do that more at large: I lay down first in this
Preface a table of the Jews, showing how they read the Prophets. Pharisees
they are at this day, who keep a record of this: and of the Pharisees of
old, Math. 23, 2.
for this much the Lord gave a testimony that they sat in the Chair of
Moses. Elias in Thishi in the word PETARAH, records this occasion, to have
been the beginning of Petaroth: that when Antiochus Epiphanes forbade to read
MOSES law ( Isaac ben Arama. fol 2 b
which was the parted into so many Those sections they call Petaroth
expositions. Directions for the Reader.
Sections, as be Sabbothes in an year.) In stead of Moses they chose a part
of some Prophet like unto it: which custom of readyng they kept still, after
their liberty restored to use Moses and his ceremonies freely. Before you come
to that Table, I will here give direction for the reading of this Book,
touching the two Tables conteynyng the Fathers ages, and certain other
points. The number under the Father shows what his age was when the Son
set in that line was borne. The other numbers show his age at the Nephews
birth over against it: or at the issue of the matter, noted in that line.
Afterward you have sundry tytles of their times parted: as Promise, Egypt,
Temple, Division, Captivity, Seauens, whereupon the chief knottes stand.
Also the times are noted by our Lords birth, Manifest faults as Luke for Mat.
Asa for Achaz, and such, many the Readers gentlens must amend.
by the age of the World, and sundry particular men, which the Reader may know
in markyng what man famous in Story is against the first number. Moreover,
touching the Column, understand that you shall be often to mark by the matter,
that the sayings depend not upon the next above them, but upon those that be
on the other Column oueragaynst them. A mark you have to note an
vncertaynetie in the time of some Stories, that touch not Chronicle: this is
the form of it. as in Hezron: but there the Corrector was deceived, who placed
his birth near Iosephes death, though he was borne before Jacob came to Egypt.
Other notes touching times, two of one kind show, either that the Narration
is driven from the due time: and should look to the mark of the same form:
or compares one Kings reign with an others, as you often shall find in Judah
and Israel. Testimonies I cite short: and in one clause drawn from sundry, I
name but one Author, when about that place I had named some other, for most of
the matter there laid down. The common Latin translation, whose soever it
is, I named it as the Title goes, Ierom. Abbreuiations chiefly be these. b.
for borne, d. for dies, y. for years. Once faulty C. for Chapter Christ's. For
other names, Antiochus Epimanes, and Epiphanes, Appian Archelaus, Artaxact,
Athenaeus, Carthusianus, Clemens Alexandrinus in Stromatibus, Cedrenus, Dio.
for Dionisius, Hal^carnasseus, Diodorus Siculus, Hystaspis, Elias Leuita,
Epiphanius, Eusebius, Florus, Herodotus, Homer, Iliades Horace, Jerome,
Josephus, Ireneus, Justin the historiographer, Iuuenal, Massecheth, once faulty
for Halacoth in Maymony, Nazianzenus, Pausanias, Plato, Plutarch, Polybius,
Ptolomy in Almagesto, Rabbi Abraham, Sadaias, Strabo, Thucidides, Tully,
Valerius maximus, Virgil, these be the most names, noted by abbreuiations:
other words shortly named, by the matter may be gessed at, or be so common,
that every one knows them.

Now I will return to speak of the ancient manner of readyng Moses and the
Prophets. S. James shows Acts 15, 21. that Moses was of old time read in
the Synagogue in every City every Sabbath, Maymony writes of that in Volume
I. Birchath Cohenim from Cha. 12. that Moses ordained that custom: and that
Ezra renewed it after the return: and that in his time, The Rabbines commonly
make Ezra the autour of the Petarothes distinctions: not agreeing with Elias
Leuita.
(long before Antioch Epiphanes) Lectiones of the Prophets were by him chosen
out, agreeable in number and matter to the Lectiones in Moses. They beganin the
Feast of Tabernacles, and in a year finished all. After the readyng of the Law
and the Prophets, they that would, having leave of the ruler of the Synagoge,
spoke upon those Scriptures. That we see was retained Act. 13, 15. I have set
down their Sectiones, and Lectiones, as they part Moses, and have put forth
their Petaroth at Venice by Bombergius in one Book.

The Jew that reads the Section now in the Jews Synagoge, begins with
praising GOD, who chose Moses and the Prophets, and delyghteth in their most
true words: likewise ends praising GOD, who speaks and perfourmeth: says
and stablisheth: so that no one word fails. Then he prays for ELIAS to
come, and for the kingdom of DAVID in CHRIST. If the Caytifes would read
Mel^^hies last end, and first oration of the new Testament, and try all the
new Testament with the old, the Gospel with Moses, the Acts with the Kings,
and the Apocalypse with all, they might see how ELIAS, and that kingdom of
DAVID is come: And see that the perfourmauuce which they extol, is not clear,
without the new Testament. And for an exposition of all their expositions, may
they use the oration of the Angel delivered at their delivery from Babylon:
Which I will translate agreeably to the Ebrevv, that the Reader may see that,
plainly at the first, to which through this Book he must have recourse. Dan
9. 24.

SEAVENTIE SEAVENS (of years) are cut out, for thy people, and for thy holy
City: to consume wickedness, and to abolysh sins, and to make reconciliation
for iniquity, and to bring righteousness everlasting, and to seal Vision and
Prophet, and to show CHRIST the HOLY of HOLY. Know then and mark: from the
outgoyng of the Word, to return and to build Jerusalem, unto CHRIST the
governor, shall be seven seauens (of years) and sixty and two seauens: in the
other it shall be restored and builded, Street and Wall: and troublous shall
these times be. In that after the sixty and two seauens CHRIST shall be killed:
and not for him self: thereupon the City and holy place shall be destroy, the
GOVERNOVRS own people to come: and their end shall be with a Flood: and at the
end of war, it shall have a final judgment to desolation. But he shall
confirm the Testament for many the last Seven: when in HALF THAT SEVEN he
shall end the Sacrifice and Oblation. Afterward by an Army abominable he
shall make a desolation: even till utter destruction and final judgment flow
upon the desolate. And this much for the Preface.

A Concent of Scripture.
THe heavenly Concent of holy Writers, who have penned for us the book of
Truth, is needful to be known for to strengthen our Faith, that we may see
a constant agreement in several ages, Ebr. 1, 1.
for matters often told in diverse parts and manner. Touching that, I labor in
this Book to lay down certain principal heads drawn through the whole
body of Scripture. The beginning ought to be from him who is A and (...), Apoc.
1, 8.
the beginning and the end: who fills all with his goodness. Thereof this is
a true saying, and found intertaynement of all the faith full that GOD is one,
and there is none but he. Of this, that is graven on the Gate of that first and
great Commandment: Deuteronomy 6, 4. Mark. 12, 29.
Hear ISRAFL, JEHOVAH, our GOD JEHOVAH, is one. Whom if we love with all our
heart, mind, soul, and strength: and hold them happy whose Psalm. 33, 12.
God JEHOVAH is, we must learn to know him aright. The name JEHOVAH imports
BEING, which the Eternal says is his name. 1. John. 5, 7.
Under this name and nature, there be three, the Father, the Word, and the
holy Ghost, and these three are one. The WORD is the Son, and he is Ramban
the Cabalist notes that Christ is called Jehovah, upon Genesis 34. from Ier. 23
6. and 33, 16.
JEHOVAH, as John Cha. 12, 41. expounds Esaias. 6, 9. The holy Ghost is (...)
JEHOVAH, as Paul expounds the same text of Esaias, Act. 28, 25. This name is
opened thus: (...)
WHO WAS, WHO IS, WHO WILL BE. The names IAH, and EHIEH, (...)
(I, AM) are of the same force. Though men's blind hearts can not thus know
God: The Scriptures are manifest, that teach the Trinity, and the holy Tongues
of all ages so spoke of God. Most plainly is that showed in the beginning and
end of our Lord his preaching. Mat. 3 1. and 28, 19. For that purpose God
gives him self a named ELOHIM: which is in meaning MIGHTY, The form plural
in Elohim is rightly noted of many learned in Ebrevv, to import the divine
persons, That should not have been blamed of others.
in form plural, as Gramarians speak: which as Profane men speak it, by
frame of language sounds GODS. God would never so speak of him self,
unless he would have us to consider thereby the divine persons. For the form
were dangerous, if necessity required not knowledge of distinct divine
persons. The enemies grant a mystery in that form, with attributes plural:
Aben Ezra upon Psalm. 11. who also cites R. Iaphath, there.

This name has also a form singular (...)
ELOAH, and a shorter (...)
EL. These forms singular are fit to teach, of the unity of Godhead: and
likewise the other when the attributes speak of one, as ELOHIM, (GOD) he
created. But to manifest distinct persons often do the ^earmes joined speak in
the number of many, as if I should say THEY God. The faythles Jews can not
tell what to say of these plain places, as appears in Massecheth Sopherim,
Cha. 4.
Genesis 20, 13. They God caused 2. Sam. 7, 22. They God went.

e SHADDAI also does God call him self MIGHTY, RICH, or ALSVFFICIENT: Though
the Greek Divines reteyne not the letters, but ^n a composition (...).
TZVRI SHADDAI, My rock is God. The Heathen of old heard of these names, and
turned them to sundry Gods. But Israel did not so. All faithful know that
GOD is one, and the persons three: Ebr. 11, 6.
and that he regards all them, that feeke him in spir^^ and truth: who is a
spirit eternal, infinite, holy, just, and merciful. Unsearchable are his
judgments: John. 4, 24. Romans 11, 33. Deuteronomy. 29, 29. Ephesians. 2, 4. Act. 15, 18.
Exo. 20.
but the open things are for us. GOD has chosen us in CHRIST, before the
world was made: and of eternity knew all his own works. In six days God
made all creatures, Man last, and gave them a commandment: which how soon
they brake Moses turns to tell after mention of the Sabbath. The Lord rested
the seventh day from creatyng, and appointed that day for holy rest: which the
Fathers observed before Moses.

Now the man and his wife were both naked, and were not ashamed. Ramban upon
Genesis 26 fol. 46. and Abenezra upon. Exo. 20. Psalm. 91, 11. John. 8, 44. 1.
John. 3, 44. 2. Pet 2, 4. Iud 6. Ephesians. 2, 1.
Over them God gave his Angels charge: but some Angels stood not in the
truth, nor kept their standing, but fell as Starre^ from heaven, and became an
enemious company, and staunderers of God. In Ebrew Satan, and in the Grake
Deuels. Of beasts the Serpent was subtilest: into whom Satan entered: spoke to
the woman against God, and his commandment: persuaded her, who drew the man
also to break the commandment. Then they both became dead in sin. So from
the beginning, as soon as man was, Satan was a liar and a murderer: and
therefore marueyle not that the wrath of God is so vehement upon ADAM through
al his generation:, because quickly sin was committed to the extremity. The
circumstaunces show the spedines of it. Satan would omit no time: the woman if
she had been practiced better would not so sone have erred: their speech
shows that no Fruit had been eaten before. Doubtless the woman fell a Virgin:
and if they had stood but a short time, the blessing of God had not been in
vain for propagation. Above all reasones this must be confidered, that the
Redemption was to be showed presently upon the Creation. For that is the
fyttest to move men to hold it: and God omitteth nothing that best helps to
that. This should move all men to put no trust in them selves: for that That
in Psalm. 49, 20. is holden of Clem. R. Nathan, R. Menachem, and Midrad Tillin,
to be spoken of Adam.
Adam having once justice, and true holiness, did not lodge one night in
honor, but became like the Beasts that perysh. And the light that shyneth in
darkness, moved men of all religions to hold this. For this opinion has been
every where received, that they fell the day of their creation. So the Jews
generally hold. I heard never of one that was of an other judgment: and yet
many of them see not how fitly they say, for the Redemption by the second
Adam. The Heathen Bibliander preface in Chro.
Christians have held this from the beginning. The Gre^et Ireneus, Chryostome,
Theodorus, Theophylast, and Cedrenus age. They have a common sentence at this
day, in speech of Adam: that in one day he was formed and deformed: by dryuing
out of the Garden. What should I name Latins, as Augustine and Bernarde? the

simplest learned this much. Adam might better then Job curse the day wherein
he was made and yet CHRIST is then promised a Redeemer. Thereupon Adam names
the Woman LIFE: seeying how she redeemed from death should be the mother of
Children that by CHRIST might live for ever. The affections of Children to
their Mothers should move them to know the truth of this point. I will once
again in fit place repeat this: and hence to Christ his death will by
years express the direct state of the World, repeatyng these last poyntes^
of the speedy fall, and comfortable Redemption.

gift of faith, being the root of goodness, whom we are to follow in the
honoring of our parents, and can not go before him.

pluck him thence. O earth, earth, earth: write him childles. For none of his
seed shall sit upon the throne of David or bear rule any more in Judah.


In that day I will power upon the house of David the spirit of grace and

THE state of the forty years of JEREMY is more largely handled in Gods
book, Ezekiel. 4, 6.
the^ that every years story may be touched once in one line: wherefore I will
so far break of the Chronicle, as to make some discourse of things falling
out within it. Iere. 7, 14.
All JOSIAS days JEREMY taught freely, 2. King. 23, 21. 2. Chro. 34, 21.
Sophe. 1.
that JERUSALEM should be as SYLOH. The king reformed his state, kept a most
solenne Passover, and looked for captivity: but God reiourned it until his
death. SOPHONY after reformation, warns the kings sons of Gods judgment,
2. K in. 23, 29. The fyfth calamity.
and blames many for closse Idolatry. On EGYPT they stayed, whose king NECHO

but to better comfort. Then Necho held CARCHEMYS against ASSVR, and displaced
king IOACHAZ, carrying him into EGYPT, and placed ELIAKIM king in IVDAH,
changing his name unto IEHOIAKYM. In the first year of Iehoiakym Jeremy does
prophecy, that SALLVM or IOACHAZ shall not return from EGYPT but dye there.
Chr. 22. That NABVCHADNEZAR shall be king of BABEL: Iere. 27, 12.
and TZEDEKIAS of IVDAH: that JERUSALEM shall be made as SYLOH. VRIAH is kylde,
and JEREMY quit. His third year endyng, and much of his fourth, Iere. 26, 23.
Dan. 1, 1. Iere. 25, 1.
is the first of Nabuchadnezar. Then Jeremy prophecieth that NECHOS Garrisons
of CARCHEMYS, and al EGYPT shall be subdued by Nabuchadnezar. The former
presently took effect. Nabuchadnezar comes against Jerusalem, and Jeremy
tells again more particulerly of Nabuchadnezars power and kingdom to be
great for seauentie years: Dan. 1. The seventh calamity.
and of Ierusalems desolation for seauentie. Then Jerusalem besieged his taken,
IEHOAKIM, DANIEL, ANANIAS, AZARIAS, and MISAEL, with others of the kings
stock, are brought to BABEL. The king is sent home again, and made tributarie
to Nabuchadnezar. Iere. 36, 15. Iere 22, 19. 2. King. 24, 1, 2. Chro. 36, 6.
Dan. 1, 8. Leuit, 11.
The same year: and the next Jeremy lamenteth Jerusalem. BARVC is his Scribe,
reads his Lamentations: which IEHOAKYM cut in pieces: thereupon God tells
that he shall be buried as an Ass. Three years Iehoakym served Nabuchadnezar,
the next herebelleth. Three years Daniel, Ananias, Azarias, and Misael,
bestow in Chaldean studies: having showed rare care and courage in straight
obedience to MOSES ceremonies. When Iehoakym rebelled, then the other are found
ten times better learned then the Chaldeans, by the king: and appointed of him
to serve in his Court. Esa. 39, 6.
So Esays prophecy is fulfilled. 2. King. 20. DANIEL had also skill in Visions
and Dreams: whose case I compared before with JOSEPH'S for time of showing
skyll, for kings affection, for excellyng Magicians, for advancement to the
mayntenaunce of their brethren. Two year after he had showed the king the
dexterity of his study, Consider Daniel, Chap. 2. with the 7, 8, and 11.
The king in one dream sees how BABEL alone, MADAI and PARAS jointly, IAV AN
first jointly, after parted, in EGYPT and BABEL should rule many Nations, and
afflict EBER until the birth of our Lord, the king of all kings: as Esa. 9.
This he saw in one Image, and forgate his dream. DANIEL saw the same:
remembered it: taught it the king: is made a great man: prefers Ananias,
Azarias, and Misael, to be rulers in BABEL. Sone after the king sets up a
great Image: and casts Ananias, Azarias, Dan. 3.
and Misael, into a Furnace of flaming fire, accused to refuse the worshypping

When they went into the Fire JEHOVAH went with them: and Nabuchadnezar saw one

MATHANIAS his brother by general term of coosenage: His fathers brother
properly, in succession his son is made king by Nabuchadnezar, as God told
Jeremy. Four year Jeremy labors to teach how nations must bear the yoke of
BABEL: After Iechonias and Mordochay were carried away. In his fourth year
ANANIAS prophecyeth falsely: that within two years God will break the yoke of
the king of BABEL, and restore IECHONIAS home, and all that were carried with
him: Jeremy tells Ananias that for his false prophecy he should dye that
same year: which death of his fell out as it was foretold. The same year
Jeremy writes to Israel carried to Babel, that they should look for the end
of seventy years before they looked to return. Also, he sends to Babylon a
prophecy of the fall of Babylon, Iere. 50. and, Chap. 51.
larger then that in ESAIAS. Chap. 13. and 14. and 21. Or that in ABAKVK Chap. 2.
and charged the bearer SARAYAS ruler of Menucha, who was sent from TZEDEKIA^ to
Babel that he should read the Prophecy at Euphrates: then should he tie it
to a Stone, and cast it into the myddle of Euphrates, saying: Thus shall
Babylon be drowned. Apoc. 18, 21. Apoc. 17, 5.
The like are we taught, Apo. 18. touching ROME, called BABYLON in a mystery.
Then a mighty Angel took up a Stone like a great Millstone, and cast it in^o
the Sea, saying: with such violence shall the great city Babylon be cast and
shall be no more found. As Jeremy writes to Babylon to keep Israel in true
patience, Iere 28, 17.
and hope of deliverance: so false Prophets in Babylon resisted him: One
ACHAB and TZEDEKIAS, Iere. 29, 22.
of whom he prophecyeth that Nabuchadnezar will make them an ensample, and a
byworde of myserably cursed: burning them in fire. We may be sure so it fell
out, because they styrred men to fall away from his obedience. He that spared
not the Chaldeans, Dan. 2. would not spare them. Also in Babylon there was a
man called SAMAIAH, who wrote to Jerusalem against Jeremy, that he should be
clapped up in Lytle-ease, for writing to Babel that their captivity should be
long. JEREMY from God sends him a bitter answer: He calls him a Neclemite:
which is, a Dreamer. It may be his family came of NACHAM 1. Chr. 4, 19. and as
he pretended, that the punishers of Jeremy should follow Iehoiada: Iere. 29,
32.
so might Jeremy taunthim, that he was rather to be called a dreamyng
Neclemite, then a Noe-like Nachamite: for of Nacham, (which means comfortyng)
had NOE his name. Genesis 5. Of him Jeremy writes, that in Babylon his family
shall peryshe.

When Jeremy had been thus resisted, Ezekiel. 1, 1.
by false Prophets, God styrreth up Ezekiel to persuade the remnant by
writing, that they should be carried to Babel. Est 2, 6.
He was captiued when Iechonias and Mardochai were. His example, Eze. 40, 1.
and the experience of two Captiuities might have warned them not to store up
wrath: but to mark how Israel pylde by PVL, captiued and pylde in part to
straight slavery by Tiglath-Pel-esar, had full payment to bondage by
Salman-asar. So Iudaht City already surprised twice by IEHOIAKYMS frowardnes,
was now past hope of ability to resist one set up a Conqueror for their
sins, when they daily more and more provoked Christ against them. Ezeki. 1.
The thyrteth year after the solenne Passover, and fyndyng of MOSES
original, EZEKIEL sees the glory of God and Christ: also he sees the
mynistery of the Angels, which in wit excel, in might are strong, in service
vnweary, in quicknes flit: them he saw in form of bodyed weightes, bearyng in
part the form of a Man, of a Lion, of on Ox, of an Egle: they had also
wings: and a voice was heard: of the blessed glory of JEHOVAH from his place.
The Christians redeemed from the Heathen, Apoc. 8, 7.
have much the like. Apo. 4. Here were also wheels within wheels with fellyes
full of eyes: whereby the creature ruled by an endless foresight, ought to be
meaned. There appeared besides upon a Sapphyre throne the lykenes of a man,
with the sight of fire myxt with the Raynebowes color. So Christ shows him
self before the end of ten Calamities named Esa. 6. Ezeks. 3. and 4.
Now Ezekiel in Table, Diet, and lying on his Sides, betokens that Jerusalem
by siege, and famyne, shall be taken: wherein note specially the time, applying a
day to a year. Three hundred and ninety days represent so many years from
the falling away by JEROBOAM. By so many years shall Jerusalem be destroyed,
and left defolate. In the end of them, when you are within forty of the
last, on the other side, was Ezekiel to lie forty days for a new remembrance
of the sin of IVDAH: who should be destroyed as aforesaid: and that when
forty years should be accomplyshed in the preaching of Jeremy, whom they so
much despised. Famous would God have the pains of that his servant. Ezeki. 5.
The same time Ezekiel shauyng his head, and partyng the hear, shows IVDAHS
case. One part ^he burnt with fire: an other part he cut with a sword: the
third part ^he skattered into the wind. One part he bound up: and soon after
^he brent also that part. So Israel should peryshe in besiege by famyne,
pestilence, and such dispertion, and a small remnaunt for a while left with
Gedaliah, should soon by Ismael come to nothing. Iere. 41, 2.
The next year again he sees the glory of Christ, leauyng the Temple, the
Cherubim accompanying, and going to Mount Oliuet. The like forsakyng of the
Temple Christ showed with his Disciples in the days of his ^^eshe. Mat. 24.
But Judah knew not God in Christ, reconcyling the world unto him self. Thus
the two years confute Ananias the false Prophet. In the seventh of Tzedekias
Ezekiel tells that Israel brought from the Wilderness into the PLEASANT LAND,
shall be brought again into the Wilderness of the Heathen. Note that to be the
name of Chanaan, Ezeki. 20, 7. Dan. 8, 9. Dan. 11. 16. Ezeki. 21, 26.
the PLEASANT LAND in Eze. 20. and Dan: 8 and PLEASANT Mountain. Dan. 11, for
Syon or Jerusalem. In that year Ezekiel calls Tzedechias a profane bad man:
and tells of his abasing, and Ie-chonias advancement: and the Crown
ouerturned, and that the Kingdom shall be no more until HE comes to whom it
belongs. He means thereby CHRIST: Luke 1, 32.
who shall fit upon the throne of DAVID for ever. Luke 1. To this place of
Ezekiel respected Nathanael, when he says to the Lord: John. 1, 49,
Thou art the Son of GOD: thou art the king of ISRAEL: acknowledgyng that he
was come ^o whom it belonged. Deuteronomy 15, 12, Iere. 34, 14.
In the year of Rest, Servants were made free according to Moses: whom their
Masters made bound again against the Law: thereupon Jeremy tells of their
bondage.

In the ninth year of the second Captivity, Est. 2.
that is since Iechonias Mard^chai, and Ezekiel, were carried captives, and
Tzedechias was made king: the tenth month, 2. King. 25, 1.
the tenth day of the month, Iere. 52, 4.
Ezekiel is told in Mesopotamia that, Iere. 39, 1.
Nabuchaduezar that very day in Judea laid siege to Jerusalem. Ez. 24, 2. 6,
16.
Then God lykneth Jerusalem unto a pot seethyng full of flesh, until al be
marde. Ezekiels wife dies: for whom he is forbid to mourn, as his peoples
sorrow for the children of Jerusalem should be greater then open mournyng might
express. Notwithstanding all this, at Jerusalem little thought they that their
City should be destroyed: and Jeremy is in Prison, for saying that God would
deliver Jerusalem into the hand of the king of Babel. First in straight prison.
Iere. 37. and 38
Cha. 37. after in the court prison, after that in a dungeon, thence is brought
again to the court prison, wherein he tarieth until the City is taken. Iere.
32, 7. The 19 of Nabuchadnezar.
In Tzedechias tenth year the Prophet buyeth a piece of ground of Chanameel
his uncles son, Iere. 32. and 33.
in token that after their carriage to Babel, there shall be for Judah a return,
and policy to buy and sell. The same time he confirms the people in
expectation of Christ: which covenant is stronger that the heavens order. The
same year Ezekiel^ prophecyeth that Pharaoh king of Egypt (who had been as a
Reed to the house of Israel) should be ouerrun, as before Jeremy had told.
Cha. 44. And in these times of siege, Ezekiel. 5, 10.
extreme sorrow befell in Israel by plague, famine, and sword. Fathers did
eat their children, and children their fathers. Moses foresaw and foretold
that. Deuteronomy 28, 53.
A greater desolation is after told, Dan. 9, 27. 2
whe^^ CHRIST is utterly denied by them. King. 25, 2.
In the eleventh year of Tzedechias* the fourth month, Iere. 39, 3.
the City is taken: Iere. 52, 5.
Then Nergal, Sarezer and other Noble of Babylon enter into it. The Heathen
make Nerighsarus one of the kinge^ of Babel: a petty king well he might be
under Nabuchadnezar, but none o^ the chief three, for whose reign only Judah
should be in Babel. These Potentates of Babel executyng the judgment of
Christ, Iere. 26, 8.
by the close assistanc^ of his Angels, are perfourmers of that vision which
Ezekiel saw in Tzedechias sixth year: when Angels like men come from the north
Gate, the^ another man marketh them in the Forehad that mourned for the sinn^
of the City, Ezekiel. 9, 3, 4.
that they might be kept safe. That falls out in Jeremy, Bar^^^ Abdemelech,
and such godly. So in the spiritual fall from the faith to Idolatry, which the
Apocalypse reuealeth: An Angel comes from the East, Apoc. 7, 8, 9.
and seals a great number: who makes seven Trumpeters agayns^ king Abaddon.
Now by night Tzedechias fled through the kings Garden* and through the gate
between the two walls: and he went through the fields: 1 King. 25.
the Chaldeans ouertooke him at Jericho: brought him to Riblah, condemned him,
slew his children before his eyes, and brought him to Babe^* but he never saw
Babel, being made blind before. This, Ezekiel wa^ taught in Tzedechias sixth
year, Ezekiel. 8.
when he was commanded to prepare instruments of transmigration: and to change
place before his peoples ey^^ on the day light: and in the night to go forth
before them, and dygg^ hole in a wall, and to bring those that beheld him
through that hole: th^^ he was to cover his own face, that he should not see
that Land. Th^^ the wheels of Gods government appear full of eyes, that so
accordingly ruled Tzedechias case. The tenth calamity.
The nintenth year of Nabuchadnezar the first mon^^ Nebuzaradan burned the

Romans, by whose policy he was crucified. The King was upon this to destroy
the kings own Nation, City, and Sanctuary. Of that he foretold them, that
their place should be desolate. Mat. 24. and of the proper token: when

touching order of time. Chap. 9, 27. His whole book conteyheth so long a
warnyng given to the Jews, as GOD by Lamech gave to the old world, when he
named Noah A special Comforter. But the Jews went in the misbeliefe of the
old world. The Lord by these times had shaken not only the Earth, Heb. 12,

receive. Ioh. 5. Dan. 9, 27. Math. 14, 15. Mark. 13, 14. Zacha 11, 1, 2. Ezekiel.

and earthly Emperors, but also the Heavens and the old Ceremonies, that
figured the doctrine of the kingdom: that such as should not be shaken might
be settled. Yet the Jews denying the true Messiah, cleave to Bar-chozba, who
said that he was Christ: for him they rebelled, though after he reigned two
years and an half, they killed him. Talmud in Sanedren. Cha. Chelek. Pa. 93
and 97. Thereupon the Roman abominable infidels with force of desolation come
to the mountain and place once holy: and work a final judgment upon it.
Then Libanus did open the gates: fire brent the Ceders, the Fur, and Oak
houled: when Nations warred against Jerusalem, took the City, rifled the
houses, defiled the women. And now is the day of lively waters issuing from a
Jerusalem from east to west: To which City they who will not come from all the
families of the earth to worship the king JEHOVAH of hosts, their flesh, eyes,
and tongue shall consume. Zach. 11. 14. according to this, after the fall of
that Jerusalem God reuealeth to John being in obscure Patmos: Apo. 20, 19. Apo.
21.
How the Romans will fight also against the heavenly Jerusalem: the glory of
which he sees most goodly. Concerning the Romans: these two things he
discovers, the profane Emperors tyranny: and after their fall, the Popet
double impiety poisoned with hypocrisy. The Stories of both, be most manifest
of any Stories: and the Pseudo-catholikes own testimonies will confirm the
matter. Apoc. 1. Tren 5. Eus. Chr. 3, 18
That Rome is condemned in the beginning for banishyng John, all grant, that
know Domitian. That Rome holds on to the end, in the Cup of the last wrath

when the city shall peryshe which had the reign over the Kings of the
earth. Cha. 16 and 17. Let us consider the state of Rome, and mark how sit
arms it has, in two beasts of small difference: both seven headed: in one
horned like a Lamb: in a Woman, Locustes, and in the Serpent: whose power
extremely is executed. Rome stood upon seven Hills, and had the policy
altered five t^mes before Casares, they make the fixed: After Emperors and
Popes together, made a seventh, which after a sort should be an eight. That
power is noted by a beast of seven heads: whereupon the Angel expounds it of
seven Hills, and seven Kings. Any political state is in the Ebrew phrase
calde a King, as Dan. 8, 21. Rome was infamous for cruelty ever since Romulus
kylde his brother: but specially in the ten Persecutors and the Popes. The one
beast the later has for that, purple color. The beast Chap. 13. has a
clear note from famous stories. Whereas the Image of the Emperors in Daniel
were a Lion, Bear, Leopard, and abeast with ten horns: Rome having subdued
all those Countries, thereaftet is a Beast with ten horns, like a Leopard,
footed like a Bear, Apoc 17, 12. Steuchns against Laur. Valla book. 2.
mouthed like a Lion. Also the other Beast has ten horns very fitly: both for
the ten Persecutors, and ten Kingdoms that John foresaw should be under the
Popo: and Steuchus does pretely confess: and the Greek Scholiast foretold
that it would fall out so. The kingdoms 1. of Spain and Portugal. 2. of
Hungary. 3. of England. 4. of Denmark. 5. of Ruscia. 6. of Creatia and
Dalmacia. 7. of Aragon. 8. of Bohemia. 9. Sueuia and Noruegia. 10. of Dacia:
These Steuchus records to have given their power to the Beast. For they paid
tribute to the Pope, who calde his throne the Apostolic seat, Apoc. 13, 5.
and had the mouth of the Dragon. The Greek Scholiast speaks most fitly upon
this place: saying, that the ten Horns are ten Kings, which in the later
times shall arise from the Roman power, among whom the A^tichrist shall rise.
Areth^^ was no Prophet, yet the playnnes of the matter caused him to say this
much. And in these ten Kingdoms is revived a spice of the government of the
people of Rome: Which then when John wrote had divided their Countries of
Lieutenantshyppes into ten: as Srabo, who saw Iohnt days, lately had recorded
Geo 17. This Empire notwithstanding their strength was overthrown for the
Emperors fylthy life, specially for kyllyng them that had the testimony of
JESUS. For the Lord Jesus fought against them in justice and power, Apoc. 10.
Apoc. 6, 2. The white Horse, the 1 and 5 seal.
as riding on a white Horse, with a Bow, and Arrows sharp in the heart of the
kings enemies. The holy Martyrs, who had hearts like Lions, they laid under
the Altar, styrred up the holy and just LORD, to judge and revenge their
blood, upon those beasts that ruled the earth. They in patience, as Oxen
sacrificed, yielding their blood, saw a just recompense of bloodshed. For all
their profane Emperors almost (some somewhat favored Christians) brought
their heads, with blood to the grave: as they came not up without great
bloodshed. The vengeance of God was to them as a red Horse, The red Horse the 2
seal.
with a rider having a great sword* and a commission to take peace from the
earth: that men should kill one another. Famine in great wars is not greatly
strange: but here scarcity exceeding plentiful did they see who were men in
deed, a punishment of the Gospel rejected. Many learned men of the heathen
noted the pitiful state: but had not the judgment of a man to know that for
savage cruelty against the Gospel, this punishment was sent. The wise might
see a black Horse sent from God, The black Horse the 3 seal,
with a ryder having a balance weighing Corn, as Spice for dearth: though Oil
and Wine, and some sustenaunce of the earth was granted by the patience of God.
Gods patience not being regarded, he sent among the Caesaret upon the
persecution by Diocletian, threefold judgments to the Emperors, as sword,
hunger, and death all together. They who with Eagles eyes, would come to see
Christ his justice, might now behold a pale Horse* having death and hell
ryding upon him. Tbe pale Horse the 4 seal. Sozimus, book 2. notes that
Licinius one of the striuers at once of his 130000. soldiers lost all saving
three. The 6 seal.
Then such slaughter made the Caesaret, and the Augusti, of them selves and of
their people, that the Kings, and Dukes, and Earls, and every free man, and
servant, were feign in all places to hyde them selves from them that favored
Christianity, whom God made the stronger. The profane men for Idolatry felt
such wrath as did Samaria, when Isra^h kingdom ended: when they well might say
to the Mountains, fall upon us, and hyde us. Yea, they that thought them
selves to be the Sun, Moon, Stars, Heavens, and Mountains of the World,
and to rule all Islands, are brought to such destruction, that the whole world
as touching them is altered: The Earth is shaken, the Sun black the Moon
blooddy, the Stars fallen, the Heaven rolled as a roll, Apoc. 6, 14.
and every Mountain and Island have such alteration of dwellers as if they were
moved from their place. These speeches may fitly be applied to the times of
Constantius and Constantinus, the first Christian Emperors. The like tropes
are in Esa. 34. of matters fallen out before these times: though most properly
it will fall out, when upon the Popes utter destruction the whole world shall be
ended. But once it must be meant touching the destrustion of the Empire.

CONSTANTINVS hating the idolatry of old Rome, The Beast has one head
vvou^ded to death. Apoc. 13, 3. Sozimus bok. 2. Orosius. 7. Ierom to Placidia.
Rome became a pray, and sk^ffe to most nations. Sigibertus. Homer. Iliad. 8.

made Byzantium the princes seat: called it NEW ROME, and endowed it with the
privileges of OLD ROME: and gave it also another name. CONSTABLE ANTINO-POLIS. The
Empire being there placed, the OLD ROME that in Italy was little set by, and by
Gods just judgment often ouerrun. For Alaricus and the Goths spoiled it, and
so prevailed there, that they purposed to have named it GOTHIA. Genserieus and
his Vandales rifled it, that they bestowed fourtene days in ransaking it.
Odoacer with many nations surprise it, and reign there many years. But many
more years does Theodoricus with his Ostrogothes rule it. Totilas the Goth
brent it, as Scipio did Carthage. Then Scipio spoke verses of Homer: which
Hector had forespoken of Troyes ruin. Polybius demaundyng of what City he
spoke: he said, of ROME: that the day should come, that it should be made like
Carthage. That saying of Scipio is applied to Alaricus his time: it might be to
Totilas, who brought ruinous Rome to an extreamer ruin. And so the city there
was defaced. But when the PONTIFICALITIE is set up by the decree of GOD, then
all Heathen from east to west worship the Pope no otherwise, then of old t^^e
they did the Emperors: whereas if it had not been for the pontificalt^ie, ROME
should never have been revived, but left a most fylthy habitation of hogs.
This Steuchus confesses. So by the POPE the Beast that was dead, is made
alive. Chap. 13. And that which. Cha. 17. for estimation once had been and
after had not been, now again for estimation is: and the POPE rulyng over the
Empire, makes the seventh and the eight Policy in ROME. Apoc. 13, 11.
To make that point more plain, of reuiuyng Rome by the POPES, we have a new
vision. For they are a Beast with horns like a Lamb, and the mouth of the
Dragon: who makes the image of the former Beast to have life, spirit, voice,
and worship of nations, with kylling the men, and confiscating their goods,
Read the forged donation of Constantine.
that yield not to their joined power. Hereupon it has been clearly showed by
the Learned, that for Laws, Apparel, and Idolatry, the POPES are a lively
image of the profane Emperors: with a religion more after Homer, then after
the Scripture. Moreover to declare what should be meant by Horns like a Lamb:
in the usurping Vicar of Christ, we have a certain name poynted at: whose
frame and force will show the matter. Many men's names there be in the
HOLYBOOKE, of fit marks for things that men conceive of God, or would find
in them selves. And in the supposed barren places, Ezra. 2, 13.
as in Ezra great fertility of wisdom grows. From thence hither God gives
us a number attributed unto a man, which will show us what man's name being
opened for the force will utter the state of the Beast: and we should make more
account of the golden wisdom herein contained, then SOLOMON would of the 666
Talentes of Gold, As in the book of Numbers, so in Ezra the names and numbers
are to be diligently regarded.
which he receyned yearly. 2. Chr. 9, 13. The book of Numbers, as Jerome
marked, conteyneth the mysterie^ of Arithmetique. For that Book Midrat Tillin
ryghtly observes great Religion contained, in the names that be therein: that
they are not Egypticall, but fyt for Gods children. As doubtless they are apt
touching notation for the first borne, recorded in the Heavens. Heb. 10.
ELI-TZVR, GOD-IS-MY-ROCKE: TZVRI-SHADDAI, MY-ROCKE-IS THE ALSVFFICIENT, These
show how the sum of Religion is contained in their names, whereby that nation
would not soon understand the term ROCK, Math. 16. of a bare man of
Abraham's seed, nor join with POPES for the supreme Rock of the Church. The
book of Ezra is much of the same kind: but in that age men had less regard
to the disigent wisdom of their Fathers, as the Mid^a^ also remembers.
Thence we have a name marked by a number: wherein both must be considered. The
number ordained is 666: by which we find out a man's name fyt for the woeful
POPES. In Ezra Chap. ^* 13. it is written, The sonnet of ADONI-KAM were 666.
Here then a name of a man by a number is showed: And what might his name mean?
Adoni-kam, is by interpritation A God standing up.

What name can better agree with the POPE, the man of sin that speaks with
the mouth of the Dragon most tragically, I am a God upon the earth. Baldus in
C. ecclesia vt sit peudeat fol. in cap. ego N. de Iurciur. Dan. 11. ^. Thessa.
2. 1. Macha. 1, 57. R. Abr. Adon^^. Zonaras. bo^ke. ^.
The Pseudo-catholikes them seluessay: the POPE is GOD upon the Earth. The POPE
is Lord of Lords, and has the authority of the King of Kings over his
Subjects. And is not he then the only man to whom properly belongs the name
ADONI-KAM? Seeing he sets up him self in the Temple of God, as if he were
GOD. Antiochus Epiphanes who started from Rome and set in the Temple the Idol
of Jupiter Olympius, did not so much exalthym self above God. The POPE began
to stand up a Lord, when impudent Boniface gate the supremacy by the murderer
Phoca^. But that mystery of iniquity wrought further to the quickenyng of the
Beast, in that sad time of Gregory the third. For he to strengthen Idolatry,
excommunicated LEO the Greek Emperor, putryng down Images, though he did
that by the consent of council, upon the express commandment Exodus 20. That
excommunication kindled sedition, which inflamed the Longobardiet against the
Emperor.

After that he lost first the Exarchy of Rauenna, and in process of time the
government of Italy. When the Longobardi increased styrres in Italy, and the
Greek Emperors troubled at home, upon the former sedition for Images, were
less able to help Italy and Rome: Charle^ the great is moved to wars upon
an injury done by Desiderius king of the Longobardie^ to him self. And (as
defenders prosper) He put Defiderius besides his own kingdom, and holdyng
Italy then by that conquest: kept it still. This breach in the Empire came by
the POPE, and his Idolatry. Charles the great gave much reuenwes to advance
holy knowledge, being taught by Englysh Alcoinus: and sundry of hi^ posterity
followed him. All their liberality the POPES labor to turn^ from paynefull
study, to superstition and their own power: And a^ the last persuade the
people, that they had authority over the Empire: and prescribe Idolatry through
all the Empire: reuiuyng the old Beast.

the bearyng of the NVMBER of his name: it is all one as to have a mark in
hand or forehead, work or any profession: but that the allusion is fetched
from Ezra. 2, 13. For as the sons of ADONIKAM make up the number 666: So they
that be the POPES babes, and hold him to stand up as GOD in the Church, are
said to have his names number. And for most clear condemnyng of Rome, mark
who the Woman is that rides upon the Beast. Apoc. 17. One running by may see.

co^demnyng Rome, made the lesuites mad to seek rediculous distinctio^s. See
their Testaments notes. Apo. 17. There they byte their ^vvne tongue.
In S. Ieromes days it was doubtless, the Greeks still are of that judgment:
Rabanus and Albertus note how manifest it is: the Jesuits can not deny it: but
they shall strive against their owneselues. And that place is a key to open a
gate to the other visions: through al which Rome is condemned extremely.

From this BABYLON came Idolatry, which caused CHRIST to cast fire into the
Earth. And though as it were seven Trumpets sounded all points of dealyng and
doctrine, men would not hear what GOD spoke to the congregations. 1. Trumpes.

Their ceassyng to be Pastors makes a Star fall from Heaven. Thereupon to

heavenly congregation, the Pope works strange things: by the Keys of the
Pit he loosed out a smoke of heresies, that darkened Sun and Air: al
brightness of Scripture. Thence aryseth his Clergy, which most lively is
expressed. They be Locustes for their idle bellies, and troops of loyterers:
they be Scorpions for close poysonyng doctrine: Esa. 9, 15.
And the Tail is the Prophet that speaks lies. They are for the Wars which
they make, and strengthenyng of their own Authority: as Horses ready for

men: for Cloysterkeeping and womanly life: and for many of woman sex, they
have hear like women. These notes al agree most fitly to the Pseudocatholiques.

Now consider Moamed or Muchumet, whom God gave up to a blind mind, and
effect in error, that by him Christians might see, what mischief might as well
come by Popes supremacy. This Moamed an Ismaelite being a poor man, till he
married a wydow welthy and of high countenance: having the Falling sickness,
whereby the wydow was sorry that she matched with him, persuaded her by him
self and others, that his fyttes were but atraunce: wherein he talked with the
angel Gabriel. The woman made women believe that her husband was a Prophet:
afterward men by help of certain Haeretiques set the false Prophet forward.
From Iudaisme, Arrius, Nestorius, and his own brain, he frames a doctrine.
Much he was opposite to the Pope, as in polygamy against his Monachy: much in
the same kind, as that he has the Keys of PARADISE: as the Popes were then,
somewhat talkyng of S. PETER'S keys. Both had Keys of the Pit. He preuayleth

naturally of Sara, as the Pope has truly h^lynes, and as the Papists are
Catholics.
The sons of Ismael ashamed of Agars name, borow from Sara the term of
Saracenes. The Pope was bolder, that takes from God the title HOLINESS. His
sons of darkness follow him that appropriate the name of Catholics, being but
Psendocatholiques. Both in their deceyte increase much: the one by success in
wars, and one point of plain truth: that Images might in no wise be
worshypped. Th^other prospered by teaching a short way, supposed of Salvation,
to know and fear God so far as an Idol did move to understanding and
reverence. The Pope was mighty in causing Stars to fall from Heaven. Agarenet
prevailed in conquest of the earth. These countries in speedy process were

Persia, Armenia, Spain, Sicily, Crete, much of Italy, Calabria, and all

vicar of Pilates holiness: and Cittim to hold such Abadd^^ until the end. At
the last thus the Turks join with them. When the Saracene^ had conquered much
they make five mighty Empires. In Spain, Lybia, Egypt, Babylon, and Persia.
Muchumet of Imbrael king of Persia having war against Babel and India: hyreth
three thousand Turks, Herodto. in Melp.
to whom one Tangolipex was general. They by name and place should rise from
Togarma. In Herodotus the name Iyrkes is recorded: where the place somewhat
argues the men to be the same. These helping Muchumet, at last fell to a
mutany, and to avoid punishment, shronke to a place of great vantage for
safety. Whom Muchumet seeking to repress, by vnheedines lost 20000 of his men:
being angry, pulde out his Captains eyes, and threatened to put all the other
Soldiers to open shame. The Soldiers fearyng, fled to Tangolipex. Muchumet
with all his power comes against him: is kylde in the field, and Tangolipex
proclaimed Sultan: (That is, Ruler) of all that Muchumet had. The term Sultan
is in Daniel 3. In the Caldy. Dan. 3. The Saracens description it much after
the Papists.
That Israel was skattered near the Turks: I showed before. Thus from
Euphrates, Saracenes and Turke^ spring to have thousands of thousands: to be
four Angels of Gods wrath upon Idolaters, ready for hour, day, month* year:
as Idolatry and other sins provoked God. As their conversation, so their
description is after the Pseudocatholiques rate. which through these find
measure for measure. Their force is Horses: their courage is Lions heads.
Their great desolation which they make, burning where they go, is Habergions,
fyery blew and brimstony. Their might, and doing this upon a word, is fire,
smoke, and brimstone, coming out of their mouths. Their false Doctor, guyding
their rule, is the tail like a Serpent, that draws as Papistry to the
second death.

The Greek Emperors understood that for Idolatry they were punished: Cedrenus
and Nicephorus tell this, though with malice.
and by learned counsel did repress it vehemently: From Leo Isauricus to
Theophilus: who could not abide any Picture to allure the mind: which ought
to regard not shadows, but truth. Yet after his death Idolatry confyrmed in
old Rome, came so to new Rome: that Saracenes Angels from Euphrates were let
loose. Papas is Father, and Popes Deuels. Eust. upon. Homer. The description of
Satan by Romes arms openly argues Rome to be Sata^s throne.
This came from Papes turned to Popes: from Fathers to Deuels. The description
of Satan the Dragon is therefore like the Roman power, with red color,
seven heads and Diadems, and ten horns. Though Satan stryued by might and
guyle: yet from the time of our Lord his death he was tied a thousand years
from deceyuing generally. For Martyrs and other faithful that thousand years
learned the life of Christ: and reigned with him. As for the faythlesse dead in
sin, Satan was not tied to them, who would not be holy and happy, in knowing
the first resurrection. But after a thousand years, Satan was let loose every
where, and few found Martyrs that held clear the testimony of Christ. Gregory
the seventh manifestly held the throne by Satan. And Vrbanus that confirmed
his decrees, was in the same condemnation. He no less besieged the holy city
of Christians in all his proceedinges, and became a mountain of Fyrein the
mids of the Sea: Specially in kindlyng the In they. 1085 Volater. Of th^s

Wars for Jerusalem: and causing that place to be counted still holy. There
nygh 200 year fell the force of the West: whereby Emperors and Kings were
weakened, to be under the Popes. Upon the same the Saracenes more hated the
Christians of the east: When they marked our Idolatrous and supersticious
conspiracies. So long sharp wars never were in the world, of such
calamities to both sides. The places by old names, fall properly within the
text: for plagy Antioch was buylt by that GOG Ezekiel. 38. And Jerusalem was
called the Holy City: notwithstanding here the four quarters of the earth,
and troublers of the Christians be meant. So that, Ap^: 14 the blood reaching
to the Horse brydles 1600 furlonges, fitly is spoken of this vvarres for the
land of Israel: for in Salomons Temple blood reached to the horse brydles: and
the whole land of Israel, (through all which this war went) is holden
1600 furlongs large in R. Menachem upon Genesis fol. 60.
Now the Pope king Abaddon of Gyges slight by man's help cannot be
overthrown. But Michael that stood on the waters, and calmed the old Gogs
waves, stands and swears in like sort against him. Seven thunders declare
the thunder of his power: seven Angels power upon the beast going to
destruction, the last Plagues from seven Cups of Gods wrath.

In quietness they have fylthy Boyles, in troubles less and more, their waters
are turned to Blood. That holiness throne is vile in Satan's darkness, and for
treachery they find burning affliction. For Idolatry still they from East and
Euphrates myghtely prevail: and when they stir their Kings against us in
the West: their three froggy spirits, that of imperial power, that of false
prophecy, that of Satan's slight: all three bring their Navy, and other force,
as to the waters of MAGEDDON, to be cut in pieces. They shall feel the
seventh Cup of wrath, and hear the seventh Trumpet: when Nations oppressed
by them, learn skylfully to sing, HALLELV-IA: and with understanding can
praise the Lord. Even the Lord must consume this bad king Abaddon of Cittim
Italy in the end, at his glorious appearyng. For light and comparison of both,
you shall have a fuller. Map, and Pictures.
As those Beasts in Daniel by the first coming of CHRIST into the world,
were wholly consumed: for whom God sat on a fyery Throne: So the Beast
compounded of those Arms, shall perysh at the second: For whom a white throne
of justice is openly revealed. By sentence thence the false Prophet POPE, and
the Beast of his auctority shall aye feel Gods wrath until they both be cast
to the Dragon into Brimstony fire. Even so, Amen. Holy and just are thy
judgments O Lord, the king of the Saints.

After the destruction of Babylon, let us behold the salvation of Syon: which
mountain the Lords death lyftted above all Mountains: Esa. 2, 2. Mich. 4, 1.
Apo. 14.
that all Nations might follow the Lamb upon it. At Jerusalem the Disciples
received power from above: being together about an hundredth and twenty
souls: to declare the great works of God, in raising his son from death.
Then were Jews from all Nations under Heaven at Jerusalem. Saint Luke
reckons them much after the countries, into which men were first scattered
upon the confusion of tongues, for the building of Babylon: and according to
the kingdoms that oppressed the faithful Ebrevvet after Babels ruin by Sem
and Iapheths posterity. The number of an hundred and twenty to speak to all
Jews, that from far Countries came to Jerusalem: was fit to revive the
story of their dispertion under Darius and Cyrus: Ierom upon Dau. 6. Dan. 6.
and 9. 2. Chro. 36, 22. Ezra. 1 3. Luke. 19, 11.
when by decree of Madai and Faras the God of heaven was preached: Cyrus sent
Judah to build Jerusalem: and Gabriel told what year, day, and hour, CHRIST
should dye. That Prophecy made them come that year to Jerusalem, to look for
the kingdom of Heaven to appear. Then from Syon was the Law to go forth,
Esa. 2, 3.
and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem, even when the most Holy by his death
had confirmed the testament for many. The learning of salvation by Greeks hence
first taught: was that dwelling of Iapheth in Sems tents. Hitherto was that
place glorious by the blessing of Sem, That Melchisedec was cmmonly holden to
be Sem, these Authors of sundry religions I had at hand to name, to stay such
as think that a new opinion. Hebrews upon Gene. 14. Rabbi Leui, Ben-gerso^,

who notes for the phrase that in Sems generations, Dying is not mentioned
until Thara ( which was mentioned in all from Adam to Noe) because CHRIST
should come of Sem, who lives for ever. Consider Syrach, 49. The learned
Latins also commonly hold Sem to be Melchisedec. Selneccerus upon Genesis 14.

who under the person of Melchisedec, was still alive in description. Genesis 14,
18. To which description the Jews were to look, that CHRIST might be known
to be God the just king, heir of the world, faithful over his own house, a
fynisher of Aarons office, of al Sacrifice and Offryng, an eternal sacrificer
by once offering him self. In this City they received power in a strong wynd,
in fyery cloven tongues, were filled with the holy Ghost, and could speak to
every one in his own language. So the Jerusalem from above was to be buylt,
that all nations might work in it, as contrariwyse by tongues not
understood, the work was but Babylon a confusion: and men ^kattered caused
the name Synear: and were estranged from the Tents of Sem: and life of God,
without whom being their guide, they perysh for ever. Hence the Disciples went
forth to teach how CHRIST was to suffer: to arise from death, and to give
salvation to the world.

That work they performed by the strength of God: who confirmed their
doctrine with signs, wonders, powers, and gifts of the holy spirit,
according to his will. Some of these godly Angels soon did seal their
doctrine with their blood: some later ended their goodly combat: some lived to
see CHRIST come in his kingdom with power: when the word was fruitful in
all the world: and that city was buylt by Fyshers of Galilee, which is called
IEHOV AH-THERE.

Then Tongues, Nations, and people of all Kingdoms departed from the power of
darkness, by faith and obedience to the kingdom of Christ, geuyng honor and
glory for ever to the king euerlyuing, holy, vnuifible, God, only wise. Of the
Jews there held still the faith an infinite number, termed by thousands
144 after their reckoning of many. These with us Heathen come to the feast of
Tabernacles with Palm, crying HOSANNA, Salvation to God, and to the Lamb.
This company of faithful s^^les, called to the blessed marriage of the Lamb,
are a Jerusalem from Heaven. Apoc. 3. and 21. Ebr. 12. Though such glorious
things be spoken concerning this city of God: the perfection whereof cannot
be seen in this vale of tears, yet here God wipeth all tears from our eyes,
and each blessing is here begun. The name of this City much helps Jew and
Gentile, to see the state of peace. For this is called JERUSALEM: and that in
Canaan has Christ destroyed. This name should clearly have taught both the
Ebrevves not to look and pray daily for to return to Canaan: and
Pseudocatholiques not to have fought for special holiness there. We live in
this by faith, and not by eye sight: and by hope, we behold the perfection. Of
this City salvation is a wall, goodly as Jasper, clear as Crystal. The
foundations are in number twelve: of twelve precious Stones, such as Aaron ware
on his breast: all the work of the Lambs twelve Apostles. The Gates are
twelve, each of Pearl: upon which are the names of the twelve Tribes of
Israel: of whose faith all must be, which enter in. Twelve Angels are
conductours from east, west, north, and south: even the stars of the
Churches. The city is square: of Burgesses settled for all turns. Here God
sits on a Throne, like a Jasper and Ruby, comfortable and just. The Lamb is
the Temple: that a third Temple should not be looked for to be buylt. Now that
Melchisedec represents GOD, these very Ebrewes grant. R. Symeon in Zoar, and
R. Menachem, fol. 45. that he represented CHRIST. R. Isaac ben Arama upon Genesis
47. and Mose^ Hadarson upon Number. 16. they hold that. Yet their darkness cannot
comprehend the light of God dwelling in Christ.
Thrones twice twelve are for all the Christians: borne of Isreal's twelve, or
taught by the Apostles: who for dignity are Seniores: For infinite, are
termed but four and twenty, in regard of so many Tribes and Apostles. Here
the Majesty is honorable: as at the delyuery of the Law, from whose throne
thunder, ^oyces, and lyghtninges, do proceed. Here oil of grace is never
wantyng: but burning with seven Lamps, the spirits of Talmud in Sanedrin,
Cha. Chelec, fol. 73. b.
Messiah, of wit and wisdom* of counsel and courage, of knowledge and
understanding, and of the fear due to the eternal. Here the valiant patient,
witty, and speedy, with sharp sight, are winged as those Seraphim that waited
on Christ: when ten calamities, and utter destruction was ^olde for the low
Jerusalem. They of this City are not as Israel, after the flesh, which would
not see for all the wonders that our Lord did. But these redeemed by his
precious Blood are full of eyes, lyghtened by Lamps, the glory of IEHOV AH,
and beholding Christ through all the Prophets: a perfourmer of our faith,

Church. Here is the true light, where the saued-walke. Hither kingdoms bring
their glory: Hither the blessed Nations carry their Jewels. This is a kingdom
uncorrupted, which shall not be given to a strange and unclean people. They
must be written in the book of the Lamb, and chosen of eternity, sanctified
of God, which here be citizens. Through this there gusheth a stream better
then the four in Eden: a stream of lively waters by belief in Christ, as
those waters flowyng from Lebanon. Here is that Tree of life in the mids of
the Paradise of God, with leaves to heal the nations, that wylbe cured, while
it is said to day: with twelve fruits, to give food continually: to such as
feed also upon the h^d Manna: who after death, receive the crown of justice
and life, 2. Tim 4, 8. Apoc. 2. Apoc. 3.
the morning star, white clothyng, and the white stone: wherein a name is
written, equal to all the Law. Deuteronomy. 27, 2. The first state of the first Adam
in the first Paradise was glorious: This is better. And as Moses began with the
terrestrial, so the holy word ends in the celestial: that to wheels full
of eyes, may the writ of truth be compared. The full consent and melody of
Prophets and Apostles: how their Harpes are tuned on Mount Syon, it will fully
appear in the full sight of peace: when our bodies are made conformable to
Christ his glorious body in the world to come: Phil. 3, 21.
and our eyes shall see the Lord in that Syon. For that coming, O thou whom my
soul loves, be like to the Roe upon the mountains. Cant. 1. and. 3.
Amen, even so come Lord Jesus. Then we shall in perfect holiness worship thee:
to whom the Angels always give holy worship: saying, praise, and glory, and
wisdom, and thanks, and honor, and power, and might, be unto our God for
evermore.

Amen.
