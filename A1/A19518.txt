Q. What is a Sacraments?

A. It is an outward and visible sign, instituted and ordained of the Lord, to
confirm the promises, and covenants of God made to us in the Gospel, in the
hearts of the faithful.

Q. What do you learn out of this definition?

A. First, that a Sacrament is a sign of an other thing, which is signified.
Secondly, that every Sacrament, must have his institution of the Lord. Thirdly,
that it is a pledge or scale of the promise of salvation. Lastly, in all
Sacraments, we must consider, first the outward and visible sin: Secondly,
the thing thereby signified: Thirdly, the proportion or agreement which is
between the one and the other.

Q. Why do you say this is a Sign?

A. Because it is a thing which the Lord sets before (...), to signify a
thing which (...) be (...).

Q. Why must it be instituted of God only?

A. He only must (...) the Sign, and (...) the promise of salvation.

Q. Why must it be a (...) seal of the promise of salvation?

A. Because it is given us of the Lord for the confirmation of our faith, which
is grounded upon the promise of salvation.

Q. What is the outward and visible sign in Baptism?

A. Water.

Q. What is signified thereby?

A. The blood of Christ Jesus, which was shed for our sins.

Q. What proportion or agreement is there between the water of Baptism, and
the blood of Jesus Christ?

A. As the water does wash away the filthiness of the body, so our souls
being sprinkled with the Blood of Jesus Christ, are washed and purged from the
filthiness and pollution of sin.

Q. Is there any difference between water in Baptism and other water?

A. Not as concerning the substance, but they differ in use: For common water
serves to wash the body, but water in Baptism is a Sacrament of the washing
of the soul.

Q. Wherefore are we but once baptized, since we are commanded oftentimes to
receive the Supper?

A Because as Circumcision was to the Jews, so Baptism is to us an entrance
and admission into the Church of God. And it is sufficient for us once to be
admitted into Gods family, and therefore, as they were but once circumcised,
so must we but once be baptized: yet that we may remain and continue in this
family and Church of God, it is necessary that we be fed oftentimes, and
therefore we must often receive the Sacrament of the Supper, as the Jews did
every year celebrate the Pass-ouer.

Q. What are the outward and visible signs in the Lords Supper?

A. Bread and wine.

Q. What does the bread signify?

A. The body of Christ.

Q. What does the wine signify?

A. The blood of Christ.

Q. Why has the Lord instituted two signs in the Supper, and but one in the
Baptism.

A. As our bodies are not sustained by meat only, but also by drink, so the
Lord would assure us, that we are not fed to halfs, as it were, but Christ he
is both meat and drink unto us.

Q. What is the resembling or proportion betwixt the Sign and the thing
signified?

A. That as our bodies, by the hands and mouth receiving these outward things
of Bread and Wine, are thereby nourished indeed: so assuredly we apprehending
by Faith the Passion and Bloodshedding of Jesus Christ, our souls are thereby
nourished and fed to eternal life, having out sins remitted, and Christ's
death and righteousness impu^ed unto us.

Q. Is the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament the s^^e which other common bread
and wine is?

A. They are the same in Substance and Nature, but the holy use whereunto they
are applied, make them differ, from common bread and common wine.

Q. Is not the Bread turned into the Body, and the Wine into the Blood of
Christ?

A. No.

Q. But does not our Savior Christ say, this is my Body, when he gave the
Bread, and this my Blood when he gave the Wine?

A. Yea, but they are figurati^e speeches, attributing the name of the thing
signified unto the thing signifying, as also in the old Sacraments,
Circumcision was called the Covenant, which was but a sign of the covenant,
the Pascall Lamb, was called the Passe-ouer, the rock was called Christ.

Q. Why is the sign called by the name of the thing signified?

A. Because we should lift up our minds from those earthly and corporal things
unto the heavenly and spiritual things which are signified by them.

Q. Show me more plainly, how the Bread and Wine represent unto us the body
and blood of Christ.

A. As Bread and Wine have a property to nourish and maintain us in this
present life, so by the partaking of the body and blood of Christ, our souls
are nourished in the hope of ouerlasting life, so that we are not partakers
only of the bread and wine, but of the body and blood of Christ, because he
has said, This is my Body, this is my Blood: and the Bread and Wine, which is
given and received, is still Bread and Wine naturally but yet the body and
blood of Christ Sacramentally: For the Bread and Wine keep always the first
nature, but in as much as they are Signs and seals, they have the name of the
things which they seal and signify: neither is Christ's body and blood
enclosed in the Bread and wine, for he ascended into Heaven, where he must be
until the time of the restoring of all things, and according to his divine
Nature, power, and presence of his holy Spirit, he is present, and will be unto
the end of the world. And although the body of Christ be in Heaven, and we be
on the earth, yet thorough a true and a lively Faith, which ascends and
takes hold of the mercies of God in the merits of Christ Jesus, we go up
into heaven, and he comes down to us by his Spirit, which can easily join
together things that be sundred.

Q. To what end do we receive the Sacrament of the Supper?

A. First for the strengthening of Faith. Secondly, for a testimony of our
obedience and thankfulness unto God for the work of our redemption. Thirdly for
the increase of love and amity: For there is always a Communion of Saints in
the Church of God, which especially consists in this, that all the children
of God are members of the same body, and partakers of the same Savior and
redeemer, Jesus Christ.

Q. That we may be worthy Communicants of this Supper, how must we prepare our
selves unto it?

A. We must first try and examine our selves concerning the doctrine of a
Sacrament, whether we do rightly understand or conceive of it or no:
Secondly, concerning our manners and life, whether we be fit to receive it at
the time appointed.

Q. How must we examine our selves concerning the doctrine.

A. By entering into consideration of that which the holy Ghost has written and
set down of it, whether we do fully understand and know it, and whether our
hearts and consciences can willingly subscribe and yield unto that which is
taught to be the truth of it.

Q. Is this examination of our selves, concerning the doctrine, necessary?

A. Yea, otherwise how shall we know how to behave our selves in this holy
action, except we know what it is that we do, and for what end and purpose.

Q. How must we examine our selves concerning our manners and life, whether we
be fit to receive this Sacrament or no?

A. By proouing our selves, whether we be the members of Christ or no.

Q. How shall we know this great secret and mystery?

A. If we have Faith and Repentance.

Q. How shall I discern that I have faith?

A. If in my heart I be assuredly persuaded by the working of the holy Spirit
in me, that the punishment of my sin is fully discharged in Christ, and that
whatsoever he has done, pertains not only unto others, but even unto me

Q. How shall I know that I have true Repentance?

A. If I be inwardly and heartily sorrowful for my sins, and do most
willingly confess them unto God, with full deliberation and purpose of
amendment of life, and an earnest desire to mortify and kill sin in me, and
wholly to confirm my self to do the will of God.

Q. What if I find not these things in me, what counsel give you me than?

A. Not to presume to come to this Table of the Lord: for he that eats and
drinks unworthily (that is without Faith and Repentance, whilst he is a
wicked liver, a profane person, a blasphemer, and such like, and has not
repented him of his sins, with full purpose to renounce them and live always
afterward in the fear of God) he eats and drinks his own damnation, not
discerning the Body of Christ aright.

Q. Is it a thing left to our choice and liberty whether we will come to the
supper or not?

A. No, the holy Ghost in forbidding men to come thither unworthily, commands
all that have discretion and judgment to examine diligently, and prepare
themselves, that they may come worthily unto it. So that if we absent our
selves and neglect this preparation, and making of our selves ready to come
unto it, let us fear least we become contemners of it, and so deprive our
selves of that great benefit which is offered unto us by it.

Q. Show me more plainly, how I may discern whether I have Faith or no?

A. If Christ be in me.

Q. How shall I know Christ to be in me?

A. By three benefits wherewith he comes unto us, Blood, Water, and the
Spirit.

Q. What is meant by Blood?

A. Our justification, consisting in Christ his righteousness, and the
forgiveness of sins by his blood shedding.

Q. What is meant by Water?

A. Our sanctification, when the Grace of God teaches us to deny ungodliness,
unrighteousness and worldly lusts, and to live godly, righteously and soberly in
this present world.

Q. How shall we know that we feel both this true mortifying or denying of
sin, and true living to righteousness?

A. When both from a true sorrow, according to God, for every thing we know
forbidden of God (yea the least) as all light Oaths, idle words, profitable
lies, or vain actions, we feel a study to avoid the first motions to them,
and clearing of our selves from all suspicion of them by avoiding all appearance
of evil: an indignation for all such things past: a fear least such things
by our corruption should fall out again: a great desire to prevent them: a
zeal against them: a punishing of them, by exercising all due authority:
which God has given us against sin: as also a great study to spend all the
rest of our time, according to the will of God.

Q. What is meant by the Spirit?

A. That full assurance which the holy Ghost works in our hearts, that we are
Gods Children, whereby we are sealed unto the day of redemption that is fully
assured that with all be kept by the power of God, through Faith unto salvation.

Q. By what ordinary means is that true Faith and that which follows it,
wrought in us?

A. By the preaching of the Gospel,

Q. What is the cause that so many hear the preaching of the Gospel, yea do
receive it with some taste, joy and understanding, and yet obtain not this
Faith and the fruit of it?

A. The cause is, the unchangeable purpose of GOD from before all beginnings,
wherein he has (being moved only by his holy will) appointed freely to
choose some in Christ unto salvation through Faith, for the praise of his rich
grace, and justly to cast away others, when they should by their own default
deserve the same.

Q. What means besides the service of God at home, must we use to exercise,
confirm, and nourish this Faith and the fruits thereof?

A. We must diligently use all the works of the public ministry, which are
prescribed of God: as Prayer, Doctrine, exhortation, the Sacraments, and
communicating unto the poor.

Q. Because our especial purpose in this work is to entreat of the
Sacraments: in conclusion, show us, and that plainly, when we come to the
Supper of the Lord, how we must prepare our selves before, behave our selves in
the present work, and reap fruit by it continually after?

A. Before we must try our Faith and repentance, not only whether they be
true, but also how we grow in them, what is the dullness and weakness of
them, that we may the more seruently seek the quickening and strengthening of
them in this Sacrament: In the present work, we must have in every outward
action, the inward feeling of that which was signified by it: as in putting
apart of the Bread and Wine, we must feel more assuredly that Christ's Body
and Blood was put apart, by his Prayers to be the food of our souls: by the
breaking of the bread and the pouring forth of the Wine, that his Body was
Crucified, and his Blood shed for us: by the giving and receiving of them, that
his body and blood is presently more lively given unto us, and received by
faith: By the eating and drinking for the nourishing of our bodies, that our
solues so joyfully feed on Christ by faith, as we are more fully assured of
the forgiveness of all our sins, especially particular sins, of greater grace to
leave them, of eternal life, in soul and body, as we do with heavenly
consolation, sing praises unto GOD for the redemption of the world. Afterward
by the meditation hereof, we must be strengthened in all temptations, which are
against our justification, and sanctification.

Q. What is Prayer?

A. It is a petition, joined with an earnest desire, proceeding from the
acknowledging of our necessity with humility, repentance, and confession of
our unworthiness, made in a true conversion unto God and trust of heavenly
promises, for Christ our mediator his sake: wherein we ask those things of
God which he commanded us to ask of him in his word.

Q. God knows before we ask what we need, so that he need not to be put in
mind, he is not sloathfull that he need to be stirred up, he has appointed
in his providence what he will bestow, how and when: therefore why should we
pray?

A. First to stir up our selves to seek him: Secondly, to exercise our
