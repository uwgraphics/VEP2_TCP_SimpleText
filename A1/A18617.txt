Choice of Inventions, Or Several sorts of the figure of three,
That are newly composed as here you may see,
Then lend your attention you shall hear anon
It goes to the tune of Rock the Cradle sweet John.



THere were three men of Gotam,
as I have heard men say,
That needs would ride a hunting
upon Saint David's day,
Though all the day they hunting were,
yet no sport could they see,
Until they spide an Owl
as she sat in a tree:
The first man said it it was a Goose,
the second man said nay,
The third man said it was a Hawke,
but his Bells were fallen away.
There was an Ewe had three Lambs,
and one of them was black,
There was a man had three sons,
Ieffery, James and Jack,
The one was hanged, the other drowned,
The third was lost and never found,
The old man he fell in a sownd,
come fill us a cup of Sack.
There were three London Lasses
did love a bonney Lad,
And either of these Wenchs thought
this young man to have had,
These Damsels all together met,
and wrought a strange device,
That she should have the man that could
throw most upon three Dice,
Their maiden-heads must be the stake,
now mark what did befall,
The young man threw the greatest cast
and bravely won them all.
There was an Ewe, etc.
There were three good old women,
that would not be contrould,
And each of them must take her cup
to keep them from the cold,
The one of them a Tailors wife,
the other was a Weauer,
The third a merry Cobblers wife,
that praid for dirty weather:
To sit and chat of this and that
it was then their hearts desire,
So long they staid till two were drunk,
the third fell in the fire.
There was an Ewe, etc.
The Piper pip't his wife a dance,
and there sprung up a Rose,
The Cobbler drunk strong ale so long
till he had wronged his Nose:
His wife came with a Broomstaffe,
and struck him on the head,
That every one did surely think
the Cobbler had been dead,
But being to his senses come,
sweet wife said he be quiet,
This twelve months day I Will take small Beer,
or water for my diet.
There was an Ewe, etc.
A man that has a sluttish wife,
is in a beastly taking,
And he that has a cleanly wife
is of another making:
He that has a dogged wife,
my fancy cannot brook,
But he that has a virtuous wife
has far more better luck:
He that has a drunken wife
that spends all at the Alehouse,
Were better take a Cord in hand,
and hang himself at the Gallows.
There was a Ewe had three Lambs,
the one of them was black,
There was a man had three sons,
Ieffery, James and Jack,
The one was han^'d, the other drowned,
The third was lost and never found,
The old man he fell in a sownd,
come fill us a cup of Sack.
The second part To the same tune.


THere was a ^^sse had three Lovers
the one of them a Tailor,
^he second was a monied man,
the third a Iouiall Saylor,
The Tailor gave his Love a Gown,
in love and kind good will,
The Usurer with his money bags
her purse did often fill,
The Saylor in the Evening came
unto his hearts delight,
And bravely carried the wench away,
the child and all by night.
There was a Ewe had three Lambs,
and one of them was black,
There was a man had three sons,
Ieffery, James and Jack,
The one was hanged, the other drowned,
The third was lost and never found,
The old man he fell in a sownd,
come fill us a cup of Sack.
There were three roaring Fiddlers
came lately out of France,
That light and nimbly can
'teach maidens how to dance:
In Turnbull-street and Clarkenwell,
Pickt-hatch and fair Bloomsberry,
These fiddlers taught their scholar there
to sing, dance and be merry:
Yet bid all Fiddlers have a care
of dancing in this kind,
Lest they from Tiburne chance to fall,
and leave their Crowd behind.
There was, etc.
A man that has a sign at his door,
and keeps good Ale to sell,
A comely wife to please his guests,
may thrive exceeding well,
But he that has a scolding wife,
his fortune is the worse,
For she will not only brawle and chide'
but pick her husbands purse,
And he that has a fool to his wife,
her neighbors often will ^lout her,
But he that has a Whore to his wife,
were better be without her.
There was, etc.
There were three lusty soldiers
went through a town of late,
The one loved Besse, the other Sisse,
the third loved bouncing Kate,
These maidens were three Landresses,
to wash men shirts and bands,
And for their pains these soldiers gave
them wages in their hands:
The Gallants are to Sweathland gone
all this is truth I tell ye,
And left these Lasses for to cry,
woe and alas my belly.
There was, etc.
Three Gallants in a Tavern
did bravely call for Wine,
But he that loves those dainty Cates
is sure no friend of mine:
Give me a cup of Barley broth,
for this of truth is spoke,
These gallants drunk so hard that each
was forct to pawn his Cloak:
The oil of Barley never did
such injury do to none,
So that they drink what may suffice,
and afterward be gone.
There was a Ewe had three Lambs,
and one of them was black,
Th^re was a man had three sons,
Ieffery, James and Jack.
The one was hanged, the other drowned,
The third was lost and never found,
The old man he fell in a sownd,
come fill us a cup of Sack.
