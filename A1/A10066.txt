A Monstrous shape. OR A shapelesse Monster.
A Description of a female creature borne in Holland, complete in every part,
save only a head like a swine, who has travailed into many parts, and is now
to be seen in LONDON,

She Is loving, courteous, and effeminate,
And nere as yet could find a loving mate.
To the tune of the Spanish Pavin.


OF horned Uulcan I have heard,
His teeth were longer the^ his beard,
Whose monstrous looks made all afeard
which did that night behold him:
And of transformed Acteon,
Which like a Heart in Forest ran,
And how fair Lidia like a Swan transformed.
Of Robin Goodfellow also,
Which was a servant long ago,
The Queen of Fairies does it know,
and hindered him in fashion:
She knew not what she did her self,
She changed him like a Fairie elfe,
For all his money, goods, and pelf,
she gulled him.
But yet be brisk you Yonkers bold,
And list to what I shall unfold,
Such news before was never told,
as I will now relate:
My subject is of such a Girl,
That has both silver, gold, and pearl,
Yet never will be for an Earl
right fitted.
This Urokin as I understand,
Is now arrived from Dutchland,
And has as much gold at command
that she would wish or crave:
Her portion threescore thousand pound,
Both corn and cattle on her ground,
As good as any may be found
in Holland.
Besides, a dainty Less is she,
A Boores daughter in the Low Country,
Her mother is in her degree
a very proper Fro,
And all the Tribe from whence she came
Call her fair Pigs nigh by her name,
You Will say they have reason for the same
hereafter.
To describe her from top to toe,
I purpose now for to do so,
And show how neatly she does go
when young men come a wooing:
She shows her pretty heel and foot,
A dainty leg adjoining to it,
Her stockins stik, if that will do it
she cares not.
The second part, To the same tune.




HEr person it is straight and tall,
A lilly white hand, her fingers small
Makes her the handsomest wench of all
that ever her father got:
In handsomnesse she does excel
Both bouncing Kate, and bonny Nell,
In dancing she does bear the bell
of many.
So choice of fare she is indeed,
As often as she does stand in need,
A silver trough she has to feed,
when ever she wants victual:
The silver trough is straight brought out
Wherein she puts her dainty snout,
And sweetly sucks till all is out
of action.
And to speak further for her grace,
She has a dainty white swines face,
Which shows that she came of a race
that loved fat porke and bacon:
Yet would I not her kindred wrong,
Her nose I think is two foot long,
Also her breath is very strong
and fulsome.
Yet let no party her despise,
She is furnished with two pigs nies,
Though something of the largest size*
they do become her neatly,
Her ears hang lolling toward the ground
More fairer then a mastie hound,
Thus are her fortunes still renowned
by hearesay.
Great store of suitors every day,
Resort unto her as they say,
But who shall get this girl away,
as yet I do not know:
But thus much I dare undertake,
If any do a wife her make,
It is only for her moneys sake
he loves her.
If any young man long to see
This creature wheresoere she be,
I would have him be ruled by me,
and not to be too forward,
Lest ye at last should fare the worse,
Although she have a golden purse,
She is not fit to be a nurse
in England.
