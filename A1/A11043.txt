HOLY CHVRCHES Complaint, for her childrens disobedience.



HE which the Church, for Mother will not have,
And still continues in his stubborn will,
May be assurde, that God him will not save,
But let him headlong run, from worse, to ill:
If thou for ever then, with him wilt be,
Come home again, the Keys he left with me.
Holy Churches Complaint.
VVHiles Adam soundly sleep did take,
Gods wisdom did provide:
A loving Spouse to be his make,
Created from his side.
So Christ our Lord upon the roode,
By death on sleep did fall:
And from his side water and blood
Did run to rinse us all.
Whereby his Church he did ordain
His loving Spouse and make:
The cause why all that bitter pain
He suffered for her sake.
And cleansed her from filthy crime
By Baptism bath, by blood:
And wanne her strait from time to time,
By conquest on the Roode.
And warned all, obediently
To hear his Churches voice: Math. 18.17.

Or else, as heathen men to be,
And of no better choice.
Wherefore (O man) take thou good keep
What holy Church does say:
Unto all such like wandering sheep
As run from her astray.
O erring flock, with all thy power,
Return to me again: John 10.

Or hellish wolfes will thee devour,
Unto eternal pain.
You should be children of Gods house,
Come seek your dwelling there:
Gods holy Church, and loving Spouse,
Which is your Mother dear.
Aug. in psa. 88. and de lymb. lib. 4. Cip. c. 10. de simplicitate prelat.
Proverb. 1.9. John 14.16, 26. John 15.26. John 16.7.
As holy Doctors all write this,
And constantly agree:
To whom Christ's Church no mother is,
God will no father be.
The holy Ghost Christ promised
To me his Spouse to send:
That in all truth I might be led,
Until this world should end.
The 2 Testame^ts Malach. 2.7. Esa. 12 3. Romans 10.15. John 10.
From my two dugges the food of life
Do all Gods children draw:
Submissiuely, without all strife,
Unto my sacred Law.
If any man contend upon
The mysteries of our faith:
Then should you answer such a one,
As sacred scripture says.
1. Cor. 11.16. 1. Reg. 15.22. 2. Cor. 10.5. 1. Pet. 1.14.
No such custom have we in this,
Nor holy church likewise:
For we well know, Obedience is
Exceeding sacrifice.
Take Credit and Authority
From me, Christ's Spouse away:
Then all true faith undoubtedly,
Will fall to deep decay.
By me you know, God, and his word,
And the true sense thereof:
Though heretics will not accord,
But prowdly scorn and scoff.
And schismatikes that separate
Themselves from grace and peace:
How do you think your sinful state
Alas shall find release?
O think on what our Savior dear
Has suffered for thy sake:
The space of three and thirty year,
Most bitter pains to take.
And poorly borne, it is well known,
Thou needst not to be told:
Descending from his heavenly throne
To bring thee to his fold.
And in this worldly wilderness,
With love long has thee sought:
The poerelesse price who can express
Wherewith he has thee bought.
For love of thee his grief was great,
The like was never found:
From his sweet face a bloody sweat,
Did trickle to the ground.
Mark how his blessed flesh was rent,
With whips on every side:
Yet for thy sake he was content
Such torments to abide.
Upon his head, him to disgrace,
They set a crown of thorn:
That streams of blood ran down apace,
Which patiently was borne.
Condemned was this Innocent,
Upon a Cross to die:
The which he bare incontinent
Toward mount Caluerie.
His blessed hands and feet thereto
With nails were fixed fast:
Three hours so, most bitter woe
For thee thy Lord did taste.
All passengers that pitteously
Behold this bitter pain: Thren. 1.12.

Declare to me, like cruelty
Did ever man sustain?
His head with thorns, his eyes with tears,
His mouth is filld with gall:
And bloody wounds (as well appears)
Do pain his members all.
This heavenly bridegroom on the Roode
His Church to Spouse did take:
And others all as bastards brood
Did utterly forsake.
Then all his pain it is in vain,
O sinful wretch to thee:
Except in me thou will remain
In perfect unity.
Galat 7. 1 Pet 3 21. Ephet. 5.24.
As well Noah's Ark did signify,
When all the world was drowned:
So in my lap assuredly
Is all true safety sound.
Symbol. Athan. John 15.1.5, and 6
Seek where thou will, no other place
From sin can set thee free:
Of all the treasures of his grace
The Keys he left with me.
My Spouse ascending left with me,
His treasure and his store:
That I might give, as cause I see,
A salve to every sore.
The seven sacraments.
Give ear to me a little space,
And mark attentively:
How seven conduits of God's grace,
I open unto thee.
And first in Baptism I do bear
The sacrament of Baptism.
(Through God the holy ghost)
Most faithful children far and near
To him in every coast.
Then do I strengthen them also,
Confirmation.
With further gifts of grace:
To fight against their deadly foe,
That seeks them to displace.
If they, through sin, and Satan's guile
Penance.
Receive some deadly wound:
I can them salve and reconcile,
Repentance being found.
I feed them all with Angels food,
And heavenly Manna pure: The holy Eucharist.

Which hung for them upon the Roode
Salvation to procure.
I give them grace to multiply,
In such as married be: Matrimony.

Two in one flesh coniunctiuely,
Resembling Christ and me.
For godly government, I give
High Orders in degree: Holy Orders.

Under whose charge my children live,
And walk obediently.
As David sung in prophecy Psalm. 44.17.

For parents past, again
Should children borne still placed be
As Princes for to reign.
When languishing sore sick they lie
In weak and feeble state:
To comfort them my Pastors hie,
In that most dreadful gate. The sacrament of extreme Unction.

The gate that all mankind must go,
Wherefore I them annoint:
With holy oil against their foe, Jacob. 5.14.

As Scriptures do appoint.
Moreover this, The holy sacrifice of the mass.
I have a pure
And daily sacrifice:
Which to my children does procure
Mercy, and Grace likewise.
As Malachi foretold, by name, Malac. 1.11.

From rising of the Sun:
Unto the setting of the same
This sacrifice is done.
With other gifts and graces more, Eccl. 24.

I have for to dispose:
Which all that thus unkindly go
From me, of force must lose.
Return then to repentance meek,
Mercy in time require:
I groan, I sigh, I sobbe and seek
To save thee from hell fire.
Thy Fathers force, and potent hand
In furious rage will strike:
Luc. 10.16.
If thou thy Mother do withstand,
And sacred Laws mislike.
Ose 1, and 2.
Forsake that stepdame Heresy,
Come walk my holy way:
Esa. 35.8.
Wherein, by Esaies prophecy,
Fools cannot run astray.
Embrace me then obediently,
See in Gods sacred Book:
Esai. 49, 23.
How mighty Kings shall foster me,
And Queens must give me suck.
O how should I forgotten be
Thus in so short a space:
For never since Christ planted me,
That I did hide my face.
Although that harlot Heresy
Would mask in mine attire:
Yet may the simplest plainly see
How hell and she conspire.
To seek my utter overthrow
Is all their whole intent:
Yet spurning at the prick, you know,
Is time but vainly spent.
Full falsely they do me accuse
Matthew. 13.25.
Their own dark cause to clear:
That I Gods truth did clean refuse
For many a hundred year.
Math. 28.20. John 14.16.26 John 15.26 John 16.7.
Though Christ my Spouse, and only aid,
The holy Ghost my guide:
As is in Scripture plainly said,
And cannot be denide.
If that a Bird cannot incline Math 10.20. Luc. 12.6.

To fall, nor to ascend:
Without Gods providence divine,
Whereon she does depend.
If to each creature he do yield
Relief in their degree:
And to the Lillies of the field
Will not unmindful be. Math. 1.26.28.

He cannot be forgetful in
His honor, and renown: Esai. 49, 15, 16.

And suffer so hell gates to win, Math. 16.18.

His kingdom and his crown.
My feet are placed on the rock,
My God is my defense: Gala. 15.1. Psalm. 17.31.

The force of all the hellish flock
Cannot remove me thence.
Of Truth I am the only ground, 1. Tim. 3.15.

As holy Paul does tell:
In me Gods will is only found,
In me all grace does dwell.
I am the Tabernacle still, Psalm. 18.6.

Set in the Sun to shine:
I am that city on a hill, Math. 5.15.

That's hid from no man's eine.
I am cut forth of Christ his side,
As is in Daniel found: Dan. 2.35.

To fill the world both far and wide,
With force of doctrine sound.
Therefore my name is Catholic,
For every time and place:
Unto that faith then firmly stick
That most men still embrace.
By David's words I hold this plea, Psalm. 2.8. Psalm. ^1.8.

That Christ must rule and reign:
From sea to sea, and from the sea
Through all the world again.
How can they charge me that I should
Gods holy truth deny:
For, so his promise cannot hold,
But Scriptures falsely lie?
He prayed for me most fervently,
How could he but prevail?
And therefore did assure to me,
Luc. 22.31. Luc. 12.49. Math. 13.24, 30
My faith should never fail.
O you poor souls so purchased,
With Christ's most precious blood:
What fury has so fondly led
You from your chiefest good?
Especially to thee my dear,
Standing in this estate:
Through wicked wealth, or worldly fear,
O most accursed Fate.
Less to esteem of God then gold,
Of soul than carcass vile:
O that such sensual pleasure should
Put reason in exile.
Heb. 12.1 and 2. Math. 16.24. Math. 10.37, 38.
If here thy cross thou will not take
With Christ thy captain kind:
For evermore in Limbo lake,
Be sure thou shall it find.
But if like Christ's disciple sound,
Thy cross thou will endure:
In heavenly wealth thou shall abound,
And lasting joy procure.
Alas, you run your course in vain,
You loose your heavenly crown:
Return to Noah's Ark again,
Or else you needs must drown.
Convert all erring hearts (O Lord)
Thy loving Spouse defend:
That we always with her accord,
And so make up, and end.
Finis.
Deo gratias.
