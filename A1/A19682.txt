The Merry Cuckold.
Who frolickly taking what chance does befall,
Is very well pleased with Wife, Horns and all.

To the tune of, The merry Cuckold.



You married men
whom Fate has assigned,
To marry with them
that are too much kind,
Learn as I do,
to bear with your wives,
All you that do so,
shall live merry lives.
I have a Wife
so wanton and so free,
That she as her life,
loves one besides me,
What if she do,
I care not a pin,
Abroad I will go,
when my rival comes in.
I can be merry
and drink away care,
With Claret and Sherry
and delicate fare.
My Wife has a Trade,
that will maintain me,
What though it be said,
that a Cuckold I be.
While she at home
is taking her pleasure,
Abroad I do rome,
consuming her treasure.
Of all that she gets.
I share a good share,
She pays all my debts,
then for what should I care.
She keeps me brave,
and gallant in clothing,
All things I have,
I do want for nothing.
Therefore I conniue,
and wink at her faults,
And daily I strive,
against jealous assaults
While for small gains:
my neighbors work hard,
I live (by her means)
and never regard.
The troubles and cares,
that belong to this life,
I spend what few dares:
gramercy good Wife.
Should I be jealous,
as other men are,
My breath like to bellows,
the fire of care
Would blow and augment,
therefore I think it best,
To be well content,
though I were Vulcans crest.
Many a time
vpbraided I am,
Some say I must dine,
at the Bull or the Ram:
Those that do ieere
cannot do as I may,
In Wine, Ale and Beer,
spend a noble a ^ap.
The Second part. To the same Tune.




I By experience,
rightly do know:
That no strife or variance,
(causes of woe)
Can make a wife
so bent to live chaste,
Thou in stead of strife,
let patience be placed,
If a man had
all Argus his eyes,
A wife that is bad,
will something devise,
To gull him to's face,
then what boores mistrust,
The horns to disgrace,
though wear it I must,
I Will be concent
with this my hard chance,
And in merryment
my head I Will advance.
Wishing I were
but as rich as some men,
Whose wives chaste appear,
yet they will kiss now and then.
One trying to me,
a great comfort is,
Still quiet is she.
though I do amiss,
She dares do no other,
because she knows well,
That gently I smoother,
what most men would tell.
If I should rave,
her mind would not alter
Her swing she will have.
though it be in a halter.
Then since that I get
good gains by her vice,
I will not her let,
but take share of the price.
Why should I vex,
and pine in despair,
I know that her sex,
are all brittle ware,
And he that gets one
who canstant abides,
Obtaines that which none,
or but few have besides.
Yet will I not,
accuse my wife,
For nothing is got,
by railing, but strife.
I act mine own sense.
intending no wrong,
No Cuckold nor Queen
will care for this song.
But a merry Wife,
that is honest I know it,
As dear as her life,
will sure love the Poet:
And he that's no Cuckold
in Country or City,
Howeuer if luck hold,
will buy this our Ditty.
FINIS.
