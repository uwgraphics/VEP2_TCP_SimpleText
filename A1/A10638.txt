How the lion king of all bestis sent out his mandementis that all beestis
should come to his feast and court capitulo primo
iT was about the time of penthecoste or whytsontyde / that the wodes comynly
be lusty and gladsom / And the trees clad with leuys and blossoms and the
ground with herbs and flowris sweet smellyng and also the fowls andbyrdes
syngen melodyously in their armonye / That the lion the noble king of all
beestis would in the holy days of this feast hold on open Court at stade /
which he did to know over all in his land / And commanded by strayte
conmyssyons and maundements that every be should come thither / in such wise
that all the beestis great and small came to the court sauf reynard the fox /
for he knew him self fawty and gylty in many things aye^^s^ many ^eestis that
thither should comen that he durst not adventure to goo thither / when the king
of all beestis had assemblid all his court / there was none of them all / but
that he had complained sore on Reynart the foxe^

The first complaynt made Isegrym the wulf on Reynart capitulo ^ij^
ISegrym the wulf with his lynage and friends came and stood to fore the king /
And said hy^ and mighty prince my lord the king I beseech you that through
your great might / right / and mercy that ye will have pity on the great trespass
and the unreasonable misdeeds that reynart the fox has don to me and to my wife
that is to we^e he is comen in to my hows against the will of my wife / And
there he has be pyssed my children where as they lay in such wise as they
thereof ben woxen blind / whereupon was a day set / and was Iuged that
^eygnart should come and have excused him hierof / and have sworen on the holy
sayn / tes that he was not gylty thereof / And when the boost with the saints
was brought forth / tho had reygnart bythouht him other wise / And went his
way again in to his hole / as he had naught set thereby / And dear king this
known well many of the bestes that now be comen hither to your court / And yet
has he trespaced to me in many other things / he is not living that could
tell all that I now leave untold / But the shame and vyllonye that he has
don to my wife / that shall I never hyde ne suffer it (...) that he shall make to
me large amends /

The complaynt of Courtoys the hounde capitulo iij
when these words were spoken so stood there a lytyl hounde and was named
courtoys / and complained to the king / how that in the cold winter in the
hard froste he had been sore forwynterd / in such wise as he had kept no more
mete than a puddyng / wyche puddyng reygnard the fox had taken away from him

Tho spak thybert the catte
with this so came Tybert the catte with an Irous inded / and sprang in emonge
them and said My lord the king / I here hier that reygnart is sore complained
on / and hier is none but that he has ynowh to do to clear him self / that
courtoys hier complayneth of that is passyd many years goon / how be it that I
complain not / that pudyng was mine / ffor I had won it by night in a
mylle / The myllar lay and sleep / if courtoys had any part hieron / that came
by me to / Then spak panther / Think ye Tybert that it were good that
reynard should not be complained on / he is a very murderer / a rouer / and a
thief / he loves noman so well / not our lord the king here that he well would
that he should lose good and worship / so that he might win as mo^h^ as a
leg of a fat hen / I shall tell you what I saw him do yesterday to Cuwaert
the hare that hier stands in the kings pees and saufgu^d^ / (...) promised
to Cuwart and said he would teache him his credo / and make him a good chapelayn
/ he made him goo sytte between his legs and sange and cryde loud Credo.
Credo. my way lay th^^ by there that I herd this song / Tho went I ner and
fond master reynard that had left that he first read and song / and bygan
to play his old play / ffor he had caught kywaert by the throat / and had I
not that time comen he should have taken his life from him like as ye hiere may
see on kywaert the hare the fresse wound yet / ffor sothe my lord the king if
ye suffer this vnpunysshyd and let him go quyte that has thus broken your
peace / And will do no right after the sentence and Judgment of your men / your
Children many yeris herafter shall be myspreysed and blamed therefore / Sykerly
panther said Isegrym ye say truth / hit were good that right and Iustyse
were don / for them that would fayn live in peace /

How grymbart the dasse the foxes susters sone spack ffor reynart and answered
to fore the king. capitulo.iiij.
tho spack Grymbart the dasse / and was Reynarts suster sone with an angry moed
/ Sir Isegrym that is evil said it is a common proverb An Enemies mouth / says
seeld well / what leye ye / and wit ye mine Eme Reynart / I would that ye would
aventure that who of you tweyne had most trespaced to other should hang by
the neck as a thief on a tree / But and if he were as well in this court and as
well with the king as ye be / it should not be thought in him / that it were
ynowh / that ye should come and ask him forgyuenes ye have byten and nyp^e mine
uncle with your fell and sharp teeth many mo times than I can tell / yet will
I tell some points that I well know / know not ye how ye mysdeled on the
plays / which he threw down fro the carre / when ye followed after fro far /
And ye ete the good plays allone / and gaf him no more than the grate or bones /
which ye might not ete your self / In like wise did ye to him also of the
fat ^lycche of bacon / which sauourd so well / that ye allone ete in your
belly / and when mine Eme asked his part / tho answered ye him again in scorn /
Reynart fair yonglyng I shall gladly give you your part / but mine eme gate ne
had naught / ne was not the better / Notwithstanding he had wonnen the flycche
of bacion with great dread / ffor the man came and threw him in a sack / that
he scarsely came out with his life / Such manner things has reynart many times
suffered through ysegrym.

o ye lords think ye that this is good / yet is the more / he complayneth how
that reynart mine eme has much trespaced to him by cause of his wife / Mine Eme
has leyn by her but that is well seven yer to fore / er he wedded her / and if
reynart for love and curtosye did with. her his will / what was that / She
was sone heled thereof / hierof by right should be no complaynt were Isegrym
wise. he should have left that he does to him self no worship thus to sklaundre
his wife / She playneth not / now makes kywaert the hare acomplaynt also / that
thinks me a vyseuase / if he read ne learned a right his lesson / should not
reynard his master beat him therefore if the scolers were not beten ne smyten
and reprised of their truantrye / they should never learn /

Now complayneth Courtoys that he with pain had gotten apuddyng in the winter /
at such time / as the cos^^ is evil to find Thereof him had be better to have
hold his pees / for he had stolen it / Male quesisti et male p^^didis^^ hit is
right that it be evil lost / that is evil won w^^ shall blame Reynart / if he
have taken fro a th^^f stolen good hit is reason who that understands the law
and can discern the right / and that he be of his burth^ as mine Eme reynart is
which knows well how he shall resseyue stolen good / ye al had he courtoys
hanged when he fond him with the menowr / he had not much mysdon ne trespaced
/ Sauf against the crown / that he had don Iustyse without leave wherefore for
the honor of the king he did it not / all has he but lytyl thank / what
skathed it him that he is thus complained on / Mine Eme is a gentil and a true
man he may suffer no falshede / he does nothing but by his prestes counseyl And
I say you sith that my lord the king has do proclaimed his pees he never
thought to hurt any man / ffor he eteth no more than ones a day / he lives
as a recluse / he chastises his body and wereth a sherte of here / hit is more
than a year that he has eten no flesh / as I yesterday herd say of them
that came fro him he has left and given over his Castle maleperduys / And has
bylded a cluse / theryn dwells he / and hunteth no more / ne desires no
winning but he lives by alms and takes nothing but such as men give him
for charity and does great penance for his sins / and he is woxen much pale
and lene of prayeng and wakyng ffor he would be fayn with god / Thus as
grymbert his eme stood and preched thise words / so saw they comen down the
hylle to hem chau^tecler the cock and brought on abiere a deed hen of whom
reynart had lyten the heed of / and that must be showed to the king for to
have knowleche thereof.

How the Cock complained on reynart capitulo.vo.
cHau^tecler came forth and smote pyteously his hands and his fetheris and on
each side of the byer wenten tweyne sorouful hens that one was called cantart
and that other good hen Crayant they were two the fairest hens that were
between holland and arderne / Thise hens bare each of them a brennyg tapre
which was long and strayte / Thise two hens were coppens susters And they
cried so pitously / Alas and weleaway for the death of her dear suster coppen /
Two young hens bare the byere which kakled so heuyly and wept so loud for
the death of coppen their mother that it was far herd / thus came they to gydre
to ^ore the king / And chantecleer tho seyde / Mercyful lord / my lord the
king plese it you to here our complaynte / And abhorren the great s^a^the that
reynart has don to me and my children that h^^re stonden / it was so that in
the beginning of app^yl when the weder is fair / as that I as hardy and proud
/ because of the great lynage that I am comen of and also had / ffor I had
viij fair sons and seven fair daughters which my wife had hatched. and they
were all strong and fat and went in ayerde which was walled round about
/ In which was a shadde where in were si^ great dogs which had to tore and
plucked many a b^^stis sk^n in such wise as my children were not aferd / On
whom Reynart the thief had great envy by cause they were so sure that hecowde
none get of them / how well oftymes has this^fel thief goon round aboutethis
wall / and has leyde for us in such wise that the dogs have be set on him
and have hunted him away / And ones they leep on him upon the bank / And that
cost him somwh^t for his theft / I saw that his skyn smoked (...) went his
way / god amend it /

thus were we quyte of reynart a long (...) at last came he in lyknes of an
^eremye^ and brought to me a lettre for to read sealed with the kings seal /
in which stood wreton that the king had made (...) oueral in his royame / and
that all manner b^^st^s and fowlles should do none harm ner scathe to any
other / yet said he to me more / that he was a cloysterer or a closyd recluse
be comen / And that he would receive great penance for his sins / he showed me
his slauyne and pylche and an heren sherte there under / and then said he /
sir Chaunteclere after this time be no more aferd of me ne t^ke no head / ffor
I now will ete no more flesh / I am forthon so old / That I would fayn
remember my soul I will now go forth / for I have yete to say my sexte / none
/ and mine euensonge to god I bytake you / Tho went reynart thens saying his
Credo / and leyde him under an hawthorn / Then / was I glad and merry / and
also took none head / And went to my children and clucked hem to gydre And
went without the wall for to waske whereof is much harm comen to us / for
reynart lay under a busshe and came krepyng bitwene us and the yate / so that
he caght one of my children and leyd him in his male / whereof when have had
great harm / for sith he has tasted of him / there might never hunter ne
hou^nde save ne keep him from us / he has waited by night and day in such
wise that he has stolen so many of my children that of ^xv. I have but four /
in such wise has this thief forslongen them / And yet yesterday was coppen my
daughter that hier lies upon the byer with the hounds rescowed This complain
I to you gracious king / have pity on mine great and unreasonable damage and
loss of my fair children /

How the king spack touching this co^playnt ca. vj:
then spack the king / Sire dasse here ye this well of the recluse your Eme
he has fasted and prayde that if I live a year he shall abye it / Now heeke
chau^tecler / your playnt is enough your daughter that lies here deed / we will
give to her the dethes right we may keep her no longer / we will betake her to
god / we will syngen here vygylie / and bring her worshipfully on earth / and
then we will speak with thise lords and take counseyl how we may do right
and Iustyse of this great murdre / and bring this false thief to the law / Tho
begone they placebo domino / with the verses that to longen which if I should
say / were me to long / when this vigilye was don and the co^mendacion / she
was leyde in the pytte / and the^vpon was leyde a marble stone polyshed as
clear as any glass and thereon was hewn in great lettres in this wy^e coppe
chanteklers daughter / whom Reynart the fox has byten lies hier under buried
/ complain ye her ffor she is shamefully comen to her death / after this the /
king sent ffor his lords and wysest of his counseyl for to take aduys / how
this great murdre and trespaas should be punysshyd on reynart the fox / There
was concluded and appointed for the best / that reynart should be sent ffore and
that he left not for any cause / But he came in to the kings court ffor to
here wat should be said to him / And that bruyn the bear should do the message.
the king thouught that all this was good and said to brune the bear sir
brune I will that ye do this message / but see well to for your self / ffor
reynart is a shrewe / and fell and knows so many wyles that he shall lie and
flatre / and shall think how he may begyle deceive and bring you to some
mockerye / tho said brune what good lord late it allone / deceyueth me the fox
/ so have I ylle learned my casus / I trow he shall come to late to mocque me /
Thus departed brune meryly fro thens / but it is to dread that he came not so
meryly again /

how bru^ne the beer was sped of Reynart the fox / capitulo.vijo.
nOw is brune goon on his way toward the fox with astowte moede / which
supposed well that the fox should not have begyled him / as he came in a derke
wode in a forest were as reynard had a bypath when he was hunted / there bysyde
was an hie montayne and land / and there must brune in the myddel goon over
for (...) goo to maleperduys / for reynart had many a dwelling place / but the
castle of maleperduys was the best and the fastest burgh that he had / There
lay he Inn when he had need and was in any dread or f^^e / Now when b^^yn was
comen to maleperduys he fond the yate fast shette / tho went he to fore the
yate and satte upon his taylle (...) Reynart be ye at home I am brownyng / the
(...) has sent me for you that ye should come to court / for to plete your
caas / he has sworn there by his god / come ye not / or bring I you not with
me for tabyde such right and sentence as shall be there given / it shall cost
you your life he will hang you / or set you on the ratte / reynart do by my
counseyl and come to the court / Reynart lay within the gate as he often was
wont to do for the warmth of the son / when reynart herd bruyn tho went he
Iuneward in to his hole / for maleperduys was full of hooleshier one hool and
there an other and yonder an other / narowe. crooked and long with / many wey^s
to goo out / which he opend and shette after that he had need / when he had
any proye brought home / or that he wiste that any sought him for his misdeeds
and trespaces / then he ran and hid him fro his enemies in to his secret
chambres / that they could not find him / by which he deceyuyd many a be
that sought him / and tho thought reynart in him self how he might best bring
the beer in charge ^ need / and that he abode in worship /

iN this thought reynart came out and said (...) eme ye be welcome / I herd
you well to fore (...) I was in mine euesong therefore have I the longer (...) a
lytyl / dear eme he has don to you no good seru^se (...) I can him no thank
that has sent you over this l^^^ge hylle / for I see that ye be also weary
that the swe^^ r^n^neth down by your chekys / it was no need / I had
neuerth^^les comen to court to morrow but I sorrow now the la^se for your wise
counseyl shall well help me in the court (...) could the king find none less
messager but you ffor to send hither / that is great / wonder / ffor next the
kyn^ge ye be the most gentyl and richest of leeuys and of land / I would well
that we were now at the cour^ but I fere me that I shall not co^ne well goo
thither for I have eten so much new mete / that me thinks my bel^ will break
or cleue asonder and by cause the mete was (...) we / I ete the more / tho
spack the bear lyef neue what mete have ye eten that maked you so full / dear
eme that I ete what might it help you that if I told you / I ete but simple
mete a pour man is no lord that may ye know eme by me / we pour folk must
ete oftymes such as we gladly would not ete if we had better / they were great
honey combs which I must needs ete for hunger / they have made my belly so
great / that I can nowher endure / Bruyn tho spack anon / alas reynart what
say ye / set ye so lytyl by honey / me ought to preyse and love it above all
mete / lief reynart help me that I might get a deel of this honey / and as
long as I live I shall be to you a tryew friend and abide by you as far as
ye help me that I may have a part of this honey /

how bruyn ete the honey capitulo..viij:
bRuyn eme I had supposed that ye had iaped therwyth / so help me god reynart
nay / I should not gladly iape with you / then spacke the read reynart is it
then ernest that ye love so well the honey / I shall do late you have so much
that ten of you should not ete it at one mele / might I get therewith your
friendship / not we ten reyner neue said the bear how should that be had I all
the honey that is between this and portyngale I should well ete it allone^ reynard
sayde^ what say ye Eme / hier by dwells an husbondman named lantfert which
has so much honey that ye should not ete it in ^vij. year which ye shall have
in your hold. if ye will be to me friendly and helpyng against mine enemies in
the kings court / then promised bruyn the bear to him* that if be might have
his belly full^ he would truly be to him to fore all other a faithful friend /
hereof laughed reynart the shrewe and said / if ye would have un hamber barelis
full I shall well get them and help you to have them / These words plesyd the
bear so well and made him so much to / lawhe / that he could not well stand Tho
thought reynart / this is good luck I shall led him thither that he shall lawhe
by mesure /

reynart said then / this matter may not be long ^^^ryed / I must pain my
self for you / ye shall well understand the very yonste and good will that I bear
to you ward I know none in all my lygnage that I nou would labor fore thus
sore / that thanked him the bear and thought he tarried long / Now eme late us
goo a good paas and follow ye me / I shall make you to have as much honey as ye
may bear / the fox mente of good strokes but the caytyf markyd not what the
fox mente and (...) went so long to gydre that they came unto (...) yerde tho
was sir bruyn me^y / now herke of (...) true that men say / so was lantfert a
strong (...) of great tymbre / and had / brought that other day to fore in to
his yerde a / great oak which he had begone to cleue And as men be woned he
had smeten two betels therein one after that other in such wise the oak was
wide open whereof reynart was glad / for he had found it right as he wisshed /
And said to the bear all lawhyng see non well sharply / to / in this tree is so
much honey that it is without mesure / asaye if ye came come therein and ete but
lytil for though the honey combs be sweet and good yet beware that ye ete not
to many. but take of them by mesure. that ye cacche no harm in your body^ for
sweet eme I should be blasmed if they did you any harm. what reynart cosyn
sorrow ye not for me. wene yt that I were a fole^ mesure is good in all mete^
reynart sayde^ ye say truth. wherefore should I sorowe^ goo to the end and
Crepe (...) bruyn the bear hasted sore toward the honey. and (...) in with his
two formest feet: and put his heed over his eeris in to the clyft of the tree.
And reynart sprang lightly and brak out the betle of the tree. Tho helped the
bear nether flateryng ne chydyng. he was fast shette in the tree thus has the
neueu with deceyte brought his eme in prison in the tree in such wise as he
could not get out with might ne with craft / head ne foot /

what prouffyteth bruyn the bear that he strong and hardy is / that may not
help him / he saw well that he begyled was he began to howl and to braye /
and crutched with the hinder feet and made such a noise and rumor that
lantfert came out hastily / and knew nothing what this might be / and brought
in his hand a sharp hoke / bruyn de bear lay in the clyfte of the tree in
great fere and dread / and held fast his heed and nyped both his fore feet /
he wrange he wrastled / and cried / and all was for naught / he wiste not how
he might get out / reynar the fore saw fro far how that lantfert the
carpenter came and tho spack reynart to the bear / is that honey good how is it
now / ete not to much it should do you harm / ye should not then well co^ne
goo to the court when lantfert comes if ye have well eten he shall give you
better to drink and then it shall not styke in your throat /

left bruyn the bear lie / And did that the priest badde

when bruyn the bear saw that they ran all fro him and ran to save the

made the priest a great showte and noise and ran af^^^ the bear with great
anger and said come and torn aga^^ thou false thief / The bear swame after the

nOw herke how the fox did / or he came fro lantfe^ts hows he had stolen a

that the bear had be deed / he said / I have now well spedde for he that should
most have hyndred me in the court is now deed / and none shall wit me thereof /
may I not then by right / be well glad / with thise words the fox looked to
the ^yuer ward and espied where bruyn the bear lay and rested him / Tho was
the fox so^ier and heuyer than he to fore was merry / and was as angry and
said In chydyng to lantfert / alas lanfert lewd fool god give him a shames

Reynat do this / I say to you bruyn and swear by my crown I s^^l so avenge
you on him / that ye shall ^onne me thank he sent for all the wise beestis /
and desired counseyl how that he might avenge this over great wrong / that the

sent fore and dayed ernestly again for tabyde such Judgment as should there be
given on him of all his trespaces And they thought that the catte tybert might
best do this message if he would / for he is right wise / The king thought
this counceyl good /

How the king sent another time tybert the catte for the fox / and how
tybert spedde with reynart the fox / cao xo^
then the king said sir tybert / ye shall now goo to reynart and say to him
this second time that he come to court unto the plee for to answer / for

counseyl. and tell if he come not / he shall have the third warnyng and be
dayed and if he then come not / we shall proceed by right ayenste him and all
his lygnage without mercy / Tybert spack / My lord the king / they that this
counseylde you were not my friends what shall I do there / he will not for me
neither come ne abide / I beseech you dear king send some other to him / I am
lytyl and feeble / bruyn the bear which was so great and strong / coude-not
bring him / how should I then take it on hand / nay said the king sir
tybert ye ben wise and well learned / Though ye be not great / there lies not on
/ many do more with craft and connyng / than with might and strength / then
said the catte / sith it must needs be don / I must then take it upon me /
god give grace that I may well achieue it / for my heart is heavy / and evil
willed thereto / Tybert made him / sone ready toward maleperduys / and he saw fro
far come fleyng one of saint martyns birds / tho cryde he loud and said al
hayl / gentyl bird / torn thy wings hethaward and flee on my right side /
the bird flewh forth upon a tree which stood on the lift side of the catte /
tho was ty^bert woo / ffor he thought hit was a shrewd token and a sign of
harm / for if the bird had flowen on his right side / he had been merry and
glad / but now he sorowed that his Journey should torn to unhappy / nevertheless
he (...) as many do / and gaf to him self better hope than ^is heart said /
he went and run to maleperduys ward (...) there he fond the fox allone

whad hurted the fox to speak fair / though he said well his heart thought it

we will to gydre goo to the court / good n^u^ late us so do / I have none of my

traitor he looked so shrewdly on me / and me thought he was so strong / that
I would not for a thousand mark have goon with him / but cosyn I will to morrow

shyneth also light as it were day / I never saw fayrer weder / nay dear cosyn
/ such might mete us by day time / that would make us good chiere / and by
nyghtte parauenture might do us harm / it is suspecyous to alke by night.
Therefore a bide this night here by me Tybert said / wat should we ete / if we
abode here / reynart said / here is but little to ete ye may well have an honey
comb good and sweet / what say ye / Tybert will ye any thereof / tybert answered
I set naught thereby have ye nothing ellis if ye gaf me agood fat mows / I
should be better plesyd / a fat mows said reynard / dear cosyn what say ye /
here by dwells a priest and has a barn by his hows there in ben so many myse

then shall ye win my love. ye al had ye slain my fader mother and all my kyn.

Reynart said ye moke and Iape therwyth^ the catte said so help me god I do

fox we tarry alto long / Thus went they forth without lettyng to the place
/ where as they would be to the prestes barn which was fast wallid about
with a mude wall and the night to fore the fox had broken in / and had stolen
fro the priest a good fat hen / and the priest all angry had set a gr^n
to fore the hool to avenge him / for he would fayn have ^ak^ the fox / this
knew well the fell thief the fore And said sir tybert rosyn crepe in to this
hool ^ and ye shall not long tarry but that ye shall catch myes by gre^^ (...)
herke how they pype. when ye be full / come again I will tarry here after you be

after us / and shall make us good chiere Tybert said / reynart cosyn is it
then your counseyl that I goo in to this hole. Thise prestes ben so wyly and
shrewyssh / I dread to take harm / O ^o tybert (...) the for I saw you never
so sore aferde / what eylech ^^w the catte was ashamed and sprange in to the
hoole. And anon ^e was caught in the gryn by the neck er ^e wyft^ thus
deceyuyd reynart his ghest and cosyn

aS tybert was waer of the grynne / he was a ferde and sprange forth / the
grynne wen^e to then began he to wrawen / for he was almost y stranglyd / he
called he cried and made a shrewd noise / reynart stood to fore the hool and
herd al / and was well a paid and said / tybert love ye well myes / be they
fat and good / knew the pre / este hereof or mertynet / they be so gentyl
that they would bring you sauce / Tybert ye sing and eten / is that the guyse
of the court / lord god if ysegrym ware there by you in such rest as ye now
be then should I be glad / for often he has don me scathe and harm / tybert
coud^ not goo away / but he mawede and galped so loud / that martynet sprang
up / and / cryde loud / god be thanked my gryn has taken the thief that has
stolen our hens / arise up we will reward him /

with these words aroose the priest in an evil time and waked all them that
were in the hows / and cryde with a lowede vois / the fox is / take there leep
and ran all that there was the priest him self ran al mother naked /
mertynet was the first that came to tybert the priest took to locken his wife an
offryng candel and bad her light it at fire / and he smote tybert with a
great staf / There receyuid tybert many a great stroke over all his body /
mertynet was so angry that he smote the catte an eye out / the naked prerst
lift up and should have given a great stroke to tybert / but tybert that saw
that he must deye sprange between the prestes legs with his claws and with
his teeth that he raught out his right colyon or balock stone / that leep becam
ill to the priest and to his great shame.

this thing fyl down upon the floer / when dame Iulocke knew that / she swear
by her faders soul / that she would it had cost her all thoffryng of a bole
year / that the priest had not had that harm hurt and shame / and that it had
not happed and faid / in the deueles name was the grynne there set / see
mertynet lyef sone / this is of thy faders harneys / This is a great shame and
to me a great hurt / for though he be heled hereof yet he is but a lost man to
me and also shall never conne do that sweet play and game / The fox stood
without to fore the hole and herd all these words / and lawhed so sore that
he uneath could stand / he spack thus al softly dame Iulock be al stylle /
and let your great sorrow synke Al has the priest lost one of his stones it

in which (...) but one belle (...) scorned and mocked the fox / the prestes

catte saw them al besy about the priest tho began he to byte and gnawe the
grenne in the myddel a sondre / and sprange out of the hool and went rollyng
and wentlyng toward the kings court or be came theder it was fair day and the
son began to rise / And (...) came to the court as a pour wight / he had
caught harm a^te prestes hows by the help and c^unseyl of the fore ^his b^dy
was al to beten / and blind on the one eye / when the king wyste this / that
tybert was thus arrayed / he was sore angry and menaced reynart / the thief sore
/ and anon gadred his counseyl to wit what they would auyse him / how he might
bring the fox to the law and how he should be fette

tho spack sir grymbart which was the foxes suster sone and said ye lords /
thowgh mine eme were twyes so bad and shrewessh / yet is there remedy enough /

When reynart and grymbert had goon a while to gy^re / the said reynart / dear
cosyn now am I in gr^te fere / for I goo in dread / and ieopardye of my life / I
have so much repentance for my sins that I will sh^ryue me dear cosyn to you
/ here is none other priest to get if I were shryuen of my sins / my soul
should be the clerer / grymbert ansuerde / Eem will ye shryue you / then must
ye promise first to leave your steelyng and rouynge reynart said that wiste he
well / now herke (...) cosyn what I shall say / Confiteor tibi pater of all the
misdeeds that I have don / And gladly will recey^^ penance for them / Grymbert
said what say ye / will ye shryue you / then say it in englissh that I
may vn^derstande* you reynart said / I have trespaced against all the beestis
that live in especyal against bruyn the bear mine Eem whom I made his crown al
blody / And ta ughte tybert the catteto catch myes for I made her leepe in a
grenne where she was al to beten / also I have trespaced greatly against
chanteclere with his children / for I have made him quyte of a great dele of hem

the king is not goon al quyte / I have sklandeed him and the queen many times
/ that they shall never be clear thereof yet have I begyled yse^grym the wulf
ofter than I can tell well I called him eme / but that was to deceive him / he
is nothing of my kyn / I made him a monk / Eelmare / where I my self also
becam one / And that was to his hurt and no prouffyte / I made bind his feet
to the belle rope / the ryngyng of the belle thought him so good that he would
learn to ring whereof he had shame / ffor he range so sore that all the folk
in the street were aferd thereof and meruaylled what might be on the belle / And
ran thither to fore he had comen to axe the religyon / wherefore he was beten
almost to the death / after this I taught him to catch fyssh where he receyuid
many a stroke / also I led him to the richest prestes hows that was in
vermedos / This priest had aspynde wherein henge many a good flitche of bacon /
wherein many a time I was wont to fyl my belly / in this spynde I had made an
hole / in which I made ysegrym to crepe / There fond he tubbes with beef and
many goed flytches of bacon w^^rof he ete so much without mesure / that he
might not come out at the hole where he went in / his belly was so great and
full of the mete / and when he entered his belly was small / I went in to the
village and made there a great showte / and noise / yett h^rke what I did
then I ran to the priest where he satte at the table and ete / And had to
fore him as fat capone as a man might find / that capone caught I and ran
my weye therewith all that I might / the priest cried out and said / take and
slay the fox / I trow that never man saw more wonder / the fox comes in my
hows and takes my capoone fro my table / where saw ever man an hardyer thief
/ and as me thought he tok^ his table knyf and casted it at me / but he touched
me not I ran away / he shoof the table from him / and folewed me cryeng kylle
and slay him / I to goo and they after and many moo came after which all
thought to hurt me /

i Ran so long that I came where as isegrym was / and there I let fall the
capone / for it was to heavy for me / and against my will I left it there / and
then I sprange through an hole where as I wold^ be / and as the priest took up
the capone. he espied isegrym and cryde smite down here friends here is the
thief the wulf / see well to that he escape us not^ they ran all to gydre
with stokkes and staves and made a great noise tha^ all the neighbors camen
out. and gauen^ him many a shrewde stroke / and threw at him great stones* in
such wise that he fyl down as he had been deed / They slepid him and drew him
over stones and oner blocks without the villag^ and threw him in to a dyche
and there he lay all the night / I wo^e never h^w he came th^ns sith I have
gotten of him / (...) he as I made him to fylle his belly / that he swear that

Tho led I him to a place where I tol^e him there we^e vij^ hens and a cock
which satte on a perch and were much fat / And there stood a faldore by /
and we clymmed there up / I said to him if he would bileue me / and that he
would crepe in to the door / he should find many fat he^nes / Isegrym went
al lawhyng to / the door ward and crope a lityl in / and tasted here and there
/ and at last ^e said to me reynarde ye lord and iape with me / for what I
seche I find not then said I^eme if ye will find crepe fo^ther in / he that
will win / he must labor and adventure / They that were wont to sytte there
/ I have them a way thus I made him to seche ferther in / and shooue him forth
so far / that he fylle down upon the floer for the perch was narow / and he
fill so great a fall / that they sprange up all that slepte / and they that
lay next the fire cry den that the val^ore was open and / somthyng was fall
and they wiste not wat it might be /

they roose up and light a candel / and when they saw him they smeton bete^n
and wounded him to the death / I have brought him thus in many a iepardye / moo
than I began now rekene / I should find many moo / if I me well bythoughte /
which I shall tell you here after / Also I have bydryuen with dame erswynde
his wife / I would I had not don it / I am sorry for it / hit is to her great
shame / and that me repents / grymbert said / Eme I understand you not / he
said I have trespaced with his wife / ye shryue you / as though ye held
somewhat behind / I wot not what ye mean ne where ye have learned this langage
/ Ach dear eme it were great shame if I should say it oppenly as it happed / I
have leyen by mine aunte / I am your eme I should anger you if I spak vylanye of
wymmen / neueu now have I told you all that I can think on / set me
penance / and assoylle me / ffor I have great repentance / Grymbert was
subtyl and wise / he brake a rod of a tree and said / eme now shall ye smite
your self thryes with this rod on your body / And then leye it down upon
the ground / and spring three times there over without bowyng of you^ legs
and without stomblyng / and then shall ye take it up and kiss it friendly in
token of meken^^ and obedience of your penance that I gaf you / herwith be ye
quyte of all sins that ye have don to this day for I forgive it you al / the
fox was glad / tho said grymbert to hi^ eme / Eme see now forthon / that ye
do good werkis / read your psalms / goo to church fast and keep your
halydayes / and give your all mess / and leave your synful and ill life / your
theft and your treson and so may ye come to mercy / the fox promised that he
would so do / and then went they both to gydre to the court ward /

a Little beside the way as they went stood a cl^oyster of back nonnes. where
many ghees ^ennes and capones went without the walls / and as they went
talking the fox brought grymberte out of the right way thither and without
the walls by the (...) went the polayle / The fox espied them and saw a
fat young capone which went allone fro his felaws and (...) caught him that
the feathers flewh about his ^^ris but the capone escaped / grymbert said what
eme cursyd man what will ye do / will ye for one of thise pole^es fall aga^yn
in all your sins of which ye have shryu^n you (...) ought sore repent you
/ reynart answered / truly cosyn I had al forgoten / pray god that he forgive
it me for I will never do so more / then turned they again over alityl bridge
/ yet the fox always looked after the polaylle ^ he could not refrain him self
/ that which cleuid by the bone ^ might not out of the flesh / though he
should be hanged* he could not let the lokyng after the polayll as fer as he
might see them / Grymbert saw his manner and said / ffowle false deceyuour /
how goo your eyes so after the poleyl / The fox said / cosyn ye / mys do to
say to me any such words / ye bring me out of my devotion and prayers /
late me say apater noster ffor all the sowles of polaylle and ghes that I
have betrayed / and often with falsheed stolen from these holly nonnes /
Grymbert was not well a paid but the fox had ever his eyes toward the polayl /
til at last they came in the way again / And then turned they to the court
ward / how sore quaked tho reynard when they aproched the court / ffor he
wiste well that he had for to answer to many a foul feet and theft that he had
done ^

aT the first when it was known / in the court that reynart the fore and
grymbaert his cosyn were comen to the court / There was none so pour nor so
feeble of kynne and friends / but that he made him ready for to complain on
reynart the fox / reynart looked as he had not ben aferd / and held him better
than he was for he went forth proudly with his neueu through the highest street
of the court / right as he had been the kings sone and as he had not trespaced
to any man the value of an here / and went in the mydel of the place stondyng
to fore noble the king and said / God give you great honor and worship /
There was never king / that ever had a trewe^ servant / than I have been to your

How the fox was arestid and Iuged to death capitulo ^xiiijo^
hEre upon was a parliament / and they desired that reynart should ben deed and
what sum ever they sayden against the fox / he answerde to each to them /
never herd man of such beestis / such playntis of wise counseyl / and subtyl
Inuencions and on that other side / the fox made his excuse so well and
formably thereon that they that herd it wondered thereof / they that herd and
saw it / may tell hit forth for truth / I shall short the matter and tell
you forth of the fox / The king and the counseyl herd the witnessis of the
complayntes of reynarts misdeeds / hit went with hem as it often does the
feblest has the worst / They gafe sentence and Iu^ged that the fox should be
deed and hanged by the ne^^e tho list not he to pleye all his flateryng
words and deceytes could not help him / The Judgment was given and that must
be don / grymbert his neueu / and ma^ny of his lignage might not find in their
hertes (...) see him dye but token leave soroufully / and romed the court /

the king bithoughte him and marked how many a yonglyng departed from thens al
weeping which were nyghe of his kynne / and said to him self ^ hier behooves
other counseyl herto / Though reynart be a shrewe / there be many good of his
lignage / thybert the catte said / sir bruyn and sir Isegrym / how be ye thus
slow. it is almost even / hier ben many busshes and h^dges. if ^e escaped from
us. and were delyuerd out of this paryl he is so subtyl and so wyly and can so
many deceytes that he should never be taken again / shall we hang him how stand
ye al thus er the galewis can be made ready it shall be night / Isegrym bethought
him tho and seyde / hier by is a gybet or galewis / And with that word he
sighed / and the catte espied that and said / Isegrym ye be aferd / is it
against your will / think ye not that he him self went and labored that
both your brethern were hanged / were ye good and wise ye should thank him /
and ye should not therewith so long tarry /

How the fox was led to the galewis / capo ^xvo^
ysegrym balked and said / ye make much a do sir tybert had we an halter
which were mete for his neck and strong enough / we should sone make an end
/ reynert the fox which long had not spoken / said to Isegrym short my
pain / Tyberte has a strong cord which caught him in the prestes house /
when he bote of the prestes genytoirs / he can clyme well and is swyft late him
bear up / the line / Isegrym and bruyn this becomes you well that ye thus do
to your neuew / I am sorry that I live thus long / haste you ye be set thereto
/ it is evil do that ye tarry thus long / goo to fore bruyn ^nde led me
Isegrym follow fast. andsee well to and beware that reynart go not away^ tho
said bruyn it is the best counseil that I ever yet herd / that reynart there
seith Isegrym commanded anon and badde his kyn and friends. that they should
see to reynart that he escaped not. ffor he is so wyly and falls. They helden
him by the feet. by the berde. and so kept him that he escaped not from hem /
The fox herd all these words / which touchid him / nygh / yet spak he and
said / Och dear eme / me thynkyth ye pain your self sore / for to do do me
hurt and scathe / if I durst I would pray you of mercy / thaugh my hurt and
sorrow is playsant to you / I wot well if mine aunte your wife bethought her well
of old ferners^ she would not suffer that / I should have any harm / but now I
am he / that now ye will do on me what it shall plese you / ye bruyn and /
thibert / god give you shames death but ye do to me your werst / I wot whereto
I shall / I may deye but ones I would that I were deed al ready I saw my fader
deye he had sone done / Isegrym said late us goo / ffor ye curse us by cause
we length the time / evil mote he fare if we abide any longer / he went forth
with great envy on that one side and bruyn stood on the other side / and so
led the^ him forth to the galowes ward / Tybert ran with a good will to fore
/ and bare the cord and his throat was yet sore of the grynne / and his croppe
did him woo of the stryke that he was take in that happed by the / counseil of
the fox / and that thought he now to quyte /

tybert ysegrym and bruyn went hastily with reinert to the place / there as
the felons ben wont to be put to death / Nobel the king and the queen / and
all that were in the court followed after for to see the end of reynart / the
fox was in great deed if him myshapped / and bethought him oft^ / how be
might save him fro the death / And tho three that so sore desired^^ his death how
he might deceive them / and bring them to shame / and how he might bring the
king with lesyngis ffor to hold with him against hem / This was all that he
studied / how he might put away his sorrow with wylys / And thought / thus
though the king and many one be upon me angry / it is no wonder for- I have
well deseruid it / nevertheless I hope for to be yet her best friend / And yet
shall I never do them good / how strong that the king be / and how wise that
his tounseil be / if I may brouke my words / I know so many an inuencion / I
shall come to mine above / as fer as they would comen to the galewes /

tho said ysegrym / sir bruyn think now on your read crown which by
reynarte mean ye caughte we have now the time that we may well reward him. /
Tybert clyme up hastyly and bind the cord fast to the lynde / and make a
riding knotte or a strope / ye be the lyghtyst / ye shall this day see your
will of hym^ Bruyn see well to that he escape not. and hold fast. I will help
that the ladder be set up / that* he may goo vpwart thereon. bruyn said. do.
I shall help him well The fox said now may my heart be well heavy for great
drede^ ffor I see the death to fore mine eyes. and I may not escape^ my lord the
king and dear queen and forth all ye that here stand. er I depart fro this
world I pray you of a bone. that I may to fore you all make my confession
openly and tell my defaultes also clerly that my soul be not a / combred /
and also that noman here after / bear no blame for my theft ne for my treson
my death shall be to me the esyer / and pray ye all to god that he have mercy
on my soul.

How the fox made openly his confession to fore the king and to fore al them
that would here it capo xvjo
all they that stoden there had pity when reynart said tho wordis and said it
was / but a lytyl request if the king would grant it him / and they prayde
the king to grant it him / The king gaf him leave / reynart was well glad and
hoped that it might fall better ^ And said thus / now help spiritus domini /
for I (...) noman but I have trespaced unto / Nevertheless (...) I unto the time
that I was wened fro the tete / (...) best child that / could o^wher be
founden / I went (...) and pleyde with the lambs by cause I herd hem gla^l^
(...) I was so long with hem that at the last I bote one / there learned I
first to lapen of the blood hit sauourd well / me thought it right good / And
after I began to taste of the flessh / throof I was lycourous so that after
that I went to the gheet in to the wode. there ^erde I the kyddes blete and I
slew of them tweyne / I began to wexe hardy after I slew hens / polayl and
(...) where ever I fond hem / Thus worden my teeth al bl^dy after this I wexe
so fell and so wroth / That what (...) ever I found that I might over / I
slow all^ / There aftercam I by Isegrym now in the winter ^ where he hid him
under a tree. And re^ened to me that / he was mine eme whenne I herd him then
rekene alliance we becomen^ felaws which I may well repent / we promised each
to other to be true and to use good felawship / and began to wandre to gyder /
he stal the great things and I the small and all was common between us / yet
he made it so that he had the best dele I gate not half my part / when that
ysegrym gate a calf / a ra^me or a weder then gri^med he / and was angry on
me and droof me fro him / and held my part and his to / so good is he.

yEt this was of the least / but when it so lucked that we took an ox or a
cow / then came thereto his wife with.vij. children so / that unto me might
uneath come one of the smallest rybbes / and yet had they eten all the flessh
thereof / there with all must I be content not for that I had so great need.
ffor I have so grette scatte and good of silver and of gold that seven waynes
should not conne carye it away / when the king herd him speak of this great
good and richesse he brenned in the desire and couetyse thereof and said
reynart where is the richesse becomen / tell me that^ the fox said my lord I
shall tell you / the richesse was stolen and had it not bestolen / it should
have cost you / your life and should have been murdered which god forbede and
should have been the gretest hurt of the world / when the queen herd that she
was sore aferde and cryde loud / alas and weleaway reynart what say ye / I
conjure you by the long way that your soul shall goo / that ye tell us
openly the truth hereof as much as ye know of this great murdre that should
have be done on my lord / that we all may here it now herkene how the fox
shall flatre the king and queen / and shall win both their good wills and
love / And shall hyndre them that labor for his death / he shall unbind his
pack and lie and by flaterye and fair words shall bring forth so his matters /
that it shall be supposed for truth /

iN a sorouful contenance spack the fox to the queen I am in such caas now
that I must needs deye / and had ye me not so sore coniured / I will not
Ieoparde my soul / and if I so did I should goo therefore in to the pain of
hell / I will say nothing but that I will make it good / for pytously he should
have been murthred of his owen folk. nevertheless they that were most pryn^^pal
in this feat. were of my next kynne^ whom gladly I would not bewraye. if the
sorrow were not of the hell. The king was heavy of heart and said / reynart
saiste thou to me the truth. ye said the fox. see ye not how it stands
with me. wene ye that I will dampne my soul. what should it auaylle me if I now
said other wise than truth. my death is so nyghe^ there may nether prayer ne
good help me Tho trembled the fox by dyssymlyyng as he had been a ferde The
queen had pity on him. And prayde the king to have mercy on him in eschewyng of
more harm / and that he should do the people hold their peace and give the
fox Audience. and here what he should say / Tho commanded the king openly
that each of them should be stylle / and suffer the fox to say vn^eri^ sped
what that he would. then said / the fox / be ye now all stylle. sith it is
the kings will. and I shall tell you openly this treson. And therein I will
spare noman that I know gylty.

How the fox brought them in danger / that would have brought him to death.
and how he gate the grace of the king. capitulo.xvij^:
nOw herkene how the fox began. in the beginning he appeled grymbert his dear
cosyn. which ever had helped him in his need / he did so because his words
should be the better byleued. and that he forthon might the better lie on his
enemies / thus began he first and said. my lord my fader had founden king
ermeryks tresour doluen in a pytte. and when he had this great good. he was so
proud and orguillous that he had all other beestis in despyte which to fore
had been his felaws he made tybert the catte to goo in to that wild land of
ardenne to bruyn the bear for to do to him homage. and bad him say if he would
be king that he should come in to flaundres / bruyn the bear was glad hierof /
ffor he had long desired it / And went forth in to flaundres where my fader
received him right friendly / anon he sent for the wise grymbert mine neuewe /
And for ysegrym the wulfe / and for tybert the catte / Tho these five camen
between gaunt and the thorpe called yfte / ther^ they helden their counseyl an
hole derke night long / what with the deuels help and ^raft and for my faders
richesse they concluded / and swore there the kyngys death / now herkene and
here this wonder the four sworen upon ysegryms crown / that they should make
bruyn a king and a lord / And bring him in the stole at akon and set the
crown on his heed / and if there were any of the kings friends or lignage /
that would be contrary or against this / him should my fader with his good and
tresour for / drive and take from him his might and power^

iT happed so that on a morowtyde ^^ly tha^ gr^mbert my neuew was of wine
almost drunk (...) he told it to dame sloepcade his wif in counseyl / and
(...) her keep it secret / but she anon forgate it / and said (...) forth in
confession to my wife / upon and heth where they both wenten a pylgremage / but
she must first sw^re by her truth and by the holy three kings of coleyne
that for love ne for hate she should never tell it forth but keep (...)
secret but she held it not / and kept it no longer (...) but till she came to
me / and she then told to me all that she herd / but I must keep it in
secret / and she told me so many tokenys / that I felt well it was truth
and for dread and fer^ mine here stood right up / and my heart becam as heavy as
leed / and as cold as Ise / I thought by this a lyknesse which hier a fore
time byfylle to the fross his which were free / and complained that they had
none lord / ne were not bydwongen / for a comynte without a gouuernour was not
god / and they cryden to god with a loud vo^s that he would ordeyne one that
might rewle them / this was all that they desired / god herd their request /
for it was reasonable and sent to them a storke / which ete and swolowed them
in as many as he could find / he was always to hem vnmercyful / tho complained
they their hurt / but then it was to late / they that were to fore free and
were a ferde of no body / ben now bond and must obey to strength their
king / hyer fore ye rich and pour I sorowed that it might happen us in like
wise /

tHus my lord the king I have had sorrow for you whereof ye can me but lytyl
thank / I know bruyn the bear for such a shrewe and rauener / wherefore I
thought if he were king we should be all destroyed and lost / I know our
souerain lord the king of so hye birth / so mighty so benyngne and mercyful /
that I thought truly it had been an evil change for to have a foul stynkynge
thief and to refuse a noble mighty stately lion / ffor the bear has more mad
folly in his unthrifty heed and al his auncestris / than any other has / thus
had I in mine ^erte many a sorrow / and thought always how I might break and
fordoo my faders falls counseyl which of a chorle and a traitor and worse than
a thief would make a lord and a king / always I prayed god that he would keep
our king in worship and good health and grant him long life / but I thought
well if my fader held his tresour / he should with his false felaws well find the
wa ye that the king should be deposed and sett^ a side / I was sore bethought
how I might best wit where my faders good lay / I a waited at al times as
nygh as I could / in wodes in bushes in feeldis / where my fader leyde his eyes
/ were it by night or by day / cold or went I was always by him to espy and
know where his tresour was leyde /

oN a time I lay down al plat on the ground / and saw my fader come rennyng
out of an hole / Now herke what I saw him do / when he came out of the hole /
he looked fast a boute if any body had seen him / And when he could nowher none
see / he stopped the hole with sand and made hit even and plain like to the
other ground by / he knew not that I saw it / and where his footspore stood
/ there stryked he with his tail and ma^^ it smothe with his mouth that noman
should espy (...) that learned I there of my falls fadre and many subtyl^^tees
that I to fore knew nothing of / then departed (...) thens and ran to the
village ward for to do his th^ngis ^ and I forgate not but sprange and lepe
to the hol^ ward and how well that he had supposed that he had made al fas^^ I
was not so much a fool but that I fond the h^le wel^ and cratched and scraped
with my feet the sand out of the hole / and crepte therein / there fond I the
most (...) of silver and of gold that ever I saw / hier is none so old that
ever so much saw on one heep in all his life / Tho took I ermelyne my wife to
help / and we ne rested night ne day to bear and carye a way with great
labor and pain this rich tresour in to another place that lay for v^ better
under an haw^ in a deep hole / in the^ mean while that mine husewyf and I thus
labouryd my fader was with them that would betraye the king / now may ye here
what they deed / bruyn the bear and ysegrym the wulf sent all the land a
boute / if any man would tak^ wages / that they should come to bruyn / and he
would pay them their souldye or wagis to fore. my fader ran over all the
land and bare the lettres. he wist lytil that he was robbed of his tresour. ye
though he might have wonnen all the world. he had not conne find a penny thereof.

when my fader had been oueral in the land between the ^lue and the sum.
And had gotten many a souldyour that should the next somer have comen to help
bruyn. tho came he again to the bear and his felowis. and told them in how
great a venture he had be to fore the borughes in the land of saxone / and how
the hunters daily ryden and hunted with hounds after him in such wise that he
vnnethis escaped with his life / when he had told this to th^se four false
traitors / then shewde he them lettres that plesyd much to bruyn there in
were wreton xij^C^ of ysegryms lignage by name without the beres / the foxes /
the cattes and the dassen / all thise had sworn that with the first messager
that should come for them they should be ready and come for to help the bear / if
they had their wages a month to fore / This aspyed I / I thank god / after
thise words my fader went to the hole where his tresour had leyn and would
look upon it / tho began he a great sorrow / that he sought he fond nothing /
he fond his hole broken and his tresour born away / there deed he that I may
well sorrow and bewaylle / for great anger and sorrow he went and hynge him
self / thus abode the treson of bruyn by my subtylte after / Now see mine
Infortune / thise traitors ysegrym and bruyn / ben now most preuy of counseyl
about the king / and sytte by him on the hye bouche / And I pour reynart
have no thank ne reward / I have buried mine owen fader by cause the king
should have his life / my lord said the fox / where ben they that so would
do / that is to destroy them self for to keep you /

the king and the queen hoped to win the tr^^sour and with out counceyl
took to them ^^ynart and prayde him that he would do so well as to tell them
were this tresour was / reynart said how should I tell the king or them that
would hang me / for lou^ of the traitors and murderars which by her flatery^
would feign bring me to death / should I tell to them where my good is / then
were I out of my wit / The queen tho spak nay reynart the king shall let you
have your life / and shall al to gydre forgive you / and ye shall (...) frohens
forth wise and true to my lord. the fore answered to the queen. dear lady if
the king will believe me and that he will pardone and forgive me all my old
trespaces there was never king so rich as I shall make him for the tresour that
I shall do him have / is right costely and may not be nombred / The king said
ach dame. will ye believe the fox. sauf your reverence he is borne to rob /
stele and to lie / this cleuid to his bones and can not be had out of the
flessh / the queen said / nay my lord ye may now well believe him / though he
were here to fore fell he is now changed otherwise than he was ye have well
herd that he has appechid his fader and the dasse his neuew / which he might
well have leyde on other bestes / if he would have been false / fell / and a liar
/ The king said dame will ye then have it so / and think ye it best to
be don / though I supposed it should hurt me / I will take all thise
trespaces of reynart upon me / and bileue his words / But I swear by my crown
/ if he ever here after mys do and trespace / that shall he dear abye and all
his lignage unto the.ix^ degree ^ The fox looked on the king stoundmele and was
glad in his heart / and said my lord / I were not wise / if I should say
thing that were not true / The king took up a straw fro the ground / And
pardoned and forgaf the fox all the misdeeds and trespaces of his fader and
of him also / if the fox was tho merry and glad it was no wonder / ffor he was
quyte of his death and was all free and frank of all his enemies /

tHe fox said my lord the king and noble lady the queen god reward you /
this great worship that ye do to me / I shall think and also thank you for hit
^ in such wise that ye shall be the richest king of the world / ffor there is
none living vnther the son / that I vouchesauf better my tresour on / than on
you both / Then took the fox up a straw and profred it to the king and
said my most dear lord plese it you to receive hiere the rich tresour which
king ermeryk had / for I give it unto you with a fre will / and knowleche
it openly / The king receyuid the straw and threw it meryly fro him with a
Joyous visage / And thanked much the fox / The fox laughed in him self / The
king then herkened after the counseyl of the fox / And all that there were
/ were at his will / My lord sade he / herkene and mark well my words / in
the west side of flaundres there stands a wood and is named hulsterlo / And a
water that is called krekenpyt lies thereby / This is so great a wilderness /
that often in an hole year man ner wife comes therein / sauf they that will / and
they that will not eschew it / There lies this tresour hid / understand
well that the place is called krekenpit / for I advise you for the least hurt /
that ye and my lady goo both thither / ffor I know none so true that I durst
on your behalne cruste wherefore goo your self / And when ye come to krekenpyt
ye shall find there two birchen trees standing alther next the pytte / my lord
to tho byrchen trees shall ye goo / there lies the tresour vnther doluen /
There must ye scrape and dygge a way a lytyl the moss on the one side / There
shall ye find many a Jewel of gold and silver. and there shall ye find the
crown which king Ermeryk ware in his days that should bruyn the bear have
worn if his will had gone forth ye shall see many a cosily Jewel with rich stones
set in gold werk which cost many a thousand mark / My lord the king when
ye now have all this good / how often shall ye say in your heart and think / O
how true art thou reynart the fox. that with thy subtyl wit daluyst and
hyddest here-this great tresour / god give the good hap and welfare where
ever thou be /

tHe king said / sir reynart ye must come and help us to dygge up this
tresour / I know / not the way / I should never conne find it / I have herd
oft^ named / paryes / london akon and coleyn / As me thinks this tresour
lyeth-right as ye mocked and Iaped / for ye name kryekenpyt / that is afayned

shall bring you out of wenyng and show it you by good wytnes / he called loud
kywart the hare / come here to fore the king The bestes saw all thither ward
and wondered what the king would / the fox said to the hare / kywart ar ye a

king here the truth / And that I charge you by the faith and / truth that
ye owe him and to my lady the queen of such thing. as I shall demand of you /
Kywaert said I shall say the truth though I should lose my neck therefore / I

suffered there much sorrow for hunger and for cold / ye more than I can tell

felawship with ryn the hounde / which made me escape many a danger / as he

the king other wise than I ought to do with right / reynart said to him go

to know of you / the hare returned and went again to the place he came fro /
The fox said my lord the king is it true that I said / ye reynart said the
king / ffor give it me / I did evil that I beleuid you not / Now reynart
friend fynd^ the way that ye goo with us to the place and pytte^ where the

I shall then take kywaert or sum other to goo with me to kry^kenpytte / and

How the wulf and the bear were a^estyd by the labor of reynart the fox
capitulo.xviiio.
ySegrym came proudly over the field to fore the king / and he thanked the
queen ^ and spack with afelle moed ylle words on the fox / in such wise that
the king herd it / and was wroth and made the wulf and the bear anon to be
arestyd / ye saw never wood dogs do / more harm / than was don to them they
were both fast bounden so sore that all that night / they might not stere
hand ne foot / They might scarsely rore ne meue any Ioynte / Now here how the
fox forth did / he hated hem / he labored so to the queen that he gate leave
for to have as much of the beres skyn upon his ridge as a foot long and a
foot broad for to make him thereof a scryppe / then was the fox ready if he
had four strong shoon / now here how he did for to get these shoon / he
said to the queen / madame I am your pilgrim / here is mine eme sir Isegrym
that has.iiij. strong shoon which were good for me / if he would late me have
two of them I would on the way besyly think on your soul / ffor it is right
that a / pilgrim should always think and pray for them / that do him good /
Thus may ye do your soul good if ye will / And also if ye might get of mine
aunte dame eerswyn also two of her shoon to give me / she may well do it / ffor
she gooth but lytil out / but abides always at home / then said the
quene-reynard you behooves well such shoes / ye may not be without them / they
shall be good for you to keep your feet hool for to pass with them many a
sharp montayn and stony roches / ye can find no better shoes for you / than
such as Isegrym and his wife have and were / they be good and strong / though
it should touch their life each of them shall give you two sh^es for to
accomplissh with your hye pilgremage /

how reynard did on the shoys for to goo to rome with / capitulo ^xixo.
tHus has this false pilgrim gotten fro Iseg^y^ ij shoes fro his fe^t / which
were haled of the claws to the senewis ye saw never foul that men roasted
lay so stylle / as Isegrym did / when his shoes were haled of / he styred not
/ and yet his feet bledde / then when Isegrym was vnshoed / Tho must dame
eerswyn his wife lie down in the grass with an heavy chere / And she lost there
her hinder shoes / Tho was the fox glad and said to his aunte in scorn / My
dear aunte how much sorrow have ye suffered for my sake / which me sore
repents / sauf this / hereof I am glad ffor ye be the lyeuest of all my kyn /
Therefore I will gladly were your shoe^ ye slal be partener of my pylgremage /

not escaped then^ without hur^^ and shame^

tHe next day when the son aroos reynard then did greece his shoes which
he had of ysegrym and erswyn his wife / and did hem on and bond hem to his
feet / and went to the king and to the queen and said to hem with a glad
chere / Noble lord and lady god give you good morrow and I desire of your grace
that I may have male and staff blessed a^ belongs to a pilgrym Then the
king anon / sent for bellyn the ram / and when he came he said / sir bellyn
ye shall do mass to fore reynart / for he shall goo on pylgremage / and give to
him male and staf / the ram answered again and said / my lord I dare not do that
/ ffor he has said that he is in the popes curse / The king said / what
thereof / master gelys has said to us / if a man had do as many sins as all the world / and he would tho sins forsake / shryue hem and resseyue penance /
and do by the prestes counseyl / god will forgive them and be mercyful unto him
now will reynard goo over the sea in to the holy land and make him clear of al
his sins / Then ansuerd bellyn to the king I will not do litil ne much
herin / but if ye save me harmles in the spirituel court before the bishop
pren / delor and to fore his archedeken loosuynde / and to for sir rap^amus his
offycyal / the king began to wexe wroth and said / I shall not bydde you so
much in half a year / I had lever hang you than I should so much pray you
for it / when the rame saw that the king was angry / h^ was so sore aferd
that he quoke for fere / and went to the awter and sange in his books and
radde such as him thought good over reynart / which lytyl set there by /
sauf that he would have the worship thereof

when bellyn the ram had all said his seruyse devoutly / then he hynge on
the foxes neck / a male couerd with the skin / of bruyn the bear / and a
lytil palster thereby. tho was reynart ready toward his Journey. tho looked he
toward the king as he had been sorrowful to depart and feigned as he had wept.
right as he had y^^merde in his herte^ but if he had any sorrow ^ it was by
cause all the other that were there were not in the same plyght as the wulf and
bear were brought in by him. neuerthel^^ he stood and prayed them all to pray
for him. like as he would pray for them the fox thought that he tarried (...)
and would fayn have departed for he knew him self gylt^ the king said reynart
I am sorry ye be so h^sty and w^l no longer tarry / nay my lord / it is time /
for m^ ough^ not spare to do well / I pray you to give me l^ue to (...) I must
do my pylgremage / the king said / god be (...) now / and commanded all them
of the court to go and (...) ne reynart on his way sauf the wulf and the bear
(...) fast lay bounden / there was none that durst be sor^ therefore / and if
ye had seen reynart how personably ^e went with his male and palster on his
sholder and the shoes on his feet / ye should have laughed ^ he went and shewde
him outeward wisely / But he laughed in his heart that all they brought him
forth ^ which had a lytyl to fore been / with. him so wroot^ ^ And also the
king which so much hated him / he had made him such^ a fool that be brought
him to his own en^e^te he was a pilgrim of deux a^s.

mY lord the king said the fox I pray you to return again I will not that ye
goo any ferther with me. ye might have harm thereby. ye have there two
morderars arestyd / if they escaped you. ye might be hurt by them y pray god
keep you fro mysauenture^ with these words he stood up. on his afterfeet. And
prayde all the beestys great and small that would be parteners of his pardon
that they should pray for him / They said that they all would remenbre him /
Then departed he fro the king so heuyly that many of them ermed / Then
said he to kyward the hare / and to bellyn th ram meryly / dear friends shall
we now depart / Ye will and god will accompanye me ferther / ye two made me
never angry / ye be good for to walk with / courtoys / friendly and not
complained on of any beeste ye be of good conditions / and goostly of your
living / ye live both as I did / when I was a recluse / if ye have leeuis and
gras ye be plesyd / ye retche not of bread / of flesh / ne such manner mete /
with such flateryng words has reynard thise two flatred / That they went
with him till they camen to fore his hows / maleperduys /

How kywart the hare was slain by the fox / capo.xxo
When the fox was come to fore the yate of his hows he said to bellyn the
ram / cosyn ye shall abide here without / I and kywart will goo in / ffor I
will pray kywart to help me to take my leave of ermelyn my wife / and to
conforte her and my children / bellyn said I pray him to comfort them well /
with such flateryng words brought he the hare in to his hole in an evil hour
/ There fond they dame ermel^n lyeng on the ground with her yonglyngis /
which had sorowed much ffor dread of reynarts death / but when she saw him
come she was glad / but when she saw his male and palster / and espied his
shoes ^ she meruaill^d and said dear reyner / how have ye spedd / he said I was
arestid in the court / But the king let me go^ I mu^ste goo a pilgremage /
Bruyn the bear and ysegr^m the wulf they be plegge for me / I thank the k^nge
(...) given to us kywart hier / ffor to do with him (...) we will / The king
said him self that ^^wart was the first that on us complained / And by the
faith that I owe you I am right wroth on kywart ^ when kywart herd thise
words he was sore aferde ^ He would have fled^de / but he might not / ffor the
fo^e stood between (...) and the yate / And he caught him by the neck ^ Tho
cried the hare help bellyn help / Where be ye This pilgryme sleeth me ^ but
that cry was sone done / for the fox had anon byten his throat a two / Tho
said he lat^ us go ete this good fat hare / the young whelps came also / Thus
held they a great feste / ffor kywart had a good fat body / ermelyn ete the
flessh and drank the blood / she thanked often the king that he had made them
so merry / The fox said ete as much as ye may / he will pay for it / if we
will ^ feche it.

sHe said reynart I trow ye mock / tell me the truth how ye be departed
thens / dame I have so flaterid the king and the queen / that I suppose the
friendship between us shall be right thynne when he shall know of this / he shall
be angry / and hastily seek me for to ha^ge me by mine neck / Therefore late us
depart and stele secretly a way in sum other foreste / Where we may live
without fere and dread / and there that we may live vij year and more and
find us not / there is plente of good mete of partrychs / wododekkis and much
other wild foul / dame and if ye will come with me thither / there ben sweet
wells and fair and clear rennyng brokes / lord god how sweet eyer is there /
There may we be in pees and ease and live in great welthe / ffor the king has
let me gone by cause I told him that there was great tresour in krekenpyt / but
there shall he find nothing though he sought ever / This shall sore anger him
when he knows that he is thus deceyuid what trow ye how many a great lesynge
must I lie / er I could escape from him / It was hard that I escaped out of
prison / I was never in gretter paryl ne nerrer my death / but how it ever goo /
I shall by my will never more come in the kings danger / I have now gotten my
thombe out of his mouth / that thank I my subtylyte.

dAme ermelyne said reynart I counseyle that we goo not in to another foreste
/ where we should be strange and elenge we have here all that we desire / And ye
be here lord of our neighbors / wherefore shall we leave this place / And
adventure us in a worse / we may abide her sure enough / if the king would do
us any harm or besiege us / here ben so many by or side holes / in such wise
as we shall escape fro him / in abydyng here / we may not do amys / we know
all bypathes over all / and er he take us with might / he must have much
hel^pe thereto but that ye have sworen that ye shall goo ouersee and abide there
/ that is the thing that touches m^ most / nay dame care not therefore / how
more for sworn how more forlorn / I went ones with a good man ^ that said to
me / that a bydwongen oth^ or oath sworn by force. was none oath. Though I went
on this pilgremage it should not auaylle me a cattes tail. I will abide here an^
follow your cou^seyl / if the king hunte after me. I shall keep me as well as I
may. if he be me to might (...) I hope with subtylte to begyle him. I shall
(...) sack. if he will seche harm he shall find harm.

nOw was bellyn the ra^me angry that kywart (...) felawe was so long in the
hole. and called loud. come out kywarte in the deuels name. ^ow long shall
re^ynart keep you there. haste you and come late us goo when reynard herd
this^ he went out and said softly to bellyn the ram. lief bellyn wherefore
be ye angry kywart spe / keth with his dear aunte. me thinks ye ought not to
be dysplesid therefore. he bad me say to you ye might well go to fore^ And he
shall come after^ he is lighter of foot than ye. he must tarry a while with his
aunte and her children. they weep and cr^e by cause I shall goo fro them. bellyn
sayde^ wh^t did kyward. me thought he cried after help / the fox answered /
what say ye bellyne wene ye that he should have any harm / now herke what he
then did / when we were comen in to mine hows / and ermelyn my wife understood
that I should goo over see she fyl down in a swoun and when kywart saw that /
he cried loud bellyn come help* mine aunte to bring her out of her swoun
then said the ra^me In faith I understood that kywart had been in great
danger / the fox said / nay truly / or kyward should have any harm in my
hows / I had lever that my wife and children should suffer much hurt /

How the fox sent the heed of kywart the hare to the king by bellyn the
ramme^ capitulo xxjo.
tHe fox said / bellyn remember ye not that yesterday the king and his
cou^seyl commanded me that er I should depart out of this land / I should send
to him two lettres. dear cosyn I pray you to bear them. they be ready wreton.
the ra^me said I wot never if I wiste that your endyttyng and writing were
good / ye might p^reue^ture so mo^che pray me that I would bear them / if I had
any thing to bear them in / reynard said ye shall not fail to have somewhat to
bear them in / rather than they should be unborn I shall rather give you my male
that I bear. and put the kings lettres therein. and ha^ge them about your
neck ye shall have of the king great thank therefore and be right welcomen to
him. hier upon bellyn promised him to bear thise lettres^ tho returned reynart
in to his hows and took the male and put therein kywarts heed and brought it to
bellyn for to bring him in danger / And henge it on his neck / and chargyd
him not for to look in the male / if he would have the kyngis friendship and if
ye will that the king take you in to his grace and love you / say that ye your
self have made the lettre and endited it / and have given the cou^nseyl that it
is so well made and wreton / ye shall have great thank therefore / bellyn the
ram was glad hereof and thought he should have great thank and said reynard I
wot well that ye now do for me / I shall be in the court gretl^ preysed when it
is known that I can so well endyte and make alettre / thaugh I can not make it
/ often times it ha^^peth that god suffers so^me to have worship and thank o^
the labouris and co^nyng of other m^n / and so it shall bifalle m^ now / Now
what counsel ye reyner / shall kywa^rt he ^a^e come with me to the court / nay
said the fox he shall anon follow you / he may not yet come / for he must
speak with his aunte /

nOw goo ye forth to fore / I shall show to k^wart s^crete thyngis which ben
not yet known / bellyn said fare well reynart / and wen^^ him forth to the
court and he ran and hasted so fast that he came to fore mydday to the cour^
and fond the king in his palace with his barons / the king meruaylled when
he saw him bring the male again which was made of the beres ^kyn / the king
said say on bel^lyn fro whens come y^ / where is the fo^e / how is it ^h^t
(...) has not the male with him / bellyn said my lord I shall say you all that
I know / I accompayned reynard unto his hows / And when he was ready he asked
me if I that would ffor your saacke bear two. lettre^ to you / I said for to do
you playsir and worship / I would gladly here to you vij. tho brought he to me
this male where in the lettres be / which ben endyted by my connyng and I gaf
counseyl of the making of them / I trow ye saw never lettres better ne
craftelyer made ne endyted / the king commanded anon bokart his secretarye to
read the lettres / ffor he understood al manner langages / tybert the catte and
he took the male of bellyns neck / and bellyn has so far said and confessyd
/ that he therefore was dampened.

tHe clerk bokart vndyde the male / and drew out kywarts heed and said alas
what lettres ben these / certainly my lord this is kywarts heed / alas said
the king that ever I beleuid so the fox / There might men see great heaviness
of the king and of the queen / the king was so angry that he held long down
his heed And at l^ste after many thoughts / he made a great cry / that all
the bestys were aferde of the noise / Tho spack sir firapeel the lupaerd which
was sybbe somewhat to the king / and said / six king how make ye such a
noise ye make sorrow enough thaugh the queen were deed / late this sorrow goo /
and make good chere / it is great shame / be ye not a lord and king of this
land / Is it not all under you. that here is / the king said sir firapeel
how should I suffer this / one false shrewe and deceyuar has betrayed me and
brought me so far / that I have forwrought and angered my friends / that I the
stout bruyn the bear / and ysegrym the wulf / which sore me r^pent^th / and
this g^th against my worship that I have done amys against my best barons and
that I trusted and beleuid so much the false horeson the fox / and my wife is
cause thereof / she prayde me so much that I herd her prayer and that me
repents / thaugh it be to late / what thawh sir king said the lupaerd / if
there be any thing mysdon / it shall be amended we shall give to bruyn the bear to
ysegrym the wulf / and to erswyn his wife for the piece of his skin and for
their shoes for to have good pees bellyn the ra^me / for he has confessyd him
self that he gaf counseyl and consentyd to kywardes de^h it is reason that he
abye it / And we all shall goo fe^^he r^^^nard and we shall areste him and hang
him by (...) neeke without law or Judgment / and there with (...) shul be
content /

How bellyn the ra^me and all his lignage were g^^uen in the hands of ysegrym
and bruyn and how he (...) slain / capitulo.xxi^o*
tHe king said I will do it gladly / firapel the ^^^paerd went tho to the
prison / and vnbonde them first / and then he said ye sires I bring to you
a fa^ste pardon and my lords love and friendship it re^enteth him and is sorry
that he ever has don spoken or trespaced against you / and therefore ye shall
have a good appoynte^ment / And also amends he shall / give to you bellyn the
ra^me and all his lignage fro now forthon to domesdaye / in such wise that
where someuer ye find them in field or in wode that ye may freely / byte and
ete them without any forfayte / And also the king grants to you / that ye
may hunte and do the werst that ye can to reynard and all his lygnage
without mysdoyng This fair great pryuelage will the king grant to you ever
to hold of him / And the king will that ye swear to him never to mysdoo /
but do him homage and feawte I counseil you to do this / ffor ye may do it
honorably / Thus was the pees made by fyrapel the lupaerd friendly and well / And
that cost bellyn the ram his tabart and also his life / and the wulfis
lignage hold thise preuilegis of the king / and in to this day they devour
and ete bellyns lignage where that they may find them this debate was begone
in an evil time / ffor the pees could never sith be made between them / The
king did forth with his court and feste length xij^ days longer for l^ue
of the bear and the wulf / So glad was he^of the making of this pees /

How the king held his feeste / and how lapreel the cony complained unto the
king upon reynart the fox capitulo ^xxiijo.
tO this great feste came al manner of beestis / ffor the king did do cry this
feste over all in that land / There was the most Joy and myrthe that ever
was seen emonge beestis / There was daunsed manerly the houedaunce with
shalmouse trompettis and all manner of menestralsye / the king did do ordeyne
so much mete / that euerych fond enough / And there was no be in all his
land so great ne so lytyl but he was there / an^ th^r were many sowles and
birds also / and all they that d^s^red the kings frendhip were there /
saving reynard the fox / the read false pilgrym which lay in a wait to do
harm / and thought it was not good for him to be there / Mete and drink
flowed there / There weere plays and esbatemens / The feast was full of melodye
/ One might have lust to see such a feeste / and right as the feeste had
dured viij days / a boute mydday came in the cony lapreel to fore the king
where he satte on the table with the queen / and said al heuyly that all they
herd him that were there / My lord have py^e on my complaynt which is of
great force and murdre that reynard the fox would have don to ^e / yester morrow
as I came rennyng by his borugh at maleperdhuys he stood before his door without
like a pilgrim I supposed to have passed by him peasibly toward this feste and
when he saw me come / he came against me saying his bedes I salewed him / but /
he spack not one word / but he raught out his right foot and dubbed me in the
neck between mine Eeris / that I had wend I should have lost my ^e^ed / but
god be thanked I was so light that I sprange fro him / with much pain came I
of his claws ^ he grymmed as he had been angry by cause he held me no faster ^
tho I escaped from him I lost mine one ere / and I had four great holes in my
heed of his sharp nails tha^ the blood sprange out / and that I was nyhe al a
swoun / but for the great fere of my life I sprange and ran so fast^ fro him
that he could not overtake me ^ See my lord thise great wounds that he has
made to me with his sharp long nails / I pray you to have pite of me and
that ye will / punysshe this false traitor and morderar / or ellis shall there
noman goo and comen over the heth in saefte / whiles he haunteth his false and
shrewde rewle /

How corbant the roke complained on the fox for the death of his wife
capitulo.xxiiijo.
Right as the cony had made an end of his complaynt / came in corbant the roek
flowen in the place to fore the king and said / dear lord here me / I bring
you hier a pietous complaynt / I went to day by the morrow with sharpebek my
wife for to play wpon the heth And there lay reynart the fox down on the
ground like a deed keytyf / his eyes stared and his tongue henge long out of
his mouth / like an hounde had been deed / we tasted and felt his belly / but we
fond thereon no life / tho went my wife and herkened and leyde her ere to fore
his month for to wite if he drew his breeth / which mysfylle her evil / ffor
the false fell fox awayted well his time and when he saw her so nygh him / he
caught her by the heed and boot it of / tho was I in great sorrow and cryde
loud / Alas alas what is there happed / then stood he hastily up / and
raught so couetously after me that for feere of death / I trembled and flewh
upon a tree thereby and saw fro far how the false keytyf ete and slonked her
in so hungerly that he left neither flessh ne bone / no more but a few feathers
/ the small feathers he slange them in with the flessh / he was so hungry / he
would well have eten tweyne / Tho went he his street / tho flewe I down with
great sorrow and gadred up the fetheris for to show them to you here / I would
not be again in such peril and fere as I was there for a thousand mark / of

lord see well to for to keep your self

How the king was sore angry of thise com^layntes capitulo.xxvo.
nOble the king was sore meuyd and angry when he had herd thise complayntes of
the cony and of the roek / he was so ferdful to look on that his eyes glymmerd
as fire / he brayed as loud as a bulle in ^uche wise that all the court quoke
for feere / at the last he said cryeng / by my crown and by the truth that
I owe to my wife I shall so awreke and avenge this trespaces / that it shall be
long spoken of after / that my saufco^duyt and my commandment is thus broken
I was over nyce that I beleuid so lightly the false shrewe / his false
flateryng speech deceived me / He told me he would go to rome / and for thens
over see to the holy land / I gaf him male and palster and made of him a
pilgrim and mente al troth / O what false touches can he / how can he stuff
the sleue with flocks / but this caused my wife / it was al by her counseyl / I
am not the first that have been deceived by wymmens counseyl by which many a
great hurt has byfallen / I pray and comande all them that hold of me and
desire my friendship / be they here or where someuer they be / that they with
their counseyl and deeds help me tauenge this over geete trespaas / that we
and owris may abide in honor and worship / and this false thief in shame that
he no more trespace against our saufgarde / I will my sell in my person help
thereto all that I may /

ySegrym the wulf and bruyn the bear herd well the kings words / and hoped
well to be auengid on reynard the fox but they durst not speak one word The
king was so sore meuyd that none durst well speak / At last the queen spak
/ Sire pour dieu ne croyes mye toutes chooses que on vous dye / et ne Iures pas
legierment / A man of worship should not lightly bileue / ne swear greatly unto
the time he knew the matter clerly. and also me ought by right here that other
party speak / There ben many that complain on other and ben in the defaute
them self. Audi alteram partem. here that other party / I have truly holden
the fox for good / and upon that / that he mente no falshede / I helped him
that I might but how someuer it comes or gooth / is he evil or good / me
thinks for your worship that ye should not proceed against him over hastily
that were not good ne honest / ffor he may not escape fro you / Ye may
prysone him or flee him / he must obey your Judgment / then said fyrapel
the lupaerd / My lord me thinks / my lady here has said to you truth and
gynen you good counseyl do ye well and follow her and take advise of your wise
counseyl / And if he be founden gylty in the trespaces that now to you be showed
/ late him be sore punysshid acordyng do his trespaces / And if he come not
hither / ^r this feste be ended and excuse him / as he ought of right to do /
then do as the coun^eyl shall (...) you / But and if he were twyes as much
false and ylle as he / is / I would not counseylle that he should be done to
more than right / Isegrym the wulf said sir fyra^al. all we a gree to the
fame^ as far as it pleseth my lord the king / it can not be better. But
though reynart were now here. and he cleryd him of double so many playn^^s yet
should I bring forth ayense him that he had forf^yted his / life. But I will now
be stylle and say not. because he is not present and yet above all this he
^ath told the king of certain tresour lyeng in kreken^y^ in hulsterlo. There
was never lied a greter lesyng. t^er with he has us all begyled. and has
sore hyndred me and the bexe. I dar leye my life thereon that he said not thereof
a true word. Now robs he and steleth upon the heth / all that gooth forth
by his hows / Nevertheless sir fi^apel what that pleseth the king and you /
that must well be don / But and if he would have comen hither / he might have been here for he had knowleche by the kyn / ges messager / The king said we
will none otherwise send for him / but I command all them that owe me seruyse
and will my honor and worship that they make them ready to the war at the
end of vj days / all them that been archers and ha ue bows / gonnes bombardes
horsemen / and footmen that all thise be ready to besiege maleperduys / I shall
destroy reynart the fox / if I be akynge / ye lords and sires what say ye
hereto / will ye do this with a good will / And they said and cried all / ye
we lord / when that ye will / we shall all goo with you.

How grymbert the dasse warned / the fox / that the king was wroth with him
and would slay him capitulo.xxvjo.
all thise words herd grymbert the dasse which was his brother sone / he
was sorry and angry if it might have prouffyted he ran then the hye way to
maleperduys ward / he spared nether busshe ne hawe / but he hasted so sore that
he swette / he sorowed in him self for reynart his read eme / and as he went
he said to him self Alas in what danger be / ye comen in / where shall ye
become shall I see you brought fro life to death / or else exyled out of the
land / truly I may be well sorouful / for ye be the heed of all our lygnage /
ye be wise of counseyl / ye be ready to help your friends when they have need /
ye can so well show your resons / that where ye speak / ye win all / with
such manner wayllyng and pytous words came grymbert to maleperduys / And fond
reynart his eme there standing / which had gotten two pygeons / as they came
first out of her neste to assaye if they could flee and because the feathers on
her wyngis were to short / they fylle down to the ground / And as reynart was
gone out to seche his mete / he espied them and caught hem: was comen home with
hem / And when he saw grymbert coming / he tarried and said / welcome my best
beloved neuew that I know in all my kynrede / ye have conne fast ye ben al be
swette / have ye any new tidings / alas said he / lyef eme it stands evil
with you / ye have lost both life and good / the king has sworn that he shall
give you a shameful death / he has commanded all his folk withyn vj days for
to be here / Archers fotemen / horsemen / And people in waynes^ And he has
gunn^s / bom^bardes tents and pauyllyons / And also he has do laaden torches
/ See to fore you / For ye have need / Ysegrym and bruyn ben better now with
the king than I am with you / All that they will / Is done / Isegrym has
don him to understand that ye be a thief and a morderar^ he has great envy
to you. Lapreel the cony and Corbant the roek have made a great complaynt also.
I sorrow much for your life. That for dread I am all seek. Puf said the fox /
dear neuew is there nothing ellis / be ye so sore aferd hereof Make good chere
hardely / though the king him self and all that been in the court had sworn my
deth^ yet shall I be exalted above them all / They may all fast Iangle
clatre and give counseyl / but the court may not prospere weythoute me and my
wyles and subtylte

How reynart the fox came another time to the court capitulo.xxvijo.
Dear neuew late all thise things pass and come her^ in / and see what I
shall give you / a good pair of fat pygeons / I love no mete better / They
ben good to dygeste / they may almost be swolowen in all hool the bones ben half
blood / I ^te them with that other / I feel my self other while encombred in my
stomak therfo re ete I gladly light mete. My wife ermelyn shall receive us
friendly / but tell her nothing of this thing / ffor she should take it over
heuyly / she is tender of heart. she might for fere fall in sum sekenes / a
lytyl thing gooth sore to her heart / And to morrow erly I will goo with you to
the court / And if I may come to speech and may be herd / I shall so ansuere /
that I shall touch sum nygh ynowh / neuew will not ye stand by me / as a
friend ought to do to another / yes truly dear eme said grymbert and all my
good is at your commandment / god thank you neuew said the fox / That is well
said. if I may live I shall quyte it you / Eme said grymbert ye may well come
tofore all the lords and excuse you there shall none ateste you ne hold as
long as ye be in your words / The queen and the lupaerd have gote^ that /
then said the fox / therefore I am glad / then I carre not for the best of
them an here / I shall well save my self / they spoke no more hereof / but went
forth in to the burgh / And fond ermelyn there sittyng by her yonglyngs which
aroose up anon and receyuid them friendly / Grymbert salewed his aunte and the
children with friendly words / the ij pygeons were made ready for their soper /
Which reynard had taken / each of them took his part as far as it would
stratche / if each of hem had had one more / there should but lytyl have left
over / the fox said lief nouewe / how like / ye my children rosel and
reynerdyn they shall do worship to all our lygnage / They begin al ready to do
well / that one catches well a chyken and that other a pullet / They^ conne well
also duke in the water after lapwynches and dokys / I would often send them for
prouande / but I will first teache them how they shall k^pe them fro the grynnes
/ fro the hunters and fro the houn^des / if they were so far comen that they
were wise / I durst well trust to them that they should well vytaylle us in many
good diuerses metes / That we now lack / And they like and follow me well /
ffor they play all grymmyng and where they hate they look friendly and meryly^
ffor there by they bring them under their feet / And byte the throat asondre /
This is the nature of the fox / They be swyfte in their taking which pleseth
me well.

eMe said grymbert ye may be glad that ye have such wise children / And I am
glad of them also by cause they be of my kynne / Grymbert said the fox ye have
swette and be weary it were hye tide that ye were at your rest / Eme if it
plese you it thinks me good Tho lay they down on a lytier made of straw /
the fox / his wife and his children went all to sleep / But the fox was al
heavy / and lay. sighed and sorowed how he might best excuse him self / On the
morrow erly he ruymed his castle and went with grymbart / but he took leave
first of dame ermelyn his wife and of his children / and said think not long
I must goo to the court with grymbert my cosyn / if I tarry somewhat be not
aferde / and if ye here any ylle tydyngis / take it always for the best. And
see well to your self and keep our castle well I shall do yonder the best I can
after that I see how it gooth Alas reyner said she how have ye now thus taken
upon you for to go to the court again / the last time that ye were there ye
were in great ieopardye of your life. And ye said ye would never come there
more. dame said the fox. thauenture of the worl^d is wonderly it goth
otherwhyle by wenyng / Many one weneth to have a thing which he must forgoo.
I must needs now go thither / be content it is al without dread / I hope to
come at alther lengest with in five days again / Here with he departed and
went with grymbert to the court ward / And when they were upon the heeth
then said reyner / Neuew sith I was last shryuen I have don many shrewde
tornes / I would ye would here me now of all that I have trespaced in / I made
the bear to have a great wound for the male which was cut out of his skin
/ And also I made the wulf and his wife to lose her shoon / I peased the the
king with great lesyngis and bare him on hand that the wulf and the bear would
have betrayed him and would have slain him / so I made the king right wroth
with them where they deseruyd it not / also I told to the king that there was
great tresour in hulsterlo of which he was never the better ne richer / for I
lied all that I said / I led bellyn the ram and kywart the hare with me and
slew kyward and sent to the king by bellyn kywarts heed in skorn / And I
dowed the cony between his ceris that almost I bena^me his life from him ffor he
escaped against my will / he was to me over swyft / The ro^ke may well complain /
for I swolowe^ in dame sharpbe^k his wife / and also I have forgoten on thing
the last time that I was shreuen to you / Which I have sith bethought me / And
it was of great deceyte that I did which I now will tell you / I came with
the wulf wal^kynge by^twene houthulst and el^uerdynge / There saw we goo a
read mare / And she had a black colte or a fool of unmonethis ol^de / which was
goodand fat Isegrym was almost storuen for hunger / And prayed me goo to the
mare / and wit of her if she would selle her fool / I ran fast to the mare /
And axed that of her / she said she would selle it for money / I demanded of
her how she would selle it / she said it is wreton in my hyndre foot / If ye
conne read and be a clerk ye may come see and read it. Tho wyste I well where
she would be. and I said nay for sothe I can not read / And also I desire not
to bye your chylde^ Isegrym has sent me hither. and would fayn know the prys
thereof / the mare said late him come then him self / And I shall late him
have knowleche / I said / I shall / and hastily went to ysegrym and said /
eme will ye ete your belly full of this colte / so goo fast to the mare for she
taryeth after you / She has do write the pris of her colte under her foot she
would that I should have read it / but I can not one lettre / which me sore
repents / ffor I went never to scole / eme will ye bye that colte / conne
ye read so may ye bye it / oy neuew that can I well what should me let / I can
well frenshe latin englissh and duche. I have goon to scole at oxenford I have
also with old and au^cyent doctors ben in the audyence and herd plees / and
also have given sentence / I am lycensyd in both laws / what manner writing
that any man can deuyse / I can read it as perfyghtly as my name^ I will goo to
her and shall anon understand the prys / and bad me to tarry for him / and he
ra^ne to the mare / and axed of her how she would selle her fool or keep it /
she said the s^^me of the money stands wreton after on my foot he said late
me read it / she said do and lift up her foot which was new shood wy^h
iron and vj strong nails / and she smote him without myssyng on his heed that
he fyl down as he had been deed / a man should well have ryden a mile er he aroos
/ The mare trotted a way with her colte / And she leet Isegrym lyeng shrewdly
hurt and wounded He lay and bledde / And howled as an hound / I went tho to
him and said / Sir ysegrym dear eme how is it now with you. have ye eten ynowh
of the colte. is your belly full. why give ye me no part I did your erande. have
ye slepte your dinner I pray you tell me what was wreton under the mares foot
what was it. prose or ryme. meter or verse. I would fayn know it. I trow it
was cantum. for I herd you sing me thought fro far. for ye were so wise
that noman could read it better than ye / Alas reynart alas said the wulf I
pray you to leave your mockyng. I am so foul arrayed and sore hurt. that an
heart of stone might have pity of me. The hoar with her long leg had an iron
foot I wend the nails thereof had been lettres / and she hytte me at the first
stroke vj. great wou^des in my ^^ed that almost it is cloven. such manner
lettres shall I never more desire to r^de /

Dear eme is that truth that ye tell me I have hereof great meruaylle / I
^^elde you for one of the wysest clerks that now live / Now I here well it is
true that I long sith have read and herd / that the best clerks ben not the
wysest men / the lay people otherwhyle weye wise / the cause that thise clerks
ben not the wysest / is that they study so much in the connyng and science
that they therein doole / Thus brought I Isegrym in this great last and harm.
That he uneath byhelde his life / Lyef neuew now have I told you all my sins
that I remember. What so ever fall at the court. I wot never how it shall
stand with me there. I am not now so sore aferd^ ffor I am clear from sin I
will gladly come to mercy / and receive penance by your cou^seyl^ grymbert said
the trespaces ben great / nevertheless who that is deed must abide deed. and
therefore I will forgive it you alto gydre / With the fere that ye shall suffer
therefore. er ye shall co^ne excuse you of the death / and hier upon I will
assoylle you. but the most hyndre that ye shall have shall be. that ye sent
kywarts heed to the court And that ye blinded the king with sutthe lies / Eme
that was right euyldoon / The fox said. what lyef neuew. Who that will goo
through the world this to here. and that to see / and that other to tell. truly
it may not clerly be done. how should any man handle honey. but if he lycked his
fyngres^ I am oftymes rored and prycked in my conscience as to love god above
all thynge^ and mine even christian as my self. as is to god well acceptable. and
acordyng to his law / But how wene ye that reason within forth fyghteth against
the outeward will than stand I all stylle in my self that me thinks I have
lost all my wits / And wot not what me ^yleth I am then in such a
thought / I have now all left my symnes / And hate all thing that is not
good / and clymme in hye comtemplacion above his comma^deme^ts but this specyal
grace have I when I am alone / But in a short while after when the world comes
in me then find I in my way so many stones / and the foot spores that these
loos prelates / and rich preestys goo in / that I am anon taken again /
then comes the world and will have this / And the fhesshe will live plesantly
/ which leye to fore me so many things that I then lose all my good /
thoughtis and purpoos / I here there sing pype / lawhe / play / and all
myrthe / And I here that these prelates and rich curates preche and say al
other wise / than they think and do / There learn I to lie / the lesynges ben
most used in the lords courts certainly lords / ladies / prestis and
clerks maken most lesyngis / Men dar not tell to the lords now the truth /
There is defaute / I must flatre and lie also / or ellis I should be shette
without the door / I have often herd men say truth and rightfully / And have
their reason made with a lesynge like to their purpose and brought it in and
went through by cause their matter should seem the fayrer / The lesyng oftymes
comes unadvised / And falls in the matter vnwetyngly / And so when she is well
cladde / it goth forth through with that other /

Dear neuew thus must men now lie here and there say soth flatre / and menace
praye^ and curse And seek every man upon his feblest and wekest / who otherwise
will now haunte and use the wo^ld / than deuyse alesyng in the fairest wise /
and that bywymp^^ with kerchieuis about in such wise that men take it for a
truth / he is not run away fro his master / Can he that subtylte in such
wise that he stamer not in his words / and may then be herd / neuew / this
man may do wonder he may were skarlet and gryse / he wynneth in the spyrituel
/ law and temporal also and where sommeuer he has to do / Now ben there many
false shrewis that have great envy that they have so great ford^le / And wene
that they conne also well lie / And take on them to lie and to tell it forth /
he would fayn ete of the fat morsellis. but he is not bileued ne herd / And
many ben there that be so plompe and folisshe^ that when they wene best to
prononce and show their matere and conclude. They fall beside and out
thereof. And can not then help hem self / and leave their matter without tail
or heed and he is a compted for a fool / And many mock them there with / but
who can give to his lesynge a conclusion / and prononce it without tatelyng
like as it were wreton to fore him / and that he can so blind the people / That
his lesynge shall better be bileuid than the truth / That is the man. What
connyng is it to say the troth that is good to do. How lawhe thise false
subtyl shrewis that give counseyl to make thise lesynges. and set them forth
/ And maken unright goo above right / and make bills / and / set in things
that never were thought ne said / and teache men see through their fyngres And
all for to win money / and late their tongues to hyre for to mayntene and
strength their lesyngis alas neuewe this is an evil connyng / of which. life.
scathe and hurt may come there of /

i Say not but that otherwhyle men must Iape / bourde and lie in small
thyngis / for who so says always truth. be may not now goo nowher through the
world. there ben many that play placebo. who so alleway says troth. shall
find many lettyngis in his way. Men may well lie when it is need / and after
amend it by counseyl / ffor all trespaces / there is mercy. There is no man so
wise / but he dooleth other while / Grymbert said well dear eme what thing
shall you let. ye know al thing at the narewest / ye should bring me hastily
in dotyng your resons passen my understanding / what need have ye to shryue you
/ ye should your self by right be the priest / And let me and other sheep come
to you for to be shryuen / ye know the state of the world in such wise as
noman may halte tofore you / With such manner talking they came walkyng in to
the court / The fox sorowed somewhat in his heart / Nevertheless he bare it out
and stryked forth through all the folk til he came in to the place where the
king him self was / And grymbert was always by the fox and said eme be not a
ferde. and make good chere / who that is hardy / thauen^ture helps him /
Oftymes one day is better than sometime an hole year / the fox said / Neuew ye
say trouth^ god thank you ye comfort me well / And forth he w^^^ and lokyd
grymly here and there as who says / what will ye here come I / he saw there
many of his kynne standing which yo^ned him but lytyl good / as the otter
beuer and other to the nombre of ^^x. whom I shall. name afterward / And sum
were there that loved hym^ The ffoxe came in and fyl down on his knees to fore
the king and began his words and sayde^

How reynart the fox excused him before the king capitulo.xxviijo.
gOd fro whom nothing may be hyd / and above all thing is mighty save my lord
the king and my lady the queen and give him grace to know who has right and
who has wrong / For there live many in the world that seem otherwise outward
than they be withi^ne / I would that god shewde openly every man's misdeeds /
and all their trespaces stoden wreton in their forehedes / and it cost me
more than I now say / And that ye my lord the king knew as much as / I do
/ how I dispose me both erly and late in your seruyse / And therefore am I
complained on of the evil shrewyes and with lesynges am put out of your grace
and consayte and would charge me thith great offencis without deseruyng against
al right / Wherefore I cry out harowe on them that so falsely have belyed me /
and brought me in such trouble / how be it I hope and know you both my lord
and my lady for so wise and discrete / that ye be not led nor bileue such
lesyngis ne false talis out of the right way for ye have not be woned so to
do / Therefore dear lord I biseche you to considre by your wysedom all thing
by right and law / is it in deed or in^ speech / do every man right / I
desire no better he that is gylty and ^^unde fawty late him be punysshyd / men
shall well know ^r I depart out of this court / who that I an / I came not
f^atre I will allewey show openly my heed.

How the king answered upon reynarts excuse.

all they that were in the palace weren all stylle and wondered that the fox
spack so stoutly / the (...) sayd^ / ^a reynart how well can ye your falacye and
salutacion d^on but your fair word^s may not help you I think well that ye
shall this day for your werkis be hanged by your neck / I will not much chyde
with you But I shall short your pain / that ye love us well / that have ye well
shewde on the cony and on corbant the roeck your falsenes / and your false
Inuencions shall without long taryeng make you to deye / A pot may goo so long
to water / that at the last it comes to broken hoom / I think your pot
that so often has deceived us shall now hastly be broken / reynart was in great
fere of thise wordes^ he would well. he had been at coleyn / when he came thedyr /
Then thought he I must her through / how that I do my lord the king said
he / it were well reason that ye herd my words all out / thaugh I were dampened
to the death / yet ought ye to here my words out. I have yet here to fore time
given to you many a good counseyl and prouffytable / And in need alwey have
byden by you whe^re other beestis have wyked and goon their way / if now the
evil beestis with false matters have to fore you with wrong bely^d me / and I
might not come to mine excuse / ought I not then to plain / I have to fore
this seen that I should be herd by fore another / yet might thise thyngis well
change and come in their old state Old good deeds ought to be remembrid / I
see here many of my lygnage and frend^s standing that seem they set now lytyl
by me / Which nevertheless should sore dear in their hertes. that ye my lord
the king should destroy me wrongfully if ye so did ye should destroy the
trewest servant that ye have in all your lands / what wene ye sir king /
had I know^n my self gylty in any feat or broke. that I would have comen
hither to the law emonge all mine enemies / Nay six nay / not for all the
world of read gold / ffor I was fre and at large / What need had I to do that /
but god be thanked I know my self clear of all misdeeds that I dar well come
openly in the light and to answer to all the complayntes that any man can
say on me / but when grymbert brought me first thise tydyngis / tho was I not
well plesed but half fro my self that I lepe here and there as an unwise man /
And had I not ben in the censures of the church / I had without taryeng have
comen / but I went dolynge on the heeth / and wist not what to do for sorrow
/ And then / it happed that mertyne mine eme the ape met with me. Which is
wyser in clergy than sum priest. he has been advocate for the bishop of
cameryk ix year during. he saw me in this great sorrow and heaviness. and said
to me / dear cosyn me thinks ye are not well with your self / what eyleth you.
who has dysplesyth you. Thing that thoucheth charge ought to be given in
knowleche to frendis. A triew friend is a great help. he fyndeth often better
counseyl than he that the charge rests on. ffor who someuer is charged with
matters is so heavy and acombred with them that often he can not begin to find
the remedye^ ffor such be so woo like as they had lost their Inwytte. I said
dear eme ye say truth. For in like wise is fallen to me. I am brought in to
a great heaviness vndeseruid and not gylty / by one to whom I have always ben an
herty and great friend / that is the cony which came to me yesterday in the
morenyng where as I satte to fore my hows and said matyns / He told me he
would goo to the court and salewed me friendly and I him again / Tho said he to
me / good reynard I am an hongred and am weary / have ye any mete. I said ye
ynowh come nere^ Tho gaf I him acopel of maynchettis with sweet butter / It was
upon a wednesday on which day I am not wont to ete any flessh / And also I
fasted by cause of this feste of whitsontyd which approuched / For who that
will taste of the ouerest wysehede / and live goostly in keeping the
commandemts of our lord / he must fast and make him ready against the hye
festes / Et vos estote para^^ / dear eme I gaf him fair white breed with sweet
butter / wherwyth a man might well be easid that were much hongry.

aNd when he had eten his belly fulle / tho came russel my youngest sone / and
would have taken away that was left / For young children would always feign eten
/ And with that he tasted for to have taken somewhat / the cony smote russel to
fore his monthe that his teeth bledde / and fyl down half a swoun / when
reynardyn mine eldest sone saw that. he sprange to the cony and caught him by
the ^eed. and should have slain him. had I not reskowed him I help him that he
went from him / and beat my child sore therefore. lapreel the cony ran to my
lord the king and said I would have murdered him See eme thus come I in the
words / and I am leyde in the blame / And yet he complayneth and I plain not
/ After this came corbant the rock fleyng with a sorouful noise / I asked what
him eyled. and he said alas my wife is deed / yonder lies a deed hare full of
mathes and worms / and there she ete so much thereof. that the worms have
byten a two her throat / I axed him how comes that by / he would not speak a
word more but flewe his way / And let me stande^ Now says he that I have
byten and slain her / how should I come so nygh her / for she flees / and I goo
a foot. behold dear eme thus am I born an hand. I may say well that I am
unhappy / But parauenture it is for mine old sins / hit were good for me if I
could patiently suffer it. The ape said to me / Neuew ye shall goo to the
court to fore the lords and excuse you / alas eme that may not be. ffor the
archedeken has put me in the popes curse / by cause I counseylled ysegrym the
wulf for to leave his religyon at elmare and forsake his habyte / he complained
to me that he lyuyd so straytly as in long fasting and many thyngis redyng and
syngyng that he could not endure it^ If he should long abide there he should
deye. I had pity of his complaynyng / And I help him as a true friend that he
came out. Which now me sore repents. for he labors all that he can against
me to the king for to do me behanged. thus does he evil for good. See eme thus
am I at the end of al my wits and of counseyl. For I must goo to rome for
an absolucion. And then shall my wife and children suffer much harm and
blame. For thise evil bestis that hate me / shulle do to hem all the hurt
they may and fordryue them where they can / And I would well defend hem if I
were fre of the curse / for then would I goo to the court and excuse me /
where now I dar not / I should do great sin if I came emonge the good people / I
am aferde god should plaghe me. Nay cosyn be not af^rd^ er I should suffer you
in this sorrow I know the way to come well. I understand me on this work. I am
called there mertyne the bisshops clerk. and am well byknowen there. I shall do
syte the archedeken and take a plee against him. and shall bring with me for you
an absolucion against his will / for I know there all that is for to be done or
left there dwells simon mine eme which is great and mighty there. who that
may give ought / he helps him anon / there is prentout^ wait scathe / and
other / of my frendis and alyes Also I shall take so^me money with me ^ if I
need any* the preyer is with yeftes hardy. with money alleway the right goth
forth. A true friend shall for his friend aue^ture both life and good / and so
shall I for you in your right

cOsyn make good chere I shall not rest after to morrow til I come to rome / and
I shall solycyte you^ matters / And goo ye to the court as soon as ye may all
your misdeeds / and tho sins that have brought you in the great sentence and
curse / I make you quyte of them and take them in my self / when ye come to the
court ye shall find there rukenawe my wife / her two susters and my three
children and many mo of our lignage / dear cosyn speak to them hardely / my wife
his sondrely wise / and will gladly do sum what for her frendis / who that
has need of help shall find on her great friendship / one shall always seek on
his frendis / thaugh he have angered them / for blood must krepe / where it can
not goo / And if so be that ye be so over chargyd that ye may have no right /
then send to me by night and day to the court of rome / and late me have
knowleche thereof / and all tho that been in the land is it king or queen /
wife or man I shall bring them all in the popes curse / and send there an
Inderdicte that noman shall read ne syngen ne crystene children / ne burye the
deed ne receive sacrament / till that ye shall have good right / Cosyn this
shall I well get / for the pope is so sore old that he is but lytil set by /
And the cardynal of pure gold has all the might of the court / he is young
and great of frendis he has a concubyne / whom he much loves / And what she

this right has standen yet hitherto. And I will not it should be broken by me.
the law and right does noman wrong / all the beestis both pour and rich
were all stylle when the fox spak so stoutly / the cony laprel and the wek
were so sore aferde that they durst not sp^ke^ but pyked and stryked them out
of the court both two. and when they were a wom fer in the play ne they said.

How dame rukenawe answered for the fox to the king. capitulo xxixo.
dAme rukenawe the she ape reynarts aunte was not well plesyd / She was great

it to do was / where ever she came euerich was glad of her / she said my lord
the king ye ought not to be angry when ye sytte in Judgment / ffor that
becomes not your noblesse^ A man that sytteth in Judgment ought to put fro him
all wrath and anger A lord ought to have dyscrescion that should sytte in

A parable of aman that delyuerd a serpent from peril of death. capitulo xxxo.
nOw two year passid came a man and a serpent-here in to this court for to have
Judgment. which was to you and youres right doubteful. The serpent stood in an
hedche where as he supposed to have gone thorugh / but he was caught in a snare
by the neck. that he might not escape without help but should have lost his
life there. the man came forth by. and the serpente called to him and cryde. and
prayed the man that he would help him out of the snare. or ellis he must there
dye:

tHe man had pity of him and said / if thou promise to me that thou will not
enuenyme me ne do me none harm ne hurt I shall help the out of this peril /
The serpente was ready and swore a great oath that he now ne never should do
him harm ne hurte^ Then he unloosed him and delyuerd him out of the snare /
And went forth to gydre a good while / that the serpente had great hongre for
he had not eten a great while to fore. and sterte to the man and would have
slain him. the man sterte away and was a ferde and said / will thou now sle
me / have thou forgoten the oath that thou made to me that thou sholdest not
mysdoo ne hurt me The serpent answered I may do it good / to fore all the
world that I do / the need of hongte may cause a man to break his oath / The
man said if it may be not bettre / give me so long respyte till we mete and
find that may Judge the matter by right / The serpente granted thereto / thus
they went to gydre so long that they fond tyselyn the raven / And slyndpere
his sone / there rehearsed they their resons / Tiselyn the raven Iuged anon that
he should ete the man / he would fayn have eten his part and his sone also /
The serpent said to the man how is it now / what think ye have I not won /
The man said / how should a robber Judge this he should have a uayle thereby /
and also he is allone / there must be two or three at lest to gydre and that
they understand the right and law and that don / late the sentence gone / I am
neue^theles ill on enough / They a greed and went forth both to gydre so long
that they fond the beer and the wulf to whom they told their matter / And they
anon Iuged that the serpent should sle the man / For the need of hongre breketh
oath always / the man then was in great doubt and fere / and the serpent came
and cast his venym at him / but the man lepe a way from him with great pain /
And said ye do great wrong that ye thus lie in a wait to slay me / ye have
no right thereto / The serpent sa^yde / Is it not enough yet / hit has been
twyes Iuged / ye said the man that is of them that been wonde to murdr^ and
rob / All that ever they swear and promise they hold not / but I appele
this matter in to the court to fore our lord the king / And that thou may not
forsake / And what Judgment that shall be given there / I shall obey and suffer
/ and never do the contrary.

tHe bear and the wulf sayden that it sbold be so / And that the serpent
desired no better / They supposed if it should come to fore you / It should goo
there as they would. I trow ye be well remembrid herof^ Tho came they all to
the court to fore you / And the wulues two children came with their fader.
Which were called empty belly and never full / by cause they would ete of the
man. ffor they howlyd for great hongre wherefore ye commanded them to avoid
your court / The man stood in great dread / And called upon your good grace and
told how the serpente would have taken his life from him to whom he had sauyd
his life and that above his oath and promise he would have devoured him / The
serpente answered I have not trespaced / And that I report me hoolly un the
king / For I did it to save my life / ffor need of life / one may break his oath
and promise / My lord that time were ye and all your counseyl here with
acombryd For your noble grace saw the great sorrow of the man / And ye would not
that the man should for his gentilnes and kyndenes be Iuged to death / And on
that other since hongre and need to save the life seeks narowly to be helped /
hier was none in all the court that could ne knew the right hierof / There were
sum that would fayn the man had be helped / I see them hier stondyng / I wot
well they said that they could not end this matter / Then commanded ye that
reynard my neuew should come and say his aduy^ in this matter / that tym^ was he
above all other byleuyd and herd in the court / And ye bad him give sentence
acordyng to the best right / and we all shall follow him / For he knew the
ground of the law / reynard said my lord / it is not possible te give a true
sentence after their words / for in here saying ben often lesynges / But and if
I might see the serpent in the same paryl and need that he was in when the man
loosed him and vnbonde / Then wys^e I well what I should say / And who that
would do otherwise he should mysdoo again right / Then said ye my lord
reynard that is well said we alle^ ^corde herto / ffor noman can say better /
Then went the man and the serpent in to the place where as he fond the
serpente Reynart bad that the serpent should be set in the snare in like wise
as he was / And it was don / Then said ye my lord / reynart how thinks you
now / what Judgment shall we give. Then said reynart the f^^e. My lord now ben
they both like as they were to (...)* they have neither won ne lost See my
lord how I Judge for a right also far as it shall plese your noble grace* if
the man will now lose and unbind the serpent upon the promise and oath. that he
to fore made to him, he may well do it. But if he think that he for any thing
should be emcombryd or hyndred by the serpent. or for need of hongre would break
his oath and promise. Then Judge I that the man may goo freely where he will. and
late the serpe^te abide stylle bounden. like as he might have don at the
beginning. fforhe would have broken his oath and promise / where as he help him
out of such fereful peril / Thus thinks me a ryghtful Judgment that the man
shall have his fre choys / like as he to fore had.

lO my lord this Judgment thougt you good / and all your counseyl which at
that time were by you / and folewed the same / And preysed reynardis wysedom
that he had made the man quyte and free / Thus the fox wisely kept your noble
honor and worship / as a triewe servant is bound to do to his lord / where
has the beer or the wulf don ever to you so much worship They conne well
huylen and blasen stele and rob / and ete fat morfellis and fylle their
belyes / And then Judge they for right and law that small theuis that stele
hennys and chekyns should be hanged / But they hemself that stelen kyen oxen and
horses / they shall goo quyte and be lords / And seem as though they were wyser
than salamon / Auycene or aristotiles / And each will be ^olden hye proud / and
preised of great deeds and hardy But and they come where as it is to do / they
ben the first that flee / Then must the simple goo forth to fore / And they
keep the rereward behind / Och my lord these and other like to them be not
wise / but they destroy town. castle. land and people. They retche not whose
hows brenneth. so that they may warm them by the coals They seek all their
own auayll and synguler proffyte / But Reynart the fox and all his frendis
and lygnage sorowen and think to prefer the honor worship. fordeel and
proffyte of their lord. and for wise counseyl which often more prouffyteth here
than pride and boost / This does reynard / thaugh he have no thank / At
long it shall be well known / who is best and does most prouffyt / My lord
ye say / that his kynne and lignage draw al afterward from him / and stand
not by him / for his falshede and deceyuable and subtyl touchis / I would an
other had said that / there should then such wrake be taken thereof / that
him might growle that ever he saw him / But my lord we will forbere you / ye
may say your playsir / and also I say it not by you / Were there any that
would bedryue any thing against you with words or with works / him would we so
do to / that m^n should say we had been there / There as fyghtyng is we ben not
woned to be aferd^ My lord by your leave I may well give you knoweleche of
reynardis frendis and kynne. there ben many of them that for his sake and love
will adventure life and good. I know my self for one. I am a wife. I should if he
had need set my life and good for him also I have three full wa^^n childr^n
which ben hardy and strong / whom I would all to gydr^ adventure for his love.
rather than I should see him destroyed / yet had I lever dye than I saw them
myscarye to fore mine eyes. so well love I him.

Which ben friends and kynne unto Reynard the fox. capitulo xxxjo.
tHe first child is named byteluys. which is much cherysshyd and can make
much sport and game / wherefore is given to him the fat trenchours and much
other good mete which comes well to prouffyt of fulrompe his brother / and
also my third child is a daughter and is named hatenette / she can well pyke
out lyse and netis out of men's heedis / thise three ben to each other tryewe /
wherefore I love them well / dame rukenawe called hem forth and said / welcome my
dear children to me forth and stand by reynard your dear neuew / Then said
she / Come forth all ye that been of my kynne and reynarts / and late us pray
the king that he will do to reynart right of the land / Tho came forth many
a b^est anon / as the squyrel / the musehont / the fychews / the martron / the
beuer with his wife ordegale / the genete / the ostrole / the boussyng / and the
fyret / these tweyne ete as feign polayl as does reynart / The oter and
pantecroet his wife whom I had almost forgoten / yet were they to fore with the
beuer enemies to the fox / but they durst not gaynsaye dame rukenawe / for
they were aferd of her She was also the wysest of al his kynne of counseyl and
was most doubted / There came also mo than xx other by cause of her for to
stand by Rynard / There came also dame atrote with her ij sustres / the wesel /
and hermell the ass. the back / The watreratte and many moo to the nombre of
xl / which all camen and stoden by reynard the fox /

mY lord the king said rukenanwe come and see hier if reynart have any frendis
/ here may ye see / we ben your true subgettis which ffor you would adventure
both life and good if ye had need / Though ye be hardy mighty and strong / Our
welwyllyd friendship can not hurt you / late reynard the fox well bethynke him
upon thise matters that ye have leyd against him / And if he can not excuse him /
then do him right we desire no better / And this by right ought to noman be
warned / The queen then spack. this said I to him yesterday / But he was so
fyers and angry that he would not here it. the lupaerd said also. Sire ye may
Judge no ferther than your men give their verdyte. ffor if ye would goo forth by
will and might that were not worshipful ffor your estate here allewaye both
parties and th^nne by the best and wysest counseyl give Judgment discretly
acordyng to the best right. the king said. this is al trewe^ but I was so
sore meuyd when I was informed of kywarts death and saw his heed. that I was
hoot and hasty. I shall here the fox. can he answer and excuse him of that is
leyd against him. I shall gladly late him goo quyte. And also at request of
his good frendis and kynne. Reynart was glad of thise wordis. and though^^ god
thank mine aunte^ She has the rys do blosme aagayn^ She has well helped me
forth now. I have now a good foot to daunse on. I shall now look out of mine
eyes. And bring forth the fairest lesyngis that ever man herd. and bring my
self out of this danger.

How the fox with subtylte excused him for the death of kywart the hare and of
all other matters that were leyde against him and how with fflateryng gate again
his pres of the king. capitulo xxxijo.
then spak reynart the fox and said / Alas what say ye is kywart deed /
and where is bellyn the ram / what brought he to you / when he came again /
ffor I delyuerd to him three iewellis / I would fayn know where they ben be
comen / That one of hem should he have given to you my lord the king / And the
other ij to my lady the queen / The king said / bellyn brought us naught
ellis but kywarts heed / like as I said you to fore / whereof I took on him
wrake / I made him to lose his life / ffor the foul kaytyf said to me / that he
him self was of the counseyl of the lettres making that were in the male / Alas
my lord is this very truth / woo to me kaytyf that ever I was born since that
thise good Iewellis be thus lost mine heart will break for sorrow / I am sorry
that I now live / what shall my wife say when she hereth hereof / she shall goo
out of her wit for sorrow / I shall never also long as I live have her
friendship she shall make much sorrow when she hereth thereof / The she ape said
Reynard dear neuew / what prouffyteth that ye make all this sorrow late it pass
/ And tell us what thise Iewellis were / parauenture we shall find counseyl
to have them again if they be above earth Master akeryn shall labor for them
in his bookis / and also we shall curse for them in all chirchys unto the time
that we have knowleche where they been / They may not be lost / Nay aunte
think not that / ffor they that have them will not lightly depart fro them.
there was never king that ever gaf so rich Iewellis as thise be / Nevertheless
ye have somewhat with your words easyd mine heart and made it lighter than it
was / Alas loo here ye may see how he or they to who^me a man trusts most is
often by him or them deceyuyd / thaugh I should goo all the world thorugh and my
life in adventure set therefore / I shall wit where thise Iewellis ben becomen.

With a dissymylyd and sorouful speech said the fo^e harken ye all my kynne
and frendyes / I shall name to you / thise Iewellis what they were / And then
may ye say that I have a great loss / that one of them was a ring of fyn
gold / and within the ring neyt the fyngre were wreton lettres enameld with
sable and asure and there were three hebrews names therein / I could not my self
read ne spelle them / for I understand not that langage / but master a^^ion
of tryer he is a wise man he understands well al manner of langages and the
virtue of al manner herbs / and there is no be so fires ne strong but he can
dompte him / for if he see him ones he shall do as he will / And yet he
bileueth not on god / He is a Jew / The wysest in connyng and specially he
knows the virtue of stones. I shewde him ones this ring / he said that they
were tho three names that seth brought out of paradys when he brought to his
fadre Adam the oil of mercy / And who someuer bears on him thise three names /
he shall never be hurt by thondre ne lyghtnyng ^ne no witchecraft shall have
power over him ne be tempted to do sin. And also he shall neu^r take harm by
cold / thaugh he lay three wynters long nyghtis in the feelde / thaugh it
snowed stormed or frore never so sore / so great might have thise words /
wytnes of master abrion / withought forth on the ring stood a stone of three
manner colors / the one part was like read cristalle / and shoon like as fire
had been therein / in such wise that if one would goo by night / him behooved non
other light for the shynyng of the stone made and gaf as great a light as it
had been mydday / That other part of the stone was white and clear as it had been burnysshid / Who so had in his eyes any smarte or sorenes / or in his body
any swellyng / or heed ache / or any sykenes withoutforth if he stry^^ed this
stone on the place where the gryef is / he shall anon be hole / or if any man be
seek in his body of venym / or ylle mete in his stomach / of colyk /
stranguyllyon / stone / fystel or kanker or any other sekenes / sauf only the
very death late him leye this stone in a little watre / And late him drink it /
and he shall forthwyth be hole and al quyte of his seknessis / Alas said the
fox we have good cause to be sorry to lose such a Jewel / fforthermore the
third color was grene like glass / But there were sum sprynklis therein like
purpure / the master told for truth / that who that bare this stone upon him
should never be hurt of his enemy / and that noman were he never so strong
and hardy that might mys do him / and where ever that he fought he should have
vyctorye were it by night or by day also far as he beheld it fasting / and
also thereto where someuer he went and in what felawship / he should be bylouyd
/ though they had hated him to fore / if he had the ring upon him / they
should forgete their anger as soon as they saw him / Also though he were al
naked in a field again an hundred armed men / he should he well herted and escape
fro them with worship / but he must be a noble gentle man / and have no
chorles conditions / ffor then the stone had no / might and by cause this
stone was so precious and good / I thought in my self that I was not a ble n^
worthy to bear it / and ther^ fore i sent it to my dear lord the king / for i
know him for the most noble that now lives / and also all our welfare and
worship lies on him / and for he should be kep^^ fro all dread need and
vngheluck.

i Fond this ring in my fadres tresour / and in the same place I took a
glass or a mirror and a comb which my wife would algates have / a man might
wondr^ that saw thise Iewellis / I sent these to my lady the queen / for I
have founden her good and gracious to me / this Comb might not be to much
preysed / Hit was made of the bone of a clean noble be named Panthera /
which fedeth him between the great Jude and erthly paradyse / he is so lusty
fair and of color / that there is no color under the heaven / but sum lyknes
is in him thereto he smells so sweet / that the savor of him boteth all
syknessis and for his beauty and sweet smellyng all other beestis follow him /
for by his sweet savor they ben heled of all syknessis / this panthera has a
fair boon broad and thynne / when so is that this beefte is slain all the sweet
odor restid in the bone which can not be broken ne shall nen rote ne be
destroyed by fire / by water / ne by smytyng / hit is so hard tyht and fast /
and yet it is light of weight / The sweet odor of it has great might / that
who that smells it set naught by none other lust in the world and is easyd
and quyte of all manner diseases and Infirmytes / And also he is ioconde and
glad in his heart / this comb is polysshid as it were fine silver / and the
teeth of it ben small and strait / And bytwen the gretter teeth and the smaller
is a large field and space where is coruen many an image subtlly made and
enameld about with fyn gold / the field is checked with sable and silver /
enameld with cybore and asure / And there in is thistorye how venus Juno and
pallas strof for thapple of gold / which each of them would have had / which
contrauersye was set upon paris / that he should give it to the fairest of
them three.

^Arys was that time an herd man and kept his faders beestis and sheep
without troy / when he had resceyuid thapple / Juno promised to him if he
would Judge that she might have thapple / he should have the most r^chesse of
the world / pallas said if she might have thapple she would give him wysedom and
strength and make him so gret^ a lord that he should overcome all his enemies
/ and whom he would / venus said what nedest thou richesse or stre^g the / art
not thou pryamus sone / and hector is thy brother which have al asye under
their power / art not thou one of the possessours of great troy / if thou wylt
give to me thapple i shall give the the richest tresour of the world and that
shall be the fairest woman that ever had life on earth / ne never shall none be
born fairer tha^ she / then shall thou be richer than rich / And shall clymme
above al other / ffor that is the tresour that noman can preyse enough / for
honest / fair and good women can put a way many a sorrow fro the heart / they be
shamefast and wise / and bring a man in very Joy and bliss / Paris herd
th^s venus which presented him this great Joy and fair lady and prayed her to
name this fair lady / that was so fair and where she was / venus said^ it is
helene king mencla^^ wife of greece / there lives not anobler. rich^r.
gentiller. ne wyser wife in all the world / Then paris gaf to her thapple and
said that she was fayreft / how that he gate afterward helene by the help^ of
venus and how he brought her in to troy and wedded her / the great love and
ioly life that they had to gyd^e / was al coruen in the field every thing by him
self / and the storye wreton.

nOw ye shall here of the mirror / the glass that stood thereon was of such
virtue that men might see therein / all that was don within a mile / of men of
beestis and of al thing that me would desire to wit and know / and what man
looked in the glass had he any dissease / of ^rie- king or motes / smarte or
perles in his eyes he should be anon heled of it / Such great virtue had the
glass is it then wondee if I be meuyd and angry for to lose such manner
Iewellis. The tree in which this glass stood was light and fast and was named
cetyne / hit should endure ever er it would rote or worms should hurt it / and
therefore king salamo^ seelyd his temple with the same wode withynforth / Men
preysed it derrer than fyn gold hit is like to tree of helenus / of which wode
king Crompart made his horse of tree for love of king morcadigas daughter that
was so fair / whom he had wend for to have won / That hor^ was so made
within / that woe som^uer rode on hit if he would / he should be within less
than on hour / an hundred mile thens / And that was well preuyd ffor cleomedes
the kings sone would not believe that / That horse of tree had such might and
virtue / He was young / lusty and hardy / And desired to do great deeds of
prys for to be renomed in this world / And leep on this horse of tree / Crompart
turned a pynne that stood on his breast / And anon the horse lift him up and
went out of the halle by the wyndowe and er one might say his pater noster /
He was goon more ten mile way cleomedes was sore aferd and supposed never to
have turned again / as thistorye thereof tells more plainly / but how great
dread he had / and how far that he rood upon that horse made of the tree of
hebenus er he could know the art and craft how he should torn him / and how
Ioyeful he was when he knew it / and how men sorowed for him / and how he
knew all this and the joy thereof when he came again all this I pass over for
losyng of time / but the most part of all came to by the virtue of the wode /
of which wode the tree that the glass stood in was made / and that was without
forth of the glass half a foot brood / wherein stood so^me strange hystoryes
which were of gold / of sable of silver / of yelow / asure and cynope / these
six colowrs were therein wrought in such wise as it behooved / and under every
hystorye the words were graue^ and enameld that every man might understand
what each historye was / After my Judgment there was never myrour so costly so
lustly n^ so playsaunt / in the beginning stood there an horse made fat
strong and sore enuyous upon an heart which ran in the feeld so far and
swyftly that the horse was angry that he ran so far to fore hym^ and could not
overtake hym^ he thought he should cacche him and subdue him. though he should
suffer much pain therefore. the horse spack tho to a herdeman in this wise. if
thou cowdest taken an heart that I well can show the / thou sholdest have great
prouffyt thereof. thou sholdest selle dear his horns his skyn and his flesh.
the herdeman said how may I come by him. the horse said sytte upon me. and I
shall bear the and we shall hunte him til he be taken The herdeman sprange and
satte upon the horse and saw the heart and he rode after but the heart was
light of foot and swyft. and out ran the horse far they honted so far after
him that the horse was we^y and said to the herdeman that satte on him. now
sytte of I will rest me / I am al weary. and give me leave to goo fro the. The
herdeman said I have arested the th^w may not escape fro me^ I have a bridle
on thy head and sporis on my heles thou shall never have thank hereof / I shall
bid wynge and subdue the had thou sworn the contrary. see how the horse
brought him self in thraldem and was taken in his own net. how may one
better be taken than by his own propre envy suffer him self to betaken and
riden^ there ben many that labor to hurt other^ and they them seluen ben hurt
and rewarded with the same

There was also made an ass and an hou^d / which dwelled both with a rich
man / The man louyd his hound well / ffor he pleyde often with him as folk do
with houndis / the hound leep up and pleyd with his tail / And lyckyd his
master about the mouth / this saw bowdwyn the ass / and had great spyte
thereof in his heart / and said to him self / how may this be and what may my
lord see on this foul hound / whom I never see does good ne proffyt / sauf
spryngeth on him and kysseth him / But me whom men putten to labor / to bear
and draw / and do more in a weke than he with his xv should do in a hole year
and yet sytteth he nevertheless by him at the table / and there ^teth bones
flessh and fat trenchours / And I have nothing but thystles and nettles / And
lie on nyghtes on the hard earth and suffer many ascorn / I will no longer
suffer this / I will think how I may get my lords love and friendship like
as the hounde does / Therwyth came the lord / And the ass lift up his tail and
sprang with his fore feet on the lords sholdres / And ble^ed grennyd and song
and with his feet made two great bules about his eres / And put forth his
mouth and would have kyssed the lords mouth as he had seen the hound done /
Tho cryde the lord sore aferde help / help / this ass will slay me / Then
came his seruauntis with good stauis and smyten and beat the ass so sore that
he had wend he should have lost his life / Tho returned he to his stable and
ete thistles and nettles and was an ass as he to fore was. In like wise who so
have envy and spyte of an others welfare / and were served in like wise / it
should be well behoefful / Therefore it is concluded that the ass shall ete
thistelis and netteles and bear the sack / though men would do him worship he
can not understand it / but must use old lewd manners / Where as asses geten
lordshippis / there men see selde good rewle / For they take heed of nothing
but on their synguler prouffyt / yet ben they take up and risen great / the
more pity is /

Harken ferther how my fad^e and tybert the catte wend to gydre / and had
sworn by their truth that for love ne hate they should not depart. And what
they gate / they should depart to each the half / Then on atyme they saw
hunters coming over the field with many hounds / They leep and run fast fro
them wa^d all that they might as they that were aferd of they: life / Tybert
said the fox whyther shall we now best flee / the hunters have espied us /
know ye any help my fadre trusted on the promise that each made to other /
And that he would for no need depart fro him / Tybert said ^e / I have a sack
full of wyles if we have need / as far as we abide to gydre we need not to
doubt hunters ne hou^des / Tybert bigan to syghe and was sore aferd / And
said / Reynart what auayllen many words / I know but one wyle. and theder
must I too. And tho clamme he upon on hye tree in to the top under the leuys
/ Where as hunter ne hounde might do him non harme^ And left my fadre allone
in Ieoparde of his life. ffor the hu^ters set on him the hounds all that
they could / Men blewe the horns and cried and hallowed the fox / Sle^ and
take. When tybert the catte saw that. he mocked and s^orned my fadre and said
what reynart cosyn unbind now your sakke where all the wylis ben in / it is now
time ye be so wise called / help your self / ffor ye have need / this mock
must my fadre here of him to whom he had most his trust on / And was almost
taken and nygh his death and he ran and fled with great fere of his life and
let his male slide of by cause he would be the lighter / yet all that could not
help him for the hounds were to swyft and should have byten him / But he had
one adventure that there by he fond an old hole / wherein he crepte / and escaped
thus the honters and hounds / Thus held this false deceyuer tibaert his
sykernes that he had promised / Alas how many ben there now a days that keep
not their promise / and set not thereby though they break it / And though I
hate tybaert herfore / is it wonder ^ut I do not sikerly / I love my soul to
well thereto / Nevertheless if I saw him in adventure and mysfalle in his body or
in his goods / I trow hit should not much goo to my heart so that another
did it / Nevertheless I shall neither hate him ne have / envy at him / I shall
ffor gods love forgive him yet is it not so clear out of mine heart / but a
lytyl ylle will to him ward abides therein as this comes to my remembrance /
And the cause is that the sensualyte of my flessh fyghteth against reason.

There stood also in that myrrour of the wulf / how he fond ones upon an heth a
deed horse flayn^ but all the flessh was eten then went he and bote great
morsellis of the bones that for hungre he took three or iiij attones and
swolowed them in / ffor he was so gredy that one of the bones stack thwart in
his mouth / Whereof he had great pain / And was in great fere of his life / He
sought al about for wise masters and surgyens and promised great yeftis for
to be heled of his disease / At last when he could nowher find remedy he
came to the crane with his louge neck and bille / and prayde him to help him
and he would lone and reward him so well that he should ever be the better /
The crane herked after this great reward and put his heed in to his throat and
brought out the boon with his bylle / The wulf sterte a side with the pluckyng
/ and cryde out alas thou do me harm ^ but I forgive it the / do no more
so / I would not suffer it of an other / the crane said / Sir Isegrym goo and
be merry for ye be al hool now give to me that ye promised The wulf said / will
ye here what he says / I am he that has suffered and have cause to plain /
and he will have good of me / he thanketh not me of the kyndnes that I did to
him he put his heed in my mouth / and I suffered him to draw it out hole
without hurtyng / And he did to me also harm / And if any hier should have a
reward it should be I by right / Thus the unkind men now adays reward them
that do them good ^ when the false and subtyl arise and become great / then
goth worship and prouffyt al to n^ught / There ben many of right that ought
reward and do good to such as have helped hem in her need / that now find
causes and say they be hurt and would have amendis / where they ought to
reward and make amends them self / Therefore i^ (...) said and trowthe it is /
whoo that will chyde or chasty^t / see that he be clear him self.

all this and much more than I now can well remember was made and wrought in
this glass / The master that ordained it / was aconnyng man and a profounde
clerk in many sciencis / And by cause thise Jewels were over good and precious
for me to keep and have / Therefore I sent them to my dear lord the king and
to the queen in present / Where ben they now that give to their lords such
presents / The sorrow that my (...) children made when I sent away the glass
was great for they were woned to look therein and see them self how their
clothyng and array bycam them on their bodies / O alas I knew not that kywart
the hare was so nyghe his death when I delyueryd him the male with thise
iewellis / I wiste not to whom I might better hane taken them. though It should
have cost me my life. than him and bellart the ram / They were two of my best
frendis / Out alas I cry upon the murder^r / I shall know who it was. though
I should run through all the world to seek him. ffor murdre abides not hyd. it
shall come out perauenture he is in this company that knows where kywart is
bicomen. though he tells it not. ffor many false shrewys walk with good men.
fro whom noman can keep hym^ they known their craft so well and can well couere
their falsenes. but the most wondre that I have is that my lord the king hier
says so felly. that my fadre nor I did him never good / that thinks me
meruayl of a king / but there come so many thyngis to fore him that he
forgeteth that one with that other / and so faryth by me / Dear lord remember
not ye when my lord your fadre lyuyd / and ye an yonglyng of two year were that
my fadre came fro skole fro Menpellier / where as he had five year studied in
receptes of medycynes / he knew all the tokenes of the vryne as well as his
hand / And also all the herbs and nature of them which were viscose or
laxatyf / he was a synguler master in that science / he might well were cloth
of sylke and a gylt gyrdle / when he came to court he fond the king in a great
sekenes whereof he was sorry in his heart / For he louyd him above all other
lords / The king would not forgoo him ^ ffor when he came all other had leave
to walk where they would he trusted none so much as him / he said reynard I am
seek and feel me the longer the werse / My fadre said / my dear lord here is an
vrynal / make your water therein and as soon as I may see it I shall tell what
sekenes it is and also how ye shall be helped / the king did as he co^seilled
him for he trusted noman better that lyuyd / Though so were that my fader did
not as he should have d^n to you / But that was by counseyl of evil and foul
beesti^ (...) had wonder thereof / but it was a rasyng against (...) he said my
lord if ye will he hole / Ye must (...) of a wulf of vij year old / that may ye
not l^ue or ellis ye shall deye / for your vryne shows it plainly / the wulf
stood there by and said naught / But the king said to him sir ysegrym now ye
here well that I must have your liver / if I will be hool / Tho answered the wulf
and said / Nay my lord not so / I wot well I am not yet five year old / I
have herd my mother say so / My fadre said / what skylleth his words / late
him be opened and I shall know by the liver if it be good for you or not / And
th^rwyth the wulf was had to kychen / and his liver taken out / which the
king ete and was anon al hole of all his sekenes / th^nne thanketh he my
fadre much / and commanded all his household upon their lyuys that after that
time they should call him master reynard

hE abode stylle by the king and was byleuid of all thyngis / and must
allewey go by his side / And the king gaf to ^hym a garlond of rooses. Which
he must always were on his heed. but now this is al torned^ All the old good
things that he did. ben forgeten* And thise couetouse and ravenous shrewys
ben taken up and set on the hye benche and ben herd and made great. And the
wise folk ben put a back. by which thise lords often lack. And cause them to
be in much trouble and sorrow ffor when a covetous man of low birth is made
a lord and is much greet and above his neighbors has power and might /
Then he knows not him self / ne whens he is comen And has no pity on
nomans / hurt. ne hereth nomans request. but if he may have great yeftis. al
his intent and desire is to gadre good and to be gretter. O how many covetous
men ben now in lords courts. they flatre and smeke / and plese the prince for
their synguler auayl / But and the prince had need of them or their good they
should ^ather suffer him to deye or fare right hard er they would give or lene
him / They be like the wulf / that had lever the king had deyed than he would
give him his liver / Yet had I lever er that the king or the queen should fare
amys / that xx such wulues should lose their lives / hit were also the leest
loss / My lord all this bifelle in your yongthe that my fader did thus / I
trow ye have forgoten it / And also I have my self don you reverence worship
and courtosye / Vnroused be it / thaugh ye now thank me but lytyl / but
parauenture ye remembered not that I shall now say not to any for wyttyng of you
for ye be worthy all worship and reverence that any man can do / that have ye
of almighty god by enheritaunce of your noble progenytours / wherefore I your
humble subgette and servant am bounden to do to you all the seruyse that I
can or may / I came on a time walkyng with the wulfe Isegrym / And we had
gotten under us both a swyne / And for his loud cryyng we bote him to death /
and sire ye came fro far out of a grove against us. ye salewed us frendl^ and
said we were welcome. and that ye and my lady the queen which came after you
had great hongre. and had nothing for to ete / and prayed us for to give you
part of our wynnyng / Isegrym spack so soft that a man uneath might here
him. but I spack out and said. ye my lord with a good will. though it were
more we will well that ye have part And then the wulf departed as he was wont
to do / he departed and took that on half for him self / And he gaf you a
quarter / ffor you and for the queen / That other quarter he ete and bote as
hastily as he might / because he would ete it allone / And he gaf to me but
half the longes that I pray god that evil mote he fare.

tHus shewde he his conditions and nature / er men should have songen a Credo ye
my lord had eten your part / And yet would ye fayn have had more / ffor ye were
not full / And because he gaf you no more ne profred you / Ye lift up your right
foot and smote him between the eris that ye ta^e his skin over his eyes / and
tho he might no lengre abide but he bledde / howled and ran away and left his
part there lie / Tho said ye to him haste you again hither and bring to us
more / And here after see better to how ye dele and part / Then said I my
lord if it plese you I will goo with him / I wot well what ye said / I went
with him / he bledde / and groned as sore as he was al softly / he durst not
cry loud / we went so far. that we brought a calf / And when ye saw us
come therwyth. ye lawhyd for ye were well plesyd / ye said to me that I was
swyft in hontyng^ I see well that ye can find well when ye take it upon you / ye
be good to send forth in a need / The calf is good and fat. hereof shall ye be
the delar I said my lord with a good will / The one half my lord shall be for
you. And that other half for my lady the queen. the moghettis. Liver longes and
the Inward shall be for your c^yldr^n / the heed shall Isegrym the wulf have /
and I will have the feet^ Tho said ye Reynart who has taught yo^ to (...) so

good thing have I don for you / that I cowde well tell if it were not to long /
of which now ye remember litil by the words that I her of you. if ye would al

the king said Reynart ye say resonably I know not of Kywarts death more than
that bellyn the Ram brought his heed hither In the male / thereof I let you
goo quyte^ ffor I have no wytnes thereof / My dear lord said god thank you /
sykerly ye do well for his death makes me so sorrowful / that me thinks my
heart will break in two / o when they d^parted fro me mine heart was so heavy /
that me thought I should have swowned / I wot well it was a token of the loss
that tho was so nyghe coming to me / all the most part of them that were
there and herd the foxes words of the Iewellis and how he made* his
contenance and stratchid him / had verily supposed that it had not be feigned
but that it had be tryewe. they were sorry of his loss and mysauenture. and
also of his sorowe^ The king and the queen had both pity of him. And bad him
to make not to much sorrow / But that he should endeuore him to feche hem. For
he had so much preysed hem. that they had great will and desire to have them /
And by cause he had made them to understand that he had sent these Iewellis
to them. though they never had them yet they tha^kyd him. And prayed him to
hel^pe that they might have them.

tHe fox understood their m^nyng well. he thought toward them but lytyl good
for al that^ he said god thank you my lord and my lady that ye so friendly
comfort me in my sorrow. I shall not rest night ne day ne all^ they that will
do any thing for me but Run and pray / Thretene and ask all the four
corners of the wolrd / Thaugh I should ever seche till that I know where they
ben bicomen / and I pray you my lord the king / That if they were in such
place as I cowde not get them by prayer / by might ne by request that ye would
assiste me and abide by me / ffor it towcheth your self / and the good is
youris / And also it is your part to do Iustyse on theft and murdre which
both ben in this caas / Reynart said the king that shall I not leave when ye
know where they ben / Mine help shall be always ready for you / O dear lord this
is to much presented to me / if I had power and might I shield deserve against
you / Now has the fox his matter fast and fair / ffor he has the king in his
hand as he would / him thought that he was in better caas than it was like to
have be / he has made so many lesynges / that he may goo freely where he will
without complaynyng of any of them all / Sauf of Isegrym which was to hymward
angry and dysplesyd and said / O noble king ar ye so much chyldyssh that ye
believe this false and subtyl shrewe / and suffer your self with false lies thus
to be deceyuyd / Of faith it should be long or I should believe him / he is in
murdre and treson al be wrapped / And he mocketh you to sore your visage / I
shall tell him a another tale I am glad that I see now him here / al his
lesynges shall not a vaylle him ^r he depart fro me.

How ysegrym the wulf complained again on the fox. capitulo xxxiijo
mY lord I pray you to take heed / this false thief betrayed my wife ones foul
and dishonestly / hit was so that in a wynters day that they went to gyder
through a great water / and be bare / my wife an hand that he would teache her
take fysshe with her tail / and that she should late it hang in the water a
good while and there should so much fysshe cleue on it that four of them should
not conne ete it. The fool my wife supposed he had said truth / And she went
in the mire to the belly to er she came in to the water / And when she was in the
deppest of the water. he bad her hold her tail stylle. til that the f^sshe
were comen. she held her tail so long that it was frorn hard in the yse and
could not pluck it out. And when he saw that. he sprange up after on her
body. Alas there rauysshyd he and forcyd my wife so knauisshly that I am ashamed
to tell it. she could not defend her self the sely beest^ she stood so deep
in the mire. hereof he can not say naye^ ffor I fond him with the deed. for as
I went above upon the bank I saw him bynethe upon my wife shouyng and stekyng
as men do when they do such work and play. Alas what pain suffered I tho
at my h^^te I had almost for sorrow lost my five wits and cryde as loud as I
might reynart what do ye there / and when he saw me so nyghe tho leep he of.
and went his way. I went to her in a great heuinesse. And went deep in that
mire and that water er I could b^cke the yse and much pain suffered she er she
could have out her taylle / and yet left a gobet of her tail behynd her / And
we were like both thereby to have lost our lives / for she galped and cryde so
loud for the smarte that she had er she came out / that the men of the village
came out with scauys and byllis / with flaylis and pykforkes / And the wives
with their distauis / and cried dyspytously slesle / and smite down right / I
was never in my life so a feed / ffor uneath we escape / we ran so fast that
we swette there was a vylayne that stake on us with a pyke / which hurted us
sore he was strong and swyfte a foot / had it not be night / Certainly we
had been slain / The foul old queen's would fayn have beten us / they said that
we had byten their sheep / They cursed us with many a curse / Tho came we in to
a field sul of brom and brembles there hid we us fro the vylaynes / And they
durst not follow us ferther by night / but returned home again See my lord
this foul matter / this is murdre / rape / and treson / which ye ought to do
Justice thereon sharply.

rEynard answered and said / if this were true / it should go to nyghe mine
honor and worship / god forbede that it should be found true / hit is well
true that I taught her how she hold in a place ca^che fysshe / and shewde her
a good way for to goo over in to the water without going in to the mire / But
she ran so desyrously when she herd me name the fyssh / That she nether way
no path held / But went in to the yse wherein she was forfrorn / And that was
by cause she abode to long she had fissh enough if she could have be plesyd
with mesure it fall thofte / who that would have all / leseth all / Over
covetous was never good / For the beast can not be satisfied / And when I saw
her in the yse so fast / I wend to have helped her / and heef and shoef and
stack here and there to have brought her out / But it was al pain lost / ffor
she was to heavy for me / Tho came ysegrym and saw how I shoef and stack and
^yde al my best and he as a foul chorle^ foul and rybadously sklaundryth me
with her. as these foul unthrifts ben wont to doo^ But my dear lord it was
none otherwise. he belyeth me falsely parauenture his eyes daselyd as he looked
from above down. he cryde and cursed me and swore many an oath I should dear abye
it / when I herd him so curse and thretene / I went my way / and let him
curse and menace til he was weary / And tho went he and heef and shoef and
halpe his wife out / and then he leep and ran and she also for to get them an
hete and to warm them or ell^s they should have deyed for cold / And what
someuer I have said a fore or after / that is clearly al truth / I would not
for a thousand mark of fyn gold lyeto you one lesyng it were not syttyng for
me / what someuer fall of me I shall say the truth / like as mine elders have
always don / sith the time that we first understood reason and if ye be in doubt
of any thing that I have said other ^ wise than troth / give me respyte of vin
days that I may have cou^seyl / and I shall being such Informacion with good
tryew and suffycient record / that ye shall all your life during trust and
believe me / and so shall all your counseyl also / what have I to do with the
wulf hi^ is to fore clerly ynowh shewde that he is a foul vylay^nous kaytyf /
and an unclean be / When he deled and departed the swyn / So is it now
known to you all by his owen words that is a deffamer of wymmen as much as
in him is ye may well mark euerychone / Who should lust to do that game to one
so steadfast a wife being inso great peril of death now ask ye his wife / if it
be so as he says / if she will say the troth I wot well / she shall say as I
do / Tho spack erswynde the wulfis wife / Ach fell reynart / noman can keep
him self fro the / thou can so well vttre thy words and thy falsenes and
treson set forth / but it shall be evil rewarded in the end / How broughtest
thou me ones in to the well where the two bokettys henge by one cord rennyng
through one polley which went one up and another down / thou sattest in that
one boket bynethe in the pytte in great dread / I came theder and herd the
syghe and make sorrow / And axed the how thou came there / thou saidest that
thou had there so many good fysshes eten out of the water that thy belly
would breast / I said tell me how I shall come to the / Then saidest thou
aunte spring in to that boket that hangs there / and ye shall come anon to me
/ I did so / and I went dounward / and ye came upward tho was I all angry /
thou saidest thus fares the world that one goth up / and another goth down /
tho sprang ye forth and went your way and I abode there allone syttyng an
hole day sore an hongryd and a cold / And thereto had I many a stroke er I
could get thens / Aunte said the fox / thaugh the strokes did you harm I
had lever ye had them than I / ffor ye may better bear them / for one / of us
must needs have had them / I taught you good / will ye understand it and think
on it / that ye another time take better head and bileue noman over hastily /
is he friend or cosyn / for every man seeks his own prouffyt / They be now
fools that do not so / And specially when they be in Ieopardye of their lives.

A fair parable of the fox and the wulf^ Cao xxxiiijo
mY lord said dame Erswyn I pray you here how he can blow with all wyndes /
And how fair brings he his matters forth / Thus has he brought me many time
in scathe and hurt said the wulf / he has ones bytrayed me to the she ape mine
aunte / where I was in great dread and fere / for I left there almost mine one
ere / ^f the fox will tell it how it byfel / I will give him the for dele
thereof / for I can not tell it so well / but he shall beryspe me / well said the
fox I shall tell it without stameryng I shall say the troth / I pray you
harken me / he came in to the wode and complained to me / that he had great
hongre ffor I saw him never so full / but he would always have had fayn more / I
have wonder where the mete becomes that (...) destroys / I see now on his
contenance that he begins to grymme for hongre / When I herd him so
complain I had pity of him / And I said I was also hongry then went we
half a day to gydre and fond nothing / tho whyned he and cryted / and said he
might goo no f^rther Then espied I a great hool standing in the myddys under
an hawe which was thyck of brembles / and I herd a russhyng therein I wist not
what it was / then said I goo therein and look if there be any thing there for
us / I wot well there is somewhat / tho said he cosyn I would not cr^pe in to
that hole for twenty pound but I wist first what is therein / me thinks that
there is some perylous thing but I shall abide here under this tree / if ye will
goo therein to fore / but come anon again / And late me wete what thing is
therein / Ye can many a subtylte and can well help your self and much better
than I / See my lord the king / Thus he made me pour wight to goo to fore in
to the danger / and he which is great long and strong abode without and
rested him in pees / awayte if I did not for him there.

i would not suffer the dread and fere that I there suffered for all the good in
earth / but if I wyste how to escape / I went hardyly in / I fond the way
derke / long and brood / Er I right in the hool came so espied I a great light
which came in fro that one side there lay in a great ape with tweyne great wide
eyes / and they glymmed as a fire / And she had a great mouth with long teeth
and sharp naylles on his feet and on her hands / I wend hi^ had be a mermoyse
/ a baubyn or a mercatte / for I saw never fowler be / and by her lay three
of her children which were right foul ffor they were right like the mother /
when they saw me come / they gapeden wide on me and were al stylle / I was
aferd / And would well I had been thens / but I thought I am therein / I must
there through and come out as well as I may / as I saw her me thought she seemed
more than ysegrym the wulf / And her children were more than I / I saw never a
fowler meyne / they lay on foul heye which was al be pyssed / They were
byslabbed and byclagged to their eres to in her owen donge / hit stanke that I
was almost smoldred thereof I durst not say but good / and then I said /
Aunte good give you god day and all my cosyns your fair children / they be of
their age the fairest that ever I saw O lord god how well plese they me / how
lovely / how fair ben they each of them for their beauty might be a great
kyngis sone / Of right we ought to thank you / that ye thus ener^^e our
lygnage / Dear aunte when I herd say that ye were delyuerd and leyd down I
could no longer abide but must come and friendly vysite you / I am sorry that I
had not erst known it / Reynard cosyn said she ye be welcome / ffor that ye
have found me and thus come see me I thank you / Dear cosyn ye be right true

I herd thise words / this deseruyd I at the beginning when I called her aunte
/ how be it that she was nothing sybbe to me / ffor my right aunte is dame
ruk^nawe that yonder stands / Which is woned to bring forth wise children /
I said aunte my life and my good is at your commandment / and what I may do
for you by night and by day / I will gladly teache them all that I can. I
would fayn have be thens for the stenche of them. and also I had pity of the
great longre that Isegrym had / I said aunte I shall committee you and your fair
children to god and take my leave / My wife shall think long after me / Dear
cosyn said she ye shall not depart til ye have eten / for if ye did I would
say ye were not kind / Tho stood she up and brought me in an other hool where
as was much mete of hertes and hyndes / was / fesaunts / partryche and much
other venyson that I wondered for whens all this mete might come / And when I had
eten my belly full she gaf me a great piece of an hynde fro to ete with my wife amd
with my household / when I come home / I was a shamed to take it / But I might
none other wise do / I thankyd her and took my leave / she bad me I should come
sone again / I said I would / And so departed thens meryly / that I so well had
spedde / I hasted me out / and when I came and saw ysegrym which lay gronyng.
And I axed him how he ferde / he said neuew al euyll^ ffor it is wonder that I
line / bring ye any mete to ete I deye for honger. tho had I compassion of him
and gaf him that I had. And saved him there his lyf^ whereof then he thanked
me greatly. how be it that he now owes me evil will.

hE had eten this up anon. tho said he Reynard dear cosyn what fond ye in that
hool. I am more hongry now than I was to fore. my teeth ben now sharped to ete.
I said then. Eme haste you then lightly in to that hool. Ye shall find
there enough. there lies mine aunte with her chyldren^ if ye will spare the
troth and lie great lesynges / ye shall have there al your desire / But and ye
say troth / ye shall take harm / My lord was not this enough said and warned
/ who so would understand it / that all that he fond he should say the
contrary But rude and plompe beestis can not understand wysedom / therefore
hate they all subtyl Inuencions / ffor they can not conceive them. Yet
nevertheless / he said he would goo Inn / and lie so many lesyngis er he
should myshappe that all man should have wondre of it. and so went forth in to
that foul stynkyng hool. and fond the marmosette. She was like the deuyls
daughter. and on her children hynge much fylth cloterd in gobettis. Tho cryde
he alas me growleth of these foul nyckers / Come they out of hell. men may

said hier is no mere / he said here is enough. And there with he sterte with
his head toward the mete. and would have goon in to the ^oool where the mete
was. But mine aunte sterte up with her children. and run to him with their
sharp long nails so sor^ that the blood ran over his eyes / I heed him cry
sore and howl / but I know of no defense that he made / but that he ran fast
out of the hool / And he was there cratched and byten / and many an hool had
they made in his cote and skyn / his visage was all on a blood / and almost he
had lost his one ere / he groned and complained to me sore / then asked I
him if he had well lied he said I said like as I saw and fond / and that was
a foul bytche with many foul wyghtis / Nay eme said I / ye should have said /
Fair nece how fare ye and your fair children which ben my welbelouid cosyns /
the wulf said / I had lever that they were hanged er I that said / ye eme

tHe she ape said to the fox / Reyner neuew / See that ye take heed in your
battle / be cold and wise Your eme taught me ones a prayer that is of much
virtue to him that shall fight / And a great master and a wise clerk. and was
abbot of boudelo that taughted him / he said who that said devoutly this
prayer fasting shall not that day be ouercomen in batayl ne in fyghting therefore
dear neuew be not aferd / I shall read it over you to morrow / then may ye be
sure enough of the wulf hit is betire to fight / than to have the neck
asondre / I thank you dear aunte said the fox / The quarrel that I have is
rightful therefore I hope I shalspede well / and that shall gretely be mine help
/ All his lygnage abode by hymal the night / and help him to drive a way the
time / Same rukenawe the she ape his aunte thought always on his prouffyt and
fordele / And she did all his hee^ fro the heed to the tail be shorn of
smothe / and she anointed all his body with oil of olyue / And then was his
body also glat and slyper / that the wulf should have none hold on him / And
he was round and fat also on his body / And she said to him dear cosyn ye
must now drink much / that to morrow ye may the better make your vein / but
ye shall hold it in till ye come to the field / And when need is and time / so
shall ye pysse full your rowhe tayll / and smite the wulf therwyth in his be^de /
And if ye might hytte him therwyth in his eyes then shall ye byneme him his
sight / that should much hyndre him / but ellis hold always your tail fast
between your legs that he catch you not thereby / and hold down your eris
lyeng plat after your heed / that he h^lde you not thereby / And see wisely to
your self / and at beginning flee fro his strokes. And late him spring and
run after you / and run to fore where as most dust is / and styre it with
your feet that it may flee in his eyes and that shall much hyndre his sight /
And while he rubbeth his eyes take your auantage and smite and byte him there
as ye may most hurt him / And alleway to hytte him with your tayll full of
pysse in his visage and that shall make him so woo / that he shall not wit where
he is / And late him run after you for to make him weary / Yet his feet ben
sore / of that ye made him to lose his shoes / and though he be greet / he
has no heart / Nouew certainly this is my counseyll.

tHe connyng goth to fore strenghte / therefore see for your self / And set
your self wisely at defense / that ye and we all may have worship thereof / I

such good / I can never deserve it fully again / me thinks there may no
thing hurt me sith that ye have said these holy words over me / Tho went he
and leyd him down under a tree in the grass and slepte till the son was risen

When the king saw reynart thus shorn and oyled he said to him / Ey fox how
well can ye see for your self / he wondered thereof he was foul to look on / but
the fox said not one word but kneled down low to the^ the unto the king and
to the queen and stryked him forth in to the field / The wulf was there ready and
spack many a proud word / the rulers and kepars of the field was the lupaert
and the loss / they brought forth the book / on which swear the wulf that
the fox was a traitor and a m^rderar / and none might be falser than he was /
and that he would preue on his body and make it good / Reynart the fox swear

his body / When this was don the governors of the field / bad them do their
deuoyr / Then romed they all the field sauf dame rukenawe the she ape / she
abode by the fox and bad him rememb^^ well the words that she had said to him

How ^he fox and the wulf foughten to gydre cao xxxixo
tHerwyth she went out of the field and let them tweyne goo to gydre / the
wulf trade forth to the fox in great wrath and opened his sore feet / and
supposed to have taken the fox in hem / But the fox sprang fro him lightly /
For he was lyghter to foot than he / The wulf sprange after and hunted the fox
sore / their friends stood / without the lystes and looked upon hem / The wulf
strode wyder than reynard did and often ouertoke him / And lift up his foot
and wend to have smyten him / but the fox saw to / and smote him with his
rowhe tail / Which he had al be pyssed in his visage / tho wend the wulf to
have been plat blind / the pysse sterte in his eyes / then must he rest for
to make elene his eyes / Reyner thougthe on his fordele and stood above the
wind skrabbing and casting with his feet the duste that it flewe the wulfis
eyes full / the wulf was sore blinded therwyth / in such wise that he must
leave the rennyng after him / ffor the sonde and pysse cleuyd under his eyes
that it smerted so sore / that he must rub and wasshe it a way / Tho came
reyner in a great anger and bote him three great wounds on his heed with his
teeth / and said / what is that sir wulf / has one there byten you / how is it
with you / I will al otherwise on you yet / abide I shall bring you some new
thing / ye have stole many a la^be and destroyed many a simple be / and now
falsely have appeled me and brought me in this trouble / all this shall I now
aue^ge on the / I am chosen to reward the forthyn old sins ffor good will no
longer suffer the in thy great rauayn and shrewones I shall now assoylle the and
that shall be good for thy soul take patiently this penannce / for thou shall
live no longer / the hell shall be thy purgatory / Thy life is now in my mercy
/ but and if thou will knele down and ask me forgyfnes / and knowleche the to
be oue^^omen / yet though thou be evil / yet I will spare the / for my
conscience counseylleth me / I should not gladly slay no man / Isegrym wend
with these mockyng and spytous words to have goon out of his wit / And that
dered him so much that he wyste not what to say buff ne baff / he was so
angry in his heart / The wounds that reynart had given him bledde and sm^^ted
sore / And he thought how h^ might best avenge it

With great anger he lift up his foot and smote the fox on the heed so great a
str^ke / that he f^^ to the ground / tho sterte the wulf to and wend to have
take him / but the fox was light and wyly and roose lightly v^ and met with
him fiersly / and there began a fell battle* which dured long / the wulf
had great spyte on the fox as it well seemed / he sprange after him x times each
after other / and would fayn have had him fast / but his sk^n was so slyper and
fat of the oil that always he escaped fro him O so subtyl and snelle was the
fox / that many times when the wulf wend well to be sure of him / he sterte
then between his legs and under his belly and then turned he again and gaf
the wulf a stroke with his tail full of pysse in his eyes that Isegrym wend he
should have lost his ^ght / and this did he often times / And alwey when he
had so smyten him then would he goo above the wind and reyse the duste / that
it made his eyes full of stufs / Isegrym was woo begone / and thought he was at
an afterdele / yet was his strength and might much more than the foxes /
Reynard had many a sore stroke of him when he raught him / They gaf each other
many a stroke and many a byte when they saw their advantage / And each of hem
did his best to destroy that other / I would I might see such abataylle /
that one was wyly / and that other was strong / that one faught with strength
/ and that other with subtylte.

tHe wulf was angry that the fox endured so long against him if his formest
feet had been hole / the fox had not endured so long / but the sores were so
open that he might not well run / And the fox might better of and on than he
/ And also he swange his tail with pysse often under his eyes / and made him
that him thougthe that his eyes should goo out / At last he said to him self
/ I will make an end of this bataylle / How long shall this caytyf dure thus
against me / I am so great / I should if I lay upon him press him to death / hit
is to me agrete shame that I spare him so long / Men shall much and point me
with fyngres to my shame and rebuke for I am yet on the werst side / I am sore
wounded / I blede sore / and he drowneth me / with his pysse / and cast so
much dust and sand in mine eyes / that hastily I shall not conne see / if I
suffer him any longer / I will set it in adventure / and seen what shall come
thereof / with that he smote with his foot reynard on the heed that he fill down
to the ground And er he cowde arise he caught him in his feet^ and lay upon
him as he would have pressed him to death. Tho began the fox to be a ferd. and
so were all his frendis when they saw him lie vnder^ And on that other side
all ysegryms friends were ioyeful and glad. The fox defended him fast with
his claws as he lay upward with his feet^ And gaf him many a clope^ The wulf
durst not with his feet do him much harm but with his teeth snatched at him
as he would have byte^ him. when the fox saw that he should be byten and was in
great dread. he smote the wulf in the heed with his formest claws and tare the
skin of between his brows and his eeris. and that one of his eyes henge out.
Which did him much payne^ he howlyd. he wepte^ he cryde lewed. and made a
pyteuous noise / for the blood ran^ down as it had been a streme

How the fox being under the wulf^ with flateryng wordesg losed him. that the
fox came to his above again. capitulo xlo
tHe wulf wyped his eyes. the fox was glad when he saw that / he wrastled so
sore / that be sprang on his feet whiles he rubbed his eyes / the wulf was not
w^l plesyd therwyth all / And smote after him or he escaped and caught him in
his arms and held him fast / notwythstandyng that he bledde / Reynard was
woo then / There wrastled they long and sore / The wulf wexe so angry that
he forgot al his smarte and pain and threw the fox al plat under him / which
came him evil to pass / ffor his one hand by which he deffended him sterte in
the falling in to ysegryms throat / and then was he aferd to lose his hand /
The wulf said tho to the fox / Now chese whether ye will yield you as overcome
/ or ellis I shall certainly slay you / the skateryng of the dust thy pysse /
thy mockyng ne thy deffence / ne all thy false wylys / may not now help the /
thou may not escape me / Thou have here to fore don me so much harm and
shame / and now I have lost mine one eye / and thereto sore woundeed / When
reynard herd that it stood so rowme / that he should chese to knowleche him
ouercomen and yield him / Or ellis to take the death / he thought the choys was
worth ten mark / And that he must say that one or that other / he had anon
concluded what he would say / and began to say to him with fair words in this
wife / Dear eme I will gladly become your man with all my good / And I will goo
for you to the holy grave / and shall get pardon and wynnyng for your cloistre
/ of all the chyrches that been in the holy land / Which shall much prouffyte
to your soul and your elders sowles also / I trow there was never such a
prouffre / prouffred to any king / And I shall serve you / like as I should
serve our holy fader the p^pe / I shall hold of you all that I have and ever ben
your servant and forth I shall make that al my lignage shall do in likewise /
Then shall ye be a lord a boue all lords / who should then dare do any
thing against you / And furthermore what someuer I take of polaylle / ghees /
partrych or plouyer / fysshe or flesh or what someuer it be / thereof shall ye
first have the choys / and your wife and your children / er any come in my body
/ Thereto I will always abide by you / that where ye be there shall no hurt ne
scathe come to you / ye be strong and I am wyly / late us abide to gydre / that
one with the counseyl and that other with the deed / then may there nothing
mysfalle to us ward / and we ben so nygh of kynne each to other / that of right
should be no anger between us / I would not have foughten against you if I might
have escaped / But ye appeled me first unto fight / Tho must I do / that I
not do would gladly / And in this bataylle I have been curtoys to you / I have
not yet shewde the vtterist of my might on you / like as I would have done if ye
had been a stranger to me / ffor the neuew ought to spare the eme / it is good
reason and it ought so to be / Dear eme so have I now do / And that may ye
mark well when I ran to fore you. mine heart would not consent thereto. ffor I
might have hurt you much more than I did. but I thought it never ffor I have
not hurt you ne don you so much harm that may hyndre yow^ sauf only that
mysha^^e that is fallen on your eye / ach therefore I am sorry and suffer much
sorrow in my heart. I would well dear Eme that it had not happed you. But that it
had fallen on me. so that ye therwyth had been plesyd. how be it. that ye shall
have thereby a great advantage. For when ye here after shall sleep ye need not to
shette but one wyndowe. where another must shette two. My wife and my chilren.
and my lignage shall fall doun^ to your feet / to fore the king and to fore
all them that ye will desire and pray you humbly / that ye will suffer reynart
your neuew live and also I shall knoweleche often to have tpespaced against you /
and what lesynges I have lied upon you / How might any lord have more honor
than I proffre you / I would for no good do this to another / therefore I pray
you to be plesyd here with al

i Wot well if ye would ye might now slay me / but and ye so don had / what had
ye won / so must ye ever after this time keep you fro my friends and lignage
/ Therefore he is wise that can in his anger / mesure him self and not be over
hasty / and to see well what may fall or hap afterward to him / what man that
in his anger can well advise him certainly he is wise / Men find many fools
that in hete hasten hem so much / that after they repent hem / and then it
this to late / but dear Eme I trow that ye be to wise so to do / hit is
better to have prys honor / rest / and pees / And many friends that be ready
to help him / than to have shame / hurt / vnreste / and also many enemies
lyeng in a wait to do / him harm / Also it is lityl worship to him that has
ouercomen aman / then to slay him / it is great shame / not for my life /
Thaugh I were deed / that were a ly^yll hurt.

iSegrym the wulf said / Ay / thief how fayn would thou be losed and
dyscharged fro me / that here I well by thy words / were thou now fro me on thy
free fect / Thou would not set by me an egg shelle / Though thou
promysedest to me all the world of fyn read / gold / I would not late the

take by chaf / I know well ynowh good corn / O how would thou mock me / ^f I
let the thus escape / thou myghtest well have said this to one that knew the
not / but to me thou losest thy flateryng and sweet floytyng / ffor I
understand to well thy subtyl lyeng talys / Thou have so often deceived me ^
that me behooves now to take good head of the. (...) false stynkyng knave thou
say that thou have spa^^d me in this batayl. look hetherward to me. is not

would not suffer me so long to (...) as to take ones my breeth. I were ever

confusion and shame as thou have don to me. and (...) also that touches me
most of all. that thou have diswor^shiped and sklaundred ^rswyn my wyf^ Whom I
love as well as my self. and falsely forsese and deceyuedes^ her. which shall
never out of my heart. ffor as often as it comes to mine mind / all mine anger
and hate that I have to the renews. In the mean will that ysegrym was thus
spekyng. The fox bithought him how ^e might help him self. And stack his
other hond after between his legs. And grepe the wulf fast by the colyons.
And he wrong hem so sore that for woo and pain / he must cry loud and
howl / Then the fox^ drew his other hond out of his mouth / The wulf had so
much pain and anguyssh of the sore wryngyng that the fox dowed and wrong
his genytours / that he spytte blood / And for great pain he byshote him self

How ysegrym the wulf was ouercomen and how the batayl was taken up and
fynysshid / And how the fox had the worship capitulo xljo
tHis pain did him more sorrow and woo / than his eye did that so sore bledde
/ and also it made him to overthrow all in a swowne ffor he had so much
bledde / and also the threstyng that he suffered in his colyons made him so
faint that he had lost his might / Then reynard the fox lepe upon him with
al his might / And caught him by the legs and drew him forth through the
field / that they all might see it / and he stack and smote him sore / Then
were ysegryms friends al full of sorrow / and went al weeping unto th^yr lord
the king / And prayde him that he would do sece the battle and take it up in
to his hands / The king granted it / and then went the kepars of the
field the lupaerd and the lossem and said to the fox and to the wulf / Our
lord the king will speak with you / and will that this batayl be ended / he will
take it in to his hand / he desires that ye will give your stryf unto him ffor
if any of you here were slain / it should be great shame on both sides / For ye
have as much worship of this field as ye may (...) the fox / All the beestis
give to you the pr^^ / that have seen this bataylle / The fox said thereof I
thank him / and what that shall plese my lord to command that shall no^ I
gaynsaye / I ^^sire no better / but to have won the field / late my friends
come hither to me / I will take advise of them what I shall do / They said /
that they thought it good / And also it was reason in weyghty matters a man should
take aduys of his friends / th^nne came dame slopecade / and grymbert the dasse
her husbond / dame rukenawe with her ij sust^rs / Byteluy^ and fulrompe her ij
sons and hatene^ her daughter / the flyndermow^ and the wezel / And there came
moo than xx / which would not have comen if the fox had lost the feeld^ So who
that wynneth and comes to his above. he geteth great loos and worship / And
who that is over throwen^ And has the werse. to him will no man gladly come.
There came also to the fox. the beuer. the otter and both their wives
panthecrote and ordegale. And the ^st^^le^ the Ma^tre the fychew^. the fyret.
the mowse. and the squyrel and many moo than I can namo. And all because he
had won the feeld. ye some came that to fore had complained on him and were
now of his next kynne. and they shewde him right friendly chier and contenance.
Thus fares the world now / who that is rich and hye on the wheel. he has
many kynnesmen and frendes^ that shall help to bear out his welthe. But who
that is nedy and in ^ayne or in pouerte. fyndeth but few friends and
kynnesmen^ ffor every man almost eshew^th his company and way. There was
then great feste they blewe up trompettis and pyped with shalmoyses / They
sayden all dear neuew blessed be god that ye have sped well / we were in great
dread and fere when we saw you lie under / reynart the fox thanked all them
friendly / and resceyued them with great Joy and gladness / Then he asked of
them what they couns^ylled him / if he should give the field unto the king or
no / Dame slopecade said / ye hardely cosyn / Ye may with worship well set
it in to his hands / And trust him well enough / Thoo went they all with the
kepars of the feelde unto the king / And Reynard the fox went to fore them
all / with trompes and pypes and much other mynstralcye / The fox kneled
down to fore the king / The king bad him stand up / and said to him /
reynard ye be now Ioyeful / ye have kept your day worshipfully / I discharge
you. and late you goo freely quyte where it plesyth you / And the debate between
you I hold it on me. And shall discuss it by reason and by counseyl of noble
men and will ordeyne thereof that ought be done by ^^son. at such time as
ysegrym shall be hool. And then I shall. send for you to come to me^ And
then by gods grace I shall give out the sentence and Iugement^

An ensample that the fox told to the king when he had won the field.
capitulo xlijo
mY worthy and dear lord the king. said the fox I am well a greed and paid
therwyth. But when I came first in to your court. there were many that were fell
and enuyous to me. Which never had hurt ne cause of scathe by me / but they
thought that they might best over me / And all they cryden with mine enemies
against me / and would fayn have destroyed me / by cause they thought that the
wulf was better withholden and gretter with you than I was which am your
humble ^ubget / They knew none other thing why ne wherefore / They thought not
as the wise be woned to do / that is what the end may happen / My lord these
ben like a great heep ofhou^ndes which I ones saw stand at a lords place
upon a donghil / where as they awayted that men should bring them mete /
Then saw they an hound come out of the kychen / and had taken there a fair
rybbe of beef or it was given him / And he ran fast away with all / but the
cook had espied or he went away / and took a gre^e bolle full of scaldyng
water / and cast it on his hy^pe^ behind / Whereof he thankyd nothing the cook
/ ffor (...) here behind was skalded of / And his skyn seemed as it had be
through soden / Nevertheless he escaped away / and kept that he had won / And
when his felaws the other hounds saw him come with this fair rybbe / They
called him all and said to him / O how good a friend is the cook to the /
Which has given to the so good a boon / Whereon his so much flessh / The
hound said ye know nothing thereof / Ye preyse me like as ye see me to fore
with the bone / But ye have not seen me behind / take heed and behold me
afterward en mine buttokkis / And then ye shall know how I have deseruyd it.

aNd when they had seen him behind on his hyppe^ how that his skin and his
flessh was al raw and through soden / tho growled them all and were aferd of
that syedyng water / and would not of his felawship / but fled and ran away
from him / and let him there allone / See my lord this right have these false
beestis / when they be made lords and may get their desire / and when they be
mighty and doubted / then ben they extorcionners and scatte and pylle the
people / and eten them like as they were forhongred hounds / These ben they
that ^ere the bone in her mouth / Noman dar have to do with hem but preyse
all that they bedryue / Noman dar say other wise / but such as shall plese
hem by cause they would not be shorn / and sum help them forth in their
vnryghtwys deeds by cause they would have part and lykke their fyngres / and
strength them in their evil life and werkis / O dear lord how lytyl seen they
that do thus after behind them what the end shall be at last they fall fro
hye to low in great shame and sorrow / and then their weerkis come to
knowleche and be open^ in such wise that noman has pity n^ compascon^ on them
/ in their meschief and trouble / and every man curse them and say evil by
them to their shame and vylanye / many of such have been blamed and shorn full
nyghe that they had no worshipe ne prouffyt / but lose their here as the heund
did. that is their friends. which have help them to couere their misdeeds
and extorco^ns. like as the here coueryth the skyn^ / And wehan they have sorrow
and shame for their old trespaces. then each body pluckyth his hand fro him.
And flee. like as the hounds did fro him that was scalded thyth the syedyng
water / and let him these extorcions in her sorrow and need /

mY dear l^rde king I beseech you to remember this example of me / it shall not
be against your worship ne wysedom / What wene ye how many ben there such false
extorcio^ners now in thise days / ye much werse than an hound / that bears
such a bone in his mouth / in towns / in great lords courts / which with
great facing and bracyng oppress the pour people with great wrong / and selle
their fredom and pryuelages / and bear them on hond of thyngis that they never
knew ne thought / And all for to get good for their synguler proffyt / God
give them all shame and soon destroy them who sum ^uer they be that so do
/ but god be thanked said the fox / there may noman endwyte me ne my lygnage ne
kynne of such werkys / but that we shall acquyte us / And comen in the light /
I am not a ferd of any that can say on me any thing that I have don otherwise
than a true man ought to do / Alleway the fox / shall a bide the fox though
all his enemies had sworn the contrary / My dear lord the king I love you
with my heart a boue all other lords / And never for noman would I torn fro
you / But abide by you to the wtterist how well it has been otherwise informed
your hyenes / I have neuerthetheles always do the best / and forth so will do
all my life that I can or may /

How the king forgaf the fox all thyngis / and made him souerayn and grettest
over al his lands. cao xlijjo
tHe king said Reynard ye be one of them that owes me homage^ which I will
that ye allway so do. And also I will that erly and late ye be of my
counseyl. and one of my Iustyses / See well to that ye not mysdoo / ne trespace
no more. I set you again in all your might and power. like as ye were to fore
and see that ye further all matters to the best righte^ For when ye set your
wit and counseyl to virtue and goodn^sse^ then may not our court be without
your advise and counseyl. ffor here is non that is like to you in sharp and hye
counseyll ne subtyller in fyndyng a remedy for a meschief. And think ye on
thexample that ye your self have told. And that ye haunte rightwysnes / and be
to ^e true. I will frohens forth work and do by your advise and counseyll.
he lives not that if he mysdede you. But I should sharply aduenge and wreke it
on him ye shall oueralle speak and say my words. And in all my land shall
ye be above all other sovereign and my bail. That Office I give you. ye may
well occupye it with worship / All reynardis frendis and lignage thanketh the
king heyly / The king said / I would do more ffor your sake / than ye wene /
I pray you all that ye remember him that he be true / Dame rukenawe then
said yes sykerly my lord / that shall he ever be / And think ye not the
contrary / for if he were otherwise / He were not of our kynne ne lignage And I
would ever myssake him / and would ever hyndre him to my power / Reynart the fox
thanked the king with fair curtoys words / And said / dear lord I am not
worthy to have the w^rship that ye do to me / I shall think thereon and be
true to you also long as I live / and shall give you as holsom counseyl as
shall be expedient to your good grace / here with he departed with his friends
fro the king / Now herke how Isegrym the wulf did / bruyn the bear / thybert
the catte / and erswynde and her children with their lignage drewen the wulf
out of the field / and leyde him upon a lyter of heye / and couerd him warm /
and looked to his wounds which were well.xxv^ and there came wise maistres and
surgyens Which bond them and we^she hem he was so seek and feeble / that he
had lost his feeling / But they rubbed and wryued him under his temples and
^yen / that he sprange out of his swoun^ / and cryde so loud that all they
were aferde / they had wend that he had been wood

but the maistres gaf him a drink / that comforted his heart and made him to
sleep / They comforted his wife / And told to her that there was no death wound
ne paryl of his life / Then the court brake up / and the beestis departed and
went to their places and homes that they came froo.

How the fox with his frendis and lignage departed nobly fro the king / and
went to his castle malleperduys / capitulo xliijo
rEynart the fox took his beue honestly of the king and of the queen. And
they bad him he should not tarry long. But shortly return to them agayn^ he
answered and said dear king and queen always at your commandment I shall be ready
/ if ye need any thing which god forbede I would always be ready with my body and
my good to help you / and also al my friends and lignage in like wise shall
obey your commandment and desire / ye have hyely deseruyd it / god quyte it
you and give you grace long to live / And I desire your licenc^ and leave to
goo home to my wife and children / And if your good grace will any thing / late
me have knowleche of it / And ye shall find me always ready / Thus departed the
fox with fair words fro the king. Now who that could set him in reynardis
craft / and could behave him in flateryng and lyeng as he did / he should I
trow be h^^de / both with the lords spyrytuel and temporel / The ^en many
and also the most part that crepe after his way and his hole / The name that
was given to him / abides always stylle with him / he has left many of his
craft in this world / Which allewaye wexe and become mighty / for who that
will not use reynardis craft now is naught worth in the world now in any estate
that is of might / But if he can crepe in reynardis net / and has been his
scoler / then may he dwell with us / For then knows he well the way how
he may arise / And is set up above of every man / There is in the world much
seed left of the fox / which now oueral grows and comes sore up / though
they have no read berdes / Yet there ben founden mo foxes now / than ever were
here to fore / The rightwys people ben al lost / truth and rightwysnes ben
exyled and fordriuen / And for them ben abyden with us couetyse / falshede /
hate and envy / These regne now much in every contre / For is it in the popes
court / the emperors / the kings dukes or any other lords where someuer it
be each man labors to put other out fro his worship / office and power / for
to make him sylf to clymme hye with lies / with flateryng with symonye / with
money / or with strength and force / there is none thing byloued ne known in
the court now adays but money / the money is better byloued than god / For men
do much more therefore / ffor who someuer brings money / shall be well
receyuyd and shall have all his desire / is it of lords or of ladies or any
other / that money does much harm / Money brings many in sham^ and dread of
his life / and brings false wytnes against true people for to get money. Hit
causes uncleanness of living. lyeng. and lecherye. Now clerks goon to rome / to
patys and to many another place. for to learn reynardis crafte^ is he clerk /
is he lay man^ eueriche of them tredeth in the foxes path. and seeks his
hole. The world is of such condycion now. that eucey man seeks him self in
all matters. I wot not what end shall come to us hereof All wise men may
sorrow well herfore. I fere that for the great falsenes theft robberye and
murdee that is now used so much and commonly. and also the unshamefast lecherye
and auoultry bosted and blown a brood with the auau^tyng of the same. that
without gret^ repentance and penance therefore / that god will take vengeance
and punysshe us sore therefore / whom I humbly beseech and to whom nothing is
hyd that he will give us grace to make amends to him therefore / and that we
may rewle us to his playsyr / And her with will I leave ffor what have I to
write of thise mysdedis / I have ynowh to do with mine own self / And so it
were better that I held my pees and suffer / And the best that I can do for
to amend my self now in this time / And so I counseyle (...) man to do here
in this present life / and that shall (...) ^^ost our prouffyt / For after this
life / comes no time (...) w^ may occupye to our auantage for to amend us ffor
th^nn^ shall every man answer for him self and (...) his ^wen burden /
Reynardis friends and lignage (...) the nombre of ^l have taken also their leave
of the king / And w^nte all to gydre with the fox / which was right glad
that he had so well sped / And that he stood so (...) in the kings grace. he
thought. that he had no shame. but that he was so great with the king that he
might help and further his friends / and hyndre his enemies / and also to do
what he would. without he should be blamed if he would be wise /

The ffoo^ and his frendis went so long to gydre that they c^men to his burgh
to Maleperduys. there they all took leave each of other with fair and courtoys
words / Reynard did to them great reverence and thanked them all friendly. of
their good faith and also worship that they had don and showed to him. And
profred to each of them his seruyse if they had need with body and goods / And
herwyth they departed / and each of them went to their own howses / The fox
went to dame ermelyn his wife which welcomed him friendly he told to her and
to his children / all the wonder / that to him was befallen in the court / And
forgate not a word / but told to them every dele / how he had escaped /
Then were they glad that their fader was so enhaunsed and great with the
king / And the fox lived forthon with his wife and his children in great Joy
and gladness Now who that said to you of the ffoxe more or less than ye have
herd or red / I hold it for lesynge / but this that ye have herd or red / that
may ye believe well / and who that ^^leueth it not / is not therefore out of the
right believe / how be it there be many if that they had seen it / they should
have the less doubt of it / for there ben many things in the world which ben
byleuyd though they were never (...) there ben many fygures / plays fou^den /
that never were don ne happed / But for an example to the pe^le that th^^ may
there by the better / use and follow virtue and ^^^^shewe sin and vices / in
like wise may it be by this bo^ke / that who that will read this matter / though
it ^e of (...) and bourdes / yet he may find therein many a good wysedom and
lernynges / By which he may come to v^rtue and worship. There is no good man
blamed herin / hit is spoken generally / Late every man take his own part as
it belongs and behooves / and he that fyndeth him gylty in any dele or part
thereof / late him b^^tre and amend him And he that is verily good / I pray god
keep him therein And if any thing be said or wreton herin / that may grieve or
dysplease any man / ^lame not me / but the fox / for they be his words and
not mine / Prayeng all them that shall see this lytyl treatis / to correct and
amend / Where they shall find fault / For I have not added ne mynusshed but
have followed as nyghe as I can my copye which was in dutche / and by me willm
