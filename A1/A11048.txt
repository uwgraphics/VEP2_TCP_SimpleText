THE Courtiers Academie: Comprehending seven several days discourses: wherein
be discussed, seven noble and important arguments, worthy by all Gentlemen to
be perused.

1 Of Beauty. 2 Of Humane Love. 3 Of Honor. 4 Of Combat and single fight. 5
Of Nobility. 6 Of Riches. 7 Of precedence of Letters or Arms
Originally written in Italian by Count Haniball Romei, a Gentleman of Ferrara,
and translated into English by I. K.

L'occhio Linceo, ha l'intendimento cieco Printed by Valentine Sims.

To the Right Honorable and Chiualrous Knight, Sir Charles Blunt, Lord
Mountioy, Knight of the most honorable order of the Garter, and Captain of her
Majesty's Seafortresse, and town of Portsmouth, I. K. wishes the
accomplishment of all perfect honor and felicity.
I Think it no ways requisite (right Honorable) to prosecute that ouerworn
method of exaltation consisting in an unsavory inculcation of their honor
and praise, whose glory by the shrill Trumpet of Fame, in every corner
resounded by a blubbering and unpolished pen, is both extenuated, it offering
further no small offense, to the modesty of that Noble ear or eye which
vouchsafes either the hearing or perusing of the same. These worthy
discourses written by no unworthy Gentleman in Italian, grounded on the firm
foundations of Aristotelian, and Platonical discipline, and yet accompanied
with a lively touch and feeling of these times, I thought no less worthy to
be offered to the view and censure, of noble and courteous constructions.
Seeing some understand not Italian at all, others pretend, beyond their
knowledge, and those exquisite therein, do yet many times meet with such
ambiguities, as not willing to contend too laboriously in that, which they
only retain for an ornament, give no small impediment to the beneficial
impression, of the subject they read and meditate upon. And in that the first
Author supposes these discussions to have fallen out in the Court of Ferrara,
and in the noble assemblies of diverse Ladies and knights, covertly herein
expressing an excellent form of Court-like exercise: I have presumed to
entitle it, The Courtiers Academie. The only interpretation of them, may in a
man of my obscure humility be deemed a singular presumption, except your
honorable and gracious patronage both protect them, as also me their imperfect
translator. What defects soever in the same appear, proceeding either from my
self or others, may graciously be sheltred under the noble wings of your
woonted clemency, to whose Lo. of my first labors, I have ouer-presumptuously
offered dedication, no less vowing unto the same, the propagation of all my
future and faithful endeavors.

Your Lordships humble and thrice dutiful poor affectionate,

To the courteous and beneuolent Reader.
BEsides many defects, the which acknowledging in my self (courteous Reader)
crave thy benign and favorable construction, there may be also some
imperfections, which either coming short, of the singularity of these times,
or lightning on the view of malignant eyes, may, besides a general deprauation
for the most part incident to al men's labors, turn me further to some bitter,
and particular reprehension. Translation therefore in general by some vain
pretendants, in tongues, and languages, has bin thought altogether a thing,
not only unnecessary, but further prejudicial, the chiefest reason leading them
thereunto, being this, as I suppose, that knowledge being an ornament, most
befitting those noble or honorable, who command ignorance agreeing best with
the vulgar sort, who be subject and obey: it is therefore requisite (say they)
that high wisdom, and excellent works, should be concealed from common
sight, lest they through equal experience, and knowledge in things (according
to the ordinary condition thereof) puffed up, shake off likewise that humility
of spirit, which should comprehend them under the obedience of laws and
magistrates. Neither in my opinion, for some arguments in books discussed of,
do they greatly mistake, when this their opinion shall be grounded upon so
sound a consideration, rather then on a vain ostentation in, themselves whereby
they would willingly retain, some color of excellency, by reserving unto
themselves in a restrained tongue, that which peradventure therein they do not
absolutely understand, or which howsoever by publication, may be an occasion of
general document, and instruction to al men: To leave comparison of writers
and whether strangers or our selves have therein attained to greatest
excellency and judgment: observe the ciuilest amongst christen nations who
perceiving (no doubt) the instability of men in all arts and professions,
proceeding from the Chaos of opinions, grounded on the conceits of particular
men, thought good by this mean to reduce them to some reuiew of foundations and
therefore we seethem to have infinitely traveled in the translation of Plato
Aristotle Plutarch, and diverse other ancient writers into their vulgar tongues:
as they themselves when they writ, made choice of their own mother languages:
and we see daily that managed horses yield sooner to the bit of a disereet
rider, then rough, and vnsadled coltes: and people well instructed, know best
howsweet a thing it is to live under government.

In a grown storm of heavy misfortune, it was my hap, to put in with the
harbor of a worthy gentleman's house, where amongst sundry other relaxations
for a distressed mind, a multitude of good, and commendable writers in the best
languages was not the least, and coming to peruse these discourses, (although
of too high a tenor for my humble fortune) partly by persuasion, as likewise,
in that I could not call to mind any so important book, touching these
subjects in the English tongue, I attempted this homely, and unworthy
interpretation of them, wherein if I have presumed any thing, either above my
own conceit, or the good opinion of others, impute it to the special desire I
had, that al me^ honorable, either by birth, or instruction, might be partakers
of so necessary and excellent discussions, always craving pardon, of
whatsoever defacement they endure, by my imperfect and mother explication:
whatsoever Poesy you herein meet withal (as with some you shall) it being
rather accidental, then any ways by the noble author at the first intended,
you may the more graciously wink at my defects therein, as one, whom the
oppression of fortune has denied that serenity of mind, from whence (for the
most part) that pleasant fury has his deriuation, I have therefore contended,
only with bare rithming desinence void of all ornament, to express the meaning
of such poetical citations as the author uses, they being ordinarily alleged
out of Petrarch whose verse in my opinion, even in Italian, is rather weighty
or sententious than heroical. And therefore I remember I have seen some of the
same verses in this book cited, by a good approved Laureate translated into
English, the which, though they retained the pith and substance, of the first
author, yet (excepting always better judgments then my own) they came very
short of that lofty and abundant profluence, with which many of our modern
Poemes are accompanied: considering withal, how too labored a transformation of
words and sense, might have offered my first author capital injury, seeing he
sets them down but as authorities wherein matter, more then words is to
be required: No less doubt I also of reprehension, for some words I have
used beyond common use, propriety leading me thereto, rather then any
affectation which consists not in so tolerable and commendable liberty, but
rather in a frivolous accumulation of words unnecessarily produced in dilating
of any argument: yet if any may lay up in this our common treasury of language,
any choice ornaments, for the decorum and copy of our tongue. I know not who
may better then they, conversant in foreign writers, seeing besides a laudable
emulation of others abundance, even very necessity in explication, inuiteth
them thereunto: and therefore for want of better terms I have bin driven to
use some forged words, as spiritally, vertually, armiger, and other, which
otherwise I could not well tell how to have expressed. Another thing there is,
the meditation whereof makes my ears to glow, with an imaginatiue ouerhearing
of some bitter taxation: especially it consisting in that discourse, whereof
the least expectation will not be had: for in the mean this author sets
down for reducement of quarrels to peace, he has prescribed a certain form
of words, which no doubt to many will seem ridiculous, as, sauouring too much
of fear, and pusillanimitie, which severe censure notwithstanding in my
judgment, may deserve mittigation, if not in respect of the dangerous abuse
of arms in these times: at least yet in calling to mind, what in the former
discourses has bin enjoined every honorable man, upon the instant of receiving
an injury, to perform: the which once past, this voluntary, and kind accord,
is not to spring from themselves, but rather from some other, who shall offer
themselves to such virtuous solicitations, when it will be requisite (as he
himself says) to so good an end, to use al commendable fallation, and by
words of equivalent, and plausible signification to cover offenses, preventing
by this means so many lamentable effects, as too ordinarily ensue, upon
inueterate, and prosecuted quarrels: These be not al, but the principallest
occasions (as I suppose) which detraction in this my labor will take hold of:
the which notwithstanding courteous, and judicial understanders will so
graciously pass over, as that there is no doubt but for all this, they will find
themselves well satisfied by Patritio, in the explanation of true, essential,
and sensible Beauty in Humane Love by Guirino, in Honor, Combat, and
fighting for reputation by Gualinguo: in Nobility by Varano: in riches by
Taslone, and last of al, in that high and worthy controversy touching
precedence of Letters or Arms, after resolute conflict, beeween Patritio, and
Brancaccio noble champions for each party, the deep, and judicial doom of
gracious Madam de Sala, will determine herein al scruple, and attribute due
right, and desert: And therefore as this worthy circumstance of Justice,
shines like a bright beam in every noble, or liberal mind, so do I hope
also for my labor, to reap courteous and favorable construction, not only of
my own imperfections, but even of those also that necessarily depend on the
error of impression, and if my poor battered name light into the fatal hands
of malicious Impostors or odious scoffers: di buffoni mi beffo: and as it was
said of that miserable Iacobine: C'est l'enfer, que les a crees.

To be commanded. I. K.

The first days Discourse of Count Haniball Romei, a Gentleman of Ferrara.
In which the Ladies and Gentlemen reasoning together, do discuss, of Beauty.
THat most renowned Lord Don Alfonso d'Este, the second of this name, and
through our happy fortune, at this instant Duke of Ferrara, lives with so
great magnificence, that his highness court seems rather a kingly and Royal
Palace, then the court of a great Duke: for it is not only throughout
replenished with noble Lords and valiant Knights, but further, is a receptacle
for the most learned and gentle spirits, as likewise for men that in every
profession are most excellent. This Prince (out of question) in all his actions
very respective, tempereth so his affairs with leisure, and with so great
order measures and dispenses the time, that neither does he weaken himself
with the ouerburdensome meditation of matters serious, or languish and wear
away with the too great leuity of things delightsome and pleasant. And
therefore his highness has allotted to every season his proper and
particular entertainment, as to the Carniuale time or shrouetide, masking,
Iusts, Turuey, feasts, Comedies, music, and other such like contentments, the
which with such peace and tranquillity are embraced, as it is a wonder in that
time to behold the general exhilleration and Iubile of our City. In the
Spring time they hunt the Fox and sly their Faulcons in the great Barco,
which enuironeth the north quarter of the City, where in certain standing
waters and martish grounds, they find many wild ducks, for the flight of the
River. And there be certain houses called Sgarzare, wherein Herons be enclosed
and kept, being a most pleasant sight to behold his highness, when with his
court, he enters into that large Meadow, accompanied by the nobility of the
City, mounted on goodly horses, and followed by the most excellent Duchess,
with all the Ladies and Matrons of the noblest sort, riding in most sumptuous
Coaches: where after they have flowen at the river, they approach the Sgazare,
and let fly the Heron, who no sooner mounteth, but incontinently they cast off
the Faulcon, who makes after: and thus with singular solace they stand
beholding this battle in the air, made by these two most hot and cruel
fowls. Then in the ardent heat of summer, his highness with the famous
Duchess and the whole court, retire themselves to Belriguardo, being
questionless a royal Palace, wherein are to be seen as many rooms, as
there be days in the year, with chambers, galleries, and hals so great, as
therein men may conveniently play at ballown. There are also most beautiful
gardens, abounding with all manner of fruit, waterd from the River of Poe, by
conueyances, which by his highness with wonderful art, were thither conducted,
which near the said Palace cause certain mils to grind, with a fair and
ample fish pond, where there is always found great store of fish: and the
water in this pond being most clear, it serves very conveniently to swim
in, being as it were continually shadowed by very high popplar trees, which do
enuiron it. While his highness remains in this Palace, he keeps open
Court, so that the Gentlemen and Gentlewomen of the City, are always coming
and going: as furthermore, al such are there lodged, that come for audience,
and to negotiate with his highness, near whom ever the Counselors and
secretaries are resident. Here the hottest part of the day is passed over with
delectable entertainment: when toward the evening his highness with the
Duchess, Ladies, and Gentlemen (being a most excellent sight) goes to fly the
Sparrehawke) killing abundance of Phesant and Partrich, where of in those
fields there is store and plenty. In the end of Autumn, his highness, the
Lady Duchess, and all the court, with other gentlemen and gentlewomen of the
City, goes to the sea side, where among other delightsome habitations, near
to Port Goro, in a park called the Mesola, he has built a sumptuous palace,
the which park his Highness certainly with heroical expense, has compassed
with a wall, which is twelve miles in circuit, with four gates, placed
according to the four quarters of the heavens, the which are kept shut, that
the beasts may not go out, being likewise to open, as occasion requires.
Herein interchangeably they take diverse delights, sometime fishing in the sea by
draught, and otherwhiles in hunting, and at al these pastimes the excellent
Duchess is ever present with all the dames and matrons, who with great
contentment take pleasure in the cliase. For the huntsinen enter with their
dogs into the wood, and forcibly procure the wild beasts to issue forth into
certain large open places made for the purpose, where there be dogs placed
for the nonce, and Gentlemen, some on foot with long broches, others on horse
back, with spears and iauelins: and thus with notable agilitie, they kill
boares, hearts, and other, beasts, so that we may truly say, that in the world
there is not a Prince enjoys more excellent chase, or commodious fishing then
here is. Afterward in the evening the Court returned to the palace; while
supper, the time is spent in many pleasant entertainements: Wherefore his
Highness, according to his wont, being the last year toward the end of
Autumn in the said place, and the most famous Duchess, accompanied with
thrice noble Gentlemen, and gracious Dames, amongst whom was the honorable
Lady Countess of Sala, the two right illustrous and most beautiful sisters,
the Lady D. Marfisa, and Bradamante; the Lady Leonora Tieni Couotesse of
Scandiano; the Lady Isabella Bentiuoglia Marquess of Galtieri; the Lady
Camilla Costabili, the Lady Lucretia Calcagnina; the Lady Victoria Tassona; the
Lady Camilla Beuelacqua; the Lady Lucretia Machiauella; the Lady Camilla
Mosti; the Lady Anne Strozza; the Lady Tarquinia Molza; the Lady Leonora
Sacrati, with other Ladies and Matrons of account, besides the Gentlewomen of
the renowned Duchess. When his Highness desirous to go down to the sea side, to
procure the nets to be drawn, he made it known to the Gentlemen and
Gentlewomen, that while they were abroad, his mind was, that every one might
lawfully betake himself to that contentment, which was to him most acceptable.
Whereupon one part of the Gentlemen, the Lady D. Marfisa and Bradamante, and
other Gentlewomen of the Court, accompanied his Highness, and the Duchess to
the sea side: but the greater part, especially of women, unto whom the sea
wind in the end of Autumn was not pleasing, went to the Palace, to the end
that with some delightsome entertainment, they might pass the time till the
return of his Highness. The Countess of Sala for her quiet, had retired
herself into her lodging apart, unto whom all the Gentlemen and Ladies
resorted, to manifest unto her their favor and good will, as also to be
partakers of her most gracious conversation. The Lady Countess therefore,
seeing so fair and honorable an assembly in her chamber, as she that is the
inuentrice of fresh and honest contentments, me thinks said she smiling, that
soldiers can hardly keep their ranckes without an head, and therefore, I
would advise, so it be pleasing to you Lords and Ladies, that by lot we choose
out amongst our selves (to avoid envy) who ought to command, and that her
empire may continue til the return of his Highness. This motion by the
Countess propounded, was of all the whole company commended. The lotte fell to
the Lady Countess of Scandiano, and with great joy she was crowned with a
garland of Laurel leaves. This virtuous Lady the Queen, peradventure of more
than one heart, considering that in this noble concourse, there were the most
learned and flourishing wits of all the Court, desirous to hear them
discourse of some matter that might be contenting, and acceptable to the whole
company, spoke thus: Amongst all the things which administer delight and
wonder, it seems Beauty holds the chiefest place, the which is so much the
more admirable, in that she by few being perfectly known, is notwithstanding
by every one beloved, which thing I with my self having oftentimes considered,
it makes me enter into a singular desire to understand, what manner of thing
this is, which we term Beauty; whether truly she be to be found in the world,
or that we forge such a matter, in our fantasy, perceiving every day, by
experience, that what to one seems deformed, to another appears beautiful.
Seeing therefore a favorable star and gentle fortune have exalted me to so
great Empire, and that I may command over the diuinest wits, I determine to
satisfy my honest desire: I enjoin you therefore Signior Francesco Patritio,
under pain of the loss of my favor, (the which hitherto I have vouchsafed
you) to discourse upon Beauty, endeavoring in the best manner you can to give me
satisfaction.

This Signior Patritio is a Gentleman of Dalmatia, a man very learned, but
especially in Platonicall philosophy, who having been a little buffeted by
Fortune, in the end retiring himself into the sanctuary of me^ literate (for
so is the court of this Prince) he was with honorable regard, by his Highness
embraced. Rising up therefore, and making reverence: This courtesy of your
Majesty, thrice famous Queen (said he) has been great and singular, having
before any desert on my part vouchsafed me so great a reward, as to be made
worthy of your Majesty's favor. And whatso grievous punishment can be
imagined, that to the loss of this, may be compared; but as with so gracious a
gift I remain comforted, so upon some further consideration, I find my self
altogether perplexed and doubtful, because in obeying your commandment, I am
sure not to satisfy your desire, knowing my own insufficiency to entreat of
so high a subject, as is Beauty: and by disobedience I should incur the
penalty set down, the which I much more fear than death it self. To ouoyde
therefore so grievous punishment, I will make no doubt to expose my self to so
great an enterprise, hoping, that as those blessed intelligences, in their
spheres, illuminations and motion, infuse that, whereof the beautiful offspring
of Nature in this inferior world is derived, so that these resplendant
intelligences which are here placed so near our hearts, reuerberating upon me
their most glittering beams will kindle light, and stir up motion in my
obscure and dull understanding: from whence conceits and words may spring, apt
not only to discover that participated of, but even essential and true beauty.
Notwithstanding we (most famous Queen) having Beauty before our eyes, leaving
the first demand, pertaining only to the blind, and searching out what thing
this is which we call Beauty, I will affirm, that it is no other but a most
precious quality, which shines in the universal frame, growing from
proportions or colors, or from the one and the other, together, brought forth
by the chief Creator, to no other end, but with wonder and delight, to kindle
love in those minds, which can comprehend it. Desiring therefore to make
known, that this my definition is perfect, and under it that all things else
be comprehended, it is necessary, that discoursing somewhat more deeply, I do
show the proper and particular beauty of all those things, which in the
universal frame of this world are of beauty capable. I say then, that as this
great work which we call the world, is known by sense, and by understanding
conceived, so is it druided into two parts, the one of which we term the
sensible, and the other the intelligible world: the sensible world has two parts
one subject to vicissitudal generation and corruption, and it is this world
which we enjoy, being so dear to us, the other is the celestial world,
subject to no other transmutation, but only local motion: the corruptible
world is contrived of the four Elements, Earth, Water, Air, and Fire, as
likewise of all things mixed: whereof some be perfect, and others imperfect,
and of the perfect some be living, othersome without life: of living things,
some have only the soul vegetative, others have vegetation, and sense: and
and the third sort enjoy both vegetation, sense, and also reason. Imperfect
mixtions, so called, because they want little of being simple, are the vapors,
whereof all those imperfect mixtions are generate in which moisture bears
sway, as deaw, frost, mistes, clouds, rain, snow, tempests, and such like;
and exhalation the mother of all such things, in which heat and dryness
prevail, as are lightnings, thunders, thunderbolts, winds, falling stars,
comets, and other like impressions, which are engendered in the highest region
of the air; the perfect mixtions without life, are stones, precious gemmes,
and mineralles: living things, tetaining vegetation, are plants, herbs, and
all sorts of fruits: living things having both vegetation and sense, be
unreasonable creatures, of which some be imperfect, others perfect; the
imperfect be those which have no other sense, but feeling and imagination
confused: and therefore they living half a life, are recounted between plants
and living creatures, as oysters, muscles, sponges, and other such like
creatures, fastening unto stones: creatures perfect be all the other sort,
whether they be beasts on the earth, fish of the sea, or fowls of the air;
the living creature possessed with a soul vegetative, sensible, and teasouable
is only man. The celestial world, although it be al of one self same
substance, and that it seems at the first sight one heaven alone, yet
notwithstanding by diverse motions we learn, that it is distributed into ten
spheres: the first of which ascending upward, is the sphere of the moon,
the second of Mercury, the third of Venus, the fourth of the Sun, the fifth of
Mars, the sixth of Jupiter, the seventh of Saturn, the eight of the starrie
firmament, the ninth and tenth, the one of which (if the position of
Astrologers be true) gives motion trepedatiue, and the other motion diurnall,
called therefore the first mouer. The intelligible world is comprehended by
many and diverse orders of blessed souls and spirits, the lowest of which is
man's soul, and after that ensues the not erring intelligence, called the
soul of the world and Nature, for the three effects, she produces in this
universal frame, for in as much as she gives life and preserves the world,
she is termed the soul of the world, and in that she imprinteth into matter
with the seal of divinity, al forms generatiue and corruptible, she is
called nature: lastly because she directs every thing deprived of
understanding, to their end, she is termed intelligence never erring. This
is she (most famous Queen) that procures the birds with so great industry to
build their nests, she imprinteth natural desire of generation in all
creatures, and contemning their own proper commodity, with great care and
labor to bring up their young. She makes the Be and Ant to provide in
summer, for the future wants of winter, and to conclude, it is she that is
always intentive to the good of the whole world. The Angelical spirits follow,
being the most noble ornaments of the celestial spheres, divided into many
Hierarchies: the first of which wholly enflamed with divine love, is that of
the Seraphins, the second of the Cherubins, all replenished with
incomprehensible knowledge, in the third be the thrones faithful secretaries
of the celestial mind: then follow Dominations, Powers, Principalities, the
Angels and Archangels: above whom sits as perfect, the first understanding,
being the most excellent and great God, who immouable, draws and conioyneth
all the other understandings, as of them be loved and desired, to himself. As
this vniuetsall work is divided into two parts, the one corporeal and
sensible, the other incorporeal and intelligible, so be there two beauties, the
one sensible, the other intelligible. But in that the beginning of all our
knowledge, is derived from sense, we will first entreat of Beauty sensible:
the which is no other but that most gracious quality, which shines in bodies
sensible, springing from proportion or colors or together both from the one and
other, which administering delight, produces love in those minds that can
comprehe^d it. And because bodies sensible are of two sorts, that is, simple,
as the heaven and four elements be, or compounded as albodies mixed are, we
must observe, that of all bodies simple, Heaven only may be termed
beautiful, for the elements being incapable of proportion, light and colors,
they cannot properly be called beautiful. Leaving them therefore apart with
the mixed bodies, that com not much short of being elements, we will affirm,
that sensible beauty only in heaven, and bodies perfectly compounded is
comprehended, which notwithstanding is not all one, but as compounded bodies be
diverse, so are there beauties distinct and different: in that some are
compounded of like parts as stones, precious gemmes and mineralles, others of
parts unlike, and in themselves dissenting, as plants, and living creatures. We
will then auerre, that both the beauty of heaven, and of compounded bodies of
parts unlike consists only in colors, for though the beauty of things
compounded of parts different, consists in proportion and colors; yet of
some the beauty confisteth principally in colors, as likewise of othersome in
proportion. The beauty therefore wherewith heaven is adorned, is no other but
his most bright end shining color, which does not only make heaven
beautiful, but further, is an occasion, that al other sensible beutie is fair
and apparent. The beauty of stones consists in their colors, as of marble,
porpherie, alabaster, and such like. That of the diamond in his white and
excellent color, like to the stars, as also the beauty of the rubie is in
his red and clear color. The beauty of mineralles also consists in colors;
for gold in color like to the Sun, receives his brightness; and silver in
whiteness resembles the Moon, and so all other mettalles by their proper
colors are esteemed fair and beautiful. Plants have their beauty in
proportion, and colors; but more specially in proportion. That of herbs and
flowers, consists rather in color than proportion: but the beauty of
creatures irrational, is placed principally in the proportion and
correspondencie, that the parts between themselves, have with the whole, and
far less depending on color. Man's beauty consists in proportion, and in
splendour of his proper and well placed colors: But in that I reserve the
discussion of humane Beauty, to the end of this my discourse, we will now leave
it. And that no Beauty may remain untouched, before we pass over to the
Beauty of the world intelligible, we will speak somewhat of artificial
Beauty, seeing things artificial also are termed beautiful: and amongst
those artificial, I place Poesy, and Speech or Oration, the one being
governed by Art Poetical, the other by the Art of Rethorike. And as we find
quantity both in the one and other, so in them both proportion, and colors
Poetical and Rethoricall are comprehended; yet these are not known by sense,
but by the mind and understanding, wherefore the beauty of Poesy and
Oration, ought to be called an artificial intelligible Beauty, differing
from other beauties artificial, which by the sense of seeing only are
comprehended. The beauty therefore of things artificial, being as it were the
image of those natural, consists as well in color as proportion; yet in
some we consider only proportion, as in statues, buildings and other like,
which proceed from manual Arts, in which there is little reckoning made of
colors. In some other things the beauty remains in color; and these be
such as depend on the Art of Weauing, as clothes of silk, wool, linen, and
such like. The beauty of plants is respected both in one and other, that is, in
proportion and colors: And let this spoken, be sufficient for Beauty
artificial.

Now passing over to that Beauty which only with the eyes of the soul is
comprehended (being Beauty intelligible) beginning from the lowest, and is
that which is found in the soul of man. I say, that as the Beauty of humane
body (as we will show) is placed principally in the superior part, which
regards heavenly light; so the Beauty of man's soul is found in the more
eminent part of the same, the which is exposed to divine light. This is called
understanding, by which our soul conceiueth and knows, not only the being of
things corporeal and sensible, but also by mean of things visible, raises
it self to the knowledge of those invisible, so that as we observe the soul
of man to be compounded of parts and diverse parcells, so the same soul from
the consent of parts and colors, receives his excellency: colors are no
other but intelligible kinds, placed in the understanding, which with colors
have the like similitude, as the visible colors themselves, and these may be
termed intelligible; for as colors are not actually visible, neither can their
beauty by bodily eye be seen, if first that eye, and those colors, be not by
some light, and especially by the light of the first visible (which is the
Sun illuminated, so the forms and intelligible kinds of our understanding
(which is the eye of the soul) cannot be comprehended, if first that
understanding and those intelligibles, be not by the light of superior
understanding cleared and illumined. These intelligibles, which placed in
understanding, do make it absolutely perfect and beautiful, be of two sorts:
some be intelligibles of truth, others intelligibles of good: those of good be
decking our souls with prudence, fortitude, temperance and justice, make them
most beutiful: those of truth apparel them with two precious habites, wisdom
and sapience, through which habites, our souls become like to divine beuty:
proportion, by which one part of the soul with admirable symetry answers to
the other, is no other but a famous virtue, which makes our soul so fair and
beautiful, that if with bodily eyes it might be contemplated, it would produce
in us incredible love, and wonderful affection: this by the eye of the mind
is only discovered, being more excellent than a thousand bodily eyes; and
therefore in those whose mind is not blind, it brings forth affections not
only wonderful, but out of doubt such, as neither by the tongue can be
expressed, nor by the mind comprehended.

According to order, the Beauty of the worldly soul follows, called Nature,
and intelligence not erring, whose beauty in like manner is observed in colors
and proportion. Colors are no other, but divine Ideaes infused in the same
soul: and proportion is nothing else, but an exemplat form, of superior
understanding imprinted in the said soul, after whose image by the seal of
divinity, it makes matter deformed, beautiful. The beauty of Angels
divided into diverse Hierarchies, as we have said, is no other but Angelical
understanding, garnished, and replenished with all forms intelligible by
understanding divine. These of all understandings, have the greater proportion
to receive celestial splendour, as those who being always present, do face to
face behold divine Beauty: and therefore those Angelical understandings, are
always in action of intelligence, and are made beautiful, after such a sort,
as of deformity they are incapable, which is not in humane intellect, by
reason it is not ever in action of intelligence, and is capable as well of
deformity as beauty. For when the soul abaseth it self with cogitations, and
intimation in the obscurity of sensible delights, the conceit of Beauty
remains extinct and darkened; but when it is exalted to the contemplation of
things supernall, exposing it self to celestial light, then procures she
her own native beauty, to be clear and excellent. Hitherto (most famous
Queeue) we have entreated of sensible and intelligible Beauty, in as much as
it is Beauty participated of.

Now remains it unto us to discourse of true and essential Beauty, by mean of
which al things created are so much the more fair, by how much the more they
are partakers of it, This is found in the first understanding, being the most
mighty and excellent God, creator and giver of all Beauty: because he alone is
absolute perfection, perfect wisdom, and incomprehensible Beauty: especially
not to be comprehended by our understanding: the which at contemplation of
divine essence, remains no less obfuscate, then is the eye of a Bat in
beholding the sun. Having therefore to discuss upon so high a subject, I will
endeavor to the uttermost of my wit and capacity, to direct your majesty to
the contemplation of essential and true divine Beauty, by those means which
are granted unto us by the Creator: For he has not equally distributed his
Treasures. Angelical understanding is replenished by the chief creator,
essentially with all forms intelligible, and to it is permitted the
co^templation of divinity face to face. Intellect humane, in as much as it is
united to the material body, deprived of all intelligibles, (as a plain and
smoothe board) is yet in potential power to receive all the forms and
intelligible representations, the material and sensible, by their own Ideas,
and the immaterial and insensible by another, or in another likeness and
similitude: and therefore al our knowledge proceeds from sense, things
sensible being the true means which guide to the knowledge of those
intelligible, being as it were similitudes and representations of them. By
these representations therefore and similitudes, I will seek to make known
divine and true Beauty, the which consists, though in a most supereminent
manner, in color and proportion, for it is a thing most certain, that this
sensible light is no other but a bright color, color being likewise nothing
else, but a shadowed and obfuscate light, seeing it is generate, not only by the
mixtion of the first qualities, but also by light and shado: wthere is this
difference, that the shadowie light is not of it self in visible act, but to
that is procured by bright color, whereas bright color is not only of it self,
always invisible act; but further, is an occasion that al other things be
visible, seen, and by all men's eyes beheld. And therefore the sun adorned with
this bright color, is the first visible, the first seen, and first seeing,
deservedly called by Heraclytus the eye of the world.

This bright sensible color, which is the suns beauty, easily guides to the
knowledge of brightest color intelligible, which is the Beauty of the first
understanding, being as it were the Image and similitude of it: for as sensible
colors can neither be visible nor seen, without the most bright color of
the sun, so intelligible colors, which be those intelligible forms, cannot
have actual intelligence, nor be conceived, without the presence of most bright
color divine: And as the eyes should not be actually seeing without celestial
light, so Intellects, which be no other but incorporeal eyes, should not
actually be intelligent without divine splendour and brightness: for as the light
of the sun is of it self visible, and by it self seen, so the most bright
color divine is of it self intelligibile, and by it self understood. And as
the sun by his most bright color is the first visible, first seen, and first
seeing, so the first understanding, which is god, most mighty and excellent,
with his most glittering shining color, and light essential, is the first
intelligible, first understood, and first intelligent. The Sun by his
resplendant light, exceeds all the celestial bodies in Beauty: the first
intellect (excepting always, if it be lawful to make comparison, between
the finite and infinite) through his divine splendour, and most glittering light
is in the intelligible world, of al intellects the beautifullest, and most
supereminent: and as the light of our material fire, in these inferior parts,
represents the Sun; so is the light of the sun in the world celestial,
the true similitude of divine light and brightness. And therefore the divine
Philosopher, defines light to be no other then an influence of divine essence,
into al worldly things infused, not being any thing throughout the universal
work, wherein some shadow of light does not appear and shine. These be the
means and similitudes (renowned Queen) which show that the Beauty of the
first Intellect consists in his proper color, being the same light which
beautifieth, and is diffused throughout the whole world. It remains that I
procure you to understand the other part of divine and essential beauty, which
is proportion. Yet let not your highness imagine, that these beauties which I
place in God, be in themselves diverse, as also distinct, from divine essence,
as we see in other understandings. For in God there is nothing which is not
divinity of it self, and therefore in God Idea, light, wisdom, justice, be
no other but God himself; notwithstanding they are diverse by our imperfect
manner of understanding: because therefore we understand proportion as diverse
from his light, we will so express it. Proportion then, which is in God part
of his Beauty, is no other but the Idea and exemplar form of the whole world,
in that divine intellect, in which universal frame, all the parts being
together, within themselves wholly correspondent, they are in that divine
understanding with greater proportion then in the world. As in the Architects
understanding, the model and exemplar form of buylding is much more fair and
excellent, then in the buylding it self: In that the form of Building may
receive impediment from matter which ever resists Ideall reason, but that
which is in the Soul being pure and Immateriall, can have no defect. So that
as the Beauty of the buylding and of all the parts thereof, depends on the
exemplar form, which in the understanding of the Architect, and therefore this
in the Building is called Beauty participated of, and that in the Architects
understanding, Beauty essential.

So the Beauty of this worldly Frame, and all the parts thereof depends on
Ideal form, in mind divine comprehended, and therefore that is teaimed Beauty
participated of: and this in the mind of the divine Architect, is true and
essential beauty, which consists as I have said, in Ideall proportion, and
his shining light, which is not only the true light, that illuminateth man
coming into this world, but further, is that which causes the universal
frame to be resplendant and beautiful. The divine Prophet shows (and it is
true) that God having created in five days all other things which are
comprehended in the whole world, he finished his labor the sixth day in the
work of man. I having therefore dilated of the whole world in the first part
of my discourse, as also of all the parcels thereof, and in the second of
corporeal Beauty sensible: in the third of Artificial beauty: in the fourth of
the Beauty of Intellects, and in the fifth of essential Beauty divine,
immitation of divine wisdom, I determine in this sixth and last part, to
conclude with the Beauty of the shape humane. Throughout the whole world divine
Beauty obscureth al other pulchritude. The Sun exceeds in beauty al bodies
celestial, and Beauty humane excels all the other of this inferior world,
and therefore we may say with the holy scripture, that God created man after
his own Image, seeing that in man the beam of divinity does appear and
shine. This heavenly creature whom we call man, was compounded of soul and
body, the which body, having to be the harbor of a most fair and immortal
soul, was created without covering of hide, bristles, feathers, skales,
brutish tusks, or horns, neither with bil, or clawing talents, but most
exquisite, with his eyes toward heaven, and was placed in the midst of the
world, to the end that as in an ample Theater, he might behold and contemplate
the works of the great God, and the Beauty of the whole world: as also there
was granted unto him a perfect tongue and speech, that enflamed with love
divine, and replenished with admiration, he might praise, and with words extol
divine beauty. In humane body we find proportion and colors, more then in all
other bodies compounded of parts unlike, because in it that proportion is
comprehended, which represents the whole corporeal sensible world, as also
the colors that beautify this sensible world; the one of which is white, like
to heavenly light, and the other is red, like to the shining color of material
and visible fire: and therefore man was worthily called a little world, seeing
the body of man is no other but a little model of the sensible world, and his
soul an Image of the world intelligible. The beauty therefore of humane body,
consists in due measure of proportion, that is, in fair and goodly
lineaments, and in colors well disposed: and further, which falls not out in
any other body compounded of parts unlike, his beauty principally is discovered
in one part alone: and this is in the superior part, which regards toward
the light of the Sun: whose beauty is that, which by mean of the eye
procures Love. Moreover (which likewise in no other kind of creature is
found) Beauty humane is in women, in far greater excellency observed, then
in men, which was thus dispensed with great providence by the chief creator.
For having granted woman unto man for a companion, he endowed her with
excellent beauty, for production of Man, and to inflame in him a desire to
generate that fair and beautiful. This Anacreon confirms, saying, that as
running is the ornament of an horse, and wisdom of a man; so beauty is the
proper honor of a woman: And the Philosopher in the first of his Rhetroyke,
does in such sort appropriate beauty to a woman, as he sets it down
principally amongst feminine virtues, saying, that the virtues of a woman be
beauty, honesty, and desire to take pains, without avarice. And in the same
book speaking of the beauty of man, he places in the visage of man, together
with the aspect, terrible, regard and countenance, to the end that, provoked
in fighting, he might be a terror to his enemies, which does clearly manifest
that beauty is not in man in so great perfection as in a woman, because his
beauty, procures as well terror as love, whereas Beauty in women does always
generate love, and never procures fear. If I were willing to describe the
beauty of visage humane, I might much more easily point it out with my finger,
the^ express it by my tongue. Yet for all this I will not forbear to affirm that
to form perfect Beauty in humane visage, four things sitly concur,
proportionable feature, color well disposed favor and presence: to goodly
feature and color, fair and comely presence adds such excellency, as without
it al other Beauties languish and wear away. This was well known and commended
by Petrarch in the countenance of his Lauretta, in the sonnet that begins;
From time to time she seems more to mollify,
By hue Angelical and her sweet simpring smiles,
And by the favor that her face does dignifie,
With rolling eyes also, disciphring wanton wiles.


Whether this be a beam of the soul, which glittereth in the countenance
after the same sort as the beams of the intellige^ces, shine in their proper
heavens and spheres, or that it be an harmony of shadowed colors and
lineaments, I dare not affirm, but confess my self to be ignorant, and will
remain bound to him, that shall make me capable here of. How much favor
imports to the perfection of beauty humane, from hence we easily conceive:
for without favor, beauty would neither be gracious, nor accepted of: for she
accompanied with favor, has force to draw to her self, al those minds which
ca^ comprehend her; and without favor beauty may be said to be imperfect:
therefore the ancients fained the Graces to be the waiting maids of Venus; by
this inferring, that beauty ought ever to be accompanied by favor, and from her
never to be separate. Presence principally is discovered in the sweet and comely
motions of the body, for the body standing immovable, is not apparent, and for
my part I would say that presence is no other then a certain faculty and
agilitie, which the body has to obey the soul.

It remains unto me (most excellent Queen) for conclusion of this my
discourse, that I declare unto your highness, that humane beuty to on other
end, has by the chief creator bin produced, amongst al beuties sensible, most
excellent, but to kindle this honest and holy love divine, which unites humane
creature with his creator. For man wholly astonished in beholding humane
Beauty, raises up his mind to the co^templation of Beauty true and essential,
whereof this is a shadow and similitude. this discourse of Patritio was by the
Queen commended, as also by the other Ladies, when S. Gioan Battista Guirini, a
gentleman most judicial in choice and excellent learning, added. Questionless
Signior Francesco has so plentifully discoursed of Beauty, that little more
may be adjoined thereunto; notwithstanding, in every part I am not satiffied,
if he loose not some doubts which hold bound my mind. For he having showed,
that Beauty consists in proportion or colors, or in one and the other
together, has from this his beauty excluded some things, which are esteemed
fair; into which being altogether simple, proportion cannot fall, it being no
other but that symetrie and commeseration which the parts have between
themselves comfortable together to the whole: for we say, a beautiful color, a
fair light, a fair voice, a fair sound, and such like: our Italian word
Bello being used in commending of al these excellencies, and in these there is
neither proportion nor colors. But further, he auerring that the beauty of
bodies compounded of parts unlike, is the proportion that the parts have
between themselves, and with the whole, he manifestly contradicts his friend
Plotinus, principal of the Platonicall family, who makes plain demonstration,
that beauty cannot be in proportion: and amongst many other arguments, this, in
my judgment, is not of little importance, for says he, if proportion were
beauty, it would follow, that the parts which compounde the whole, should not
be beautiful; for no composition being in them, there is likewise no
proportion, and they not being fair, how can the whole be beautiful,
considering that of parts not beautiful, an whole Beauty cannot be compounded:
notwithstanding the consequent is false; for the parts which compound the
whole, are and be termed fair, we usually saying, a fair hand, a fair foot,
a fair eye, a beautiful nose, and such like; this word Bello serving for to
commend al these perfections: the antecedent therefore is false, which is, that
proportion is beauty. Furthermore, he also unmindful of his Plautinus, has
only entreated of that sensible beauty, which is the proper object of the sense
of seeing, and has not placed that in the number of Beauties, which is the
object of hearing, that being of so great price, as Plotinus makes it, like to
the beauty of the soul: and this is melody or music which so greatly
delights, there being no doubt but that also is termed by the title of
sayre, we saying for the most part, excellent music, singular harmony, and
pleasant consent. I expect therefore Signior Francesco, that you resolving these
my doubts, do cause your beauty to appear, much more resplendant and
glorious, then that altogether beautiful.

Very wittily and learnedly said Patritio, according to the custom of his
pregnant wit, doubts Signior Guicini how I have for born to put in the number
of things beautiful, some other which also are called by the same name, as also
moved by the authority of Plotynus, he doubts that proportion is not the
beauty of bodies compounded of parts different, as more over, me lody is to be
numbered amongst beauties sensible. I answering therefore to his first doubt
said, that beauty is a quality as we have affirmed, and therefore cannot of it
self consist, but is necessary that it be resident to a subject, and this
shall be substance. For substance as the sound thereof imporreth, is that which
by it self subsisteth, and not the quality or accident. Color therefore being
an accide^t which cannot stand by it self, it cannot be the subject of beauty,
but rather the beauty of the subject. Whereupon we speaking properly, this
proposition will not be true, that color is beautiful, except we understand it
in this sort, that it makes another thing beautiful. As physic is said to
be healthful, because it heals another, it is also improperly spoken when
we say, a sayre voice, or a fair sound: for besides that there can be no
sensible beauty: but that which is comprehended by the sense of sight, sound
and voice, has in a certain manner the said proportion with Musical consent
as has the color, with the body colored: for as by color, beauty is
represented to the eyes: so by sound and harmony, the voice represents
melody to the ears: whereupon as we cannot say a beautiful color, so can we
not likewise term the voice to be fair, I say speaking properly: but insteede
hereof, we might better term, a melodious, or good voice, and a good or
sweet sound. I have not in like manner placed in the number of things beautiful
those which be the objects of hearing; for only proportion in bodies,
according to Platoes mind, is called Beauty: and in number it is termed
harmony in humors health, and in the mind virtue. For as it would be no proper
but translated speech to say insteede of, beauty of the body, harmony of the
body, and for the health, the beauty of the humors, so would it be improper to
say, the beuty of number, or health of number, in that the science it self,
which entreats of Music, terms his proper subject, number harmonious, and
not beutifull. That harmony, which is the object that most delights hearing,
is not properly beauty, as that of bodies, it is by this manifest; for beauty
of bodies is absolutely a work of Nature, shining of it self, without the help
or adoperation of Art: But harmony is not wholly a work of Nature, but
depends of science, and art humane, which the understanding retains, by
musical habit; and therefore in Music it seems, that not only sense, but
also understanding is wakened and delighted. Further, beauty in bodies, is
always in action, neither needs it humane art to be seen, but suddenly at
the appearance of light does discover it self; harmony, notwithstanding it be
always potentially in number, nevertheless without humane Art, it cannot be
in action, nor be heard: Yet this (and with Plotynus leave be it spoken) is
much different from beauty, by the argument of Plotynus himself, which is,
that proportion in bodies compounded, of parts unlike, cannot be Beauty. For
though I esteem him as Prince and chief of all the Platonists, nevertheless,
desiring to have truth my friend, I can not in this conform my self to his
opinion: For he considered not, that the different parts which compound the
whole, are also framed themselves, of parts and parcelles unlike: For the hand
is compounded of fingers, and the fingers of joints and nails, and in it do
we behold well disposed colors, and due proportion, as likewise in the feet
and all other members, in which out of doubt, we find proportion of the parts
and whole: and therefore when we call the^ beutifull, we respect them not as
parts, but also as entire wholes, and compounded. I further affirm, that as of
matter and form, the body heavy, and light, is compounded, although neither
the matter not form, is either heavy, or light; so will it be no such great
inconvenience, that of parts not fair, an entire beautiful should be
compounded. Guirini seemed to be satisfied with the answer of Patritio, who now
withdrew himself, to give place to the L. Laura Peuerara, that by commandment
of the Queen, had taken the Harp into her hand for music: When the lady
Tarquinia Molza: go not away said she, Signior Patritio, for I have also a
doubt to cast, neither do I think that the Queens mind is, I should here rest
discontented, as I must needs, you not satisfying me, in my own I cannot say,
but even in the general doubt of every one: for who is there, especially among
us women, which knows the reason (speaking of beauty humane) why she with
us is so rare, and deformity so frequent, and yet the quite contrary should be,
if that were true which you have spoken: That Nature the ministresse of divine
providence, and disposer of al forms, does imprint them in matter, according
to example, in understanding divine: how can it therefore be, Signior Patritio,
that Nature, who has ever before her eyes, the true model of Beauty, after
the Image whereof she intends to form the thing beutiful, like an unskillful
Painter, or Grauer, should for the most part impart deformity.

This doubt Lady, answered Patritio, is not smally importing: being undoubtedly
worthy of your most noble conceit, notwithstanding I will endeavor my self
herein, to give you satisfaction. It is a thing certain, that Beauty
proceeds from form, and deformity from matter; the which, as it is of his
own proper nature vnformall, so al deformity has from it deriuation: For
matter resists Ideall reason, so that in her she cannot produce the perfect
form she intends: and from hence comes it, that the Grauer can never set
forth Beauty in Marble, answerable to the immateriall impression of her in his
mind: for the marble makes resistance to his chizel, hand and art. Applying
this then to our purpose I say, that the matter whereof humane creature is
formed (and it is pure blood, mixed with man's seed, in the womb of the woman)
in which the great mother Nature determines to introduce the Image of
divinity, is not always one, and the self same, but sometimes by the mother,
otherwhiles by the father, and often by the variabilitie of celestial
influence, we find it diversely disposed. Hereupon it appears, that one more,
another less, resists Ideall reason. By how much therefore matter is of
greater resista^ce, by so much the more loses form his beutie; as on the
contrary it obtains the more, the less it makes resistance: And therefore
divine Plotinus defines Beuty to be no other, but the flower of form subduing
matter. It seems you, replied the L. Tarquinia, would charge the heavens, with
beauty or deformity, seeing it is they that dispose matter, to greater or
less refictance. Without doubt, answered Patritio, as of the cause
isntrumental, the beauty and deformity of celestial influence depends; so
likewise does all other effects of this inferior world: for celestial heat, is
the principal instrument of nature, as also vital heat, is the instrument of
nature in man's procreation, which by the father in feed impressed, has
proportion with the starry element: and therefore if nature would introduce
like form, unto Ideall beauty, it is necessary, many things should agree to
subdue the resistance of matter: as these points would be requisite, that the
fathers seed be well disposed, that the heat of the womb be temperate, as
also that celestial heat be graciously infused by the favorable stars: As
Petrarch affirms, speaking of his fair Laura, in the Song

Garments of green, yet bloody, tawny, and obscure: Saying in the seventh
Stanza: O gracious stars, which feruor did infuse,
Into the flank that was so fortunate,
When this fair child, the world came to peruse,
Whom for a star on earth we celebrate:


And as follows likewise in the fifth Stanza of the Song: Silent I cannot be:
and fear prevails not.

When he says: The selfsame day, when she was bound in world below:
Those stars which in us have most happy influence:
In places high, and choice, themselves did soon bestow,
One with another, in friendly correspondence:
Venus and Jove her sire, with gracious mild aspect,
Above the fair and princely houses did possess:
When all disastrous lights, evil fortune that detect,
Were all in heau'ne extinct, and darkened questionless.


And as further follows: being therefore necessary, that so many things should
concur together for generation of Beauty, no marvel (most gentle Lady,)
though Beauty so seldom, and Deformity so often manifests her self: The
cause of Beauty and Deformity set down by Patritio, seemed very probable to
the Lady Tarquinia, and when all the attendants and standers by, imagining,
that in the like argument, no other thing was to be sought after. The excellent
Duchess, a princess of rare and strange capacity, making Patritio once
again to stay. You have yet further, said she, to satisfy my doubt, which
proceeds from having by you bin affirmed, that the beauty of humane body
consists in proportion and colors: I desire therefore to know which holds
the chiefest place, because by this means I shall also come to knowledge,
which is the greater defect in beuty, either disproportion, or deficiencie in
colors. Reason, said Patritio, persuades me most noble Lady, to yield the
chiefest place to proportion, notwithstanding sense makes me stand doubtful,
ever observing, that the countenaunces of these fair Ladies, and of all women,
do more shine and glitter through the abundance of colors, than by great
proportion. Although I, if it so please your Majesty, will discuss this
problem, by allegation of reasons, both for the one and other part: and
without giving definitive sentence, will leave sufficient arms to every one,
to defend that best pleases him. And there is no doubt, but rastes be
diverse; whereupon every one enamoured will commend that part in which his
beloved is more excellent: for this may be perceived in Petrarch, who
sufficiently praises the colors of his Lauretta, because her colors exceeded
far her proportion. He called therefore her fair hair, tresses of gold, her
forehead more beautiful than the heaven, he compared the eye liddes to ebonie,
the cheeks to frosts, snowes, and roses; the lips to rubies, the teeth to
pearls, as we read in all those Sonets which contain the beuty of Laura:
where we see not so much as one word, having relation to feature or proportion.
The manner of handling this controversy pleases me well, replied the L.
Duchess, seeing every one may reason to their own mind: yet give you the
onset, and begin first from proportion, the which out of doubt naturally
exceeds colors, as do the clements things mixed. When Patritio therefore, had
alitle pawsed with himself, he said: Among al beuties sensible, that seems the
most perfect beuty, which is nearer to beauty intelligible, as also of that
most participating. Proportion is such: therefore amongst all beuties sensible
she is the greater: and consequently where she is found, is that, which to
beauty, gives greater perfection. Proportion questionless has greater
similitude with intelligible beauty, because it can not be proportion without
order, and order is proper to reason, which reason is no other, but a
similitude of beauty intelligible, and of the self divine intellect: but
further it is the more principal part of beauty sensible, which reaches
delight, not only to sense, but also to the mind, and such proportion: for by
the order and disposition of parts, the footesteps of reason do in her appear,
and therefore she is very conformable to the nature of the mind, being apt to
delight, and ravish it with unspeakable contentment: Further, proportion is
the principal cause of beuty, throughout the universal frame, as well of the
world corporeal and sensible, as of the intelligible: considering that by
proportion, it is created, and by the same preserved; therefore it deserves the
chiefest place in the beauty of humane body, which is no other but a model of
the great world. Except we should foolishly beleene, that the world was made
by chance, we must necessarily conceive, that with special providence, it was
built by the divine architect, as also it is necessary to place in the same
divine mind, the Ideal form, as we have said of the world, by others termed
the worlds Archtype, even as it is necessary that the model and Idea of the
building, should be in the mind of the Architect. Now the principal and most
perfect part, as well in the mind of divine, as humane Architect is
proportion, because in it order and disposition are comprehended. According to
this Ideall proportion therefore was the whole world by God created, and first
of figure circular; because to contain this universal work, that of al other
figures was most proportionable, and the heavenly spheres were with so great
proportion framed, as likewise to every one, motion, with so singular
proportion dispensed, that in moving (as the divine Philosopher affirms)
they procure celestial harmony: every star has his proportion to receive
light from the Sun; and the Sun proportionably to every one of them,
dispenses and infuseth of his light; and both the stars, and Sun, with so
great measure and proportion, do infuse their light and heat into these
inferior bodies, as with marvel, and wonder from them, springs the beutie of
this inferior world. Such proportion we find in the elements, as well in
quantity as quality, as if of this their proportion, the least part were but
disproportioned, one element would convert all the other into his proper Nature,
or else the world would be confounded into Chaos. Proportion causes harmony in
number, in bodies beauty, in humors health, in mind virtue, as contrariwise
disproportion, procures in numbers discord, in bodies deformity, in humors
infirmity, and in the mind vice: But who is it that will doubt proportion to be
the cause of all delights, as well sensible, as inte ligible, in that the good
which delights, is no good, if it bring not with it proportion, neither is
there any thing that desires to be united with good simply, but with a good to
it self proportioned; and from hence proceeds the saying of Heraclytus, that
every thing is ravished with his own contentment, the which stands in union of
good, to it self proportioned: and this is that which properly of all things
is beloved and desired.

To conclude, as there can not be good in the universal world, without
proportion, so can there not in the little world which is man, be any beauty
without proportion: and, as good can not without proportion procure desire; so
can not beauty without proportion cause love: In that love is not generate in
the lover, but by symetrie, which the thing beloved has with the lover: by all
these, and other reasons, which might be produced, we may conclude, that all
perfection springs principally from proportion: and therefore that it in
humane body is a part more excelent, than is the beutie of colors. Me thinks
said the Duchess, the doubt is after such a manner cleared, as we need not
proceed any further, and that the palm is due rather to beautiful feature,
than to fair and well disposed colors. It is a thing just and requisite,
renowned Lady, said Patritio, before judgment to attend the party, for his
allegations are not to be contemned, and therefore that lover who is made a
servant to beautiful tresses, to black eyes, to colored cheeks, to rosy
lips, to a white hand, will allege in defense of colors, that the beauty which
is part, or rather proper offpring of the most perfect of all beauties
sensible, ought to be the self same, which brings principally the name of
beautiful to that subject wherein it is found; but colors are such, therefore
by colors humane body shall principally be called beautiful: that colors be
such, it is a thing manifest: for light is the greatest of all beauties
sensible, as that which is no other but a beam and influence of divine
essence, dispersed over the wole world (as I have said) this being granted to
the most perfect, of all bodies sensible, which is the sun, to the end that by
it, it might not only be beautifullest of all other creatures, but that it
should also be the mean and principal cause, of the appearance of all other
beauties: colors are so conjoined with light, and light with colors, after
such a sort united, as we term light a bright color in a body illumined, and
color a shadowed light in a colored body: in no point differing, but that light
is a color without adumbration, and color a light shadowed, whereupon those
colors which have least adumbration, as is white, have the greater similitude
with the purity of light: Light then being the greatest beauty of the world,
and colors part of light, and of light created, in all reason they ought to
obtain the chiefest place in humane beauty.

This lover will further argue, if the proper object delectable to the sight, is
no other but beauty, colors being more delightsome then proportion or figure,
should also have in them greater beauty. That colors be such, it is proved,
for colors are proper sensibles of the sight, but figure and proportion
sensibles common: and by the opinion as well of the Perepatetikes, as
Academikes, proper sensibles do more move and delight sense, then common.
Neither want there philosophers of authority, as was most learned Psellus,
which hold opinion, that common sensibles are rather known by reason, stiried
up by the senses, then by the sense themselves.

To conclude, he will thus reason, grounding himself upon that proposition,
which runs current through all universities, and is this: that which is the
cause that another thing is such, is much more the like it self: as for example
sake: If fire be the cause that all other things are hot, then shall it of all
other things be the hottest: I will therefore affirm, that if beauty of
colors, is a cause that the beauty of figure and proportion is apparent, then
must they likewise needs be of more apparent beauty: as light is of all
other beauties the fairest, in that light is the cause of the appearance of all
beauties sensible: and there is no doubt, but colors are the cause of the
appearance of proportion, considering that common sensibles cannot be
comprehended, but by sensibles proper: by the testimony of women themselves, of
whom beauty is the proper ornament: the said reasons may be confirmed, they
being privy, that colors in beauty humane holds the cheifest place, and are
of themselves apt to produce Love: they employ all their industry in the
beauty of colors, by making their hair like the shining color of gold, the
cheeks like to white lillies and red roses, the lips to rubies, the teeth to
the orient whitenes of pearl, with which beuties shadowing some other of their
disproportio^s, they yet appear, and are called fair, kindling notwitsta^ding
by such heart, in the hearts of me^ amarous flames. I Will further add the
authority of the doctors, of the Moysaical law, who desirous that me^ leaving
their bestial appetites, should be inamored of women, set down by public
decree, that it should be lawful for women to paint their faces, and that
fathers to daughters, brothers to sisters, and husbands to wives, should be
enjoined to allow money for the buying of colors: these wisemen conceiving,
that there is not a beuty more preuailent to imprint love in humane breasts,
then that of colors: and thus will this entangled lover with the beutie of
colors conclude, that colors are the most principal points of humane beauty.
Here Patritio held his peace, and on a sudden great murmuring did arise, one
defending one part, and others another, which the Queen observing, she
pointed to the Lady Laura Peuerara. This is a Gentleman belonging to the
Duchess, borne in Mantua, to the glory of that City, married to Count Hanibal
Turcho, one of the principallest Gentlemen of our City: who, as she does
easily with her beauty kindle love in any one that beholds her, so with her
honest customs and modesty, she does so assuage others flames, that al
amarous affection, is resolved into singular and special reverence, whereupon
by all those that know her, she is no less reverenced then beloved. Being come
therefore before the Queen with her Harp, she sung so sweetly, as it seemed
the soul at the sound of that divine harmony ravished, would have flowne out
from the body of every one that heard her: when music being finished, the
Lady Duchess dwarf came running, and made it known that the Court was at
hand: whereupon the queen rising up, the Ladies and knights after order given
for prosecution of these disscussions begun, the day following went to meet
his highness, and the rest of the day while suppertime, was passed over in
diverse recreations, and pleasant sports. After supper they trod certain
measures, which finished, his highness rose up, and cuerie one retired
himself apart to his Lodging.

The second days discourse: Wherein, an argument arising amongst the Ladies
and Gentlemen, they disscusse of Humane love.
THe day following, his highness with the renowned Duchess, and part of the
Court, went into the wood of Elisea, where was prepared a very pleasant chase,
the huntsmen with their nets having enclosed a sufficient number of boares,
whereof that wood above all others does greatly abound: and the usual company
placed in order, returned to the Chamber of the Lady Countess of Sala, from
whence taking, by chance, the Lady Isabella Bentiuoglia, a matron, adorned with
most noble qualities, she was crowned Queen, who after a little silence,
spoke in this manner: I believe not, that amongst us there can any one be found
of so dull a conceit, which did not yesterday find great contentment in the
discourse of Signior Patritio, he having explaned unto you, what beauty was,
from whence she derived her original, and to what end she was granted unto
mortal men, by the omnipotent Creator. The which having well considered, I
think it not much from the purpose, to prosequute the method and begun, give
some occasion to these pregnant and learned wits, to extend forth such like
delights, which also unto us may be a singular benefit and commodity: For what
greater pleasure may be tasted, then to satisfy that natural desire we have
to understand. Signior Patritio said yesterday, that beauty was the mother of
love, and therefore, as of the mother I remained out of doubt, so am I desirous
to have some notise of the son, and in effect to know, what thing this is
which we term love: for in the description that Plutarch thereof makes, I am
but little satisfied: it seeming unto me a mere fable to say, that he is a
blind boy, winged, and naked, with a bow in his hand, and arrows by his side,
as likewise it is no less vanity to affirm that he is a courteous child, or
froward old man, and that he springs from idleness and humane iolitie. I
command you therefore Signior Guirino (if my favor be with you of any worth)
that you dilate upon this subject, because I am assured, that al will attend
you with great pleasure and contentment, for the desire every one has to
know the Tyrant, or rather this greedy deuourer of humane hearts. A most
grievous burden (thrice excellent queen) does your majesty lay upon my
shoulders (answered Guicino) in suddenly enioyning me to entreat, of so high
an argument, as love is, in contemplation whereof, the most refined wits have
bin confounded. Nevertheless, to make known how dear the favor of so great a
Queen is unto me, I will courageously attempt the enterprise, hoping that love
himself, unto whom from my cradle I have dedicated my life, will stir up my
invention, and move my tongue, so that conformable to your highness entention, I
may make his noble essence and other mysteries unto him appertaining, most
perspicuous and manifest.

Here Guirino staying and pausing a little with himself, begun afterward in
this manner. Our soul (most excellent queen) being derived from true and
essential beauty, there is in it such an inclination, and knowledge of beauty
impressed, that no sooner by the eye, beauty discovers it self unto her,
but suddenly without any reasonable action rejoicing with her self, she is
greatly delighted. Hereupon it proceeds, that there is not so harsh a spirit
and capacity, which at the presence of some beautiful thing, be it natural
or artificial, slays not with wonder and delight to behold it, although he
can neither comprehend the proportion, order, or any other part of this Beauty.
But in that (most illustrous Queen) as yesterday Signior Patritio made
manifest, Beauty humane, (as the lively image of divinity) surmounteth all
other in this inseriour world, therefore deservedly is it that, which with his
present appearance, has force to inflame and kindle love in the soul of man.
Of which love humane (seeing your majesty so commands) I have determined to
discourese, laying apart that general argument, whereof others super fluously
have entreated: it being rather a certain inclination, which every creature
has to his own particular good, then a true and infailible love. Whe^therfore
we would attain to the prerfect knowledge of any thing, these four things
especially we are wont to seek out: first whether that, after which we seek,
be extant: secondly, what it is: thirdly, from whence it has his original:
and lastly, what end it has. Now therefore, I supposing, (which of all these
Ladies and gentlemen will be granted unto me) that love is: I will pass
over unto the other three sought after, the which I intend to make manifest
unto you, in the description I shall set down of Love: but before I go any
further, I think it not amiss to lay open some definitions. i. two of divine
Plato, and one taken out of Aristotle, for taken out I may very well say,
because be never has defined it. Plato therefore in his book called Phedro,
says, that love is no other thing, but a desire of unition with that which is
Beautiful, and in his Conuiuio, as also in Diotima, he affirms, that love is
a desire of bringing forth that which is beautiful: In like manner, out of the
words of Aristotle in his Rhetoric, may be gathered, that love is no other
but a desire of interchaungeable affection. The words of Platoes first
definition be true, but yet being too much restrained, they declare not
sufficiently the nature of love: the second is only proper to one kind of
humane love, and therefore cannot be taken for a general desinition. That of
Aristotle, notwithstanding it be universal, and has his verification, as
well in love as in good will, being in a manner the end both of one and other,
yet is it somewhat defective, because there wants the efficient cause, as in
it no mention being made of beauty, which properly does generate and preserve
love: but in that the defect of these definitions will be made manifest, in the
consideration of that I intend to propound. I will in this proceed no further,
but come to define humane love, according to the power of my slender wit: and
admit I prevail no further, yet by this means shall I give occasion to these
learned understandings, to think better on it. I affirm, that love is no
other but a forcible perturbation of humane mind, stirred up by some known
beauty, through a secret conformity of Nature, which the lover has toward
the thing beloved, resolving with himself in desire, to be united with this
beauty in love corporeal. That love is violent perturbation of our soul and
mind, it may be confirmed by the authority of Plato in his Conuiuio, where he
terms love a great spirit or Demon: and if the authority of so great a
Philosopher were not sufficient, yet might these noble Ladies give ample
testimonial thereof, who peradventure have felt more then once, and often do
feel the same, in whose delicate and chaste breasts be the most lively and
fervent flames of love, as likewise these amorous young Gentlemen, amongst whom
peradventure, more then one may be found, who at the presence of such a
splendour and beauty, murmuring to himself, may say.

If this be not blind love what may I then, call this my fit?
But Love if that it be, O God, what manner of thing is it?
There is no doubt but among all the passions and affections of mind, love
holds the cheifest place, there being no other affection that makes
alteration, as well in the body as mind, then love does, as Petrarch wittily
expresses. describing in a sonnet his amorous passion, when he says: I find
no peace, and yet to war, dare not be bold:
I fear, and hope, I burn, and yet like ice am cold.


And in another place, I fear and tremble, fry, and freeze. That to procure
love, it is necessary that beauty, as a cause efficient, should be known, it
may be proved by the Philosophers authority, in the ninth of his Moralles,
where he affirms, that it is impossible any one should be enamored, without
he be first drawn unto it by beauty: and the reason also hereof is in
readiness, in that knowledge ever goes before affection, which is no other
but a sudden motion of the sensatiue faculty, and cordial spirits, procured
by a delectable or odious apprehension, resolving either into desire of union
or separation; whereupon ensues either pleasure or grief. I have also placed
that little clause, as necessary in the definition of love, through a secret
conformity of nature, that the lover has with the beloved. For it is not
possible that any should be enamored, except in finding a woman conformable in
beauty to his own proper disposition, the which is testified by the testimony
of Plato in Lyside, where he concludes, that we are enforced, to love that
which is comfortable to our nature: as also by the authority of divine
Petrarch, in the second Stanza of that excellent Sonnet, in the sweet time of
my first years, where he says: I say that from the day Love first assailed
me,
Were many years yspent, and fast away did flee,
So that my youthful hue, I changde for grave and sage,
With frosen thoughts my heart was burdend by that age.
Which had my heart to Adamant converted quite:
Nor tears my breast did wet, with cruel loves despite,
I broke not yet my sleep, and what was not in me,
I deemde most strange in others when I did it see:
Alas what am I now? and what have sometimes been?
By end the life, at evening we the day esteem.
This cruel boy mark well, of whom I do complain,
That until then my garments only did remain,
Hit with his dart: he therefore with his wity snare,
A mighty Dame did catch, when she was unaware,
With whom I never could, or ever can prevail,
By force, wit, penitence, but with these three do fail:
These two have me transformde into this state you see,
Of me a living man making a Laurel tree,
Which planted in cold ground, without leaves cannot be.


Here Petrarch shows, that having in his days seen many fair women, (as it
is likely) he never was enamored, but rather had an heart made of Adamant,
till by that mightre Dame he was surprised, whose Beauty was conformable to
his own proper Nature, and therefore this sweet conformity, is one of the
principallest and most essential causes of Love; which has his original of
no other thing, then from the celestial influences in humane generation:
because these infuse seperately, into every thing, as well without life, as
living, and especially into man's body, a peculiar and particular temperature,
by which every man is in some thing different from another in complexion. From
whence springs diverse inclinations and appetites, in that it cannot be
denied, but that the sensible faculty, having always his operation joined with
the body, follows the temperature of the body; and therefore it is no
marvel (as the Poet says) if every one be transported by his particular
delight, and that the beauty which is apt to ravish the mind of one, scarcely
touches another. This love, which is no other, but that most vehement passion
we spoke of, resolves into a desire of uniting it self, in reciprocal love,
with the thing beautiful: and here let us observe, that though a man has the
greater part of his affections common with other creatures, yet is he from
them very different: for in other creatures, affection, desire, action, if
they be not hindered, they move as it were in one moment, in that they want
reason, which should struggle with sense. But in man, though affection
fodainely moves, yet it is not so readily transformed into desire, or
quickly mooned to action, in that this cannot be without the consent of
reason: the which as a mistress, oftentimes permits not affection to break
forth into desire, or so incontinently to proceed to action: If therefore love
be willing to resolve into desire, of necessity reason must thereunto consent,
it being she that perfectly knows the hope, which is the true foundation of
this desire. Therefore when any rare beauty or pulchritude conformable to our
appetite, discovers it self, it is not in our power at that instant, to
resist amarous affection: but if this beauty be placed in too high a subject,
as in a Princess, hope of unition and love reciprocal, failing in us by the
light of reason, affection is not converted into amarous desire, but rather
into special reverence. By this true conclusion, we may conjecture how vainly
it was spoken by our Poet; Although thou have thy heart placed full high above,
Wail not, though die thou do, and languish in her love.
For it had been a truer sentence to have said: Who placed has his heart
mounting too near the sky,
May well lament, if he languish through want, and die.


That love changes himself into desire of aunswerable affection, these
amorous and valiant Gentlemen, will serve me with most certain and infallible
testimony, who stirred up by such a desire, to make themselves worthy of the
reciprocal love of their affected mistresses, covet ever to perform gentle
and liberal actions: and there is no doubt, but in the heart of every noble
lover, the principallest desire is, to be beloved mutually, and that he had
rather be deprived of the union of love reciprocal, than by union to lose the
mutual and interchangeable affection of his dear affected: and this may
suffice for the definition of love. Yet will I not forbear, to admonish these
most beautiful Ladies, that they be not too presumptuous in the title of
Mistresses, as though they themselves might not likewise come to be lovers:
For though their hearts be built of plaster of Adamant, yet be they not so
hard, but that Love sometimes with his golden arrow may pearse them; therefore
when I say, inamoured, I intend as well women as men; and by a Lover, I give to
understand, both the one and the other. By the same way and mean, that amorous
passion, in humane hearts is engendered, as by beauty being an object to the
sight, and therefore is the mother thereof; so may we affirm with the
authority of Petrarch, that the eyes be guides unto the path of love: and
therefore in the first Terzetto of his Sonnet, he says, there was a day when
the Sun was darkened.

Love, me unarmed altogether found:
And open did make the way, by eyes, my heart to kill,
Which to my tears were foordes, from whence they did distill.
And in the fifth Stanza of the Sonet: so weak the thread is, whereupon my
yrkesome life depends: And also with my heart, let both those lights feel
smart,
Which to the path of love did guide me, to depart:


And not only the lovers cies, as the way, but those also of her beloved do
necessarily concur, to the imprinting of this amorous passion, as affirms
the same Poet in the Sonnet, Love has me set, as white unto the shaft, saying:
Your eyes this mortal blow, did toward me direct,
Against which preuailes no time, nor place can well protect:


And in the Sonnet: O cruel star, if heavens in us have any force,
And cruel woman, of whose eyes I take remorce:
As eke the bow whereto I for a mark did rest.
That made the wound whereby, with love I do not jest.


And in the Sonnet: When by the eyes into the heart profound,
A woman does her lively image send:
Then all things else depart away full round,
And virtue, which the soul does comprehend:
Then leaves the rest of all the members straight
Inimoueable, much like a ponderous weight.


We therefore concluding with the Poet will say, that the eyes be those that
swallow down the Idea of the beauty beloved, and transport it to the Lovers
heart; whereupon the mind incited by that most delectable contentment, enters
into contemplation, and feeling of that influence wherewith it is moved, and by
little and little set on fire, especially when unto this there comes the
reuerberation against them of those most glittering beams, sent forth from
the eyes of the beloved: so that fresh fuel added to the former fire, all
these together inflame with amorous heat. And as it is not in our power (most
noble Queen) to resist amorous affection, as that which in a moment altering
the vital spirits, makes impression in our sensible faculty, so not being
able without the consent of reason, to break forth into desire, it is in our
power to bridle, and induce it to a mediocritie; which if we do not, it is no
more humane love, but made like the love of savage beasts, is termed bestiall.
Wherefore as this disordinate love is the norishment of all vices, so temperate
love, is the principal original of all virtues. Leaving therefore apart this
brutish love, which deserves rather the name, of a luxurious and furious
storm, then of true love, we will divide humane love into three several
kinds, different one from another, in respect of the end to which they are
directed.

The first and excellentest of all the rest, like unto the divine offspring of
that celestial Venus, wherein the Seraphins immeasurably burning, do inflame
with like affection all the rest of the Angelical spirits, is called divine
love. This was defined by Plato in his Phedro, to be no other then a divine
fury, which reduces to memory the form of true beauty, in that far from
all brutish action, in the only contemplation of his fair and dear beloved,
he rests satisfied; who beholding beauty as the Image of Divinity, raises
up by that means his mind to meditate on that beauty which is perfect and
celestial. This divine lover desires that his dear affected should be set on
fire, with so holy, chaste, and immaculate a love toward him. With such love,
not only young men, but old, religious, and men married may be inamoted; and
it is in the highest and most perfect degree of temperature. The second kind,
without contaminating chaste thoughts, rejoices only in beholding,
discoursing, and conuersing with his beloved, as also by her to be mutually
affected. This is discrepant, from that in the divine lover, insomuch as
admiring humane beauty, without lifting up the mind to that from whence she had
her beginning, he meditateth on this beauty humane, not as the Image and
representation of Divinity, but as if it were most true and essential beutie,
and rejoices in this contentment: this is called chaste love, and is in the
second degree of temperance. It se emeth kissing unto this Love, is permitted
for a reward; in that a kiss is rather the conjunction of soul then body, for
by mean of a kiss, a most pleasing passage, of the liueliest spirits being
procured both from the one and others heart, the souls of lovers remain so
bound together by the undivided knot of love, that of two there is made one,
which compounded after this manner, governs two bodies, and therefore those
chastely enamored, desire to attain to a kiss, as being a true connection of
the soul. Wherefore the divine Philosopher in his Conuiuio, speaking of one
inamored with chaste love says, that kissing, the soul comes into the
lips, from whence it flies out, and is received.

The third kind of humane love, is that, which resolves into desire of
unition, with the thing beautiful, not only in mind, but also corporally,
yet by lawful and honest mean; and this love is that, which is the beginning
of thrice sacred Matrimony, and in this, not only an union of reciprocal
love, but also a desire of eternity is discovered; for by mean of this
lascivious love, a man communicating his own proper kind, being frail,
makes himself eternal. Thus much Plato gave to understand, when he said,
Love is a desire of bringing forth that which is beautiful: although this
definition has by others been diversely interpreted, they supposing, that the
divine philosopher understood it by that love, wherewith Socrates loved fair
and goodly young men; which resolved into a desire of generating in their gentle
wits, his noble conceits and moral virtues. There follows (most excellent
Queen) and with this I will finish my discourse, as the shadow a body, so this
love, a most cruel passion, which many times with his bitter poison, appalleth
and infesteth the happy state of the lover: This is wicked jealousy, which is
no other but a passion that assaileth and freezeth the inamoured heart by
imminent danger of leesing, or to be hindered in the mutual affection of his
beloved: This takes beginning and nourishment, from the lovers understanding
the want of some perfection in himself, which in his corriuall is abundant
and plentiful.

Here Signior Guirino held his peace, and judging that he had sufficiently
satisfied the commandment of the Queen, would have retired himself. When
the Queen beckened unto him, that he should sit still, and commanded the Lady
Tarquinia Molza, with all the other gentlewomen, that they should move
questions to Signior Guirino in the argument of love, that by this gentle
exercise, they might beguile the time, till the coming of his Highness.

This noble desire of your Majesty, answered then the Lady Tarquinia smiling,
is unto me singular good hap, and fortune, seeing by this occasion I hope to
reduce my mind to tranquillity, which now is greatly troubled for that which
Signior Guirino has said, holding opinion, that love is procured in us, by a
secret conformity of nature, which the lover has with his beloved, and that
this conformity depends on the heavens: which being true, how shall I be
free from this amorous storm, notwithstanding I now ride to my great
contentment in safe port and harbor? for how shall I be able to avoid, that
a beauty conformable to my Nature presenting it self before my eyes, I may
not enter into this tempestuous sea of love? I beseech you therefore by your
wonted courtesy (Signior Guirino) explane unto me, whether love comes by
election or destiny. You should (Madam Tarquinia) be over highly conceited in
your self, answered Guirino, and too cruel against love, if as you are
always beloved, so you should be secure from being inamored, and that destiny
could not chastise your ingratitude: that love proceeds from celestial
influence, it is confirmed by Petrarch, and especially in the fifth Stanza of
his Sonet, or sestine, which begins thus: To any creature that does harbor
on the earth, saying: I think that in the wood there feeds no such beast
By night, nor yet by day, that is, so fair at least
As she whom I do seek, by shadow, and the son
Not weary, for my sleep, when morning it does come,
So though my mortal body on the earth does mous,
Yet does my firm desire come from the stars above.


Here he confesses that his firm and constant love toward Laura, proceeded
from the stars, that is, from celestial influence, and in the seventh Stanza
of the Song. That my old sweet, yet wicked Lord, speaking in the person of
Love, he says thus: As each one by his star, does seem to be ordainde,
From servile love of maids, I could not be detaind.


And in the Sonnet, It may be some will think that in commending her: in the
third Terzetto he says: Thy state divine, by mortal tongue cannot expressed
be:
Love by election does not draw, but even by destiny.


To absolve this doubt, and not leave you perplexed, I say that love is planted
in the heart of man by destiny, but it takes there no root, but by election:
This is evident by the definition of Love: For he by a known beauty is
incited, through the secret conformity of nature, that the Lover has with his
affected, so that it is not in our power, when conformable beauty discovers
it self to effect, that in us amorous passion should not be moved, as
likewise we cannot procure, that others affections, whose subject is the part
irascible, may not exercise their force, amiddest fear, and such like: but in
that these affections cannot resolve into desire, as we have said, if reason do
not thereto consent, from whose agreement springs election; it follows that
love cannot change into desire, or take root in man's heart, but by election,
which is an action of free will, neither can it by the stars be violated, or
have hinderance, as Petrarch speaking of himself affirms, in the last Stanze
but one of his song: Alas that I am ignorant where hope is to be found,
saying: No planet does me thus condemn to wail,
When that my sight is dimde by mortal veil;
What fault is in the stars, or things in beauty that prevail?
The Poet covering to infer, that though the stars incline, yet enforce they
not a man, to offer himself as it were a pray to love, but all proceeds from
our election. I am but slooderly comforted, answered the Lady Tarquinia, in
this your conclusion, for if it be true which both Petrarch and Ariosto
affirm, that love depriueth liberty, and that he can be brideled with no bit
(election being an action of freewil,) shall have no place in his Kingdom, and
in truth experience shows, that Love manageth his Empire with violence, and
where there is least hope of union and Love reciprocal, there banishing reason
from her seat, he principally makes trial of his force. Unhappy Mirrha was
inflamed with the love of her own fathermiserable Canace with her brother
Macareus, and unbridled Phedra with the love of most chaste Hippolytus, being
overcome by amorous passion: Pasiphae for love of a Bull frequented the woods,
and that incontinent young man Guido animated, by this most cruel tyrant
defiled in the Temple, that most beautiful statue of Venus: and who will say,
that the foundations of these loves were laid in any action of reason, and not
confess, that these unfortunate lovers were provoked to this disordinate love,
rather by destiny than election? To conclude therefore, that love takes root
in man's heart, by election, in my judgment is no other, but to open the eyes
of love, and of a blind boy, to make him a wakefull and vigilant old man. My
conclusion, learned Lady, (answered Guirino) ought to give you so much the
more consolation, by how much for the most part it falls out to be true, and
after such a manner true, as those unnatural and sordide affections, which so
greatly amaze you, are recounted but for wonderful accidents. Undoubtedly they
were bestial inamorations, as brutish likewise all those shall be, which are
rooted in humane hearts, without the action of reason: of which you are not to
presume in your self, in whom reason uses to command, and sense to obey.
For virtue having already taken certain possession of your most beautiful
mind, it will be easy for you, ever to extinguish the disordinate flames of
Love; but if destiny set before your eyes, conformable beauty, you beholding it
as the representation of divinity, and sauished with divine love, will
prosently transform your self into the same divinity.

I am contented to accept (Signior Guirino) of these last words, answered the
Lady Tarquinia, no less for commendation, then consolation, neither will I
urge further: Then the Lady Camilla Canala, a matrone of magnificont presence
and high wit, took occasion to propound a doubt; I would also willingly know
said she, seeing love is planted in humane hearts by destiny, and takes root
by election, whether it be in the Lovers power to extirpate it, for of this I
greatly doubt. You have great reason to doubt (said Guirino) for by the
Philosophers consent, it is much more hard to resist the appetite of desire,
then of anger. And Plato in his Timeo affirms, that cupiditie gives no ear
to reason, but no sooner is stirred up by sense, then that immediately she is
ravished, by these viewed representations: in which opinion Plutarch agrees.
Love then being the principal affection of the part concupiscent, and yet
notwithstanding the beauty of the beloved being to the lover represented by
sense and imagination, as it has annexed unto it I know not what manner of
violence, which forcibly rauisheth the soul of the lover, so is it impossible
that the lover taken by that bait, should clear himself, as Petrarch
affirms of himself, saying: The more I hope my heart will shun this cruel
bait,
The more on beauties hook to fasten, I awaite.
And in another place also, speaking of himself, he clearly shows, that it
is not in the lovers power to break the amorous cord, but in that sonnet
especially. If I rauish't with fond desire, do make great haste,
To follow her that flies away from me so fast:
And loosed from the bonds of love, does run full swift,
Before my snailing pace, that scarce my foot can lift:
And calling back my self into securer path,
She to attend me then, the lesser pleasure has:
And vain it is to spur, or yet to fly away,
When I by loves desire made restiue, needs must stay.


And in the other sonnet.

Oh pleasant liberty, what trial I have had
Since thy departure, to conceive that state so bad
Wherein I have remainde, since first I took the wound,
Of which there never could yet any cure be found:
These eyes did then de light so greatly in their woe,
As reasons bridle could not curb their doing so.
And in the second Stanze of the song, when destiny will have it so, he says:
So mighty was that fond desire, which me transported hence,
That reason dead her bridle served for small use or defense.


And in the fixed Stanze of the Sonnet: If I do meditate in thought, she does me
straight assail.

This shows evidently, that seeing love has possession of man's heart, it is
in man's power to acquit, himself of him, saying: My folly I perceive, and
truth do plainly see,
Though daseled, cruel Love by means inforceth me:
That never suffers him in honors path to tread,
That thereinto does think he will him surely lead:
And presently even now, into my heart does come,
A light, yet sharp disdain and troublesome:
Which every thought that was before conceald:
Does in my forehead place, to ulmen then reueald:
What mortal thing on earth should we so dearly love:
Like to immortal God, who has his throne above?
Unhappy he, that greatest honor does attain,
In this: which often reason also does reclaim:
That drawn by senses, leaves eft soones the rightway.
But yet in hatred, or in hope, she does gainsay,
Bad customs to dissolve, but forward does advance,
Painting out that, whereon mine eyes casting a glaunce:
May make me think her borne, my death for to procure,
Because she pleased her self, and me too much, most sure:


Ariosto concludes the same, in the Stanze which begineth.

Now out alas, whereof justly may I lament,
But of Desire, which has me over stiffly bent.
Where he adds: And who can bridle that which nsuer had no rain,
Assured that to death at length she will me train,
Because attending grief, augmented is my pain.


Notwithstanding, I little regarding the authority of these Poets, seeing they
have but weak minds, I hold the contrary for truth: and that we have power
to free our selves of amorous passion, when, or in what manner soever we please:
and to the end most gentle Lady, together with these other Gentlewomen, you may
comprehend the truth, examining the matter a little more deeply, I say, that
the most excellent and great God (principally Architect, of this worldly frame)
having with all beauty bedecked the celestial regions with angelical Spirits,
furnishing the heavenly spheres with souls eternal, and having replenished
this inferior part with all manner of plants, herbs, and living creatures.
The divine majesty desirous to have an artisicer, who might consider the
reason of so high a work, admire the greatness, and love the beauty thereof,
in the end made man, being of al worldly creatures the most miraculous, but
this divine workman having before the creation of man, dispensed proportionably
of his treasures to al creaturet, and every kind of living thing, prescribing
unto them infallible laws, as to plants nourishment, to living creatures sense,
and to Angels understanding, and doubting with what manner of life he should
adorn this his new heir, this divine artificer, in the end determined to
make him unto whom he could not assign any thing in proper, partaker of all that, which the others enjoyed, but in particular, whereupon calling him unto
him, he said: Live O Adam, in what life pleases thee best, and take unto thy
self those gifts which thou esteemest most dear. From will this so liberal a
grant (most gracious Lady) had our free his original, so that it is in our
power, to live like a plant, living creature like a man, and lastly as an
Angel: for if a man addict himself only to feeding and nourishment, he
becomes a Plant, if to things sensual, he is as a brute beast, if to things
reasonable and civil, he grows a celestial creature: but if he exalt the
beautiful gift of his mind, to things invisible and divine, he transfourmeth
himself into an Angel; and to conclude, becomes the son of God. To affirm
therefore, that we have not power to free our selves from love, after he has
planted his root in our hearts, is no other but to reject the most high gift
granted unto us by the chief creator, for our great perfection, and to say
that we can live no otherwise then creatures irrational, which are wholly bent
to sensuality, is a matter altogether false, seeing by the act of reason, we
may reduce all affections to mediocritie, and pacify these disordinate motions
of our mind: and amongst the rest, this of love. The Lady Camilla was satisfied
with this solution, which although it was commended, yet gave it some young men
not liking there of occasion to mutter, that the empire of love was utterly
destroyed, and that after their so wonderful excess, he should not have
authority, to make them so much as a safe conduct, or cover them under his
great wings, they holding that sentence true: That easily then all scuse we
admit,
When Love of blame, is worthy thought and fit.


But the Lady Syluia Villa, whose turn it was now to speak by propounding her
doubt, caused silence: and her question was, whether long distance and
separation increases or diminishes love. That distance increseth love
(answered Gui rino) is very conformable to reason, by how much the want is
greater, by so much the more is desire augmented: The Lover therefore by reason
of separation, being more destitute of union, causes his amorous desire to be
the greater, or at least impaireth it not at all. As Petrarch affirms in the
last Terzetto, when time and place before mine eyes I set, saying.

That sun which on mine eyes alone does shine,
With splendant beams does scorch me often time,
Being the same at night, it was early in the morn,
Which far off does me burn, with grief, and eke with scorn.
And fresh in memory, each hour does represent,
The knot, the time, the place of my most fond intent.
Here Petrarch shows that his being in Italy far from Laura, did not
extenuate his love, in that the beauty thereof burned so much the more ardently,
and remained always the more fresh in memory, and confirmed. Notwithstanding
I (most famous Lady) to resolve this doubt, make this arbitrament, that if this
separation be but for short time, it does not diminish, but rather increase
love, through the hope of sudden return: but if it be for any long time or
continuance, it does not only impair, but utterly extinguish love, which is
plainly manifested by this reason: for by what mean love is procured, by the
self same it is preserved. Love therefore having production in man's heart, by
mean of the eyes and sight, we may with good reason couclude, that the sight
of his dear beloved, is that, which sweetly nourishes love: and therefore we
see, that one nor other thing, lovers are more ententiue, then to behold their
affected: whereas by great distant separation, the food and nourishment of
love failing, of necessity pining away through want, he must needs be
weakened, and in the end perish. The Lady Syluia remained satisfied, and Madam
Camilla Costabile peceruing all the company to expect her proposition, without
further delay, moved this question: whether iealosie were a token of great
love. When, Guirino replied, it seems noble Lady, that ielosie is a sign of
special love, for we usually say, that whosoever greatly loves, he is not
without fear, jealousy being no other but a maruailous fear, as before we
affirmed. To resolve therefore this doubt, I say that the heart of him greatly
enamored, is the proper subject of this most bitter passion, which we term
ielosie, yet does it not so presently take impression, which is a manifest
sign, that the great heat then begins to qualify: and when ielosie
proceeds so far that hope remains dead, by the victory fear has
obtained, then that so fervent love, enclining by little and little toward
his contrary, is transformed into hatred and disdain. Jealousy therefore is a
sign of affectionate love past, and slender affection present. This answer
pleased the Lady Camilla. And the Queen beckened to the Lady countess of
Sala, that she should move her scruple: This most beautiful, and in all her
actions and gestures most gracious Lady, besides her other rare qualities, is
so ready of utterance, and full of ingenious conceits, that she procures the
astonishment of all them that behold, or attend her. After she had therefore
paused a while, she spoke in this sors. You have defined love to be no other
but a defire of union; if this were true, it would likewise follow, that in
things beloved, after the union and possession of beauty, love should rest
extinguished: for where there is no want, there can be no desire, and yet
experience teaches the contrary, that after enioyance of the beloved, we yet
in love make further progression. My question therefore shall be, whether
after possession of beauty, love remains extinguished.

This doubt (most excellent lady, is of no small importance) answered Guirino)
because it dissenteth from reason, that we should desire the things we have
already in our power. Notwithstanding I would affirm, (always excepting
better judgment) that love may be maintained living in two wants, the one is
in the wa^to of simple union, and the other in want of union perpetual: after
enioyance of beauty, the first want of simple union cease, and then arifeth
the want of perpetual union, for when we enjoy a thing present, yet are we
by and by in want, of that which is to come, which want is of force, to
maintain living this desire, that we term Love: and therefore in that State,
love is no other but a desire of perpetual enjoying the thing beloved. With
this excellent distinction Guirino satisfied the Lady Countess and all the
standers by: when the Lady Camilla Beuelacqua cast out her doubt after this
manner: In the definition of Love, you affirmed, that it sprung from the
knowledge of Beauty: this in my judgment brings with it some difficulty, in
that we see by experience, that some contemning the thing truly beautiful,
grow enamoured with that, which to all others seems deformed and odious,
therefore necessarily you must affirm, that either deformity to another may
seem beauty, or else that not always beauty, but deformity also sometimes,
may be the mother of love: clear therefore unto me this doubt, that your
desinition remain not imperfect. As things material and corruptible, fair
Lady, answered Guirino, can never be so beautiful, as that in them some
defect may not be discovered, so do they never carry with them such
deformity, that some steps of beauty may not appear, for the evil
disposition of matter cannot so greatly resist the Ideall form and reason, but
that in it the excellency of the divine artificer will discover it self. They
therefore, which unto many seem deformed, are never without some beautiful
point, which being never so little, when it shall be conformable to another
nature, in such a one will it be of such force to stir up Love, and there
is no doubt but our minds, as in the rest, so also in love, are very diverse,
and therefore some are enamoured with a beautiful mouth, and sweet smiling
countenance, others with a fair breast, or iuory neck, some with delicate and
white hands, others with the breath and comely grace, or some other hidden
beauty in a woman: who no sooner bait their wings on this loving limetwigge,
but blind in all other deformities of their beloved, beholding only that
part wherewith their mind is contented, they deem their own mistress of
all other most worthy, to be beloved and served: and so likewise, the least
blemish in any fair woman may prevail so far in his mind, unto whose
nature and disposition it shall be disproportionable and displeasing, as
contemning all other perfections, he shall judge her unworthy of any man's
love. This therefore is true, that love proceeds from known beauty, because
of deformity, hatred, and of beauty, love is the legitimate of spring.

This answer was commended: and the Lady Leonora Sacrati further replied: tell
me Signior Guirino, if love be the self same with desire, why does your
definitions, lately delivered, call it in question, and yet Leon the Jew in his
third dialogue of love, says, that love is no other but a desire, which is
also conformable to experience, seeing we love because we desire, and desire
because we love. Leon the Jew, a man questionless of quick and excellent
wit, answered Guirino, has in this committed an error as one that
contradicts him self in the first Dialogue, wherein he distinguishes love
from desire: but to resolve your doubt, I auerre, that if we consider love as
an affection, it is as different from desire, as the beginning from the
midst: seeing love is that sudden and first motion, which grows in man's
mind through apprehension of conformable beauty, which without consent of
hope, disturbeth that mind, and altering the heart and desire grounded upon
hope, follows love, it being a mean to attain to the end, which is union
with beauty. Notwithstanding, love is taken for desire, because after the
first motion it is transformed into desire, and then it is true that we love,
because we desire, and desire, because we love. The L. Leonora replied no
further: but Madam Tarquinia Molza: It seems, added she, that this your
conclusion is contrary to the Philosopher, for he in his Politikes says thus,
that none can love, except he first be delighted with beauty, and he thus
delighted in beauty, loves not suddenly, but then loves, when he desires,
the thing beloved being absent, and has to it as great a zeal being present.

Our of these words we collect, that desire preceed eth and follows not
love We must observe (learned Lady) (answered Guirino) that the Philosopher
speaks not of love in this place, as it is a perturbation, and that first
motion by us before spoken of: but intends it by loving action, desirous to
infer, that the Lover is not brought to such act, before Love be resolved
into a desire of the thing beloved; and this is so far from being contrary,
as that it is conformable to all our pofitions. The Lady Tarquinia highly
commended this clear explication of Aristotle's words, and using no further
speech, the Lady Victoria Tassona propounded her doubt after this sort.
Hitherto you have discoursed of love, we giving attention, not knowing as yet,
whether love be a good or discommendable thing, when notwithstanding this most
principally should be taught: for all our desires and actions being moved from
the knowledge of good and evil, we flying always known evil, and following
the good: who is he that would not avoid love, if he thought it wicked, or
would not follow it, esteeming it good: resolve me therefore of this doubt,
whether love be good or wicked. Petrarch wittily disputes, (answered Guirino)
upon this problem, in the Song, That my old Lord, Wicked, though sweet he
seem,
Made to appear before the Queen on hie:
Whom of our parts divine, men gouernesse do deem,
Having her seat above the lofty azurde sky.


Where he faining to cite love, before the tribunal of reason, accuses him
as wicked and perverse: and love defends him self; in the end of which
conflict, reason having heard, both the one and other part, leaves the
controversy undecided, saying: Suffice it; that to your complaints,
I have attended well:
But yet more time this strife requires,
Allerrour to repel.


Notwithstanding the reasons are not of light importance, by which our minds
should be induced to believe, that love is a wicked thing. First, in that it is
an exceeding perturbation of our mind; and perturbations being contrary to
tranquillity, which is one of the principallest conditions of humane
felicity, being good of it self, and to be desired, and therefore of
necessity al those of themselves are wicked and odious: secondly, because he
depriueth us of liberty: thirdly, for that further he co^tending with reason,
auoydeth al good operations: As Petrarch affirms, complaining him self, of
love, in the third Stanza of this underwritten Sonnet, saying: These have me
made less for to love my God,
Then that I ought, and less my self also,
One woman has me scourged with this rod,
That equally, all thoughts procure me woe.


And a little more underneath, Thus am I now dispoilde of my sweet liberty,
By my most cruel foe, whom I accuse and fly.


And in the triumph of love: Of us I will now speak, and first of that great
man,
That of our life and liberty dispoile us can,
The same whom all the world calls Love, as I do learn:
But bitter, as you see, and better shall discern,
If of your quiet thoughts, he prove the sovereign sire,
As in our hearts his thoughts do kindle burning fire.


And further, love is a cause, that loosing our selves, we are transformed
into another, as Petrarch affirms of him self in the Song by me cited.

These two have me transformed into the state you see,
Of me, a living man, making a Laurel tree,
Which planted in cold ground, without leaves cannot be.
And in the third chapter of love: Of my great enemy the path I searched out,
And seeking her to find, I was transformd throughout:
As lover to be loved, possessed out of doubt.


Ariosto also supposes, that Love, for the most part, is a wicked thing, when
he says: Love we do not therefore so wicked always find,
But that sometimes he helps, as well as hurtes the mind.


Notwithstanding most gente Lady, I am of a contrary opinion, and hold, that
love is a most excellent thing, and necessary to a good and happy life: but I
understand not this by bestiall love: For this undoubtedly is wicked, and that
which depriueth of liberty, and auoydeth all good operations, there being no
greater servitude then sin: and this peradventure Petrarch understood when he
said:

These have me caused less to love my God, But speaking of other sorts of
love, all are good, and profitable to a man: and coming to the first, which
for his excellency, is called divine love: this is most excellent, in that
being a desire of unition, with the thing beutifull, as the true Image of
Divinity, by mean of humane creature, it lifts up the mind to love
beauty, and is inflamed with incredible love toward his Creator. Neither can
that love be termed wicked, which bursteth out into desire, of generating by
honest mean, the thing beautiful, in that being joined with a desire of
eternity, of al other, it procures the greatest good to mankind. But what
shall we say of the other kind of love, placed in the second degree of
temperance? may we peradventure affirm it wicked, seeing far from all
brutish action, in the contemplation of beauty only, and reciprocal
affection of his dear beloved he contents him self? This is that perfect
degree of love, which enflameth the hearts of men to glorious enterprises.
Wherefore Petrarch calling to mind his error, in this Sonnet under all
cadged, when he so rashly indignified Love, in the sixth Stanza, and also in the
rest of the Sonnet he faineth him self by love, taxed of ingratitude, saying:
My mortal foe, with bitter frumps assayes,
But, woman, mark the other part, always:
Which shall the truth declare with faithful heart,
How thus ingrate, this man came to depart:
In youth he did apply, him self to selling
Words wholly vain, and lies eke eftsoons telling:
And as it seems, he was no whit ashamde:
Moved by this mean, to make me eke be blamde,
With my delight, which does most pure remain
From his desire, which would me gladly stain:
And in sweet life, which he vexation calls
Some follies to lament, he freshly falls,
When by my help, he glorious does remain,
Which of him self, he never could attain.


And alittle afterward in the same Song: Under my wings I did him so conuoy,
That Knights and Ladies in his speech took joy,
And afterward him to that fame did bring,
As that among ripest wits his name did ring:
And of his words, conseruaes they did make,
Who in his speech so great delight did take:
Though now in court some sycophant he be,
Or with the vulgar sort in base degree.


And in the last Stanza saving one, he affirms that this love is acceptable
to God and men.

Never was nightly dream, so fond and vain,
As that opinion, which he does retain
Of us: whom now he perfectly does know
Favored of God above, and men below:
This lofty sire, for this laments Itrow.
We will conclude therefore, that love is a good and sweet thing: and more,
whosoever finds not him self inueigled with some of these loving snares, is
but a sottish man, and of the common sort. It remains that I answer the
contrary arguments, for better understanding: Be it therefore known unto
you, that the perturbations and affections of the mind, are no other but
sudden and forcible motions of the concupiscent and angry faculties stirred up
by the knowledge of things delightful or noisome, as I have said, these being
procured by Nature her self, who does nothing in vain, or which is not
conformable to divine providence, and therefore cannot be said to be wicked;
for that were no other than to reprehend God, and Nature her self, who gave
unto man the virtue of the angry and concupiscent faculties: affections
therefore in themselves, are rather good and necessary to the creatures and
man, than wicked; for without them, the parts individual, and kind, could not
be preserved, considering that these move the creature to action, yet may they
be wicked in a man, when resolving into desire, they obey not reason, for then
they become brutish: wherefore affections touching man, may be compared to a
horse, who bridled, is very good and profitable, but hurtful without bit;
because casily he carries the rider away headlong, affections being greater
benefit to man, then to other unreasonable creatures: for man without
affections, should be also without virtue, virtue being no other, then an
habit, imprinted in our angry and concupiscent faculties, by mean of which all
other affections are easily reduced to mediocritie, and therefore, as S.
Augustine says, to a Christian, concupiscence and anger be necessary, to
stir up temperance, continence, tollerance, and fortitude. And the same
Saint in the fourteenth book of the city of God affirms, that affections
agree well, with the beloved of God; saying: that the Citizens of the holy
city, who live according to God, in the pilgrimage of this life, do fear,
are angry, desirous, sad, and merry: but because in these, love has a good
ordination, in them all these perturbations are moderate and good: whereupon
that shrill Trumpet of truth said: be angry, but sin not: to which opinion
conforming my self, I also say; love Oyee gentle young men, and be enamoured
you fair, and most gracious Ladies, for love is a good thing; but sin not.
This excellent conclusion, was with great contentment, especially of the vong
gentlemen accepted and praised: but after their whisperings were somewhat
ceased, the Lady Countess Tieni, a woman of most lofty conceit, whose turn
it was to propound, bethinking her self a little. At last: I would willingly
know said she, whether the beloved, be bound to reciprocation in love, and by
what reason: if we enter into consideration of Loves definition, which you
Signior Guirino have made, this seems an Iniunction, not only of courtesy,
but also of necessity. For that secret conformity of nature, which is
between the lover and the beloved, as it forces him inamored to love, so
ought it to urge in her affected, an answerable love. For besides that
(crediting me) things of conformable nature, should have a conformable desire,
and inclination. Yet further, if we attribute any thing to Dant a Poet of
great authority, we will be ready to affirm that Love is so just a Lord,
that he exempteth none beloved fro loving, but with his mighty power, and
burning firebrands he enflameth the hearts of all them beloved, with love
mutual toward their lovers. Notwithstanding how may we credit this,
beholding the tears and hot sighs of these inamored young Gentlemen, who show
manifest tokens of the cruelty of their ungrateful Mistresses? Put me
therefore out of this doubt. Ariosto and Petrarch were of contrary opinion to
Dant, answered Guirino, who in diverse places affirm, that Love does not force
and bind the beloved to affect; but on the contrary, seldom are the desires
of her beloved, correspondent to those of her lover: and therefore Ariosto
complaining him self, says: Wherefore does Love unjust, so seldom frame our
will,
To answer him with love, with love whom we do kill,
Perfidious wretch, from whence does it proceed,
That thou with discordance, two several hearts do feed?


And alittle after: Why do thou laugh and joy, feed, and maintain thy life:
Procuring from the eyes, fountains of tears by strife.


And Petrarch makes the subject, of one part of his Sonnets and Songs,
sometimes of the cruelty and ingratitude of his Laura, otherwhiles of the
treachery of love, and especially in the Sonnet, There was a day when sun
obscured dark:

Saying in the last Terzetto: Love me (alas) unarmed, altogether found,
And open did make the way, by eyes, my heart to kill,
When I transfixed by his grievous mortal wound,
Made of my eyes wet foordes, from whence tears did distille
Yet as I think by that, he little honor gaind,
Wounding me in such state, wherein I was detaind,
You armed, not his bow, once to behold constraind.


And in the Sonnet by me cited, he says, speaking of love: This cruel boy
market well of whom I now complain,
That until then my garments only did remain,
Hit with his dart: he therefore in his wily snare
Amightie Dame did catch, when she was unaware,
With whom I never could, or ever can prevail,
By force, wit, penitence, but with these three do fail.


And in the third Stanza of the Sonnet which begins: In time when heavens
are furiously enclinde,

He says: Ah cruel Love, that do me thus enforce,
Of this wild beast, causer of my remorce,
The voice to follow, pace, and eke the path,
When she unbound, does fly far from thy wrath.


For absolution therefore of this doubt, I say that the natural conformity
which is between the lover and beloved, is a conformity between the object
and forcible power, for the beloved with her beauty, concurreth as object, and
there is but seldom conformity between the one and others power: And
therefore it may easily fall out, that the beauty of the affected may be apt
and conformable, to move the mind of the Lover, when in very deed the
beauty of the Lover, shall not have the like conformity in the mind of the
beloved, or be preualent to kindle in her amorous passion. For this cause the
Poets fained, that Love had two sorts of darts, that is some gilded, and others
of lead, and that those gilded had power to inflame, and those of lead to
congeale and freese: as also that he pierced lovers with his golden shafts,
when the beloved, were for the most part stricken with the leaden ones, and
therefore Petrarch willing to clear him self, swears saying: If I may say
so much, Love with his golden dart
Charge on me, when those of lead, fall to her part.


Notwithstanding she beloved, is bound by election, perceiving the loiall and
faithful service of her servant, to return the like mutual affection, which
not doing, she falls into the error of ingratitude, in that she beloved
receives secret honor and commendation, by this affection of her lover, she
showing in that most notable perfection, and such, as that it urges him to be
enamored, to love and serve her, and so much the more she must hold herself
bound, if she perceive her self beloved with one of those kinds of love
before rehearsed: for if she observe her self affected with this brutish and
sordide love, she is no ways bound to answerable affection, neither for this
shall she be deemed ingrate, but rather in hating such a lover, she deserves
praise and commendation. The Lady Countess replied no further: And Madam
Camilla Mosti propounded her doubt, which was, whether it were better to love
or be beloved. That to love is better (answered Guirino) may be affirmed by
the Philosophers authority, for to love is action, and with some contentment,
being good, but from the beloved there proceeds no action: and moreoner it is
better to know then be known, and the Lover knows, but she affected as
having love made to her, may be deprived of knowledge, and therefore things
without life may be beloved, but never love: finally, the lover in loving,
exercises the work of charity, which does not the beloved: And therefore the
Philosopher affirms, that to delight in loving rather than to be beloved, is
a more commendable thing, and a sign of greater excellency in good custom
and fashion. On the other side, it seems, that to be beloved is greater
perfection; for to love, being the same as to desire, proves want of
perfection in the lover, wherein she beloved does abound: and further, by how
much the final cause is more perfect tha^ the efficie^t so much does the
beloved exceed in perfection the lover, in that she affected concurreth as the
loving and desired end, and the lover is procured to love, in favor of her
affected, or to receive from her some perfection. Now clearing this doubt, I
say, that this word to love, may be interpreted in two senses; one is, to
desire unition with the thing beloved, to the end to obtain perfection from
it; the other, in desiring to give unto the thing beloved some perfection. In
the first sense, as riches is better than poverty, so is it better to be
beloved than affect.

And in this manner are the kinds of humane love fette down by me; for the
lover seeks union with the beloved, to obtain perfection from her beauty,
where of he has want. After this sort likewise does the creature love his
Creator, seeking unition with him, for to participate of his perfection. In the
second sense, it is a thing much more excellent to love, than be beloved: for
in the lover we suppose plenty, and in the beloved penury. With this love God
loves the creature, and desires to unite it with his divine Majesty, to
reach unto it full perfection. With this love the Prince loves his subjects,
and the greater his inferior, to give and not receive perfection.

Out of this we have spoken, you (most honorable Lady) shall gather this
singular conclusion, that all loves have their original from abundance or
defect, as the divine Philosopher affirms in his Conuiuio, and in his book
called Lyside, faining that Poro, which signifies riches, is the father, and
Penia, which imports poverty, is the mother of love. For love springs
either from the penury of the Lover, or wealth of the beloved, or from want in
the beloved, and superaboundance in the Lover. The Lady Camilla commended the
answer, and all the other Gentlewomen, wishing within themselves, to be rather
rich affected, then poor inamored. The Lady Lucretia Machiauella propounded
this excellent question: whether is more fervent, the love of a man toward a
woman, or of a woman toward a man?

Most gentle Lady answered Guirino, the reasons are not of small moment, by
which we may conclude, that women exceed in love, whereof the first is
perfection, which women receive from unition with man, as by the Philosopher it
is confirmed, where he entreats of universal beginnings of things natural:
who desirous to show the great desire, the first matter has of unition with
form, says, that she desires form, as the female desires the male: and
this is in no other respect, but because matter requires perfection from
form, as does the female from the male. Woman therefore attayning perfection
from man, and not man from woman, so amorous desire in her is more eminent then
that in man. But further, if we shall but consider the proper subject and
abode of love, we shall find that it is in soft and delicate hearts, the
which continually are nourished with sweet and pleasing cogitations, as divine
Petrarch here testifies, speaking of loves original, when he says: From
idle mind, and want onnesse humane
He springes: nourisht with thoughts, though sweet, yet vain,
And of vain folk, does Lord and God remain.


Women therefore being naturally soft, delicate, and usually idle, being
nourished with sweet and pleasant cogitations: and on the contrary, men
being stern, and for the most part, entangled in serious meditations, we may
conclude, that love taking greater nourishment in the heart of a woman,
becomes also more preualent and vigorous. Although I, notwithstanding these
reasons, do hold the contrary for truth, and that amorous passion is much
more vehement in man then in woman: and I am moved thereto by this most
probable supposition, that the more preualent cause, brings forth the more
forcible effect. The beauty then of woman being far more excellent then
that of man, as Signior Patritio yester day showed: and beauty being the cause
which produces love, it will follow, that the beauty of a woman shall bring
forth in man's heart amorous affection: much more ardently, then shall the
beauty of a man, in the heart of a woman: and therefore reason wills, that
the name of beloved be attributed to the woman, and the name of Lover to man,
being proper to a woman (and reward of her beauty) to be beloved and served of
man, man's property confisting in loving and serving her, as his natural
mistress. That this is true, experience teaches, for a woman seldom pricked
forward with a morous affection, is moved to love a man, or if she loves,
she does it but to avoid the vice of ingratitude, knowing her self to be
beloved, and faithfully served.

It is no marvel then, if in the heart of a Woman, this fire being always
so slenderly kindled, it is in possibility by every blast of disdain, to be
extinguished, and that she is so apt to change, will, and mind. Answeting
therefore, unto the contrary reasons, and first to the authority of the
Philosopher, I say it is true, that the first matter desires form as the
female the male. For as the female, which in this respect represents Nature,
desires the male, not for her own perfection, because she is most perfect,
but for the conservation of her proper kind, and for general perfection, so
matter desires not form for her perfection, because she in her own essence
is perfect enough: neither being matter, has it need of form, but she
desires the union of form, for general perfection, to the end this
composition might be made. To the other reason I answer, that the heart of
women is far more soft and delicate then is man's, and she is idle, nourished
with sweet and pleasant cogitations, but I deny these to be the principal
harbourers of amorous passions, although indeed they be easy and plaint
subjects of compassion. For the tender and gentle heart of a woman not being
able to endure the fervent sighs, tears, and lamentations of her faithful
Lover, is procured to satisfy him with mutual affection, by compassion rather
subdued, then amorous passion.

I doubt Signior Guirino, replied the Lady Machiauella, that you have rather
procured your self diminution, then attribution of our favor, your demerite
deserving the one so much more above the bond wherein we are tied to render the
other, as the meanest blame you have imputed unto us, exceeds the uncertain
commendation mixed therwithal: and truly this is a new kind of reprehension,
when under praise lies hidden deprauation: but who knows not that under
commendation of our beauty, you have privily expressed the rebuke of tyranny?
and by showing how we become lovers by election, you hane made us as it were
altogether rebellious to love. But which is worse, you have described us for
flitting and inconstant, which blame undoubtedly does so far excee de the
praise of compassion, as the vice of infidelity surmounteth the natural virtue
of piety: and al is untrue: for we are not tyrannous, nor rebellious fro
love, but loving, more constant and faithful then men. You Lady, answered
Guirino, have interpreted my words in sinister sense, for the commendation is
true and properly belonging to you, and the blame is uncertain, and not by
your fault. I confess, that under the name of your beauty I have expressed
tyranny, conforming my self with Socrates, who was wont to say (speaking of
humane beauty) that she was a tyrant that reigned but a small time. This most
wise Philosopher, desirous to infer, that beauty in the manner of a tyrant,
does violently dououre and draw unto her self all those minds, which may
comprehend her, exercising over them all, tyrannical empire. Therefore you can
not avoid, but being fair, you must also be tyrants, neither can this be
ascribed unto you for discommendation, seeing it is a particular privilege
granted unto you from God and nature, to the end that by mean of love, you
might by authority by us men, be loved and served. This secret and natural
vice of tyranny which is in you, have I yet after such a sort tempered with
piety, that it should not seem grievous unto you, to be called Tyrants by
nature, and gracious Queens by election; neither have I made you altogether
rebellious to love, though I have attributed unto you rather the name of
beloved than loving, having also showed that it is greater perfection to be
beloved, than love: and notwithstanding it is true that you are ready to change
your will and mind, this is in you rather a virtue than vice, being a manifest
sign, that amorous affection can not prevail so far with you, but just
disdain may much more, neither do you make your selves so servile, but that
still you reserve your princely authority, which neither can nor will support
the least contempt: and your self (Lady) gives here of ample testimony, who
not for any offense, but upon suspicion, that amongst diverse praises of women,
I had sowed some little seed of blame, al angry on a sudden, have changed your
mind and opinion toward me, declaring me, not only unworthy of your own
favor, but also of the gracious respect of al these ladies: Notwithstanding
confident in my innocence, and in their just and merciful authority, I live
in hope, that more than ever heretofore they will grace me with their favor.

This playsted (answered the Lady Machiauella,) will not a whit mollify the
impostume of my just wrath: for I affirm it is false, that we women are
tyrants or rebellious to Love, being certain, that in loving we are more
faithful and constant then men, which you also would confess, if you were not
of a malignant mind: seeing fidelity and constancye themselves be of the
Feminine, and not of the Masculine gender. All the standers by, smiled at this
replication, and the Lady Victoria Bentiuoglia, whose beauty the Graces
themselves accompany, said.

You Signior Guirino, have beer by the authority of Petrarch confirmed, that
the lover transformeth him self into the beloved, of which I am very
doubtful, as not being able to imagine, what manner of transformation this
should be, neither will I be so foolish to believe that Petrarch after the
manner of Daphne, transformed him self into Laura. I am desirous therefore,
that you would verify unto me your saying, manifesting unto me, how it may
be that the lover should be transformed into the beloved. When Guirino
answered: your desire is noble (most gentle Lady) wherein to satisfy you, it
is necessary that I discover some secrets, which to the Philosophers are only
known. You shall therefore understand, that we cannot perceive before the
instrument of sense, be first made like to the thing perceived. Which
similitude notwithstanding, is neither real nor material, but we call it
Spiritall and immateriall: as for example, I cannot perceive or see your fair
and gracious form, if first mine eyes (the sensible instrument of sight) do
not so draw it into it self, as that it becomes like to the same.

Notwithstanding, you (fair Lady) beholding in mine eyes, may see your goodly
shape, as in a most clear glass: For between the glass and the eye there is
no further difference, but that the glass is an eye without life, and the eye
is a living glass. Now this your beautiful Image, is transported, by mean
of the most subtle vital spirits, and imprinted in the inward organe, that
is, the intrinsecate part of the brain, which also becomes like unto her,
and from thence received into my soul, my soul her self takes of you the
whole similitude, so that we may say, that while I see and behold youpresent,
my soul wholly transfigured into you, is no other but the true pourtraiture of
your self.

This which by proof is verified in exterior sense, is also as true in sense
interior, which is that virtue of the sensitive faculty, called fantasy, or
imagination, which is of force to contemplate and perceive obiectes, although
they be absent, by those imaginations which remain imprinted in the interior
organ or member: whenever therefore our soul imagines any thing, she
becomes like unto it, and further, spiritally transformeth her self into the
thing imagined: the same that happens to sense, falls out likewise to
understanding, understanding being in a manner altogether like to sense: for
while the understanding conceiueth and beholds anything, it is transformed
into it, and becomes the same: and therefore happy are those, who employ the
beautiful gift of the mind, to contemplate divine and high things; for in
that state, they become diumitie it self. By this which I have expounded unto
you (most honorable Lady) you may easily comprehend the transformation of the
lover into the beloved. For it is not a real, but a spiritall transformation:
For the true lover bearing always the representation of the beloved imprinted
in his soul, and never aiming his thoughts, but toward his beloved object,
in that state he comes to be transformed into it. Whereupon the divine
Philosopher in his Conuiuio, describing the force of Love, says, that Love,
with such a strong knotte knitteth lovers together, that of two he makes one
alone, willing to infer, that those, who absolutely give themselves over in
prey to amorous passions, are after such a sort ententiue on their loving
cogitations, as it may be affirmed, that the soul disioyned from the body,
lives in the beloved: and therefore no marvel, though the bodies of Lovers
deprived of vital vigor, do consume and languish: The which here Petrarch
auerreth of himself, in these Terzetti of this Sonnet: At every pace I turn
my self about, saying: Sometimes amidst my mournings sad and dull,
A doubt arises how these members can
Live, so remote from spirit, wonderful:
But answered Love, remembrest not thou, man,
That this is priuiledg'd to Lovers art,
From other qualities humane, apart.


With this answer the Ladies and Knights remained very well satisfied, who
expected with great desire to understand* this marvelous Metainorphosis. And
his Mistress Lucretia Calcagnina, a Matron, adorned with all gentle fashion,
made her doubt in this sort. It happens oftentimes, that after a long and
cold conversation bet wixt man and woman, in the end either one with the
other, or both of them are enflamed with love reciprocal, the which as it is
true, so brings it that into doubt by you spoken, that the Lover is presently
enamoured, as conformable beauty discovers it self unto him: for I would
reason thus: either that the beauty so often contemplated* is to the Lover
conformable, or not, if it be conformable, wherefore does it not in a moment
cause love? but if there be no such conformity, how can it procure this after
long time? clear me this doubt. When Guirino: Two manner of ways gracious
Lady, may your doubt be resolved. First I allege, that in diverse respects,
how long soever their conversation be, it may happen, that to the Lover those
beauties may be concealed which were more apt to enamour him, seeing a fine
foot, a beautiful leg, a fair arm, a quick and lively gate, or other
excellencies of the body hitherto covered, and sudainly or by chance perceived,
may kindle amorous flames: I will also affirm, that not only the
singularities of body, but those of the mind also, may procure love: and
because these do not so suddenly discover themselves, to the eye of the soul,
which is the reasonable part, and that by little and little, with long
observation sees and beholds, therefore not so suddenly, but after long
conversation, they enslame the lover, so soon as he knows them, and after he
is enflamed, with that which before with his bodily eyes he saw, and was not
there with contented, then with delight he rejoices and is glad: for as the
beauty of the body is of force to conceal from the lover the defects of the
mind, and to make them appear less weighty, so the perfections of the
mind, after they have with sweet and honest contentment fastened on the lover,
are of vigor to transform the deformities of the body beloved, and make it to
the lover seem beautiful, or at least, not brutish.

This answer was taken for sufficient, when the Lady Countess of Sala, I
would willingly know said she, whether a lover at one time may love two
mistresses: and this my question arises, in having seen diverse times by
experience, that they are seldom lovers, who are content with one love alone.
No servant (most honorable Lady (answered Guirino) can serve two Masters,
neither can one Lover at the same instant, serve more then one inistris, which
by many reasons is manifest: And first because the beauty of two subjects is
either equal, or else we discover the difference of more or less: If they be
equal, neither of the one nor of the other can he become loving: for finally,
love being no other but desire, and desire of it selte being undetermined, it
is necessary, that placed between two objects, it should be determined by the
better, or the worse, by the more beautiful, or more deformed, other wise it
would be always immovable: and therefore John Baccone a Philosopher, and most
learned divine, was wont to say, that if the horse were in away equally distant
from two barley fields of like goodness, he should be in danger to die for
hunger, for his appetite would not be moved more to the one then to the other
corn. He therefore, who were in the presence of two women, equally fair, not
being able to bend his desire, moved through knowledge of sense, more to the
one then the other, should rest immouable, and consequently, would love neither
the one, nor the other: but if there were a difference of more and less,
desire inclining it self, would be enflamed with the more beautiful, and the
other should take no place: but further, if the Lover transformeth himself
into the beloved, as before we said, not being able to transform himself
into two, but into one subject only, so shall he be able to love but one
subject alone: to conclude, as that which has taken place within, is an
impediment to the other, but exterior, which would surprise him: so that object
which shall have taken the possession of the lovers heart, will forbid any
other that attempteth to pearce thereinto: the which Petrarch shows in diverse
places, to be true in him self, and principally in the Sonnet: Athousand times
sweet warlike mistress mine.

Speaking of his heart, now possessed by his Laura, says: And if in him some
other mistress hope,
In vain it is: when mind has no such scope.


And in the sonnet: Shaming sometimes, although she hold her peace:

Says: Calling to mind the day, when first I did thee see:
For never will there one, to me so pleasing be.


And in the sonnet: Full of that sweet, unspeakable delight:

He says: This custom has so crept into my mind,
Her to behold, whom I so glorious find:
That any other, if I chance to see,
This custom makes her odious seem to me.


And in the sonnet: Seeing that for my hire, this way is me debard:

He faith: And to one Image I addicted was,
Which Zeuxis did not make nor Phydias,
Nor yet Praxiteles who caru'de so well,
But one for art that did them al excel.


Touching experience of those lovers, which are not contented with one love
alone, it is altogether false, because they are no true Lovers but treacherous
rebels to love, as those, who carried away with a furious storm of lust, fancy
rather beastiall, then humane love. the answer pleased the Lady Countess, and
all the other Gentlewomen. But Madam Syluia Villa, a young damozel of most
beautiful and gentill presence, seeing you conclude, said she, that a Lover
cannot love two Mistresses, show me also if one beloved of two several
friends, to avoid ingratitude, ought to content both Lovers with intercourse
of affection? From the former conclusion answered Guirino, proceeds the
absolution of this present doubt. For the beloved, not being able to perform
correspondencie in love, except she also become enamored, and it being in the
Lovers power to affect but one subject, she can love and favor but one alone;
for doing otherwise, she shall not only, not avoid the vice of ingratitude,
but defrauding the first lover, of his part in that whole, which is his in all
reason, shall be most unthankful. The Lady Syluia commended this answer, when
Madam Anne Strozza, a Matron, whose favor is accompanied, with modest
affability, propounded after this manner: Men inamored amongst many words,
which they utter, intermixed with tears and sighs, they are wont to their
beloved, with oath to affirm, that they affect them above themselves: on which
words, having many times mused, I ever found my self in greater doubt the^
before, neither can I be resolved whether it may be true, that the Lovers
affection toward his Mistress, is greater, then to his own self. Tell me
therefore Signior Guirino your opinion. It is requisite answered Guirino:
before I resolve you, that you most noble Lady be advertised, that doubt has
no place in the love, whereof we have entreated, which is a desire of union,
and supposes indigence of the thing beloved, for with this love toward our
selves we cannot be affected, notwitstanding the fable of Narcissus, first
because union presupposes two at the least, secondly because of our selves we
can have no want. Therefore your demand has place in that love, which we term
good will, which is no other, but a desire of giving, or seeing perfection in
some subject; touching which we have to consider, that all loves have
original from the affection toward our selves, the which is such, and so
great, that all things created contend ever to work in favor of themselves,
and he that should further say, that the creator fashioned the world for no
other cause, but to please himself, should not speak much amiss, which being
true as it is, how vain are the words of flattering lovers, when they affirm
that they love their mistresses better then themselves: But because there is no
lie so great, as in it there may not appear some shadow of truth, it may so
happen, that the lover desires some sort of humane good more in his mistress,
then in himself, as riches, honor, and such like, and in this sense it may
be true, that he could wish better to his beloved, then to himself. But he
desires such good to please himself, it cannot therefore be said, that he
loves his mistress better then himself. But we see by experience replied
Lady Anne, that some lovers deprived of the hope of their beloved, have also
suffered the privation of life, and we read that the faithful wife of
Ametus, refused not to offer her self to voluntary death for the love of her
husband: which is a manifest sign, that the lover may affect his beloved above
himself. And if we may credit Petrarch, it may be said, that the lover may
not only love his mistress above him self, but hating himself, may plant
all his affection in her: as he affirms of himself in the sonnet, I find
no peace: saying:
My self I hate, and love an other best.
Be assured (noble Lady) answered Guirino, that violent killers of themselves,
do that for no other end, but in a love to their own persons, and to please
themselves, being of opinion, that death should be to the^ as an ease, of some
insupportible grief: and the wife of Ametus (supposing the fable to be true)
without doubt performed that loving offer, in favor of her self, either as
desirous of glory, or to avoid the sorrow which by the death of her husband,
she thought in her self insupportable: neither want there examples of men most
studious of glory, who to acquire immortal fame unto themselves, have
embraced voluntary death as we read of Curtius, of the Decij, of Attilius
Regulus, and other noble Romans, whose attempts out of doubt were undertaken,
more for their own contentment, then for love of their country. So that I
think there is not so simple a woman, which believes such vain words,
produced by Lovers for their own contentment, and by such like dissimulations,
to obtain reciprocal affection, from their affected. This opinion of Guirino
was by the gentlewomen approved true, not without some secret heart-burning of
the gentlemen enamored: and never a gentlewoman remaining to propound any more
questions, the Queen spoke after this sort: Although doubt is little befitting
princely Majesty, being a manifest sign of ignorance, the which of all other
defects in Princes is most reproachful, overcome notwithstanding with a
natural desire of understanding, I desire it may be lawful for me, Signior
Guirino to demand of you, if in the Lover not beloved, love can long time
endure. To doubt said Guirino, most renowned Queen; proceeds rather from
equality of contrary reason, then from ignorance: and to be circumspectly
doubtful, may rather be ascribed to abundance, then want of knowledge: Your
highness therefore in doubting, has not only, not offended royal Majesty, but
by moving a most excellent question, has given trial of your noble conceit,
and by favoring me, exercised your high and magnificent courtesy. Therefore
before I answer your Majesty, I will declare the fable recited by most
singular Themistius, in his sixth oration. The goddess Themis, says he, being
before Venus, who had brought forth Cupide, having highly commended the beauty
of that winged child, added: sincere love may well be borne, but that he should
grow by himself alone, understand O Venus, it can no ways be: Therefore if
you desire that this your dear son, may increase to his proportionable
greatness, beget and bring forth another like to him, for such will the nature
of these two brothers be, that in beholding one another, both of them will
grow alike, and look how much shall diminish in one, no less will there
impair in the other. Venus persuaded by this most wise goddess, produced
Anterota Cupides lawful brother. By this fable we may easily comprehend, that
love alone cannot endure in the lovers heart, and for his maintenance and
reduction, to his due stature, it is necessary, be behold, and sport with his
brother Anterota. Yet, Signior Guirino, experience teaches the contrary,
answered the Queen: for every day, we see diverse enamored, without having the
least sign of interchaungeable affection, obstinate altogether in amorous
enterprise, and peradventure confident in the saying of Dant before repeated:
By love, beloved, cake, from love, are not exempt.

And Petrarch himself, though his Lauretta were froward and ingrate unto him,
notwithstanding as an obstinate Lover, burst forth into these verses.

Yet live I still in hope, remembering this always,
That moistened drops, at length, though with some long delays,
In tract of time do pearce, the free, and marble stone.
And heart so hard none is, which will not straight way moan,
Moved with unfeigned tears, and loves incessant flame,
Nor will so freezing cold, 'which heates not by the same.
There be two sorts of Lovers not beloved again, answered Guirino, the one
finding always in his Mistress, a pride correspondent to her beauty, without
receiving at any time the least sign of love, but ever discovering in her
countenance, a duskish cloud of disdain, he most unhappily loves. In the
heart of such a Lover (most renowned Queen) affection cannot continue, but
giving place to wrath, anger, and disdain, flying away, it departs, being
impossible, that it alone should wrestle long with reason, accompanied by these
other most forcible affections. The other sort, seeing the brow of their dear
beloved, sometimes fair, and sometimes cloudie, the Lover doubtful within
himself, and feeding upon a sweet air of hope, affecting, serving, and
entreating, maintains himself long time. Such a Lover was Petrarch, as he
describes himself in the verses recited to your highness, and in other songs
and sonnets, but especially in the sonnet: I find no peace: saying:
Prisoner I am, to such an one, as neither opes nor shuts:
Nor holds me fast, nor yet the snare, with loves requital cuts.


Guirinos answer was of the Queen accepted, and by the standers by approved
for good, it seeming to all impossible, that where hope cannot be settled, love
should there make any long residence: and with this ending the discourse of
love, the Queen commanded that they would practice some pleasant conceits of
divination and fortune-telling, as amongst women they use to do: and while they
were intentive on this pastime, the Duke, and Lady Duchess, privily entering
into the palace, they sudde^ly caused to be put into the chamber, where this
noble company were assembled a Do, taken quick in the nets, which hopping
here and there, leapt upon the Gentlewomen. Whereupon very fearful of this
terrible creature, each one without tarrying for another, ran all out into
the great Hall, whom the excellent Duchess meeting, with the other beautiful
Huntresses, in a sudden their fear was turned into laughter: and after a
while, the huntsmen arriving with a mighty wind of horns, and cry of
dogs, his highness commanded, that the chase should be brought into the
hall, which being done, there were many boares laid out, whereof some were so
great, that the women durst not behold them. The rest of the day was spent in
discoursing upon such accidents as fell out in their Game, the gentlewomen
taking no less contentment to hear of that, then did the Hunters in
recounting their own exployts, in encountering and killing these terrible
beasts. Evening being come, his highness caused a most pleasant Comedy to
be recited by the Gelosi. These be certain Coemedians, who requested every
year by his highness, are wont to come in the end of Autumn, and he takes
them along to the sea side, as also the whole Carneuale or Shrouetide, to their
great gain, and contentment of all the City, they employ themselves in
Commicall representations, and are very apt in imitating all manner of
persons and actions humane, but especially those, which are fittest to procure
laughter, in which point they are so prompt and excellent, that they would
make Heraclitus himself to laugh. The Comedy ended, they practiced certain
pastimes, and being late, his highness rose up, and each one departed to
their several lodgings. The day following was passed over by his highness in
another pleasant and delightsome chase, in which they killed Hearts, and wild
Goats, with other beasts, to the singular contentation of the Ladies and
Gentlewomen which were present. At the self same time, the usual company
being retired into the accustomed room, the Lady Camilla Costabili, was by
chance, drawn Queen, a Matrone of stately presence, and adorned with most
gentle customs, who not to let slip the accustomed wont of entertaining
the time, and judging that the entreatie of honor, would be delightsome and
profitable to every noble spirit, in that honor many times is badly observed,
by not knowing the nature thereof, therefore she commanded Signior Gualenguo a
genleman, not only most skillful in handling his weapon, but also learned, and
very judicial in things appertaining to honor and combat, who desirous to
please the Queen, without other reply began in this manner.

The third days discourse: Wherein is contained a discussion of Honor.
A Most not able and eminent subject, does our Queen this day propound to be
entreated of, which is Honor, it being with humane life in such sort connexed,
that there is not any condition or quality of men, to who^ the knowledge of
honor is not commodious: but above all others, it is so necessary in a man
noble and civil, as without it, being ouershadowed, as it were with the
obscure darkness of ignorance, for the most part, in steed of honor, he
imbraceth infamy. This is that ardent heat which enflameth the mind of man,
to glorious enterprises making him audacious against enemies, and to vices
timorous. And therefore Plato in his Phedro, compares the mind of a man to a
Chariot, whereof reason is the coach man, the affections of the mind the
horses, and desire of honor the whip: The divine Philosopher minding to
infer, that reason without honorable desire, and fear without reproach, are
notable to bridle the most fierce passion, of the angry and concupiscent
faculties, and to direct man to virtue. I will therefore endeavor my self,
most famous Queen, to discourse of Honor, seeing your highness so commands
me, although to my self I am not ignorant, that so high and excellent a
subject, very far exceeds the power of my wit, hoping these valorous
knights, most faithful subjects to Honor, will be ready to supply my
defects. Honor (excellent Queen) being above measure desired by man, it is a
thing manifest, that in the number of humane goods, some be appertaining to the
body, as beauty, health, strength, agilitie; and some to the mind, as
understanding, wisdom, knowledge, prudence, and art, as also other goods
there be external belonging to fortune. Amidst these therefore, Honor, out of
doubt, cannot be numbered amongst those goods, that appertain to the body or
mind, but rather is accounted amongst them, in our selves not resident; as are
likewise riches, principality, power, friends, a fair and modest wife,
children, nobility, and such like. Universally therefore we will affirm, that
honor is the most precious of all goods external. But because this word Honor
signifies not one alone, but two honors of diverse nature in themselves, not
being able to assign such a definition, as wherein both may be comprehended.
I will divide them; and one (as a new forger of these words) I will term
natural and imperfect; the other acquired honor, and perfect. By not
conceiving that honors are of two kinds, and diverse of themselves, and not one,
al they which hitherto have entreated of Honor, have fallen into most manifest
errors: and amongst other, the learned Bishop of Caserta, (provided, if it be
true, that the book of Honor, set forth under the name of Posseuiuo, were by
him made, as of himself he affirms) is led into a most notable error; For
he in the same book having defined honor, and wrong interpreted the fence of
Aristotle, in his book of Rhetorike, after a long discourse, upon the same, he
groundeth his combat; not observing, that combat is wholly contrary to the
nature of that honor by him discussed and defined. At this time therefore, I
not swaruing from the order of nature, which is to go from the imperfect to the
perfect, will first entreat of honor natural, and conclude in honor acquired:
which is one of the principal circumstances of humane felicity. I say therefore
that honor natural, is a common opinion, that he honored, has never failed in
justice, nor valor. I term it honor natural, because man brings it from his
mothers womb, and preserves it unspotted, except through some grievous
offense or suspicion, he loose this good opinion. This was defined by Fausto
Longiano in his Combat, to be no other than an incorruptible state of Nature,
as though to possess this honor, it were sufficient to maintain our selves,
such as we were borne. This is that honor (most excellent Queen) whereof
there is so great fame, and wherein there is not any one, which professes not
himself to have his part, as surely he has, though in no other respect, at
loast yet in his mouth, in that he will neither say nor do any thing without
the license of honor, or except honor permit. This is that which gives
occasion every day, of bralles, hatred, and rancours: and upon which was
grounded, in times past, wicked combat. I affirmed it to be an opinion, and
not a science or knowledge: For science is grounded on truth and necessity:
Opinion upon probability and accident, For we may well have an opinion, that
one is an honest man, but we cannot affirm it, without understanding so much,
because externally he may be good, and in secret, wicked.

This opinion which is termed honor, is grounded upon a secret supposition,
that man is good, if there appear nothing to the contrary; and notwythstanding
this has in it difficulty; especially for that which the Philosopher says, in
the second of his Ethickes, that virtues and vices in a man, are neither
natural, nor against nature, and that good and wicked habit, not by nature,
but by custom is acquired: notwythstanding by that which he adds in his sixth
Book, it seems this supposition may be granted, because he affirms that
man is borne with a certain virtue, by mean of which, he seems apt to
justice, fortitude, and temperance, seeing in a man, by virtue of his mind,
there are naturally some principal notes, by which we may worthily presume,
that he is rather good, then wicked: and I have set down these two parcels,
that have not failed in justice nor valor, differing from other defects, for
that God only being immaculate and without fault, it is necessary that man,
accompanied with some imperfection, must offend, notwithstanding those sins
are tolerable, which sometimes through humane fragilitie we cannot but
commit, and therefore the Philosopher in the second of his Ethikes says, that
he cannot be termed vicious and wicked, which a little swarueth from comeliness
and honesty, minding to infer, that those sins, although they give
testimony after a certain manner, that we have not performed virtuous
habit, yet are they not sufficient to make him loose his honor, but rather
those, which are committed against justice and fortitude. And that every one
may the better understand how honor is preserved and lost, I have not thought
it much from the purpose to declare, what it is to fail in Justice, and what
in Honor. To fail in Justice therefore, is no other but to perform the
things, which by good laws are forbidden, and severely punished, to injury
another against reason, and by sinister means, rashly to commit manslaughter,
murder, theft, 'rapines, treasons, adulteries, and sin against nature, to be
an heretic, conceiving sinisterly of God and divine things, to practice usury,
and to be addicted unto unlawful gain: to be a falfe witness, to the
prejudice of the goods, life, or honor of another: finally, he is said to have
failed in Justice, who has extremely offended against any virtue, seeing that
of Justice universally all things depend. To want valor is no other, but
basely to carry our selves in dangers, as that should be, to abandon the
colors, or battle, by flying away, or else to leave our friend and companion
in danger, not to hazard our lives for defense of religion, and of holy
Christian Church, for his prince, for his country, for father, wife, children,
and such like: as also he manifests vilitie, who easily swalloweth injury,
without by his own proper valor, showing himself therewith moved. And let
this by me spoken, suffice, to make known the nature of this honor: the
which true lie may be termed imperfect Honor, in comparison of that by proper
valor acquired. This Honor principally is incident to beneficence
(understanding this word not only for bounty or liberality, as many times we
do, but as being derined of the Latin words been and facio, to do well or
good) it being the most excellent of all other virtuous actions. And it is by
the Philosopher, two manner of ways defined, in the first book of his
Rhetorike, saying: Honor is a sign of beneficent opinion: and in the fourth of
the Ethikes, Honor is the reward of virtue: the first definition has respect
rather to the honourer, then to the honored, because it is a sign of opinion
which the honourer has, of the beneficent inclination of him honored. The
second rather concerns him honored, then the honourer, in that it is a
reward of virtue, which in him honored is found. Going about therefore to
describe the Nature of this Honor, called by me Honor acquired, I will
affirm, accepting both the one and the other of these definitious, that
acquired honor is no other, then a reward, manifesting an action of
beneficence, there being no action so famous, nor that makes man more like to
god, then to be beneficial, the which the ancients plainly show, who esteemed
their great benefactors worthy to be put into the number of the gods,
consecrating unto them temples, dedicating altares, erecting Statues, offering
sacrifices, and such like honors, neither was Jupiter called by the Latins,
the chief of the Gods for any other occasion, but because administering all
things, he is the head Benefactour, as for the like reason by the Graecians he
was called (...) as it were Zon, which is as much to say as life, being he that
gives and preserves life in all things of the world. But because this reward,
which manifests action of beneficence, may be given more ways then one, the
Philosopher in the first of his Rhetorike divides this honor into diverse
parts, which notwithstanding I comprehend under these two heads: considering
that of honors, some be permanent, and others not. Permanent we call those,
which after we have given them, remain to the perpetual honor of him
honored, as Statues, Images, Temples, Altars, Sepulchers, Crowns, public
stipendes, hymns and such like which cause, not only men to be honored, but
also make them glorious, and are never attributed but to gods, and to men
heroycall, who have performed great and public benefits.

Honors not permanent, we term them, which after their performing, remain
not in action: and these by the Philosopher, are called, barbarous customs,
and by us much frequented, as to give the place, to bow, to kiss the hand, the
hemme of the vesture, the knee, the foot, putting off the hat, and such like:
and these honors are not only done to them, who have bin beneficial, but also
to those, who either for their riches or virtue, are of power to benefit. Out
of the definitions by me set down, as also from that, we have hitherto
discoursed, it may easily be discerned, how different one honor, is from
another; in that natural honor, may rather be said to be, a former
disposition of true honor, that by valor is acquired, then honor absolute,
and perfect: and therefore it has the self same proportion, to true honor,
as the faculty vegetative, has with the sensatiue: for as vegetation may from
sense be separate, and is of it self apt to bring forth, one sort of living
creatures, as be plants and fruits; so this honor may stand, nay and for the
most part is from the other separate; and yet be sufficient of it self to
form, an imperfect sort of men honored, considering all those, who are
judged, not to have failed in Justice and valor, are called honorable: And as
in the living creature, the virtue vegetall, is first in nature and operation
before the sensatiue, being as it were a former disposition unto sense, so this
honor, preceedeth ever, honor perfect, being unto it a former disposition. And
as the sensitive faculty without the vegetative can not stand, so can there
not be honor acquired, where there is not honor natural, conceiving that he
which is reputed a wicked man, is of any honor unworthy. But moreover, its a
thing manifest, that this honor wheere of every one makes profession, is
without labor acquired, in that man brings it from his mothers womb; but true
honor is obtained, by excellent endeavor and industry, and by the self same
means is preserved. Of honor natural, it being grounded upon contingent, as
well the bad as good may thereof be partakers. Of honor acquired, it being a
manifest sign, and reward of virtue and her operations, only the man virtuous
and excellent, is there of possessor. Natural honor consists not in any
exterior act, because in this the honorer performs not, and the honored
receives nothing: but perfect and true honor is known by exterior action; by
reason in this the honorer, by rewarding, gives some sign thereof, as also
the honored, by receiving it: moreover, honor naturally has his contrary
positive, which is infamy: and, honor acquired, his contrary privative. And, to
the end your Majesty may understand these philosophical terms, you shall be
advertised, that contraries positive, be those, which have both their real
being in the nature of things; but of co^traries privative, the one has his
real being, and the other has no existence at all, as for example sake: heat
and cold, are contraries positive, because in that subject which is not hot,
there is always found cold; and where no cold is, heat has there his real
being. Light and darkness be contraries privative, because light only has
his real being, but darkness has nothing in existence, as that which is no
other, but the bare effence of light. Therefore honor natural has positive
contrary; for where he is not, there is real infamy: but honor, which is the
reward of beneficence, has his privative; for where he appears not, yet
infamy does not there take place, or dishonor, but only his prination or
absence. For one that has never a statue erected to him, nor crown given him,
public gifts, or magistracy, to whom no preeminence is given, or cappe moved,
neither is by any such like obseruatio^s honored, shall not, for all this
remain infamous or dishonored, nor in question of honor can not be excepted
against, but we will say, that he is only deprived of that honor which is the
reward of beneficence, this being a part of humane felicity. This is as much
as I can or am able to deliver (renowned Queen) upon this subject of honor,
wherein, if I have bin deficient, let these other honorable Knights plead for
me.

Stay a little Signior Gualinguo, answered the Queen, for there is a skirmish
prepared against you, wherein it shall greatly help you, to be a good and well
trained soldier. Then she commanded al those gentlmen, who were there present,
that they would move doubts, and contradict Gualinguo, in the argument of
honor, after the same method, as the Gentle women had done in the discussion
of love; and the Gentlemen beholding one an other with silence, as they who
sitting round about, knew not from whom the beginning was expected, the Queen
smiling upon the illustrous Lord Don Cesared Este, (who understanding of the
excellent discourses that passed in the chamber of the Countess, withdrawing
himself closely from the chase, was come in all haste with the Lord Marquess,
to find out the company) made a sign unto him, that he should move his
doubt; and his most honorable Signiory, in whom, in his green years, a most
bright beam of heroical virtue does shine, graciously obeying the
commandment of the Queen, began in this manner.

You (O Knights) if I do carry well in mind, have grounded this opinion,
which is termed Honor, upon a secret supposition, that a man, if there
appear nothing to the contrary, is good. Which supposition I hold to be very
doubtful: yea and further, that some notable sign of virtue not appearing,
he may be coniectured rather a wicked than good man: considering that humane
nature of it self, enclineth rather to vice than virtue. Which by this may be
imagined, because the way of virtue is asprous, hard, and laborsom; so that as
a thing myraculous, men point at him who arriueth to the end, and becomes
perfectly virtuous: and on the contrary, the way that conducteth to vice, is so
easy, plain, and pleasant, as the number of them is infinite which walk by
it, and become vicious; this being a manifest sign, that naturally we are not
inclined to virtue, but to vice: because things difficult, and that seldom
happen, are far from the condition of nature. Experience furthermore shows,
that we rather incline to vice than virtue, in that there is none of us (for
what preuayleth it to lie) which in himself has not trial, with how great
violence he is drawn to vice, and how hardly he abstaineth from sensible
contentments, how troublesome continence is unto him, and patience bitter.
Which being (as it is) true, so shall your supposition be false: for as all
things having no impediment, do rather work according to their inclination,
than against their nature, so must we presume not knowing any other, that man
for the most part, is rather wicked, than good: the which is confirmed, by the
answer of Pythagoras, who being demanded, what was most true, made answer,
that men are wicked. The supposition therefore being false, so shall the
opinion of an others valor, and justice be untrue; for the foundation failing,
the building falls down; Notwithstanding I attend your answer. The reasons
of your renowned Segniory, answered Gualenguo, introduced against my
supposition and opinion, are so preualent, as I may well say the conclusion
pleases me not a whit; for I know not well how to answer the argument: and
certainly our natural fragillitie is such, as that it never cease to make
trial of occasion while it be brought in subjection unto vice, neither could
divine Paul effect, although he were divinely illumined, but that he was driven
to say, I perceive in my members, and flesh, an other law, repugnant to the
law of my mind, which subdueth me to the law of sin: Yet, notwithstanding
all this, I am of opinion, that my supposition is true, as also that man in his
natural estate, is inclined to virtue, and not to vice, being good and not
wicked: the which I hope with so lively reasons to make manifest, as every one
shall be out of doubt. I say therefore, that all things comprehended in this
universal frame, having their original from God, as God is chief bounty and
goodness, so are all these partakers of this bounty, and therefore al are good
in the first instant of nature. To affirm therefore, that man is wicked by
nature, is no other but to auerre, that amongst all the creatures of the whole
world, the sensible image of the insensible God (for so is man) is wicked: a
matter repugnant to truth, and the authority, as well of holy divines, as
philosophers, who are of opinion, that in this inferior world, amongst all
living creatures, only man may be virtuous and happy; and as fire should not be
light, if of his nature he did incline to the center, so a man should neither
be virtuous nor good, if naturally he were inclined to vice. Furthermore, if
Nature, the ministresse of God, does not only generate, but guides al things
generated to their end, and therefore heavy things descend, and those light
ascend, as also beasts and living creatures, so soon as they are generate, by
nature herself, they are directed to their end and perfection: how can it be,
that man should only rest by her abandoned; and which is worse, not only
abandoned and contemned, but further instigated, to his ruin and imperfection.
Man by the beautiful gift of the mind is true man, who as he is divine, so will
we affirm with the Poet, that; Like to his Maker he, does heavenly state
retain.

And therefore he desires that only which is best and divine, neither can
he, knowing the true and principal good, wish evil: by which reason the
divine Philosopher being moved, subscribed to the opinion of the Stoickes,
affirming in all his conclusions, that man is by nature good, and against
nature wicked, and that he as all other things is inclined to this end which
is best: and the Philosopher says, that man is never wicked, but when he is
affected against Nature, which comes to pass, when in himself he has not
civil government, and that which should obey, commands: which is sense,
over reason. If we shall also further consider, that man naturally is
thirsting after knowledge, as the Philosopher affirms in the Proemium of his
divine Philosophy, we may easily judge, that to virtue and not vice, he is
naturally disposed: for of vice there can be no science, it being nothing in
existance, but otherwise a mere privation, as affirms great Dionisius in the
book of Divine Titles, and likewise the Academikes, and Peripatetickes. If we
therefore (most famous Lord) have respect to the Creator of man, he is his
own Image, if to the gift of Nature, he is most apt, if to the end of every
thing created, man amongst mortal creatures is only capable of chief good,
having only the use of reason; and good consultation to him alone is proper:
wherefore notwithstanding the reasous by your Segniory all eadged to the
contrary, we must conclude, that naturally he is inclined to virtue, and not
to vice: and that it is to be presumed, that he is good, and not wicked. To
which reasons, I being to make answer, we must consider, that in man three
natures are comprehended, one common to al living creatures, which is
vegetable: another common to creatures and man, and that is sense: the third
common to man and things Divine, and this is reasonable Nature. By the first,
man is like to plants, by the second, to other living creatures, by the third,
he comes to be true man, and a divine creature, and therefore man by
participation, is in the midst betwixt mortal and divine: for in respect of
body and sense, he partaketh of mortality, but touching his mind he is divine
and immortal: as in man these three natures are discovered, so find we in him
likewise, three natural inclinations; one called properly natural, and
depends on the insatiable knowledge of universal nature, which moves all
things deprived of knowledge, to those operations, that may conduct them to
their proper ends; and therefore this is not subject to the internal
understanding of man, that is, to sense, and the mind, because she governs,
augmenteth, nourishes, moves the pulses, the spirits, the hearts: and
performs such other like offices, without the consent of reason and will: the
second is called living Inclination, which is derived from the knowledge of
sense, and in a man is naturally subject to reason: the third is reasonable
Inclination, and takes his original from the knowledge of the mind: this in
true man, naturally commands over the inclination of sense.

These foundations being firm and real, I gather two conclusions: the
first, that man in the incorruptible state of his own nature, is always
inclined to virtue, abhorring vice, following honest contentment, and auoydeth
that dishonest: the second is this, that man, as he is a creature conjoined
with matter and sense, enclineth naturally to sensible contentments, and to
vice accidentally: the first conclusion is clear, by that which I have before
spoken. For man, produced from God, cannot be but like to his beginning, and
conceiving by his proper nature, that honest good is the true and chiefest
good, which consists in virtuous action, it is not possible that naturally he
should will his contrary. The second is manifest by this: for any man, how
wicked soever, never does evil in favor of vice, but of contentment: the
thief therefore steals not to be a thief, but to possess and enjoy that
whereof he has want, and the adulterer commits not adultery, to be
accounted an adulterer, but this he does in favor of lust, and venerous
contentment, the which contentment if he could attain unto without vice, it
would be much more acceptable and pleasing unto him: for if a man should take
contentment in vice, and not in virtue, true man should not taste in himself,
the incredible contentation of virtuous action; which questionless is such, as
makes him blessed and happy. Neither should the miserable man be so
afflicted by his own conscience, the which without any other help, brings
unto him most grievous punishment. Man therefore runs into vice
accidentally, that is, by how much the more the vice is conjoined with excess
of pleasure or grief. That vice is contrary to the natural inclination of
man, it may be this reason be proved, because before the vice of
intemperance, proceeds that same semy-vice of incontinence, which is no other
but a precedent battle, that external makes with internal Man, bestiall
with reasonable Nature: and except reason be made drunk, and subdued by sense,
man falls not into vice. This battle out of question, should have no place,
if a man were naturally inclined to vice, for where there is natural
inclination, there can neither be fight nor resistance: and if any should
object, that by the semi-vertue of continence, which preceedeth temperance, the
contrary may be concluded: I answer, that in this there is special
difference, because the incontinent after vicious action, repents himself,
and is daunted in mind, but the man continent after virtuous action, is
merry, and comforted: the one is tossed with trouble some thoughts: the other
reposeth himself with all quiet and tranquillity, no otherwise then does the
earth, when after great violence, in the end she unites her self to the
Center, whether she enclineth.

But moreover, man more then of any other outward good, is desirous of honor,
praise, and glory, he shunneth and abhors more then any other evil,
dishonor, and infamy: acquiring therefore unto himself, honor and praise,
by mean of virtue, but infamy and dishonor, by mean of vice: it is
necessary, that man naturally should bend to virtue, and contemn vice: for it
would be inconvenient to love the effect, and hate the cause. But
notwithstanding all this, it cannot be denied, but the number of vicious, is
infinite: and contrariwise of virtuous, the number to be so small, that good
Diogenes seeking with a light in the day time amongst a multitude, could not
find one: this proceeding from no other, but because the way unto vice is
easy, and that unto virtue hard and difficult. Of which, if we be desirous to
search out the reason, we must discover a little further, and consider what
manner of thing virtue is, as what is vice, and how it may be said, that both
the one and other habit is acquired. I say then, that virtue is no other, but
an habit, imprinted in the sensible faculty by true and direct reason: by
mean of which, that faculty easily yielding to reason, reduces all his
affections to mediocritie, and is conversant either about pleasure or grief:
and vice is an habit imprinted in sense, by perueise reason, by whose means,
declining from right and direct reason, it easily bursteth forth into height,
and excess of pleasure and grief.

Although man (as I have showed) be naturally inclined to virtue, yet is he
neither virtuous nor vicious by Nature, as we have said, but acquireth both
the one and the other habit, by custom that is with frequent, and like
reiterated actions. Furthermore, we must observe, that man is neither capable
of vice nor virtue, before he be a perfect creature and perfect man: unto which
perfection he arriueth in the beginning of the fifteenth year of his age, for
then he is a perfect creature, being able to generate another like himself,
and is perfect man, having the true use of reason: but while that time, he
lives rather the life of every living creature, then of man, performing no
one action with preelection, but ouer-guided with pleasure or anger, and
therefore as in that state, he cannot be either vicious or virtuous, so he is
not then worthy of punishment, reward, praise, or reproach. Man therefore
living first an irrational, before a reasonable life, and aiming all his
operations, to the contentment of sense, this by little and little, procures
in him a former disposition to vice, and contrary to virtue, so that we may
say with the Poet: From whence it sure proceeds, that nature quite does swerve,
From proper course, the laws of custom to obsarue.
Whereupon, being necessary for introducing virtuous habit, to take away
first wicked impression, and tame sense by little and little, which after the
manner of an untamed and evil customed Colt, never ceasing to spurn against
reason: therefore the way of virtue is hard and uneasy, whereas contrariwise,
that of vice is pleasing and ready. This other difficulty also offers it
self, that virtue is in the mean, and vice is that which moves it self
from mediocritie: one way only directs to virtue, but those that conduct to
vice, are infinite, which is plainly showed by the example of the Archer, for
he can hitte the white but one way only, but to miss it, there be ways
infinite. Finally, from the small number of virtues, we may assign this
reason: for as to exercise and perform a vicious habit, few things suffice,
so to acquire and practice virtue, there be many instruments, and
circumstances necessary. And first, liberal birth, and good temperature of
the body, is not of small importance: for understanding not being able to
work, except stirred up by sense, as also sense cannot perform his duty,
if the members and body be not well disposed, as good temperance aideth the
senses, so does it help understanding: and from hence comes it, that one man
more then another, as the Philosopher affirms, seems borne to temperaunce,
instice, and fortitude: further then this, discipline and good education are so
necessary, that without these it is impossible, or at least very hard, that a
man should become virtuous: For in Children and boys, the right use of reason
wanting, (being the Chariot of virtues) and they ever being by folly surprised,
it is requisite, that the right reason of fathers and mothers, should be that
which should supply their defects, and by little and little inure them unto
virtue. The Philosopher understanding well of how special importance it was to
a well instituted commonwealth, liberally to beget and bring up children well,
he concludes the Treatise of his Politiks in procreation, and good education
of children, teaching all those means and rules, which are necessary, for to
dispose and assweat them unto virtue: And Lycurgus the Spartane, amongst other
his laws, made this one most wholesome and good, that to all actions of boys,
their Masters should be assistant, who had an eye, that even in their pastimes
children should not commit any unjust act; holding this for a firm
conclusion, that of wicked children sprung vicious young men; and of youth
vicious, men impious, as also of flagitious men, old ribawdes: and to this
conclusion consents the divine philosopher, in the sixth of his commonwealth;
and Aristotle in the first of his Politickes, and sixth of his Moralles, they
affirming that a man evil brought up, proves worse than any wild beast.
Riches also is of great moment, to the acquiring and practicing of virtue, for
as it is hard without wealth to apply our selves to liberal Arts, so is it
likewise difficult where poverty is, that there should be good education, and
consequently, vertus. For worldly want, is the mother of Arts moechanicall, and
wealth of Arts liberal, and of noble and virtuous actions. It being therefore
necessary, that these three things should concur together, to the attaining
of virtue, that is, temperature, good education, and riches, it being difficult
in one man, to find these three united, of necessity (most famous Lord) the
virtuous must be few, and vicious many in number. Wherefore then, replied Don
Caesar, may we not suppose, that man is rather in the number of many wicked,
than of a few good, especially being so hard and difficult to prove good and
virtuous.

Because every thing, if it be not hindered, continually works, rather
according to the inclination of his special form, than general, answered
Gualenguo, and reasonable nature, being the special form of man, by which
from other creatures he is different, and irrational condition, his form
general, we must suppose, not knowing to the contrary, that he works
rather according to reason, then beastial^^^e, for notwithstanding the
contrary, many times happens, this is not by the proper nature of man, but
because matter and sense make resistance. Therefore of being more men vicious
then virtuous, the same reason may be asssigned, which Signior Patritio the
other day alleged, from the greater number of deformed, then beautiful: For
as in forming corporal beauty, matter resisting Ideall reason, procures,
that Nature, oftentimes, against her intention, gives deformity, so in
framing virtue which is the proper beauty of the mind, matter making
resistance to Ideal humane reason, is a cause, that she against her intention
many times, runs into vice, being the true deformity of the mind.

The most noble Lord Don Caesar, without any further motion, showed himself
herewith to be satisfied. And Signior Caualier Bernieri who sat hard by him,
doubted after this manner: If the private supposition of another man's valor and
bounty, were true, this inconvenience would ensue, that an insolent fellow,
whose flagitions were concealed, might be an honorable man, and yet (if the
Philosopher in his Ethickes, be worthy of credit) honor agrees not but with
an honest man. When soever a man (answered Gualinguo) commits a malificence,
suddenly of himself he falls into the penalty of infamy. Yet does he
delaie his punishment, so much the longer, by how much the slower he is in
revealing his offense. A wicked man therefore, though of himself he be
unworthy, may yet be honorable, because he loses not that inward
supposition of his being good, except he make it evident and manifest, that he
has failed in Justice, or valor: And this is no greater inconvenience, then is
that, when a thief by the law is not punished, his offense being concealed.

Touching the authority of the Philosopher, it is true that the honest man is
only worthy of honor, yet this is no hindrance but that one flagitious may be
thereof na unworthy possessor. Put the case, replied the Knight, that one had
committed a flagition, or performed some villainy, of which, only one or two
had notice; shall this man therefore be infamous? Cleaving to our foundations
laid, said Gualenguo this man shall be dishonorable, and infamous, mary not
with all men, but only with those, who shall be acquainted with this
malefact. This would be a marvelous inconvenience, objected Bernieri,
because it would follow, that in one instant time, the same man should be
honorable, and infamous. It would be inconvenient, answered Cualenguo,
whenas at the selfsame time, and for the like respect, he were honorable and
infamous, but being in diners considerations, it is not only, no
inconvenience, but moreover necessary, because they to whom the offense is
known, loose the good opinion they had of him; and they thereof ignorant,
reserve it muiolate, while he makes manifestation thereof. And this is one of
the principallest imperfections, that this our houour has annexed unto it, in
that an unworthy man may easily be partaker of it, which to perfect honor is
not incident. Bernieri replied no further, and the noble Signior Aldarano
Marquess of Carara, a Lord adorned with most noble customs, and of good
Letters, very studious, propounded his doubt, the which was, Whether that an
honest man might be infamous.

When Gualenguo: There is no doubt (noble Lord) but an honest man, either
through false calumniation, or upon presumption of maleficence, may loose the
good opinion, the world had of him; which having lost, he falls into
infamy. But this is a great inconvenience, replied the Marquess, that he who
never failed in justice, nor valor, may be infamous.

The nature of this honor, is subject to these and such like inconveniences,
answered Gualenguo, yet is it a thing very difficult, that an honest man should
lose his honor, as also it is not a thing so easy, that a man wicked should
avoid infamy, for time in the end discovers truth. Notwithstanding sometimes
it may happen, that an honest man, may enter into a bad fame, yet must he
endeavor in all his actions, not only to be blameless, but also free from all
suspicion of offense, having always his eyes open, that he give no occasion
of scandale, or presumption to the world to judge evil; for the envious and
malignant take occasion of every probability, to stain the honor of an honest
man.

The Marquess was satisfied with this answer, and the Count of Scandiano, a
most valorous Knight: Me thinks said he, that you, sir Knight, have very
unjustly placed the adulterer in the number of men dishonored, because custom
is contrary; seeing that men, are not only, not ashamed to commit adultery,
but as of an enterprise honorable, they have no sooner performed it, as that
thereof they vawnt, and make great boast: ney there is it intended, that any one
should ever be refused, in comparison of honor; for being an adulterer,
notwithstanding that of these, the number be infinite. I am desirous therefore,
that you would give me to understand, how it may be, that an adulterer should
be infamous. A man, answered the Knight, commits adultery in two sorts, in
one, when he being bound, falsifieth the oath of matrimony, frequenting with a
loose woman. And in this, although he be worthy of some blame, yet loses he
not his honor, because he iniurieth none but his own wife: in the other, when
married or unbound, he uses the company of a woman married. And this man
remains dishonored, because he finneth extremely against the virtue of
Temperance, and fails in justice, he being a grievous iniurier or destroyer
of an other man's honor; the which (as I have said) of all other goods
external, is the most precious: and therefore deservedly by the laws, is there
imposed on adultery a greater penalty, than on theft, because the adulterer
endamnifieth in honor, and theft but in goods. And although men, through evil
custom, are not ashamed to be esteemed for adulterers, yet is this no
obstacle, but that they are worthy of infamy: or that in combat they may not
be excepted against, when by men honest, it shall be objected unto them, as well
as thieves. Seeing a man, replied the Count, loses not his honor, but when
he conuerseth with a married woman, I would willingly understand, if the like
happens to a woman, which is, that she shall not forgo her honor, but when
she joins with one married: for in my judgment, a woman's condition, in this
should not be worse than a man's. A woman, said Gualenguo, as in many other
things, so in this, is of harder condition than a man: first, in that if she be
married, with her own, she also staineth the honor of her husband:
secondarily, for that she being (as the Philosopher affirms) by reason
subject to man, commits the greater injury; considering that the injury is
greater, of an inferior toward his superior, than of a superior toward an
inferior: thirdly, because she may bring into her house other men's children,
dispossessing the proper children of her husband, of his goods: fourthly, for
that a woman, offends extremely against her own proper and principal
virtue, which is honesty. A woman therefore cannot after this manner, accompany
with others than her husband, reserving still her honor, but thus doing, she
incurreth infamy. Scandiano seemed to be well resolved.

When Count Guido Calcagnino, moved this question. You said, that he, who
flying, abandoneth his colors, forgoeth his honor: I further desire to know,
Whether a valiant soldier, seeing all others forsake the colors, may with
honor fly, and remove himself from danger: or ought, for maintenance of his
honor, to remain dead by his ancient or colors. And Gualenguo: according to
the law of Lycurgus, and of the valiant Spartanes, the soldier should be
bound rather to die than abandon his ensign for any accident whatsoever; and
therefore the severe and rigorous mother was wont to deliver unto her son,
that went to battle, his shield with these words, Either with this, or in
this: giving him to understand thereby, that either he should return
victorious, or remain dead: I am notwithstanding of opinion, that when an
honorable man has performed his duty in fighting, and yet for all this, sees
all the other soldiers betake themselves to flight, and knows himself not
able to resist the force of the enemies; such an one retiring himself into
safety, loses not his honor, but rather, they that first fled remain
dishonored. If one, replied Calcagnino, should abandon his friend or companion,
in danger, esteeming himself not sufficient to defend him, by reason of
inequality in number, should he in this case loose his honor? If his friend,
answered Gualenguo, with arms in hand turned himself to defense, and he on
the contrary made away, there is no question but he should loose his honor,
neither would the excuse of inequality help him a whit, for the valiant man is
not daunted in sudden danger, but the slave and villain. I would not have
thought, added the Count, that a man had been tied to do more than he can,
but that rather, he had bin rash and heady, which esteems too much of his
own force, as one should be, who to save his friend, did fight against ten men
several. And Gualinguo: he that without any other necessity should make choice
to fight at one instant against ten, should certainly be rather presumptuous
than valiant; but an honorable man being in company with his friend, ought not
to forsake him, though he saw himself incountred by ten several swords, but
must rather fear the loss of honor, than of his life. By the selfsame
reason, replied Calcagnino, whosoever were in battle, he ought to stand, though
all the restsled.

The case is much different, said Gualinguo, because he in the field
withdrawing himself from danger, and other men flying, does not abandon, but
is abandoned; whereas contrariwise, one that leaves his friend in danger, is
he that forsakes, and is not left, or abandoned: wherefore he comes to fail
in valor, and manifesting, that he esteems more his life, than his honor,
he remains infamous. Calcagnino held his peace, and Counnt Palla Strozza a
most valiant soldier, doubted after this manner: You have placed him amongst
men dishonorable, who with his proper valor, makes no show of being touched
with an injury: Put the case one were justly iniuried, should he, to avoid
the loss of honor, manifest himself therewith provoked? Out of doubt he
ought, answered Gualinguo, and if he knowing himself to be in the wrong,
replied Strozza, should offend him iniurying, failed he not in justice, and so
consequently, should he not loose his honor, this honor being principally
grounded upon the opinion of the world? Gualenguo returned: A man, how good or
wicked soever he be, must respect none other thing, but to preserve this
opinion, if he desire to be an honorable man: For honor perishes not before
this opinion be lost; and opinion cannot be lost before some defect be
manifestand made known: the iniuried therefore, notwithstanding he knows
himself to be justly offended, must labor that the world have no notice of
it; and this he shall do, by revenging the injury in proper valor: for by not
failing in volour, his defect in justice shall be concealed: but on the contrary,
if he shall bear the injury, not to commit an unjust fact, the world will judge,
that having wanted valor, he also failed in justice: and that therefore he is
worthy of injury and contempt.

By this your conclusion, added Strozzi, a great inconvenience would follow:
that one to avoid the loss of honor, ought to maintain an unjust quarrel, a
thing not approved by any of these, who have entreated of honor and combat;
they holding it for sure, that to fight having the wrong on our side, is no
other but to provoke the just judgment God, in that by many experiences it is
well known, that they who have maintained the wrong, have either been slain,
or vanquished by their enemy, although he in force were inferior unto them:
where upon they affirm, that he which acknowledges his offense and requires
pardon, is less dishonorable then he, that moved by a diabolical spirit,
obstinately seeks to cover it within the listes. All they answered Gualinguo,
which hitherto have written of honor and combat, are fallen into manifest
errors, by not having entirely known, the nature of this honor: for
maintenance whereof, there is every day braules, and whereupon combat is
grounded: for then amongst other things, they would not have said, that an
honorable man ought not to maintain an unjust quarrel, for preservation of his
honor: and notwithstanding what they said, is conformable to a Christian, who
never ought to enter into an action, which offends God: yet for all this, it
is not convenient for them, who value the honor of the world: for such like
men desiring to be honored, must endeavor by right and wrong, not to lose that
opinion, and supposition wherewith they are borne, but questionless this is as
oftentimes lost, as a man manifests to the world, that he has failed in
justice or valor. And how can it be, further urged Strozza, that an honest man
going against his own conscience, should maintain an unjust quarrel? An honest
man, said Gualinguo, can never maintain an unjust quarrel, for reason will
ever with him be at hand, but an honorable man may well fight being in wrong,
to avoid the loss of honor. Then an honest man, and an honorable man, be not
all one, added Strozzi: and Gualinguo: By the foundations I laid, it may be
clear unto you, that an honest man, and an honorable, be not the self same
things: and in this they have been deceived, that write in the argument of
honor and combat: for it may be, that an honorable man, shall not likewise be
honest; as also that one may be a man honest, and not honorable, as we have
sufficiently declared. What intend you by a man honorable? said Strozzi: By a
man of honor, answered Gualinguo, I mean all those whatsoever they be, good
or wicked, who have not lost the good opinion that the world conceived of them.

Therefore I conclude, that an honorable man, is tied in right or wrong by his
own proper valor, to repel an injury, and also to maintain an unjust quarrel,
lest he remain dishonored. Strozzi said no more. And although this position,
at the first appearance, seemed to all the standers by, a paradox, yet was it
by the greater part of the Gentlemen approved for most true. When Count
Hercules Beuelacqua, unto whom by order it belonged to propound; seeing honor,
said he, is both in right and wrong to be maintained, I would willingly
understand, if an honorable man, after he has valiantly fought within the
listes, and brought to that point, as he cannot longer defend himself, ought
rather to yield, then permit, that his enemy kill him. This, answered
Gualinguo, is not a doubt of small importance: and the opinions of famous and
learned men be in this point diverse: the greater part affirming, that the
combatant ought rather to die, then yield: for in any case, a man of honor
should always prefer death, before infamous safety. And this the Philosopher
testifies in the 3 of his morals saying, A valiant man ought much more to
fear infamy then death: and also in another place of his Morals. that an
honorable man, should rather choose a short life honorable, then a life long,
but contumelious. And upon this foundation, the Stoikes in some cases,
permitted the violent killing of ones self, to avoid a dishonorable life. As
also the Lacedaemonians, who in fortitude and warlike valor, excelled alother
Grecians, commanded their soldiers that they should never yield, they holding
it for certain, that they which died with weapon in hand, might rather be
esteemed slain, then subdued: and therefore their great captain Leonidas, who
with three hundred soldiers, defended Thermopolis against the innumerable
army of Xerxes, was not overcome, but killed, neither were the three hundred
Fabians vanquished, but slain. Divine Plato esteemed it so contamelious a
thing, to yield, as that in his commonwealth he ordained, that there should be
no redemption for him that yielded, but that he might be set as a prey to the
enemy: and in the twelfe of his laws, he made one most severe, against those,
who in bataile surrendered themselves, as varquished, affirming, that free men
should more fear to be made slaves, then have any dread of death it self.
He therefore that yields within the lists to his enemy, remaining his slave,
and deprived of honor, whereas being killed, he may rather be accounted
slain, then subdued: it seems, that brought to that necessity, he ought
rather to endure death, the^ ever to yield himself, yet for all this, I hold the
contrary opinion to be true, and I am moved by this firm foundation: For in
Combat, the cause is no less lost by death, then by submissio^; but betwixt
submission and death there is this difference: that he who yields, loses
only his honor, but the other remaining dead, loses both honor, life, and
that is worse, his own soul: neither will any deny me, but that he had
rather choose one alone, then all these three euilles together, and no man is
bound to do more then his force will extendvnto. Whereas it is a rash part, and
altogether adverse to nature and humane condition, for no benefit to suffer
death, without obtaining by the same any thing honest: I will further affirm,
that he which in the Lists has not failed in valor, although urged by
necessity he yields himself, he remains not wholly dishonored: nay and
sometimes it happens that the vanquished, with men of understanding,
retains a better opinion then the victor, in that the virtue of the mind, is
known rather in adverse then prosperous fortune, and a man gives testimony of
himself, and his valor in blood, wounds, and eminent danger of death. Finally,
I will further allege, that a man not being borne so much for himself, as
for his Country, ought not without urgent necessity, to deprive his country of
a valiant champion. The reasons alleged to the contrary are true. Supposing
with the Philosopher, (which is false) that chief good cannot be without
worldly honor; but because they are grounded on a supposition diverse from ours,
they no way prejudice our position: For they suppose, that with an honorable
death, a man shunneth infamy, and that his former life remains unspotted, but
if I imagine the ruth, his whole life past remains no less infamous by death,
then by yielding himself, because he which dies, be he defenda^t or
assailant, rests in opinion to have failed, either in justice or valor, and
consequently is dishonored. This opinion of Gualinguos, was confirmed by the
greater part of the gentlme^, and those in points of honor most judicial: when
the illustrous Signior Hippolito Bentiuogli: if I carry well in mind, the
Philosopher affirms in his Rethoricke, that nor only he which offends our
selves, offers us injury, but also he who wrongeth those things belonging
to us: as our father, son, brother, friend, or such like, I would know, if in
point of honor we are bound to revenge such an injury. When Gualinguo: that
such an injury should tie us to revenge, it is requisite there depend upon it
these conditions; first, that it be performed in contempt of us, and through no
manifest fault of him offended; further, that he iniuried, be impotent, for if
he were sufficient to revenge of himself, by taking upon him the burden of his
honor, he should come to dishonor himself; therefore the Father is not tied
to revenge the injury of his strong and able child, as neither the Son his
Fathers wrong, when of himself he is sufficient to answer the offender: and to
conclude, the strong and mighty, stands bound to answer for the weak, and
impotent, considering the injury is done in despite of him, that can revenge
himself, when it is not offered through any manifest fault of him offended: for
otherwise to revenge his cause who is justly offended, were no other, but to
fail in justice, and therefore I say by manifest fault, because if it were
secret, he is by all means to endeavor to keep it close, that he offended rest
not infamous. Considering that we are, not only bound to protect our selves,
but also the honor of the^ that belong to us. Bentiuoglie was satisfied, and
count Alfonso Turchie You, if I understood well, said he, have recounted
heresy among those defects that deprive of honor, and this, in my opinion,
has in it some difficulty, seeing honor and dishonor agree with action, and
not with opinion, and sin or maleficence, as the Philosopher affirms, in the
sixth of his Ethikes, is not properly of knowledge, nor of opinion, and it is
clear, that heresy is no other but an opinion, which though it be false yet
shall not he herewith possessed, rest infamous, and the reason is ready, made
by the same Philosopher in the third of his Ethikes: for honor, dishonor,
reward, and punishment, follow those actions that depend on free will, and are
in our power, but the sin of heresy is not in our power, seeing we cannot
enter into what opinion we would, but are enforced to believe what the mind
judges to be true, or like to truth.

Although heresy (answered Gualinguo) as it it is an opinion, can neither give
nor take away honor: notwithstanding in as much as it is a beginning to work
against holy laws, and Catholic decrees, it makes a man more then all other
sins, infamous, when either by tongue, or exterior actions she comes to
manifest her self. Distinguishing therefore, I affirm that heretics are of
two sorts: the one secret, who neither with words nor deeds, discover their
Heresy: and these, though they loose the favor of God, yet do they not forgo
their honor, for the reasons above cited: The other kind be manifest, which
impudently strive against the laws and institutions of holy Christian Church:
and further, seek to draw this and that man into their perverse opinion, by
scandalizing the world, and therefore loose their honor, they being held in
the opinion of the world, to have failed in justice, and to be most notable
destroyers of souls health, the which of honest men ought to be preferred
before all other goods. Undoubtedly said Count Alfonso, these sorts of men, are
not only worthy of eternal infamy, and in comparison of honor to be
excepted against, but for chasticement, are right worthy of the fire. I am
also in doubt, said Scipion Sacrati, neither can I see, how it may be, that an
usurer should loose his honor; as also I cannot perceive, in what respect he
fails in justice or valor: but I call to mind a Dialogue of a great learned
man, wherein he proves, that usury is necessary to live well and happily.
It is necessary, answered Gualinguo, that husbandmen should be great usurers,
as Virgill teaches, and that they should labor, that the earth may render an
hundred for one, and after this manner does learned Spocone entend it in his
dialogue: but the usurer whom I place among men dishonored, is not such a one:
but rather one that is unjust, and who practices against good laws, seeking
unlawful gain, and using monye contrary to his proper nature. And wherefore
against his proper nature, replied Sacrati? Because, answered Gualinguo, money
by the law, was to no other end found out, but to make contracts equal, in
the exchange of things, whereupon he that uses it without any change,
imploieth it contrary to his nature, and against the ordinance of the law: But
such a one is the usurer, because he changes not his money for commodity, but
money immediately for money, and therefore usury by the Grecians was termed
Focos, which signifies one begotten; for as the child is like him that begot
him, so money employed by the usurer, is like the money, which without any
permutatio^, but only with the benefit of time, it brings forth. The usurer
deservedly therefore is put in the number of those infamous, because by an
evil mean, he wastes other men's goods. Sacrati said no more: When Count
Hereule Tassone: seeing honor is lost by failing in justice, or valor, I would
further understand, whether of these two defects deeplyer wound honor.
Questionless honor cannot be lost but in defect of Justice, answered
Gualinguo, neither does want of valor, touch honor in any other respect, but
because with such a defect, there is annexed injustice, or the caracter
thereof. I understand you not after my mind, said Tassone: and Gualinguo: He
which through vilitie hazardeth not his life, for Religion, his Country,
Prince, and Friends, commits an unjust fact: for a man not being borne to
himself, but for all these, defraudeth his Country, Prince, Religion, and
Friends, of that which is their proper good: and therefore as unjust he is
worthy of infamy: he likewise, that is not moved with an injury, besides
that he infringeth the law of Nature, which permits every one to repel
force with force, he carries also with him the caracter of injustice. And how
ca^ this be, replied Tassone, if to suffer injury as the Philosopher affirms,
is free from vice, and to offer it, is vicious and unjust. The Philosopher
says well, answered Gualinguo, but yet this takes not away my positio^, for
though the suffering of injury be without vice, yet gives it some testimony of
vice in the patie^t, for that by this act of supporting injury, he shows
himself worthy of contempt, and consequently, unjust, and wicked; for only the
wicked man is worthy to be ignominious. Seeing honor is not lost, added
Tassone, but through want of justice, and defect of valor is a kind of
injustice, this word Valor, in the definition of honor, seems to be
superfluous. The common sort, said Gualinguo, not knowing, that justice
comprehends al virtues, and injustice al vices, and ordinarily distinguishing
between base actions, and those of injustice, to make men learned, as also
unlearned, conceive the nature of this our honor: the word valor is not only
not superfluous, but necessary, and so much the more, by reason common opinion
holds base and cowardly men, more infamous then those unjust: and in every
one, want of valor is more observed, then that of justice.

Nay, said Count Hercules, the abuse is grown so far, as all men valiant of
person are esteemed honest men, although in the rest they be most dissolute.
This happens answered Gualinguo, because the common sort, which know not the
inward virtues of the mind, measures the goodness and valor of a man, from the
force of his body, and not from the power of his mind, little observing, that
as man by the virtue of the mind, exceeds the creatures, so in strength of
body, by many beasts he is excelled. Tassone said nothing else, but count
Hercules Mosti objected: tell me sir knight, if this our honor once lost, may be
recovered again. Let every one take heed, said Gualinguo, of loosing his
honor, for being once justly lost, it can never be recovered: and I said
justly, because lost otherwise, it may rather be termed honor suspended then
lost, as it happens to those honest men, who by false suggestions enter into
the evil opinion of the world, seeing it may come to pass, that time in the
end discovering the truth, they may recover their good name. You impose too
severe a law upon honor. Signior Gualinguo, replied Count Hercules, in that it
only being once lost, you give out, it cannot be recovered: for my part, I
judge it scarce reasonable, that one bad action cannot by many other good be
recompensed, for this is no other, but to bring an offender into extreme
desperation: by which mean honor, that in a man ought to be the principal
cause of doing well, would be an occasion for him to multiply his flagitions,
without ever reforming them. By my definition of honor delivered, you should
be out of doubt (answered Gualinguo) that honor justly lost, cannot be
recovered. For if it be true that honor is a firm opinion in him that
honors, that he honored has neu^^ led in justice nor valor: one that has
only failed once, and is known for the man, cannot come within the compass of
this definition, because then it should not be conuertible with the defirite,
and would be no other, but as if we should ascribe a reasonable soul to an
ass. But if men, added Mosti, should turn to have as good an opinion of such
an one, as at the first, might he not, recovering the privilege of honor,
come within this definition? If we should grant, said Gualinguo, that an ass
had wings, we might conclude, that he were a bird and foul, therefore I say
unto you, that this case in him can hardly be admitted, who has justly lost
his honor, because they who have notice of his defect, although they would, yet
could they not of such an one retain so good an opinion, as at the first, if
they lost not also their own memories, the which is hard, or at least very
difficult. For men for the most part, being envious and maleuolent, they are
unmindful of virtuous actions, keeping them close, but they reserve fresh in
memory another man's misdeedes, and continually with their tongues blaze it
abroad: and touching this severe and strict law of honor, I say it is severe,
but yet just, and likewise those laws be just, though austere, that cut off
the lives of malefactors, or their members, the which things, though they be
irrecouerable, yet cannot these chasticements hold malefactors in: but if the
fear of loss were recompensed with the hope of recovery, who sees not how
great the number of wicked men would be, and of those ready to work mischief.

The law of honor then, is the cause of well doing, and not of multiplying
flagition, because the greater sort of men hold their honor so dear, as that
they dare not do evil, for fear of the loss thereof, knowing that it once
only being lost, can never be recovered. But for all this, I do not affirm,
that a man who has ceased the honor of the world, should upon this multiply
in flagitions, without ever reforming himself, but rather the contrary, that a
man after the recovery of the former good opinion, cannot do better, then
manifest to the world in all his actions ensuing, that he is penitent and
turned to a better life: for though it may well be, that he shall hardly be able
to return to his first degree of honor, yet he may become a good man, and shun
continual reproach. And how should it come to pass, replied Mosti, that
proouing a good man, he should not likewise become honorable: I pray you tell
me, is not an honest man worthy of honor? If you deny this, you frame a paradox
against the Philosopher, who affirm, that only the honest man is worthy of
honor. An honest man, answered Gualinguo, is two manner of ways understood:
One is, he that never cracked his credit, but is well known for such an one, and
this man is truly worthy of honor, and deservedly honored: The other is he,
who having once or twice failed, and known for such an one, in the end
amendeth, and becomes good; this man is not absolutely worthy of honor,
neither can he be counted honorable, but only in comparison of a man impious.
Count Hercules was content with this last distinction: when Count Gherardo
Beuelacqui, I saw said he, in the book of Posseuiuo, entitled, of Honor,
amongst many other, this one notable disputation, whether honor consists in
the honorer, or him honored, and notwithstanding he greatly laboreth to
ressolue this difficulty, yet my conceit was not therewith satisfied; for by
one reason it seems to have residence in the honorer, seeing in him is placed
that opinion, which you auerre to be honor. On the other side, it appears
rather to be in him honored, seeing he gives denomination to the subject, and
that as milk for the whiteness is in it, comes to be termed white, so the
honored is so called, for the honor in himself understood: I desire therefore
to hear you upon this point.

This doubt, answered Gualinguo, has given diverse occasion of discussion, and
especially Posseuiuo, but because what he says, nothing touches this honor
whereof we entreat, but rather that which is acquired by beneficence, we will
leave it apart: therefore standing on the foundation of our natural honor, we
must observe, that a man supposed good, if nothing appear to the contrary,
honor proceeds from the apparent image of the virtue of the honored,
imprinted in the fantasy of the honorer: and because good opinion is the
proper essence of honor, we will say, that honor essentially is in the honorer,
and in the honored vertually (to use these terms) essentially in the honorer,
because in him remains the opinion; vertually in the honored, for that in him
is the hidden virtue, which of it self causes imagination in the fantasy of
the honorer, procuring opinion. This answer well pleased Count Gherardo, and
replying no further, Signior Hercole Gilioli: There rises in my mind a doubt,
said he, which springs from that before you affirmed, man to bring with him
this honor, from his mothers womb: If this be true, I cannot see how honor
should essentially be in the honored, seeing he enjoys it not from his
birth, and if in him it be essentially, how can it be recounted amongst goods
external? Man, as I have said, answered Gua. brings with him honor from his
mothers womb, because he is borne with that inward supposition, that he is
good, neither is it requisite, that to preserve this supposition, he labor
greatly, in that it suffices only, he never extremely offend against any
principal virtue. And for that of this supposition, in the end grows opinion,
in him honoring, which is honor, therefore it is said to be essentially in
the honourer. Yet is not to him as his own, but as a thing appropriate to the
honored. I affirm therefore, that notwithstanding the honored is borne with
possession of honor, yet makes not this, that in him honor should essentially
be: for if that were true, we might conclude, that riches likewise were
essentially in the wealthy man, seeing he is borne to possession of them, and
that they were not to be placed amongst goods external. Signior Hercules
held his peace, and the Lord Caesar Brancaccio whom now it concerned to
propound, musing alitle with himself: Me thinks, said he, that this our
honor, (and ours I call it, seeing Nature and Fortune offers unto us, without
our industry) gives occasion of doubt in this, I not having hitherto heard
any one question propounded, pertaining to that true honor, which by virtue and
valor is obtained, as though the Knight had so amply entreated, as that
nothing remained whereof you might doubt; I notwithstanding am not altogether
satisfied: for if it be true, that this honor is a reward that shows and
exalts the work of beneficence, and that not only those are honored, who
have persormed benefits, but he also is esteemed, that is likely to be
beneficial, this inconvenience insueth, that a wicked fellow, who either has,
or is likely to benefit, may be worthy of honor, as on the contrary, an honest
man unworthy, because he neither has, and is altogether unable to perform any
benefit. The man wicked, said Gualinguo, can in no sort be worthy of honor,
although he either has, or may perform a benefit, always provided, that he
be known for flagitious: first, in that he deprived of natural honor, is
incapable of any other: secondly, because the work of beneficence simply
suffices not, to make one worthy of honor, being requisite, that such an
action should be performed by an honest man, and to no other end: for he that
should place a benefit to thend to reap thereof gain or delight, such an one
should not be worthy of honor, neither could he be thought ingrate, that were
unmindful of such a benefit, or should not thereof make any demonstration; but
an honest man and so known, doing benefit, is worthy of honor, because he is
beneficial to no other but an honest end: neither can any be virtuous or good,
which is not apt to perform benefits. If a virtuous man, replied Brancaccio
were in calamity or poverty, how could he be beneficial? And Gual: The means
of benefiting be diners: for we may do good to the body, to the soul, by good
examples setting forth moral virtues and knowledge, or with physic procuring
health to the body: Finally, as it cannot choose, but the Sun must needs heat
and illuminate, so is it impossible, that a virtuous and good man should not be
beneficial, and consequently, unworthy of honor.

If they, added Brancaccio, that for profit, benefit, and not for honesty
were not worthy of honor, the Doctors that read publikly, the Physicians
that administer health to the body, advocates that defend goods and titles, and
other like virtuous men, who notwithstanding do great good, should be
unworthily honored: seeing all these practice their virtue for profit. And
Gualinguo: If these were principally moved by profit, aod not honesty, out of
all doubt they could not be worthy of honor, but if practicing for honesty,
together they attain profit, they shall not for this be unworthy: and
especially the Doctors, who read publicly, for they are publicly paid, and
public stipends, are in the number of points honorable. By good reason also
Physicians are honored, because in them there is virtue, and their end is
supposed honest, in that they set not their labor at sale: and notwithstanding
they extend forth the hand, to receive that which is given them, yet do they
this, because a gift is accounted as a point honorable, and a reward of
beneficent and well doing action: and therefore as the Philosopher says, a
gift is equallye desired by the ambitious, as by the covetous, of the ambitious
for honor, of the covetous man for profit. At this last answer, the Ladies
and Knights smiled, and Signior Brancaccio replied no further. But Signior
Scipion Gilioli took occasion of the doubt propounded by Signior Guilio Caesar:
I would willingly know, said he, seeing a wicked man by the work of
beneficence, cannot make himself worchie of honor, whether he may honor
another or no: by one reason it seems no, in that he cannot give what he
has not: but the wicked man has no honor: on the other side, if a wicked man
shall receive some singular benefit, from one honest and good, he may in
recompense erect unto him a Satue, make Himnes in his commendation, offer him
presents, and such like honors. A bad fellow, answered Gualinguo, can in this
do no honor to an honest man, who is truly honored, but rather by such like
ostentations he dishonors him, especially when the man depraved does him
this honor: for having received some benefit, either in his body or goods: for
an honest man cannot do good to the body or goods of one wicked, without
giving scandale of himself, seeing he is worthy of honor, that does good
for honesties sake, and to a party henest.

You said, replied Signior Scipione, that a man might many ways be
beneficial, that is, to the body, goods, and soul: put we the case, that a
good man, by doctrine, good examples and admonitions, do cure upon the sick
soul of one wicked, reducing him to better life, and that he for such a
benefit should erect unto him a statue, as they do who having escaped a
shipwreck, erect altares and statues, to God and religion, should not this be
honor to a virtuous man? Without doubt it should, and that most great, said
Gualinguo, in that of al benefits he has performed the greatest, which is,
the health of the soul. Then inferred Gilioli, a man wicked may perform a
most special honor, and yet not long since you denied it. I said, answered
Gualinguo, that a depraved man could not give honor, but he which having
received the health of his soul, does honor, honors not as he was wicked,
but as he is a good man, and therefore the honor he offers is not to be
despised, for though it be not honest, that a good man should further the
body or goods of one wicked, yet is it most honest to procure unto him the
health of his soul: and whosoever performs such a benefit, makes himself
worthy of honor; Signior Scipione used no further speech. When Signior
Alessandro Andriasi: You sir Knight, have defined this honor whereof we
entreat, to be the reward of beneficence, if this definition were true, it
would follow, that the inferior could not honor the superior, for as it is
proper to the superior, to give, and not receive reward, so is it proper to
the inferior, to receive and not give. And Gualenguo: reward may be
considered, after two sorts, which be, as it is profitable, or as it is
honorable: as profitable it concurreth not with the definition of honor, but as
it is honorable it therein takes place. In this sort therefore considered, it
may be thus given by the inferior, as unto him also from the superior: for the
recognisance of virtue, is common both to the one and other. Yet is there this
difference, by reason that what by the greater is given to the inferior, besides
being a note and testimony of virtue, it shows also supereminencie in the
superior, and therefore requires thankefulnes and gratitude: but that from the
inferior to the greater, containing duty, is a sign of humility, and is
called reverence. This excellent destinction pleased all the standers by, and
Andriasi replying no further. Signior Galiazzo Fiaschi: I remember said he
amongst other matters I saw in the book of Posseuino, this conclusion, that
honor consists more in desert, then possession; where of I doubt: and upon
this expect your opinion. And Gualenguo: Posseuino, or the author of that
book, as many other things, so does he maintain this conclusion against
Aristotle, from whom he shows himself altogether dismembered, and separate:
for if it were true, that honor consisted, rather in deserving, the^ possessing
thereof, that likewise should be salfe, which the Philosopher affirms in the
first of his Ethickes. That honor is not our own, but depends more of the
honorer then him honored: neither could honor be recounted, amongst goods
external, or of fortune: for though it be in our power, to make our selves
worthy of honor, yet is it not in our power to receive or possesle it: seeing
through the ingratitude or ignorance of them, in whose hands just distributio^
lies, we are often times deceived. Therefore conformable to this, Cicero cited
this notable sentence: Virtue for guide, but Fortune for companion, I would
have. Minding to infer, that if the virtuous man have not Fortune for his
companion, he cannot have pessession of honor: and that virtue without fortune,
is of it self unto it insufficient: the opinion of Cicero was held for truth.
When Caualier Guirino: Seeing you sir Knight have concluded with the
Philosophers and Ciceros authority, that honor consists rather in possession
the^ desert, I desire to understand further: whether a virtuous and prudent
man, ought to seek and demand that honor, whereof he knows himself
meritorious, or holding his peace, to attend while fortune accompany his valor
and defect, with honorable charge, leaving al other means: In that by one
reason it seems he should not: for in seeking after them, he incurreth
suspect of ambition, which ought to be abhorred of an honest man: on the other
side by not laboring and suing after it, he is in danger to be thereof
deprived, and consequently, not to be known for virtuous: considering that
honor is the ensign of virtue: as by effect we see, that some are esteemed of
valor, by enjoying magistracy, titles, and other such like honors,
notwithstanding that in them selves, they have not the least shadow of virtue.
Then Gualinguo: It is the property of a virtuous and wise man, not to show
himself desirous of honor, neither to seek or crave it, but directing all his
actions to honesty, by this mean to make himself worthy of honor; yet ought
he not to live so contemptibly, as after the manner of Diogeues Cinicke, to
manifest, that he holds honor in scorn, but rather whenever occasion
presents it self, he ought with modesty to accept of those honors that
befit him, that he incur not the vice of pusillanimitie. If it be true,
replied Guirini, that honor is deserved by virtue, and by fortune acquired: I
cannot see, why a virtuous man may not seek at the hands of for tune, the honor
he deserves, considering that fortune is not moved except she be sought unto
and urged: we being wont for this cause to say, that she is not favorable, to
the timorous and slothful, but to the bold and aduenturous: and it is an
opinion approved by all the Philosophers, that a wise man is the framer of his
own fortune: And I know some gentlemen, which to others also are well enough
known, virtuous, prudent, and of great desert, yet for that they have (as we
said) bin ever cold, and not urged fortune, nor sought the honors they
deserved, live in their City without any renoume: whereupon by Court
impostors, this their modesty is esteemed pusillanimitie, not to say plain
stupidity: whereas on the contrary, every day we see men of small desert, raised
to great honors, by having been audacious, and assaying all means, as well
lawful as unlawful, but specially in procuring to themselves their favor, that
could bestow on them honor or riches. And if we do but think upon the
examples, as well of the ancientes, as men of these times, we will conclude,
that valiant men ought to seek, and hunt after honors, that they may be known
to be the men they are. For beginning from the Romans, as they were virtuous,
and of great valor, so did they demand, and by all means affect honors: unto
them, it not seeming sufficient, to deserve it, except they also fished for it:
with great suit therefore they required the Pretorships, Consulshippes,
Pontificacie, all Magistracies, and other dignities that appertained to honor,
as also the Generals of armies or Consuls were wont, returning into their
country laden with spoil of their enemies, with all instance to demand
triumph: and oftentimes this being denied them, they raised sedition in the
commonwealth, which surely they would never have done, but that they knew,
that to seek and hunt after honor, is proper to a virtuous man, and to one
that deserves: and to come to more modern examples, let us see, whether in
the most famous Venetian commonwealth, honors and magistracy be by the
nobility required: in such sort, as it seems no whit inconvenient for any
gentleman whatsoever of singular virtue, to demand Magistracy, with that
their manner of supplication, which they call Broio; and yet for all this are
they not counted ambitious, but rather doing otherwise, they should be
esteemed lostie and proud: as if for this received honor, they were rather
bound to their own proper virtue, then to those, who graciously dispensed it
unto them. But what need we to use any more preualent example, do we not
read that the master of good customs, Aristotle himself with his followets
having plucked Plato now old, out of his chair, went and sat in it himself,
not respecting to dishonor his master, for the exaltation of himself with
that honor, whereof he thought he was worthy? I will not therefore think, that
to seek honor is any heresy at all, or a thing unworthy of a virtuous and
wise man. The virtuous man, said Gualinguo, directs al his actions to
honesty, and not to honor, for though there were no honor in the world, yet
would he perform honest actions, considering that humane felicity consists
in virtuous and honest action, and not in honor, as the Philosopher affirms
in the second of his Ethikes: nay, and as often as he should perform honest
actions, to no other end, but to obtain honor, and not honest reputation,
such an action of it self should neither be virtuous nor worthy of honor.
But the ambitious man making small reckoning of honesty, is he that always
works in favor of honor, seeking that honor which is not convenient for
him, from the place with him not befitting, and with the means for him, no
ways requisite.

I would have thought, said Guirino, that Honor and Honesty haddde been the
self same thing, especially, the Philosopher having placed it amongst things
honest, or at least so, that the one cannot stand without the other: in such
sort, that we cannot endeavor in favor of honesty, without having an eye
unto honor: as likewise, he that did attend honor, should have regard to
honesty. And Gualinguo: although there is nothing honest, which is not also
worthy of honor, and notwithstanding honor properly agrees with things
honest, yet honor without honesty, and honesty without honor may be found:
for as one may deserve, and not possess honor, so may he unworthily enjoy
honor that deserves it not, considering that the possession of honor is in
the hands of Fortune, and not of virtue, as has been said. By the definition
of honor replied Guiring, it seems that honor and honesty are inseparable:
for if honor be a sign of honest action, it will follow, that where honor
is, there must likewise be honesty, as also where honesty is, there must
needs be honor: as (for to use the example of Posseuino) where is the figne,
there is the Inn, neither without the sign can the Inn stand: and where
ashes be, there either is, or has been fire, for ashes is a manifest token of
fire, as milk is of pregnancy in a woman. If honor (said Gualinguo) were as
necessary a sign of honesty, as ashes of fire, or milk of child quickening
and pregnancie, this argument would quickly be concluded, but though honor be
a sign and reward of beneficence, yet it is no necessary token of honest
action: for it may be honor, though unworthily, where virtue is not, or
virtuous action may stand without deserved honor, when she finds her self by
fortune abandoned: and to prosequute the example of Posseuino, as many times
there be Innes, and especially in Spain, which have nothing good in them but
the sign or garland, that deceive strangers, seeing within there is neither
bread nor wine, nor any of those things that are the proper sustentations of an
Inn, so may diverse be found, that not having in themselves any virtue,
possess by the stroke of blind fortune, the exterior ensign of virtue, which
is honor. But to return from whence we have digressed, I affirm, that to seek
possession of honor by any other mean, then by the desert of virtue, is not a
thing honest nor convenient for a virtuous and good man, so that with a quiet
mind he ought rather to suffer the deprivation thereof, then by demanding it,
to manifest himself ambitious, and defirous of honor, retaining always in
memory this infallible proposition, that to require honor, annihilateth the
desert of wertue. And therefore the Philosopher in the third of his Politikes
says, that he who demands magistracy, she weth himself rather ambitious,
then deserving it, and he adds, that magistracies should rather be given to
those that modestly refuse them, then to such as impudently require them: which
being true, the modesty of those gentlemen, by you and others known to be
virtuous, ought not to be taxed, although they live a private life, not
practicing every day, after the manner of men ambitious, and that shamefully
beg honors. But rather that Signior or prince is to be blamed, in whose hands
it lies to dispense rewards, punishments, honors, grace, and favors. For if
he knows not the desert of every subject, but espetially of such as be
noble, who of themselves are worthy to be regarded, he incurreth like blame,
as the shepherd that knows not his sheep: but if he know them, and yet
distribute his honors and favors, to flatterers, ignorant, and presumtuous men,
little esteeming the modest and virtuous, he shows himself unjust, and
unworthy of principality. And touching the example of the Romans, if we mesure
well their actions, we shall find that in their commonwealth they were rather
good citizens, then virtuous and good men. I would have thought (said Guirini)
that a good citizen and an honest man had bin al one: And Gualinguo: In the
best commonwealth it is al one, because her end is honest: but in that
commonwealth which prefers profit before honesty, a good man and good
citizen be not al one: And such an one was the Roman commonwealth, she ever
having had this scope, to signiorize over others, and therefore the Romans,
notwithstanding they were good Citizens, and profitable for the commonwealth,
yet surely they were not virtuous nor good men, but rather ambitious, they
seeking the honor, not of honesty, but of profit: and that this is true, by a
decree of the Senate it may be proved, which thus disposed, that triumph
should not be granted, but upon the augmentation of empire, and not for
recovery only of things lost: as also, that no captain might triumph, if in
one battle only, he had not at the least put six thousand men to the sword.
Whether such an action be absolutely honest, or worthy of honor, I leave to you
to judge: for my part, I would say, that to shed humane blood, for the wicked
desire of Empire, were an action rather wicked and dishonest than worthy of
honor: which being true, the examples of the Romans, ought not to remove us
from our opinion, seeing they ambitious, sought honor, from whence it befitted
not, and after a manner no ways convenient: but if they had been truly good
and virtuous, they would never with suit have demanded magistracy and
honors, being an action much more worthy of an honest man with modesty to be
refused, tha^ to be accepted of ambitiously. And to use the example of the
self same Romans, tell me in good ernest, whether of these two judge you to
be the honester action? That of Fuluius Flaccus, who to anoyde envy, refused
triumph, by others so much aspired after: or that of Q. Valerius, who blinded
with ambition, contended with Lutatius about triumph, not respecting how it was
not honest, that a Praetor in triumph should be equal with a Consul? And which
act was more worthy of commendation, that of Julius Caesar, in usurping the
perpetual Dictatorship, or the other of the great African, who having bin
entertained with honors correspondent to his deserts, and the Senate
determining further, to erect unto him an image, where the people used to
assemble, one in the Senate house, another in the Renghera, or place of
orations, as also to place his image in the Ca pitoll, where were the statues
of the gods, adorned with triumphant ornaments, and further to make him both
Consul and Dictator for term of life: he never would consent, that any of
these honors might be attributed unto him, neither by decree of the Senate,
nor voice of the people. sent that any of these honors, might be attributed
unto him, neither by the decree of the Senate, nor voice of the people.
Undoubtedly this valiant man, did no less show the greatness of his mind, in
refusing so great honors, than before he had done in deserving them: whereas on
the contrary, the mind of Caesar puffed up and full of ambition, by usurping
the highest of all honors, did not alittle obscure the desert of his renowned
valor, making him to be known, as question less he was, for a man ambitious
and wicked.

Concerning your modern example, of the Venetian Signiorie, as that most noble
commonwealth is armed with excellent laws, so is the practice of Broio (as a
course scarce honest) by law forbidden. And about reformation hereof is the
office of Censorship conversant: for truth whereof, they grant no magistracy
to them, who openly demand it, but to those that are chosen: and therefore,
before they create a magistrate, they first call out by scruteny, those that
are to have the election; and he to whose lot the golden Ballot falls out, is
the Elector that propounds and nominaceth him, whom he thinks worthy of the
magistracy; and that of al he may be known for such an one the Ballotini go
about (for so are they called that carry about the box with these Ballots)
declaring with an high voice, the honors and magistracies that before they
have performed. It cannot be denied, said Guirino, but that commonwealth
governed by the Holyghost, is furmshed with excellent laws: notwithstanding
the practice of Broio is so inueterate, that there is no Magistrate chosen, but
by this mean: as also, they praeoccupy to be nominated and elected: yea and
openly give one to an other the tickets of their names, surnames, and offices,
they have gone through. This abuse, answered Gualinguo is not rashly
permitted, but with great judgment, seeing thereout they reap a benefit, that
tends to the preservation of the commonwealth, considering that by this
Broio, the Nobility is united, comoyning themselves rogether in love, procured
by this mutual and interchangeable benefit: and by surname, knowing one
another, they are wary to offend in any case: so that I assure you, those
gentlemen, do more fear one of those ragged pelers of paper, then do soldiers
the leaden bullet of the hargabuse. Surely I remain satisfied, said Guirino,
that a virtuous and good man, ought not to prosecute honor, but with desert of
virtue, and virtuous action. And Count Caesar Tassone: Seeing an honest man
must not show himself so much as desirous of honor, yet I would willingly
understand, on whether of these two he ought to be most ententiue, either to
receive honor, or to do honor to another: for my part I would think, that
honor being a sign which shows virtue, an honest man, to make himself
known for the man he is, ought rather to cover by honor amongst others to be
famous, then he himself to honor another, considering that to honor another,
seems a token of submission, and notes I know not what kind of
supereminencie in him honored. A good man, answered Gualinguo, ought rather to
be careful in doing honor, then in receiving honor from another, and the
reason is in readiness: for though we be not honored by another, yet lose we
not the desert of honor: but on the contrary, we not honoring those, to whom
we are bound to render honor, we wholly manifest our selves unjust, and
unworthy of honor: Furthermore, to do honor, and especially to him that
deserves, is an honest action, and ever proper to a good man: but in receiving
honor, the honored performs nothing honest: and notwithstanding it be a sign
of virtue in the honored, yet is it no such necessary token as we have said;
for a wicked man may also receive honor, although he be voworthy. Tassone
commended this answer. When Signior Francisco, Patritio: You sir Knight have
given me but small occasion to doubt, yet would I willingly, somewhat more
exquisitly understand, how it can be, that the honor by you termed natural, and
as it were imperfect, should be a former disposition to perfect honor,
considering you explained it from this point very diverse. And Gualingua The
honor which is our own, and whereof every one makes prosession, is out of
doubt a former disposition to that honor, which with virtue is acquired: for
whosoever wants the good opinion of the world, is incapable of all, but
especially, of perfect honor, as a living thing wanting virtue vegetative,
cannot have sense. If perfect honor, said Patritio, (for so will we call that,
which is the reward of virtue) cannot consist without the imperfect, wherefore
have you said that the imperfect honor has no part in felicity, but only
the perfect? Imperfect honor said Gualinguo, may be understood by it self
alone, (as many times we find it) or else as conjoined with that perfect: of
it self alone it has no part in felicity, because felicity depends on
operation according to the best and most perfect virtue: and this is not
derived from excellent operation, but from not performing very vicious action:
and therefore it brings not with it felicity, but makes a man indifferent,
neither happy, nor miserable; but when we consider it, as united with perfect
honor, then we may say, that it is a disposition and preparation to felicity.

Patritio was satisfied, and Signior Hercules Varani, who has no small taste
of learning, propounded after this manner: The Philosopher shows in the first
of his Ethickes, in the place above cited, that felicity is not honor,
because felicity is our own, and honor is not: and rendering hereof a reason,
he uses these formal words: It seems honor is rather in the performer,
than in him that receives it. Out of which words, some move this question;
whither honor, be in the honorer, or honored: and amongst others, Posseuino
makes a large discussion, concluding that honor, is both in the one and
other. In the honorer, because he does his duty, in honoring him that
deserves: and in the honored, as receiving the reward of virtuous operation.
Now of this honor wherewith we are borne, you have sufficiently showed how
it is both in one and other; but of perfect honor we stand in doubt.

And Gualinguo: It is no less improper, for to search whether this honor, be
in him honoring, or the honored, than it would be to demand, whether the
Statue were in the Grauer, in the procurer of it to be wrought, or in him whose
image it represents: therefore I say, that honor as a reward, is neither in
him honoring, nor the honored. And what sense will you apply to the words of
the Philosopher, replied Varani? When Gualinguo: The Philosopher would
infer, that honor being no other, than that reward, which shows operation
of virtue, it depends of the giver, as of the cause efficient, which is he
honoring, and not of the other honored, being he that receives it: seeing
it is in our power to deserve it, but not to receive it, as we have said: yet
to honorable action, he honored concurreth in a more eminent manner, than
the honorer; in that he thereto concurreth as the end, he honoring
performing honor, in favor of the other honored: but if by this reason, honor
were formally, both in the honorer, and honored, by the contentment, which of
honorable action, is both in the one and other, as affirms Posseuino, this
would be false which the Philosopher says, for the contentment of receiving
honor, being greater than of performing it, it would by this means come to
be, more in the honored that receives, then in the honorer, that performs
it. And how can it be added Varano, that in receiving there should be greater
contentment, than in perfourming, considering (as the same Posseuino affirms)
that it is a thing more excelent to do, than suffer: but he that receives
suffers? This proposition also of Posseuino, answered Gualinguo, is false,
speaking absolutely, for being always true, it would follow that the creature
in reasonable action were more excellent than the Creator. But to the end we
err not in this, it must be observed, that to give, and receive, is considered
two manner of ways: one, when we perform or give simply in honesty, without
having received, or so much as hoped for any benefit. And in this kind, it is
much more excellent to give the^ to receive, and the contentment of him that
gives, is much more, then of the other that receives, for in the giver,
abundance appears, but in the receiver, indigence. The other kind is, when we
give in recompense of a received benefit, and especially the reward of Virtue,
which is the honor of this world: and in this respect undoubtedly it is a
matter of greater excellence to receive then give, because it notes abundance
of perfection in the receiver, and want in him that gives: and so
consequently, it is a greater contentment to receive after this manner, the^ to
give: conformable to which our opinion, the Philosopher in the second of his
Rhetoric, says: The performer of a benefit is much more joyful in beholding
him benefited, then is the receiver in seeing his benefactor: and to conclude,
by how much the cause final is more noble and excellent then the efficient,
so much more excellent is it to receive, then to give honor.

And therefore the most mighty God concurreth with honor, as of all other
things the most eminent, being the end, in favor whereof all things do move.
Signior Hercules approved this answer: and Signior Francesco Villa, thus
propounded: You, sir knight, have defined honor universally to be the most
precious of all goods external, which being true, it would follow, that
Praise, Honor, Glory, and Fame, should be the self same things signified by
these diverse names, or being different, your proposition would be false, for
glory is much more esteemed then honor, which seems to be most precious, as
that which only agrees with God. And Gualin: Your doubt Signior Villa, is no
less excellent and gracious then your self, wherefore resolving it, I say,
that if we consider the foundation, and from whence they take their original,
praise, honor, and glory, be the self same things, neither does one in
perfection exceed another, seeing al of them are grounded upon virtue, and from
her are derived. And therefore the Romans so joined together the Temple of
Virtue and Honor, as to the Temple of Honor one could not pass, unless first
he wen by that of Virtue: but if we consider these terms in themselves, they
are of diverse signification: for speaking properly, we praise habites and
virtues, but attribute honor to the actions that of virtue depend, and glory
to the excellence of virtue and actions together: distinguishing therefore
every one of these terms, we will affirm, that praise is a speech, which
shows and exalts another man's virtue, the which in two sorts is afforded,
with lively voice, and in writing, as also by poesy: and this by the Grecian
is called Encomion, and has his place with honor permanent: Glory, the
faithful heir as it were, of Praise, is no other but a common and approved
opinion, of another man's excellent virtue and Heroycall acts, and from honor
is different, because this, without any other sign or reward, may be preserved
in memory with men, through infinite ages. Fame, notwithstanding it seem the
same that is Glory, that also being a public rumor, that brings forth
universal opinion, yet is it from Glory different, first, because she in one
instant has her sorce, and many times is falacious: but Glory is ever firm,
as not framed but with long time. Moreover, glory is always taken in good
part, Fame sometimes well, otherwhiles evil, whereupon wicked men also are
said to be famous: and therefore Fame of Virgill is described, to be an
horrible monster, then which there is nothing more swift. It seems also that
Fame agrees most with the dead, but Glory belongs also to the living. For
the excellent Philosophers, and great Captains, now long since dead, are said
by Fame to be exalted to the stars, but glory the living also enjoy.

Signior Villa was pleased with this answer, and the Lady Tarq. Molza drawing
near, a woman of most pregnant capacity, seeing how in that noble assembly
there was not any, who would further propound with the favor of the Queen,
spoke after this sort: It appears Sir knight, that you have handled this
argument of honor, in favor only of men, as though women therein, had no
part at al: seeing al those aduertisements by which honor is preserved, do in a
manner pertain altogether to men, and little or nothing to women; because for
my part I will not be of opinion, that a woman loses her honor, if with her
proper valor she repel not injury, or fight not for her Country, Prince,
children, or husband, performing other such like actions, as belong unto
fortitude. Forbear not therefore to instruct women, how they may preserve
their honor: And Gualinguo: Although in women, most gentle Lady, all those
virtues are found, which proportionally are correspondent to the virtues of
men, notwithstanding it seems, that for preserving their honor, their
condition is far better then men's: for Honor feminine is preserved by not
failing only in one of their proper particular virtues, which is honesty. If
a woman therefore, replied Lady Tarquinia, should commit a thest,
manslaughter, or fail in any other part of Justice, should she not for such a
fact be infamous? And Gualenguo: Although such offenses, in men and women, are
by the laws equally punished, yet as often as in a woman they are not
accompanied with the act of dishonestie, they make her not infamous. Therefore
it was not lawful with the Hebrews nor Romans, to refuse their wives, as
also at this day the separation of marriage bed is not permitted, but for crime
of dishonestie, seeing in a woman, this offense is so grievous, as with her
own, she staineth also the honor of her husband.

This is a great matter you acqaint me withal, added Molza, neither can I
perceive how it may be, the definition of honor, remaining firm, wherein you
conclude, that honor is lost through our own, and not for another defect: the
adultery therefore of the wife, being of a wife the defect and offense, and
not of her husband, she only ought therefore to be infamous.

The wife, answered Gua. being in her husbands power, and under his
government, it appears she cannot offend, without some fault in her husband,
as he that either by consent, or evil government, has been the occasion of
such a defect: and therefore it cannot be that the adulterous wife, should not
in some part offend her husbands honor, because such a man, cannot be in that
good opinion he first was, with them who have notice of this offense, for they
judge him ignorant, of small worth, and worthy of that contempt his wife and
adulterer procure him. And if the husband, said Molza, knew not the adultery
of his wife, but had thereof all the convenient care he might, and yet for all
this, his wife should be so malicious, as he not ware thereof, to set a
creast on his head: should the husband for this lose his honor?

A man not being able, answered Gualenguo, to avoid all snares and deceits,
nor to prevent those things, whereof he has no knowledge, should not
altogether loose his honor, notwithstanding, it could not otherwise in some
sort be, but that he should be touched, and shake his reputation with those
men, who were acquainted with his wises adultery: yet could he not in
comparison of honor be excepted against, unless it were proved, that he
tolerated his wifes dishonestie, for some benefit he hoped for in simplicity,
or through folly; suffering her to go into places dishonest, or to converse
with women of evil name, or where there were danger that she might commit
adultery; for certainly he is a fool, that puts fire to towe and thinks
it should not burn.

To return therefore to our purpose, a woman desirous to preserve her honor,
ought to have an eye to preserve her honesty, and not only to be free from
offense, but also from suspicion of offense: the which she shall conveniently
do, if she accompany her words, laughter, looks, and carriage of her
person, with that grave and reverent majesty, as is beseeming a chaste and
modest Matrone, and above all, to avoid the familiar conversation of any man,
be his condition whatsoever, except her father, son, and brother: For honor
having his foundation and proper essence in the opinion of the world, it is
not so much lost for offense, as by probable presumptions of offending, With
this answer, by the Queen commended, and by all these most chaste and
virtuous Ladies confirmed, they ended the discourse of honor; and the Lady
Laura Peuerara was called, who with singular delight to the hearers, sung unto
the Harp an amorous Sonnet. But the court and huutsmen arrived, the Queen and
company retired them selves into the lodging of the Duchess, where, with
diverse entertainements they spent the time while Supper; which finished, and
certain dances exercised, the night being well spent, the Duke rose up, and
referring over his fishing to the day following they all betook themselves to
their rest.

The fourth days discourse: Wherein is discussed, the iniquity of Combat,
and single fight for maintenance of reputation, with the mean to accommodate
quarrels, and reduce unto peace private enmities.
THE whole Court and his Highness, being ready in the morning to have gone to
sea, there suddenly rose a most furious wind, which having incontinently, as
it were, obscured the air, with thick and dark clouds, held the whole
company in suspense, till dinner time: Finally, by all those experienced, the
time being thought unfit, either to draw the nets, or practice other manner
of fishing, as also to be dangerous, for going on the sea; the Duke, after the
tables were taken away, and the rain even now ready to descend, gave liberty
to the Ladies and Gentlemen, to betake themselves to that entertainment of
time, which best stood with their contentment: some therefore went to cards,
some to tables, other some to chesse, and diverse spent the time in pleasant
discourses. Signior Gualinguo was set down by himself alone, al melancholy,
leaning his cheek on his hand: which Count Alfonso Turchi perceuing, as he who
is desirous to understand (especially such matters as appertain to
knighthoode) going to count Scandiano, count Hercules Beuelacqua, and count
Guido Calcagnini, who stood beholding at a window the tempestuous sea: Let us
go, said he, to Signior Gualinguo, who sits there altogether idle, and
procure we him to discourse a little more particularly touching Honor and
Combat. For although yesterday, he entreated thereof, yet stood he altogether
upon generalities, not extending himself greatly to particulars, which in my
opinion, are of no small importance. This motion well pleased the other three
Gentlemen, it seeming unto them, that they could not spend the day in more
pleasing or profitable entertainment. Approaching therefore near Gualinguo,
sir knight, said Count Alfonso, if we be importunate, blame your own virtue,
and the desire we have to understand: Yester evening in favor of the Queen,
to our great benefit and contentment, you made it known, that there were two
honors, in themselves diverse, the one of which might be called perfect,
grounded upon an opinion, for the most part false; and the other truly perfect,
as grounded upon true apparent valor, and upon the most excellent of all
virtuous operations. To day seeing the time forcibly keeps us in the house,
we desire, that in favor of your self, you will discourse of combat: for
those who write of combat, not having distinctly known the nature of honor,
doubtlesle, they have not thereof sincerely entreated.

Although to this hour, answered Gualinguo, there has not any written
sufficiently of Combat, and that for this, many abuses have been introduced
into the Titles of honor; yet in this, neither I can, or ought to give you
satisfaction: first, because the Treatise thereof is superfluous, Combat now
being no more in use, but removed out of christian commonwealths, by Popes and
christian Princes, as a thing certainly, I will not say barbarous, (in that
amongst Barbarians we never find it accustomed) but impious and profane:
secondarily, as a man expressing the truth, I neither can nor ought to dilate,
but in discommendation of it, showing contrary to the vanity of Doctor Paris
de Puteo, and Posseuino, that it is unjust, and worthy to be wholly banished
out of the commonwealth, as a destroyer of humane felicity; if you will not
according to our desire, said Alfonso, discourse thereof, at the least yet, may
it please you, by us demanded, to answer to those points, wherein we do doubt,
and have not understanding. And Gualinguo: I will not refuse to make answer, and
resolve you to my power, if you should thereof have any wrong or sinister
opinion. You entreating of honor, added Count Alfonso, said, that Combat was
wholly grounded upon that honor, we bring with us from our mothers womb, and
whereof every one makes profession, it being honor imperfect: and that it
has nothing to do with that honor which is a part or circumstance of
felicity. Of this I stand in doubt: For besides that Posseuino holds the
contrary, he grounding Combat upon that honor which is a sign of
beneficent opinion: further then this, also it seems there is some reason,
that a man in combat, putting his life to compromise, ought rather to expose
it for honor perfect, than imperfect: especially perfect honor, being part of
felicity, unto which, as to his proper end man directs all his operations.
And Gualinguo: What I told you yesterday is true, that Combat has not to do
with that honor, which is a part of felicity, and reward of beneficence: the
which I will make you conceive, by the definition it self of Combat, which in
my opinion ought to be such: Combat is a bartaile betwixt two of equal
interest, in some point of honor, in the end whereof the vanquished incurreth
infamy, and the victor remains possessed of Honor: We having therefore
showed that infamy is not contrary, to perfect honor, which with valor is
acquired, it follows that the honor in Combat debated, neither is, nor can
be perfect honor: but that honor, which is proper contrary to infamy.

This also is made manifest by the two means, wherewith quarrels are
protested: For he which challenges, called therefore the Assailant, offers
to prove upon him challenged, who in this respect is termed Defendant, that he
has committed some of those offenses, that deprive of honor, and that
therefore he is infamous: in the other kind, the assailant offers to prove
himself a man of honor, and that he is unworthy of the injury and contempt,
which the Defendant has offered him, being as much as if he should say, that
he would prove upon him, that himself never fail^^ in justice, nor honor. For
by such defects a man comes into contempt: and to stand upon use and custom,
we never do, nor shall find, that any quarrels have been undertaken, about
perfect honor, or that any for this have come to combat: for certainly it
would be a ridiculous matter, if any should offer to prove, that he is a man,
worthy of a statue, Image, crown, a public gift, to be reverenced, given
place unto, celebrated with hymns, or honored with such like honors, as also
it would be as far from reason, for a man to prove one infamous, not because he
had offended, but in that he never received any of those honors by me recited.
And to an swer that you spoke touching Posseuino, I know not how he came to be
so blind, as having defined honor, and entreated thereof, as the reward and
sign of beneficence, he afterward has so unadvisedly thereupon grounded
Combat, minding that the honor contended upon, within the listes, should be
that, which is the reward of beneficence, neither can we say, that he intended
it by any other honor: for besides that in all his book he has not discussed
or known any other honor but this, which is a part and proper condition of
felicity; he yet further in the beginning of the fifth Book manifests
himself clearly, saying that the honor, which is the end of Combat, is
explaned and defined in that part of Politickes which handles Customs; and
that therefore the Treatise of Combat, is a matter pertaining to the Moralist,
and not to the Ciuilian: and why might not this honor said count Alfonso
Turchi, be the reward of the victor in the listes? considering that to such a
one after victory, great honors were done, he being accompanied out of the
field, with sound of drum and trumpet, and denounced valorous of all men: and
finally, the arms hung up in the church, wherewith he had fought, to the
perpetual glory of such a fact: which arms, after the nature of a statue,
represented the image of the victors valor. Relying on the definition of
perfect honor, said Gual: by us recited, and by the same Posseuino confirmed,
after Aristotle's opinion it cannot be the reward of the victor in the listes;
for he performs no act of beneficence, but to himself, overthrowing his
enemy: but rather in respect of the world, he performs a work of
maleficence, and therefore is worthy of blame: because he offends the life
and honor of his neighbor, and depriueth the common wealth of a champion.

And touching those, which you term honors within the lifts these be no true
houors, in that they neither are, nor can be the rewards of beneficence, as
also it is no perfect honor, to hang up our arms in the church of God: first
because he that is conqueror, not to himself, but to the glory of God hangs
them up: and though he had done it in favor of himself, yet could this be
no honor unto him, in that, though by our selves, we may be made worthy of
honor, yet of our selves, as we have proved, we cannot be honored: for then
it would follow, that for the self same respect, and at the self same time,
one may be both honorer and honored, which is impossible: I having many times
considered, said Count Guido, of hanging up in the Temples the arms of the
Champions in combat, dedicating them to God: I could not but with wonder rest
scandalized with so great an abuse, especially God in his holy law, having
commanded, that menquellers, should be removed from his altar; for what thing
could be more impious, and profane, then to present before God the unjust
sword, all begoared and tainted in humane blood, and which before had destroyed
the image of God, and dispearsed the honor and life of his neighbor. The holy
Ghost ever be praised, who yet in the end has vouchsafed, to breath upon the
souls of christian Princes, and has removed unjust combat, which was the
occasion of so many evils. questionless it was a singular favor, proceeding
from the divine bounty and goodness of God (said Count Hercules) to root out
of the world so great an abuse. But to return to Posseuino. of whom sometimes,
I was wont to be enamoured, I now know, that there can no excuse be found, but
that, his error is to be blamed: seeing it is manifestly proved by the self
same definition, he delivers, of Combat, that the honor contended of in
the listes, is not that honor he defined, and whereof in his book, he has
entreated, which definition he sets down with far greater circumstances,
then you do yours, wherefore of necessity either yours must be defective, or
his superaboundant, he affirming combat to be a voluntary encounter, betwixt
two men, by which the one armed onte^deth to prove upon the other, by his own
proper valor, not therein any way hindered, and in the space of a day, that he
is an honorable man, and not worthy to be contemned, nor iniuried: as also the
other has a determination to prove the contrary. Out of doubt by these last
words in this definition, it cannot be intended by perfect honor, and by
beneficent actio^ acquired, seeing he minds not to prove, that he has
performed any great benefit, that he is worthy of a statue, crown, or some
other such like reward: except peradventure Posseuinos mind was, or that he
supposed, the man unworthy of contempt, to be also worthy of the reward of
beneficence. Notwithstanding Posseuino, answered Gualin: endeuoreth to show,
that this his definition, is most perfect, as in it being nothing superfluous
or improper, and that it might be a perspicuous beginning to the understanding
of all things, that appertain to combat: yet to himself overmuch affected,
he is deceived, for he has praepostered it with words superfluous, defective,
and improper.

Now in all affection, sir Knight I beseech you (said Count Alfonso) be it not
unto you displeasing, to examine this definition by points and parcels, to the
end, we may understand the truth, for I for my part ever judged, that
Posseuino, by this definition had better expressed the nature of combat, then
any other, that hitherto had written. Beginning at the first word (answered
Gua.) encounter or conflict, whereof in this definition, he makes a general
use: it is not a word proper, but translated; for it is drawn from hewing
down trees, overthrowing houses, walls, towers, and such like: and it is a
thing certain (as the Philosopher teaches) that translated or metaphorical
words, as we call them, are not apt to express the essence of things: and
thersore they should never be placed in definitions, especially, when there be
words proper to serve the turn: and although without prejudice to truth, we
should grant, that it were not a word translated, yet could he not deny, that
he, when he might have placed in his definition, a kind more near, has used
one more universal and remote, considering that conflict or encounter, is much
more remote and universal, then is their word battle, seeing every battle
may be said to be a conflict, but yet every conflict may not be a battle:
except Posseuino were of opinion, that to overthrow walls, trees, houses, or
such like things, were to be termed a battle. Houing therefore in this
definition placed the kind remote, for that nearer to the nature of the thing,
it seems he made but small account of his masters precepts in his Logic;
and the error he has committed, is no less, then being to define man, he has
defined him for a creature, and not for a reasonable substance. But for all
this he shows, replied Count Alfonso, with judgment to have set down these
words: saying: from hence we may gather that all both wise and ignorant, do
call such an encounter or conflict if we so please, Combat? Although this be
false (said Gualinguo) as I will show you, yet admit it were true, that
Combat ordinarily were called a conflict, it should not for all this be set
down in the definition of Combat, this being a word translated improper,
and insufficient, to distinguish the nature of Combat: For as authority
coupled with reason, makes great proof, so of reason abandoned, it is
insufficient, neither shall we ever find, that the Philosopher without reason
has prevailed by authority: but this is far from truth, that such a like
battle, is by all men called a conflict: And beginning with excellent Doctor
Paris de puteo, who is the ancientest and of greatest authority, he calls
combat a single battle, and never terms it an encounter or conflict, and
notwithstanding Mutio Iustinopolitano sometimes has named it a conflict, yet
when heassigneth the proper desinitio^ thereof, he says, that combat is a
battle, of body to body, for proof of truth: and Ariosto speaking of
battle hand to hand, calls it not an encounter, or conflict, but single
fight, saying: Fine, or six days, this single fight deferred was.

And that which follows: by this authority, one may understand, that
Posseuino has erred in saying, that both the wise, and ignorant, call combat
a conflict: but rather any one of judgment, having an eye to the latin, which
says, single fight: and to the Greek which terms it Monomachia,
signifying the self same, will define it a battle, and not a conflict. But
to come to that other word voluntary, it is superfluous, improperly placed,
and not necessary, as he affirms, to distinguish a battle made by force
and in this point, he has no better used Aristotle's doctrine, then before in
other places he has done. But how is it superfluous, replied Count Alfonso,
are there not many that fight by constraint? It is superfluous (answered
Gualinguo) because without it, the definition may stand, seeing such a chance
can never happen, that two combatantes within the listes should fight, by
force, in that manner he speaks of; and always when there is a battle, it
is supposed to be voluntary; but further, he has used this word voluntary,
improperly, in having applied it absolutely; for although combat be Voluntary,
yet is it not absolutely volu^tary, but has ever mixed with it some
circumstance, not voluntary. I rest altogether perplexed (said Count Alfonso)
neither can I imagine, how combat should be, either voluntary, or violent. To
manifest this unto you (returned Gualinguo) and withal, to discover the error
of Posseuino, it is necessary, that I give you distinctly to understand, what
actions be absolutely voluntary, and what not voluntary, and which mixed, that
is which have joined with the^ a little force or co^straint: and this I will do
the more willingly, in that all this I am to tell you, will be no small
assistance, to the understanding of virtuous operations: for no action can be
termed virtuous, or vicious, worthy of honor, or deserving blame, demeriting
reward, or punishment, if it be not absolutely voluntary.

I affirm therefore that to be absolutely volumarie, seven conditions are
required, as the Philosopher very well teaches in his Moralles; the first is,
that the beginning be in him that works, and not external or without him: the
second is, that he understand his own action: the third, concerning what, or
for what cause he works: the sift, after what sort: the sixth, to what end,
that is, in favor of whom: the last, that he perform such an action,
voluntarily, and not with grief: whenever therefore, any of these conditions
shall fail, out of doubt the action, cannot absolutely be termed voluntary,
but shall either, not be voluntary, or retain with it, some part or
circumsta^ce of constraint. Help my understanding (said Count Alfonso) with
some example, to the end I may better comprehend these circumstaunces of
absolutely voluntary. And Gua. behold an example, we may commit an error, not
understanding the matter, as he does, that puts away a false crown
esteeming it good: this action may be termed not voluntary, for if he had
known so much, being an honest man, he would not have spent it: and therefore
is worthy of pardon, and not of punishment: In like sort we may err, not
knowing the matter, or concerning what we work, as if one should offend his
Father, esteeming him an enemy, in such manner as unhappy Oedipus did: we may
likewise err by not knowing the instrument wherewith we work, as if one
should strike with a spear, believing it to be without a head, or with a
marble stone, taking it for a pumix: Fifthly we err about the manner how: as if
one thinking to strike softly, should smite hard. Sixthly, we err concerning
the end, and of all other errors it is the greatest, as if a Physician to heal
his patient, should lance an impostume, and by such incision procure him to
die: lastly, that action is not absolutely voluntary, but has somewhat not
voluntary mixed with it: when one works having know lege of all the
circumstances above named, and yet enforced, and with grief, performs such an
action, as it happens to him, who to save his life, casts his goods into the
sea. Now by absolute voluntary, we may conceive that, not voluntary, which is
in two manners: that is, by force or ignorance: by force is that, when the
beginning of the action consists not in the performer, but is extrinsecall
and without him, as if one taking my arm by force, should strike another
therewith: and therefore this action is violent, because the actor consents
not thereunto, neither as agent nor patient: by ignorance is he, that works,
not knowing any of those circumstances by me recited: and this, though always
it be not voluntary, yet is it not ever unwillingly performed, but sometimes it
happens, that they be performed both voluntarily, and not. How can it be, said
count Guydo, that one thing may be, not voluntary, and yet Voluntarily acted.
When after an operation, performed ignorantly, replied Gualin. there insueth
not grief, or repentance, but rather joy and contentment, that is an action
not voluntary, voluntarily performed: as if one should shoot an arrow, where he
thought some wild beast lay hid, and with this should kill his enemy there in
covert, it might be said, that this man unwillingly, had voluntarily slain
him, he after the fact remaining joyful, and well satisfied; but when repentance
follows such operations, in such a case they are not voluntary, and against
will performed. There be other actions, which (as I have said) be termed mixed,
because they have annexed to the^, some respects voluntary, some not volun tarry:
for voluntary they are, as not being performd by force.

For the beginning of the action is in the actor, who is privy to the
circumstances by me rehearsed; but yet have some consideration in them of not
voluntary, insomuch, as they are performed for fear of greater ill, or for
hope of some good, and so unwillingly performed: being such actions as no man
of sound mind would undertake: as if a tyrant having in his power, the father
or children of some one, should command him to perform some infamous fact, with
this condition, that performing it, his father and children should be free, and
on the contrary not acco^plishing it, they should be put to death. The like is
as I said by them, who for fear of shipwreck, cast out their goods: for
simply there is no man, that of his own proper will, casts away his goods:
this granted, we may easily conceive, that this word voluntary, placed by
Posseuino, in his definition of Combat, cannot be intended by absolute
voluntarines, as himself (it seems) understands it: for notwithstanding in
him that fights, the internal beginning of such an action consists, and
that it is not performed by ignorance, yet has it some circumstance of not
voluntary annexed to it: first, because it is done for fear of greater evil,
as would be the loss of honor, which the professor thereof prefers before
his own life: secondly, in that no man of right sense, would choose to put his
life, honor, and soul, to co^promise, as combatants do within the lists. Poss.
has erred, by improperly placing this word voluntarily in his definition;
neither can this alegation excuse him, that he put it in, for difference of
conflict made by force; seeing all conflicts are forcibly attempted after the
same manner I have declared, they being performed for fear of greater evil:
but if he meant to place it as a difference, of violent, and not voluntary;
which is of that when the beginning of operation consists not in the actor, it
would be superfluous, for such an instance can not be imagined in combatants
within the lists: unless Posseu. meant that the wind should face to face blow
the combatants one against an other with their arms, the one by the other to
be bruised. But proceeding further, after he has said, that combat is a
voluntary encounter or conflict, he adds: wherein one intends to prove
upon another, that he is an honorable man, and unworthy to be iniuried or
contemned; as likewise the other minds to prove the contrary.

In this last clause there be two errors; first, that there being two kinds of
quarrelles, for which the assailant, chalengeth combat, he has made mention,
only of one: the second is, that he has improperly placed this word, to
prove, in the person of the defendant, which is proper to the assailant. I
would have thought, said the Count of Scandiano, that quarrelles had not been
only of two sorts, but rather insinite, for which men fight: Although the
quarrelles may be infinite, answered Gualenguo, that procure combat, yet are
they all reduced to two heads, as likewise injury and impeaching another man's
honor, be of two sorts: for injury is either committed in words or deeds: in
injury of deeds, the assailant being ever the party iniuried, he entendeth to
prove upon the defendant, that he is an honorable man, and unworthy to be
contemned: and so consequently, that the defendant, in offending him, has
carried himself, as an unjust and wicked man; the defendant minding to
maintain the contrary. In the injury of words, the Assailant is for the most
part him iniurying, who by the iniuried repelled with a lie, is enforced to
auerre his saying: and therefore he entendeth to aprooue upon the defendant,
that he has failed in justice or valor, and that he deserves not to be in
the number of men honorable, the defendant determining to mantaine the
contrary: Yet Posseuino, in his definition comprehends not the second
manner, which respects the injury of words, but only the first, having
relation to injury in deeds, and therefore in this point is defective. The
using of this word. To prove, in the person of the defendant, was no less
error, said Count Alfonso, because unto the assailant it is so proper, as that
there have been some (whose opinion notwithstanding I do not commend) who
setting down precepts for the forming of bills, have advised the defendantes,
that in answering, they should not use this word, to prove, because by this
means, of defendants, they should make themselves assailantes, and be
prejudiced in the election of arms.

Although after a confused manner, said the count Scandiano, I understand these
terms, Assailant, and Defendant, yet I desire to have of them more full and
ample knowledge, as also wherefore to prove, is proper to the assailant, and
to sustain and maintain to the defendant: These terms (answered Gualinguo)
are taken out of the civil law, wherein he that demands and moves strife,
is named the Assailant, and the challenged Defendant: So that in Combat the
challenger is called, Assailant, and he challenged Defendant: And as by the
Civil law, it concerns him Plaintiff, to prove by testimony or writings
wherefore he pretends to usurp the Defendaunts goods: So in Combat it
belongs to the Assailant, to prove wherefore he usurps the Defendants
honor: And therefore it is necessary that the first provocation proceed from
the Assailant, in assaulting the Defendant, to which Defendant as a Castle, it
suffices to sustain the assault: wherefore as well in combat, as in civil
law, the state of the Defendant, is better than of the Assailant: in that the
Assailant not subduing, loses, and the Defendant not loosing, overcomes. It
seems further, said Count Guido, that Posseuino thought it necessary to
insert this word Arms, in the definition of combat, saying: that the one will
prove by Arms, and as follows: whereof I am doubtful, especially by the
Lombards law, who were the authors of combat, seeing they allow not, that the
Combatants should use other arms in Combat, than staves, and if arms were
granted, this was only in quarrels that imported some offense against the
majesty of the Prince. And Gualinguo: If Posseuino by arms intendes only
those which are made of iron, or steel, which cut, prick, and kill, out of
doubt, it is superfluous, seeing without such arms quarrels may be ended, and
an enemy vanquished, within the lists. It see meth, said Count Hercules
Beuelacqua that he expresses himself, because he says, he put in arms in
that definition, for the difference betwixt them, and proof of testimony, and
other means, as with fistes, buffetting, and other such like offenses, which
are not properly termed combat: In my opinion also that other circumstance is
not necessary, but rather superfluous (in the space of one day) saying, that
the assailant in the space of a day minds to prove, that he is a man of
honor. Wherefore is that superfluous, said Count Alfonso; would you that there
should be no end of the defendants fighting? And Gualinguo: Questionless, it
is superfluous, for though they should fight out the battle, till one were
slain, (which sometimes, by consent of the defendant, they do) yet could it
not therefore be said, that such a battle were not combat. Posseuino, said
Turcho, in the beginning of his fifth and last book of Honor, moves a
question, which has, and will ever be ready to procure disputation amongst
the curious, and that is, whether the treaty of combat, appertains to
military discipline, to political customs, or to the wisdom of the laws:
and finally it seems, that with most effectual reasons he concludes, that
the treaty thereof properly appertains to politic customs, and morrall
philosophy, being altogether alienate from professors of the law, and
soldiers: and our country man Pigna, was of the same opinion, as he affirms
in his book entitled of honor, and men heroical. Touching this also I would
willingly understand your mind, that relying on Posseuino and Pigna I continue
not still deceived, as I was wont. In very deed, said Gualinguo, you should be
deceived, if you entered into any such opinion, for politic customs neither,
can, nor ought in any sort, to entreat of combat, combat being a thing
unjust, and contrary to their foundations. Posseuino, replied Turcho, does yet
by lively reasons show, that combat has relation to politic customs, as
that which entreats of injuries, and determines honor, which is the end of
Combat; for combat is ordained to no other end, but to repel injuries, and
recover honor: and more, by politic customs, we conceive, who is honorable,
and who not, as who is iniuried, and who not: and not by the policy of laws,
and magistrates, which discuss not of virtue, vices, honor, or felicity: but
supposing all these things, with good laws, and fear of punishment, enforce
malicious, and ignorant men, to live according to virtue. By that I have
otherwise said, answered Gualin. in the discourse of honor, as also by that I
am to declare unto you, it will be an easy matter to conceive the
sophistications of Posseuino, who defirous to entreat of combat, with morral
foundations, and according to Aristotle, is fallen into a sea of errors, and
manifest contradictions, giving to understand, without other addition, that
combat is no point of moral discipline, as it is only moral: for the moral
Philosopher having felicity for his scope, as he which entendes no other
course, but to show the means whereby a man may become happy, cannot dispose
of these things which are contrary to felicity, except by the same means he
considers of vice, that is, as of a thing worthy to be discommended, and by
them altogether to be avoided which desire humane felicity: neither
prevails it to say, that moral philosophy defines that honor, whereupon
combat is grounded, for I have proved unto you, that the Moralist considers
nothing at all, nor never defines this honor whereupon combat is grounded,
but only that, which by beneficent action is acquired: fot this by way of
combat can neither be acquired, or preserved, as he foolishly affirms, as
also it were to small purpose to say, that by Ethics we know, who is
honorable, and who not: for although this be true, yet is it not to be
understood by that honor, whereof every one makes profession; but by that,
which to a few is participated, being the reward of excellent action, and a
principal circumsta^ce of felicity: for he that understands such an action,
understands likewise who is worthy: and touching that he adds, how the
Moralist entreats of injury; for repelling whereof combat is introduced. I
say, the consequence is nothing worth: for the Moralist discourses of injuries
for instruction, how to know the just from the unjust, and not that such
injuries, are by combat to be repelled, seeing injustice and injury is to be
returned with justice, as the laws command, and not by unjust means, as is
combat. But before you numbered the supportation of injury amongst vices, said
Count Guydo, and not revenging the same with proper valor. The Perepatetike
(answered Gualinguo) does not spoil a man of affections, like the Stoicke, for
man being partaker of the sensitive faculty, can not be insensible: but
would, that with reason moderating them, he might reduce them to the state of
mediocritie: it is therefore necessary, that a man in the same instant he is
offended, should be angry, and therefore at the same time it shall be lawful
for him to make that revenge he can, and which honesty permits: which not
doing, he runs into the vice of stupiditie, or pusillanimitie (if we may
use such words:) And if he could not, replied Turchi at the same instant
return due revenge, either through inequality of party, or some other
impediment, to repel the injury, and not seem sottish, shall it not be
lawful for him, to have recourse to combat, and to attempt the recovery of
honor, by his proper valor. It is not requisite for him, answered Gualinguo, to
have recourse to combat: for as I told you, he must not repel injury, with a
mean unjust, but just, according as the laws command: Wherefore occasion
once past, it is not convenient, that in cold blood, as we usually say, he
perform any other matter with his proper valor: for in such a case, the
condition of the iniurier is far worse, than of him iniuried. How may it be
said count Guido, that the offerer of injury, should be of worse condition in
honor, than he that receives it: I of my self following common opinion,
should have believed the contrary: considering the iniurier usurps the honor
of him iniuried, and necessarily urges him to recovery of the same. The
condition of the iniuried is less wicked, said Gual: because, to receive
injury, shows no more but impotencie, and is without vice: but to offer it,
is a thing vicious, and blameworthy, considering he fails in justice, and
therefore loses his honor. In like manner, the receiver of injury loses his
honor, said Calcagnino) by failing in valor, and she wing himself worthy of
contempt. To receive injury, is not to fail in valor (answered Gualinguo) but
so to receive it, as thereof to make no just revenge. And what understand you
by just revenge, replied Calcagnino? And Gualinguo: the revenge shall be just,
when at the same^ instant he is offended, he shall attempt to repel the
injury with his proper valor: and it is just, for he does that, which by
natural and civil law, is permitted unto him, which make it lawful, to
repel force, with force: and when through inequality of party, or other
impediment, he cannot perform this, he is bound after the fact, to have
recourse to the magistrate, and by them to seek revenge, rather then by
combat, to the end that Magistrates, and laws, see me not in Cities to be
created in vain. He that in such a case should run to the Magistrate (said
count Hercules) would give notice of small valor, and show himself worthy of
contempt, and consequently, to be but slenderly honored. No man remains
dishonored (said Gualenguo) but he which offends against justice, or
fortitude, as we have said: therefore he which in receiving injury, has
committed no vile fact, loses not his honor, although afterward, he seek
revenge at the hand of the Magistrate: neither for this, does he fail in
valor, but he should fail in justice, if contemning the laws, and
Magistrates, he assayed revenge of himself, and should attempt against the
laws. I beseech you tell me unfeignedly, he that goes about to recover his
goods, and seeks revenge of the thief, fails he in valor, having recourse
to the Magistrates? I know you will say he does not, because the laws so
command: and wherefore then would you have him to fail, which assayeth to
recover his honor, and seeks revenge from the Magistrate, seeing the laws so
command, and that they punish them severely, who attempt by any other means,
as contemners of the Magistrates, and laws, which chastise with no less
penalty impeachers of another man's honor, then the offense that thieves commit.
Me thinks sir Knight, said the count of Scandiano, you are contrary to your
self; for yesterday you said, that a man of honor, ought by all means to
repel injury, not to seem worthy of contempt. and that he ought not only to
enter into combat, but further was bound to maintain au unjust quarrel, for the
concealing of his defect, seeing honor is not lost before offenses be revealed:
and now you would have him seek recovery of his honor, and revenge not by his
own proper valor, but from the hands of the magistrate: and there is no doubt,
but relying on the worlds judgment, he that attempted to recover honor, by
this means should be noted for vile and cowardlike. There is no contradicto^
in my words (answered Gualinguo) if in sinister sense they be not interpreted.
I then said, and now affirm, that a man of honor ought by all means to
endeavor to maintain possession thereof: but above all, by just means, as these
be I have here set down unto you: and if they were not sufficient, through some
evil custom, and that he were in danger to lose his honor, he ought not
refuse then to fight, notwithstanding the quarrel were unjust, and enter into
the lists, if co^bat were in use: and this is one of the principallest
imperfectio^s, that this honor has, by me rightly termed, imperfect; wherefore
whosoever thereof makes profession, he ought by right and wrong to procure the
preservation of it; as was yesterday sufficiently showed: only Iwil say, that
the moral philsopher determines not of this honor, he being of himself, and
alone, as a thing imperfect, hardly capable of humane felicity, and
consequently less ought to censure, or entreat of unjust combat, seeing
upon this, honor is altogether gorunded, and has his foundation.

You (replied the Count Scandiano) ever term Combat unjust, yet have you
made no demonstration of the injustice thereof; and notwithstanding, this I
have seen, some places cited out of Aristotle by those that are learned, out
of which they gather, that combat is just, and ought to be permitted:
especially in the first of his Rhethoricke, where he admits revenge, which
not being granted, says he, diverse inconveniences would ensue: and in the
fifth of his Moralles he says, that Citizens must endeavor to repel offense,
in that to suffer injury is a kind of servitude: And Homer whose poem by
opinion of the divine Philosopher, is the seeing glass of humane life, and
author of combat, makes Paris and Menelaus to fight hand to hand at defiance,
as also Hector and Ajax, the which by Virgil and Ariosto has bin observed:
neither wants there of the grauest authors, who writing, labor to make it
just, and worthy to be admitted, as a thing profitable to preservation, and
recovery of honor, and to live well in a City amongst whom is Doctor Paris
de puteo, and Posseuino, neither are their arguments to be despised, and for
my part, I esteem them preualent.

If by others, and especially by most learned Susiue, said Gualinguo, it were
not proved against Doctor Paris de puteo and Posseuino, that Combat is a
thing most unjust, I would labor to make you conceive the injustice thereof,
but this man having philosophically and learnedly entreated thereof in a book
of his own, entitled of the injustice of Combat, referring you over to that,
I will speak no further of it. Although excellent Susius, said Beuelaqua,
has plentifully spoken thereof, as you say, yet will it be acceptable to
understand also something from you in this point, seeing at this inslant we
have not Susius book about us. That you may not account me, luskish and
ssothfull, said Gua. behold I desire to gine you satisfaction. Combat, is
repugnant to nature, and contrary to laws divine, and civil: To Nature it
repugneth, because she entendeth generation and preservation; Combat to kill
and destroy: it is contrary to laws divine, and civil, because, neither by
the one, or other law it is permitted, that a particular man should dispose,
either of his own, or of another man's life: considering that the law respects
a particular man, not as of himself, but as belonging to the country and
Prince, under whose dominion he is subject. Secondly it is unjust, because it
contendeth to prove the virtue of the mind, with force and dexterity of
body; which mean is by it self insufficient, for if with force of body the
virtue of the mind, were necessarily conjoined, a country man or porter, or
some other more base, might easily be more honorable and virtuous then one
noble. Thirdly, in combat the knowledge of truth and equity, is referred to
the arbitrament of fortune, a Judge most uncertain, and to the sword, deprived
of reason: therefore it is unjust: neither avails it any thing to say, that
in combat God favors the just; for if that were true, he should never
overcome that had wrong on his side, and yet we see by experience, that the
lier by being more strong and fortunate, has overcome him with truth on his
side: so that to ordain combat, is rather a tempting of God, then by such a
means to draw from God just judgment. Finally, it was never by any common
wealth accepted, or approved of, neither by any ancient State, that for cause
of honor, or wants of proof in investigation of truth, they should have
recourse to combat; nor Aristotle, Plato, or any other philosopher, or
Lawgiver, did ever approve or so much as know this monstrous manner of
conflict: and although Aristotle affirm, in the places by you cited, that
revenge ought to be made, and that supportation of injury, is a kind of
servitude, yet he means not this should be performed by an unjust mean, but
by a mean just, and as the laws command: for as it is not lawful to recover
goods from the these by proper force, so ought it not to be lawful by the same
means to recover honor: and no less in the one the^ other case, we ought to
have recourse to the magistrate. Of the same opnion was Plato, for he decreed
in the eleventh of his laws, that the iniuried by words, should not offend
the iniurier, but rather with modesty excuse himself, of the vice objected
unto him: and in Crito: that we should not injury others, though by them we had
bin offended, for upon what occasion foeuer we offend another, it is always
evil done. In Gorgia he shows how we should serve our turns with
rhetorical Art, to accuse malefactors, that they might be chastised. Out of
which positions, this conclusion may be drawn, that the iniuried is not by
himself to work revenge, seeing that would ever be but evil done, but to
accuse the iniurier to the magistrate, who stands to preserve universal good:
What will you answer, replied count Scand. to Paris de Puteo, who proves the
justice of combat, from the universal justice of war, by God permitted, as
we read in so many places of the scripture by him cited: as also the reasons
of Posseuino, who affirms, that Combat is lawful, seeing by that means a
man may recover the most precious of al other goods, which is honor. Paris de
Puteo, answered Gualinguo, was a good doctor, in his profession, of the Law,
although he were somewhat harsh in expressing his conceits, and was the first
that advanced this argument of Combat, giving precepts thereof: not
withstanding, enclining to evil custom, he labored to show, that combat
had in it some point of justice: but he reasoning from universal war, to
this particular battle, which we call Combat, cannot formally conclude:
seeing this, not only is not comprehended under that general kind, but is
further from it, altogether diverse: And therefore we must observe, that
general war is lawful, for no other respect, but because men are not placed
under the government of one Prince alone, neither are all states governed by
the self same laws; for if it were otherwise, it should not be lawful for
one people, to war against another: neither for augmentation of state or any
other occasion, considering that by the highest Prince, Law, and Justice, every
difference would be determined, and if any people or citrie should attempt to
right themselves by arms, as contemners of the Laws, and rebels to the Prince,
they should be incontinently punished; but for that the dominion of the earth
is divided into diverse principallities, they having no superiors, make Mars
Judge of their controversies, and put over their right to Arms: War is
therefore lawful, for want of a public revenger of injuries, and therefore God
commanded his chosen people, that they should take up arms, for their
defense, and slay their enemies, minding they should be ministers of divine
justice. But this battle performed between two particular men, shall never be
lawful, which we do call Combat. Seeing particular men, have a Prince, law,
and magistrates, whom it concerns to revenge injuries, and determine
controversies, which may fall out betwixt particular men. And if Posseuino had
said, that Combat is an unlawful and unjust mean to recover honor, he had
well spoken: For combat offends the magistrate, and contemnes the laws:
they entering into combat carrying this mind, to revenge injury with their
proper hand, and by a wicked and insufficient mean to attempt, the finding
out, and proof of truth, not considering that the laws and magistrates, take
order for men injurious and liars. And yet combat as a thing lawful, said
Count Alfonso, has been granted even by the hie priest himself, as we read
of Pope Martine, who permitted that two brothers, who had brought into the field
two armies face to face, should between them two perform the combat,
committing unto the hand, sword, and most uncertain lotte, the title of that
principallitie, whereof betwixt them selves they contended. And further, they
which make Combat lawful, are of opinion, that it may be granted, when by
other mean we can not attain to knowledge of truth, as if combat were lawful
in the same nature, as are those kinds of torments, wherewith the Criminalists
serve their turn, to make malefactors confess.

Combat was justly permitted by Pope Martine, between those brethren, said
Gualinguo, as also that in Spain. between two coosins allowed by Scipio, who
contended about principallities: and no less just were the conflicts of the
Horatij and Curiatij, and it may ever be lawful to put two men's lives in
danger, for preservation of a thousand others: But it can neither be a thing
honest nor just, to search out truth, by way of combat; for it is a most
fallacious proof, in that the liar, may vanquish as well as the other with
truth on his side. What is to be done then, said Count Guido, when we cannot
attain to knowledge of truth? That which the laws command, answered
Gualinguo, which is, the Defendant to be free, when the Plaintiff cannot
prove, either by witness, writings, or some other faithful testimonial; and
these failing, other proof is no way requifite, or upon this to undertake
Combat. Put we the case, replied Calcagnino, that one call an other traitor,
or object unto him, that he has committed some one of those malefacts, that
deprive of honor, and the other denies it with a lie, what ought the iniurier
in this case to do? He is bound, answered Gualinguo, to auerre his saying, as
before you have understood, and not so doing, he remains infamous, as a liar,
unjust, and an impeacher of another man's honor: and the Defendant stands still
in his first degree of honor: neither need he upon this to enter the listes:
and if he answered (added Calcagnino) to the lie, with a box on the care, or
any other blow, would not this be sufficient proof of his saying: He should
not only (said Gualinguo) not prove it, but auouching it by no other
testimonial, should remain tainted with double infamy: For besides being a
false slaunderer, he should be an iniurier by deeds, and before I showed you,
that they which injury others, fail in justice, and are infamous. They
notwithstanding that entreat of Combat, said Count Hercules, have set it
down for a certain rule, that injury in words is taken away by the injury of
deed, and that a lie is satisfied with a box on the ear, or any blow with what
thing else soever, they alleging this proposition for a maime, unto which no
answer can be made, that one injury, by another greater than that is clean
taken away, and that the injury of deeds is greater then that of words: and
this in such a sort is observed for custom, that it is impossible, or at the
least very difficult, to introduce any other law, amiddest these terms of
honor. It is no marvel, answered Gualingno, if those that entreat of combat,
cannot speak with any foundation of reason: for necessarily from a matter
unjust, many points unjust, and unreasonable must needs proceed: wherefore
these men desirous to manage points of honor with combat, and evil custom,
have supplanted the laws of honor, and multiplied abuses. I say therefore,
that this supposition, that the injury of deeds is greater than that of
words, is not only, not always true, but further for the most part false,
seeing one may be more diffamed by burdensome and opprobrious words, than by
the injury of deeds. As for example: he shall remain more dishonored that
swalloweth up the term of Traitor, murderer, or any such like brutish speech,
without making revenge, then shall another that takes the Bastanado, a box on
the ear, a blow, or any such like injury of deed: for not to attempt revenge
of a blow or bastanado, notes small valor, and impotencie, but yet is without
vice: but closely to digest the name of a traitor or murderer, carries with
it, not only note of vility, but supposes the vice in him iniuried, objected
unto him by the iniurier, and therefore such an one shall be much more infamous.
It may be proved also by this other reason, that contumelious words are apter
to impeach an other man's honor, then deeds. For as they affirm, who entreat
of combat, there is not so grievous an injury indeed, which with words may
not be lenified: which could not be, if words were not much more effectual,
as well in ablation, as restitution of honor. It should seem to be a common
opinion, said Count Scandiano, that the injury of deeds cannot be removed by
words: as also it carries some reason: for can words take away a bastanado
or blow, and how should they effect, that the scarres remain nor in the
receuers visage, to his perpetual dishonor? Wherefore there be some, who in
making peace persuade the iniuriers by deed, that they make no account to
utter some submissiue or dastard like speech, for conclusion of peace, and
satisfying of him iniuried: they alleging, that feathers and words, are
carried away with the wind, but deeds continue everlastingly. Such like men
little understand the law of honor, answered like men little understand the
law of honor (answered Gualenguo) seeing there is not so greiuous an injury of
deed, which by words may not be mittigated, the which words, though they
cannot take away scarres in the body or face, yet are they of force to wipe out
the spot of infamy, and to return it upon the iniurier, as for example: if
the iniurying in deeds, shall allege unto the imuried: I confess I have
committed an unjust act, in strikeing you, seeing you are not a person worthy
of contempt, and I humbly require pardon of you, with other such like words:
who sees not that the iniuried (in respect of honor) by such words, remains
in far better condition then the iniurier.

And what think you of that other conclusion (said Turcho) that one injury
is taken away by another greater then that? This other conclusion (answered
Gualinguo) has been an occasion to multiply insolences in men, making them
prove rather infamous then honorable. Wherefore I say unto you, that injury
in words, is properly by words removed, and improperly by deeds: and in like
manner, he which iniurieth by words, properly takes it away by words and
witness, and improperly by deeds: as if one should call me traitor, with the
lie I properly take away the injury, but if without the lie, I strike or wound
him, I improperly return the injury: for by this means I deny not that I am
a traitor, neither urge him to prove his saying, although after a certain
manner, I manifest him a man worthy of contempt: and therefore he may leave the
first, and betake himself to the second quarrel as just, by saying: I will
prove upon thee that I am not a man of contempt, and that thou have unjustly
done to strike me, in which quarrel ouercoming, the other shall be also
convinced of treason: in like manner he improperly, and foolishly retourneth
the lie, with a box on the ear, the which, or any other blow, though in a
certain sort, it notes him stricken, worthy of contempt, yet does it not
prove or verify the saying of him, who has iniuried by words: in that a box
on the ear, or a blow, is not sufficient proof to show that one is a
traitor: but rather it plainly testifies, that the committer of such an
act, is a most unjust man, a great iniurier, and wounder of another man's
honor: so that they which set down these conclusions, have spoken, not
altogether sincerely, following rather, as I have said, wicked custom, than
direct reason, and have been, as also now are, the occasions of great
inconveniences: for if it were not in use, to return the lie with a blow,
there would be but few iniuriers by words, it being hard to find words enough,
to auerre words injurious, and not proouing them, he should continue infamous.

You sir Knight, said Beuelacqua, have with sufficient sincerity declared,
that Combat is an Unjust thing, contrary to humane felicity: as also, that it
is not grounded upon true, but imperfect honor: and that the Philsopher in
politic customs, cannot entreat thereof, but as of a vice, to the end, that
by the virtuous man, it may be abhorred. It rests that you here declare, whom
the treaty here of did concern, if it were in use: and this will serve
greatly to purpose, seeing in doubtful cases of honor, we shall know whither
to have recourse for counsel. Without doubt (answered Gualinguo,) and (be it
spoken with leave of your countrieman Pigna and Posseuino) the argument of
Combat is proper to the Ciuilian, and not to the moral Philosopher, as he is
a Moralist: and this I will manifest unto you, by infallible arguments: And
first, the Cruilian intendes that honor, whereof every one makes profession,
upon which Combat is grounded: For the laws punish detractors from other
men's honors: and in like manner, declare who are infamous, chasticing many
offenses with the punishment of infamy: Secondarily, combat is either by law
(as it appears by the law of Lombardy) or else by custom: the Ciuilian is he
which intends laws and customs, and rules and ordains them: Thirdly, the
terms which in combat are used and expressed, are proper to the Ciuilian, and
by him are defined, and considered, as assailant, defendant, quarrel, bills of
challenge, to provoke, maintain, and such like, therefore combat is proper to
the Ciuilian: Fourthly, the bill and quarrel which by mean of Combare direct
to the tribunal of arms, has the self same proportion, and like rules, as
has the Book and action, which direct to the seat of Justice: the Ciuilian
therefore being he that censureth the Book and action in place of judgment,
it is as convenient that he scame the bil, and order the quarrel by combat, in
it expressed: Fifthly, the Ciuilian determines all manner of injuries, as well
by deed as word, having respect to the condition of the persons, place, and
time; for repelling of which injuries, Combat is introduced, therefore Combat
is a subject appropriate unto the Ciuilian: Sixthly, the Ciuilian is he that
pronounces and decideth, whether the quarrel deserves to be put to trial of
arms; for when we may understand by other mean, who is honorable, and who
dishonorable, it is not lawful to come to combat: Last of all, the Ciuilians
be they, that entreat and ordain, touching all sorts of torments used for
inuestigation of truth; combat therefore being (as the same writers thereof
affirm) a kind of torment to find out the truth, when by other mean it cannot
be known, it will follow, that to entreat and order well combat, belongs to
the Ciuilian.

Though so many and firm reasons were not sufficient to persuade, yet common
use and experience might serve the turn; seeing ordinarily in occasions of
combat, the Combatants were wont to be advised by Doctors of the law, as
appears by the sundry opinions of most excellent Ciuilians, which are yet in
Print; besides those good Authors that have entreated of combat, were
Ciuilians, as doctor Paris de Puteo, and Mutius, who always used iuridicall
terms, propositions, and suppositions, agreeable to the proper argument and
matter by them handled; so that Posseuino and Pigna needed not have said, that
the Lawyers usurped to themselves this matter of Combat, belonging properly to
Polliticke customs; for, besides that we have convinced them, they themselves
entreating of it morally, have run into inexcusable errors, and infallibly
proved, that the argument of combat, concerns not the Moralist, but the
Ciuillian. Me thinks said Count Scandiano, that this treatise more befitteth
a Soldier then a Roabed man, seeing unto him books be proper, and the
management of arms to the Soldier; first because combat is borne between the
sound of trumpet and drum: secondly in that the soldier determining of
general war, and discipline military, he may the better likewise, dilate of
war single, and particular, for so is combat: considering that under the
universal the particular is comprehended. Soldiers according to their
principles can not discourse of combat, answered Gualinguo, because the
precepts, wherewith war general is rused, are wholly contrary to combat.
Art military, in general war, ordains all advantage, approoueth all odds
and inequitie, as well in the number of men, as of arms, and places vantagious
for battle: and commends him that can subdue, by all manner of stratageme,
policy, and deceit; whereas in single fight, we detest all advantage and
subtlety, and seek equality, to the end, victory may only depend on proper
valor; but further, combat not only does not advance, but iniurieth also
profession military, and therefore by it ought not only, not to be directed,
but further wholly excluded: for combat causes seditions, makes soldiers
insolent, and disobedient to the magistrates of the field, which by the same
military art, were ordained for to determine all differences and brawles,
which fall out among soldiers: to the end, that peace maintained betwixt
friends, they might with greater valor make war Upon the enemy; and
therefore the Romans did not only punish those, which durst fight singly
amongst themselves, but the^ also, who without consent of the magistrate
performed combat with the enemy, as we read of Manlius Torquatus, who caused
his victorious form to be stricken with a cimeter, having performed combat
with an enemy, without license from the magistrate. But leaving examples, and
coming to common practice and use, let us see whether the probleames and
conclusions, which by combat are determined, have any similitude with the
other of profession military, and general war.

In combat it is determined betwixt the assailant and defendant, of injuries
and oppression, as well in words, as deeds: of the lie, of the form of bills,
of the manner of sending these bills, of challenge, of laying out the field,
according to form of patent: and further, many other questions are discussed,
as, whether the quarrel deserve to be referred to proof of arms, if after the
defiance upon any sudden occasion we may refuse to come to battle, whether a
man half subdued, and by a lie having the better of the field, may demand a
new day: who ought to be admitted to combat, and who not, of the election of
Arms, whether one may fight by his champion, of the difference of nobility,
as well in private men, as in great states and princes, with other such like
points. In general war, it is principally discussed, how to set an army in
order to fight, the manner of arming it for obtaining of victory, in what order
they are to move forward, and march with the army, and how, and in what
situation they are to take up their lodging, and after what manner to fortify
and entrench, to prepare and conuoy victual, to raise fortifications, of the
manner how to defend and assail, of stratagems, or as we may say, of military
deceits, with other like points, the which are altogether diverse from those
which in Combat are decided; and therefore we must conclude, that soldiers,
as being soldiers, may well manage arms and perform combat, but not
dispose of it, according to principles of military profession. Fortitude being
the principal virtue of soldiers, said Beuelacqua, and in combat as well the
fortitude of the body as mind being exercised, I would also have thought,
that it had properly appertained to soldiers to define of combat, especially,
having seen in Print, diverse opinions touching the same, of famous and
worthy Captains, who are reputed amongst the chiefest and best: and further,
I saw in France while I was reside^t in the court, that upon question and
difference of honor, Gentlemen rather repaired to soldiers then Doctors,
accepting of their opinions, as they had been oracles. That fortitude
practiced in Combat (answered Gualinguo) is not the same which is the propper
virtue of Art Military: because that with virtue, and this being far
remote from justice, is accompanied with vice: and therefore we may truly
say, that in combat we rather practice force and dexterity of body, then
that fortitude, which is a virtue of the mind. Touching your having seen
Captains write, discourse, and entreat of points of honor and combat,
yielding therein their judgments, this concludes not that it is a proper
office belonging to that Art; for they do this by a certain practice and
natural judgment, or peradventure, as men not only in war, but also in
other disciplines experienced. By those reasons therefore we have alleged,
and others which to them we mind to add, the error of Posseuino shall be
clear unto you, who vainly excludes Lawyers from the subject of combat: and
you shall observe, that by Lawyers or Ciuilians, I understand not law giuers:
for they being most wise, and creating laws, as inspired by a divine spirit,
cannot make any one law, which shall not be most just and godly: and
therefore these ought, not only, not to discuss of Combat, but even wholly to
exclude it, as Unjust: But by Lawyers, I mean, those that interpret, counsel,
and judge according to the laws, unto whom the treaty thereof out of doubt
apperrameth, as also to dispose of Combat, if it were in use: and likewise to
counsel in points belonging to that honor, whereupon Combat is grounded.

And this shall be the better known unto us, if we do but consider the terms,
questions, and rules, which about Combat are freque^ted: For we shall find the^
either the self same, or altogether like them, which the lawyers have every day
in hand. And as for the persons that enter into combat, who can deny that the
terms of assailant and defendant (as we have said) be not properly belonging
to Lawiers? and that the Lawier does not declare, who is the assailant, and who
the defendant, as also what is the office of the assailant, and what belongs
to the defendant. And coming to the bills; who will deny, that they carrying,
with them the similitude of those books that advocates carry in their hands,
belong not to Lawiers to be prescribed and framed, they differing in no other
respect, but that in the bil, honor is demanded, and in the book, goods, and
many times also honor: and that the bill cites the defendant, to the
tribunal of arms, and the book to the tribunal of the laws and magistrate?
then passing over to laying out of the field, what is this laying out of the
field, but the electing of some spacious place, where the strife is to be
determined, about which if any question arise, who is to decide it but the
Lawier? who likewise is alwais he, that gives sentence, whether the Judge be
competent or no. In Combat injuries are debated, which be opprobrious, and
which not: And who can better distinguish of this then the Lawier, who has
justice for his proper object, and whose property it is to consider all kinds
of justice, and injustice, and consequently of injuries, which be the
principal, part of injustice? Neither Posseuino nor Pigna would deny me, if
they were living, that it concerned the magistrate, to distribute punishment
toward those that are injurious: and if this be true, how could he make just
distribution if he knew not, and did not distinguish all kinds of injury. In
combat the lie is discussed, and question moved, which is a preualent lie,
and which none: and this appertains to the lawier; for the magistrate
punishes lying, and especially that which to another man's loss and reproach,
is told, and therefore it is necessary he understand which is preualent, and
which not, for the preualent lie is given as stirred up by an injury, and
therefore is exempted from punishment, if he to whom it is given, prove not
his objection true: and the insufficent lie is that which is not given upon
receipt of an injury, and because in this case it sauoureth of injury, as
accusing his adversary of slander, it ought therefore to be punished.

In combat the first of any other thing, it is debated, whether the quarrel
deserve to be put to trial of arms; and this is proper to the Ciuilian: first,
because the determination of such questions is contained in the Lombard law:
secondly, for that the Lawyer is he that judges, whether the civil trial of
the cause made, were sufficient or no: for if it were sufficient proof of
arms cease: in combat, the disparitie and inequality of the combatants is
called into question, and who may be admitted, who refused: and this is also a
discussion belonging to the Lawyer: For he being conversant, not only about
justice commutatiue, but also concerning that distributive, being no other but
to distribute punishment, and rewards, with geometrical proportion, of
necessity he must needs know those offenses that make an other worthy of
chasticement and infamy: as likewise the actions, that are meritorious of
reward and honor; and consequently, that he determine who ought to be refused
as infamous, and who as honorable to be admitted to the trial of arms: in
combat also is debated the distinctions of Nobility, as well of private men
as of Princes: and this also belongs to the Ciuilian, who respects the
degrees and qualities of persons, to distribute justly and with proportion,
reward, and punishment. Those rules also, which in combat are observed, are
proper to the Ciuilians, being the selfsame that are observed in civil
judgments. In combat this is observed: that after the challenge is accepted,
it is not lawful for the combatants to offend one another, but in the
determined day of battle: this precept is like to that which says, during the
suit let there be no innovation of any thing, and whosoever disturbeth the
possessor, the suit still hanging, is intended to be fallen from all his right
and title: in combat is this other point: that he which appears not in the
field on the day prefixed for battle, is intended to have lost his whole
interest: and this also is decided by the Ciuilians, who say that allawes
exclame against the man stubburne and contumacious.

This other rule is also auerred, that the day and time of battle expired,
and the assailant not proouing, the defendant is intended to be victor, this
being likewise a maxim with the Ciuilians, the law affirming, that the
assailant not proving, in the prefixed and instant time, the defendant is
absolved. To conclude, there is not any thing in combat, which does not
resemble those points handled in the laws. Proceed no further, said Count
Alfonso Turchi, because now we are sufficiently satisfied, that in doubts, I
will not say, appertaining to Combat (seeing God be thanked) it is no more in
use, but pertaining to the honor, whereof every one makes profession, we
must have recourse to the Ciuilian, and not to the Moralist, the honor whereof
he entreats, being from this very diverse. Notwithstanding the use of
combat be taken away, said Count Guido) yet are neither brawles, nor
tumultes removed, which every day be stirred up, with great effusion of
blood: the which, in that by combat they can not be defined, there is an
other invention diabolical enough found out, which is not Combat, and that is
the field, whither Gentlemen of honor oftentimes run to decide their quarrels
with arms: And this manner of fighting is now in such use, as I am doubtful,
whether a man of honor offered the field, may refuse without presumption of
cowardice. As in Civil judgments (said Gualinguo) the defendant is not bound
to answer the plaintiff, except there be compotent court and Judge assigned
him, so that defendant, who to the Tribunal of Arms is cited, need not there
appear, without a secure field and Judge: and refusing, he ought not only,
not to be held as a Coward, but further, a man of honor: For it is proper to
the eues, murderers, and ruffians to fight in wooddes and solitary places, and
for Gentlemen of honor, to perform battle, in the presence of Princes, and
many knights, to whose judgment the Combatants refer themselves. And from
those Lords in the field, they receive (as from competent Judges, the patent
of their victory, and in what manner they have subdued. Necessity makes many
things lawful which are unlawful, (added Calcagnini) and there is no doubt,
but if combat were in use, the field might lawfully be refused: but not being
able by other means then this to end quarrels, it seems the iniuried, which
is Assailant, has in a certain sort discharged his honor, when he has urged
the field of his defendant, and the defendant not accepting of it, he
incurreth suspicion of timidity and slender valor: and touching the
circumstance of a secure judge and field: what better judge, or truer
testimonial of victory can there be, then the sword? For to return from
Battle with the sword bloody, and unwounded, notes that Combatant
victorious: and on the contrary, to remain dead, or grievously wounded, is a
sign of vanquishment: Moreover, combatants go not into the field alone by
themselves, but for security, each one carries with him a confident friend,
of unspotted fidelity, or some Gentleman of honor, who after performance,
gives testimony of the valor and victory of the Combatants.

The sword (replied Gualingno) cannot be a sincere testimony, nor a just judge,
for we see, that he mortally wounded, has first before his death taken
prisoner his enemy, and the Confidents, by being each of them partial to their
Champion, are not faithful testimonies of valor and victory: and we see by
experience, that seldom times they carry in mind the circumslances of the
conflict, in recounting the fact: upon which afterward questions have risen,
and fresh quarrels, both betwixt them, as also between the Champions: So that
in any wise the field is to be avoided, being contrary to all law, and ancient
custom of Knighthood, apt rather to frame new, then to take up old quarrels.
What must we then do, said Beuelacqua) is it necessary we continue always in
Bralles, finding no mean to determine them? Not so (answered Gualinguo) but
they must be decided, as divine and humane laws command, that is, peaceably,
and so, as honor by them may be restored, who have usurped it. As this is a
most singular and religious mean, so comprehends it very great difficulty,
said Scandiano; for in peace nothing else being sought after, then to reduce
the parties to equality, or that such a peace should be effected, as that the
iniuried, and the iniurying, might remain equally possessed of honor: be it
not therefore troublesome unto you Sir knight, discoursing yet somewhat
further, to deliver also in this point your judgment and opinion.

Of the mean how to make peace, and take up quarrels.
IN that he iniurying (answered Gualin.) as before I have said, cannot in honor
be equal to the iniuried, no more can he not in reconciliation, and coming to
peace, obtain with him equal condition. For the iniurier shall ever be taxed,
having by injury failed in justice, and he iniuried not having extremity,
offended against any virtue, especially when in receiving it, he has
performed his part, shall not have lost his honor, and therefore the iniurier
making peace, cannot absolutely recover his honor justly lost, nor be equal to
him iniuried. This is a plain paradox (replied Calcagnino) altogether
contrary to a common opinion, for in concluding peace, it is held for
certain, that the vantage remains on the offenders side, especially when he
has performed some notable injury, as that of deed: this being confirmed by
the authority of the Philosopher, in the first of his Ethikes, where he says,
that the iniurier has in him more good then he iniuried. This (said Gualin.)
is the foolish vulgar opinion, which holds for courageous, valiant, and
honorable, the proud, insolent, and those ready to injury others; and
conceive not, that the greater the injury is they offer, be it by word or
deed, the more unjust and wicked the iniurier is: and that this is true, the
laws severely punish such like iniuriers, not chasticing them iniuried, as
those without vice, and who will deny, that they are not also infamous, which
are by the laws and magistrate punished? Touching the authority of the
Philosopher, you shall consider that good is of three natures, good profitable,
pleasant, and honest: when it is said, the iniurier has in him more good, it
is intended by profitable and pleasant, and not that honest good, which also
comprehends honor: for of this the iniuried has better store, he having no
ways failed in justice: wherefore, if the iniurier rejoice in himself, that
in force, riches, and friends, he is more mighty then the iniuried, the other
may comfort himself, in that he is more participant of honor, being without
vice. I see not how it can be, (added Calcagnino) that the iniuried should have
more honor, then he iniurying, considering the laws and magistrates
command and enjoin the iniuriers to restore honor to the iniuried. And they
that challenge Combat, or come to question and debate, be no other but those
iniuried, who by this means assay to recover that honor, which by the
iniuried has been usurped: and in entreaty of peace, it is ever required,
that the iniurier restore honor, this being a manifest sign, that he has
not only his own, but that he also retains that of another man's, being of
the iniuried: and consequently that he has the vantage in honor: what say you
to this? Before I make you answer (said Gualin) I will put you in mind of
what I said, entreating of honor: for honor is lost, by failing in justice
and valor: unto which I add, that the offense of justice is far more
grievous, and that which is more accompanied with vice, and by the laws
punished, then is the offense of vilitie or cowardice, seeing the not revenging
of an injury, is after a certain manner without vice, and therefore not
punishable Further, you shall note, that he iniurying, in offering injury, not
only loses his honor by failing in justice, but moreover, staineth the
reputation of him iniuried, by bringing him in suspicion of vilitie, and making
him to be esteemed a man worthy of contempt: observe that I say by bringing
him in suspicion, seeing if it were manifest that the iniuried in the same
instant he received it, performed his part and endeavor, he could not be
reputed vile, although through inequaltty or so me other advantage, he were
wronged: but contrariwise, the iniurier in such a case should remain noted,
with double reproach, that is, both with injustice and cowardice, for to offend
with advantage, discovers vilitie and want of valor: and therefore the
iniuried is urged as well in civil judgment, as before the Tribunal of
arms, to prove that he iniurying, has offended him by advantage and
inequality, or by some bad mean, for justification of his own self, that he
has not failed in valor, and that the iniurier has failed both in one and
other. Now from this I have spoken, it follows that the offerer of injury,
remains absolutely infamous, and the receiver somewhat touched and blemished:
but because it is in the iniuriers hand, to wipe out the blot of him iniuried,
by manifesting his own injustice, and the innocence of the other, therefore it
is said, he retains the honor of the iniuried, and that to him it belongs,
to make restitution thereof.

Whereupon the Magistrates and laws enforce the iniurier, to restore honor
with his tongue to him iniuried, which is no other, but to confess himself
culpable, and the iniuried innocent, as also in making of peace, the self same
is sought after, which is, that he iniurying acknowledge, that he iniuried is
not worthy of contempt, and that he is a man of valor: in which act
questionless, the iniurier remains with the disadvantage of honor: and
therefore as I have said, the Magistrates compel them who impeach other men's
honor to make restitution thereof, after this manner, to the end that for
penalty of their offense, they may receive infamy: considering that the
iniurier cannot restore honor, but he himself must rest somewhat attainted. If
this truth were as well known touching injurious men (said Gualinguo) as in
this point I am fully satisfied, they would not be so hard, to conclude peace:
for men finding themselves offended, think it impossible, especially being by
some injury of deed, that any means may be found out, whereby in capitulating
peace, they should not rest far inferior in honor to the iniurier. And if the
self same (said Beuelacqua) were by the iniuriers foreseen, they would never
be brought to peace: and so necessarily there would be continual quarrel, to
the special discommodity of the commonwealth. And Gualinguo: Although in
working peace, honor cannot equally be balanced, between the iniurier, and
iniuried, yet for all this the offender must not refuse to restore honor to
him offended, when this by an honest mean may be done, and it shall be a
means honest, when he by such an action rests not infamous: and not doing
this he declares himself unjust, no otherwise then he, who forcibly retains
other men's goods: wherefore those that solicit peace, ought by all industry,
to find a mean, through which, with all the equality possible, honor may be
distributed between the iniurier, and iniuried: neither can there be a better
mean found out for persuasion of peace, then when it is made known both to
the one and other, as also in my judgment, those men are not to be hearkened
unto, who setting down courses for proeuring of peace, respect not, so that
peace may ensue, though the one rest with honor, and the other with reproach,
by persuading the iniurier that he cannot commit a thing more unjust or
dishonest then to retain another man's honor, and as in offending he showed him
self superior, so he ought not to refuse, for satisfaction of him offended, to
manifest himself inferior, as also that this mean is convenient for a man
penitent and sorry for his fact. Yet this course is not honest for them that
esteem the honor of the world, or that would preserve their good opinion.

Therefore I am not of their opinion that say, there be offenses so extron me
and grievous, as that no mean can be found to satisfy him offended, exccept
he freely remit and forgive them: For, to come to peace by such an act, is
rather the part of a rash and foolish man, than of one honorable. This free
remission, is blamed by Posseuino, Mutio, and Attendolo, said count Alfonso,
and therefore I am doubtful to commend it: There comes a doubt to my mind,
said Scandiano:) You said that he iniuried, was touched in honor, through the
suspicion that he had failed in valor, or was worthy of contempt; and therefore
that he is bound, for disburdening of himself (as by the other urged) to cause
debatement in civil judgment, or combat, of the inequality, cuil mean and
injustice of the iniurier. Put we the case, that one perform an injury hand
to hand, and without inequality, or advantage, in this point, who shall
remain with advantage of honor? You must observe, said Gualinguo, that there
are and may be two sorts of iniuriers, in themselves very different: which
diversity is gathered from diverse ends; for one is principally intentive to
pleasant good, and the other to good, honest. He intentive to pleasant good, is
the first in offending by words, deeds, through malignitie and envy, or to
show himself the more mighty and gallant: And this man offending whomsoever,
resleth in worse condition of honor, then he iniuried: notwithstanding it is
certain if they offend with inequality or advantage, and by cuill mean, he
remains double infamous: because he comes to fail, not only in justice,
but also in valor. He intentive, one good honest, is not first offending: but
being provoked, makes revenge with his own valor, returning to the first
iniurier, the burden and wrong. Now and if so be he do revenge without
advantage, his condition is much better than that of the iniuried: For he
shows himself, truly valiant, and unworthy of contempt, committing no unjust
act, but in contemning the laws, and Magistrates, at whose hands he is rather
tied to seek revenge, then of himself, to the end Magistrates (as we have
said) in a City be not in vain: but this normitie is so by custom admitted,
that such an iniurier (although he revenge in cold blood) is esteemed far
more honorable, then is the other that has recourse to the Magistrate:
considering that this repairing to the Magistrate, breeds suspicion of small
valor, and impotencie: and to revenge of himself, notes the contrary. You
will then infer said Scandiano, that he which offends without manifest
occasion, or not being provoked, in what manner soever he iniurieth, by
himself alone, or otherwise accompanied, rests more dishonorable then he
offended: for in him is discovered that defect, which principally dispoyleth of
honor, being want of justice: and in the iniuried only want of valor appears,
which is without vice, but yet so, as he that hand to hand offends by an
honorable means, and for revenge of a manifest injury, remains honorable,
and his adversary infamous, because he shows himself valiant, and unworthy
of contempt, being no more unjust then he, who by his proper force will rather
take his goods out of the theefes hand, then acknowledge it from the
magistrate: And this your opinion pleases me so much the more, in that it
swarueth not from the common custom of gentlemen, and of those who make
profession of honor, who should seem in their honor interessed, nay and
unworthy to bear arms, if they sought revenge of a received injury rather
from the laws and magistrates, then of themselves.

Thus much I will infer (sade Gualinguo) and further therewith conclude, that
in according peace, honor cannot be equally balanced, between the offender
and iniuried. Notwithstanding by the solicitor thereof it may so be
cou^terpoised, as that there shall be no true difference, or at least wise very
apparent, that may import so much as once more or less, and I say apparent,
because sometime it is necessary, to deceive and outshoote them, that to peace
would be reduced, neither for this shall one demerite the blame of a deceiuer:
For the end of the best Citizen is, the felicity of his common wealth,
therefore it shall be permitted him to deceive some particular man, for the
taking away of sedition, which disturbeth the general quiet of a whole City;
as also this deceit will be commodious to them deceived, no less then are
those pills, which the Physician sweetneth, to the end the patient, not
displeasing his taste, may be reduced to health. Now vouchsafe I beseech
you, said Scandiano) seeing with so effectual reasons you have excluded
combat, to dilate somewhat concerning peace, instructing us, how we may or
ought to deceive the seditious, for reducing of them to peaceable condition. As
there is not (answered Gualinguo) a thing more impious and prejudicial than
combat, so I am of opinion, that in the whole world (as the giver of health
well shows) there is not any thing that brings with it greater felicity,
than beautiful peace: as likewise there is not an action more worthy, or
beseeming a Gentleman, as by Plutarch it was thought, than to solicit peace:
It shall not therefore grieve me upon this point to deliver some general
rule: For it would be difficult for me, and to you very tedious, if I should
touch all those particular occurrences, wherein, and for which, peace is to be
treated of. Supposing therefore, which otherwhiles I have showed, that the
first offender loses his honor through the offense of injustice, as also the
iniuried through suspicion of having failed in valor, or to be worthy of
contempt, it is necessary, that in treaty of peace, both the one and the other
of these offenses be diminished, and after such a sort excused, that through
them the offenders rest not manifestly dishonored.

It seems that the offense, especially of the iniurier, is mitigated, or at
least excused by two means: one is, when in accusing him, we blame any one
of those passions and sudden motions of the mind, unto whose force it is
hard, or in a manner impossible to resist, as are anger, disdain, love,
jealousy, fear, and such like forcible affections. The second mean is, when
the iniurier charge himself with ignorance, not that ignorance, which is
proper to wicked habit, but with the other particular, which rather deserves
the name of error, then of offense, being the same which is connerfant, about
the circumstances before by us recited, as if he shall confess to have
offended, not knowing the quality of the person, or his desert, and not
imagining in such an action to have iniuried, as also he did it not to
ouercharge him, or as wrongly informed, and such like: suspicion of vilitie in
him iniuried shall be diminished or taken away, by showing the sudden
lighting of the blow, that either for some former or present malady, he was
weak: by being at the same instant he was iniuried, in the presence or privy
chamber of the Prince, or of some others, where he was bound to reverence, for
doubt of inequality in party or such like.

It should not appear (said Scandiano) if that it be true which they
entreating of Combat affirm, that the act of cowardice is excused by
suspicion of vne quall party: whereupon if one accompanied, provoke or assail
another alone, he by himself showing cowardice, cannot be excused by
inequality of party, except he see himself fight against the arms of two
several men: And this their reason is grounded upon that your inward
supposition, that every man is honest, if no action appear to the contrary.

Being therefore to imagine, that the companions of the assailants are just,
there shall be no reason to fear their offending, except it appear
manifestly. And yet in this I am very doubtful, for as in general battle
it is great advantage, to daunt the enemy at the first sight, with great
number, so will it be in any brawle a special advantage, at the first meeting,
by a multitude of accomplices, to strike terror into an enemy alone.

Say it whosoever will (answered Gualinguo) but to assault, or challenge, being
accompanied, one alone, is an unjust act, and notes small valor, although no
other draw their swords then the assailant: neither can he defiled or
assailed, presume upon such honesty in the others companions, as that the
doubt of their injustice shall not be greater: so that in such a case, he
offended may always excuse himself, with probable presumption of inequality.
That this is an action scarcely befitting an honorable Gentleman, Ariosto
declares (said Count Alfonso) in his three and twenty Canto, saying.

They would full feign have gone, but of their company
The Count accepted not: though honest twere and good:
And with this reason straight, he did them satisfy:
That in a warrior no disgrace was understood:
Like as, when to the field his foe he does defy,
And brings for aid and help, a friend, or stander by.
But to return to our purpose of peace, although the general rule you have
set down, concerning entreatie of peace be good, yet rest I not satisfied,
except you also proceed unto points particular, the which (though unto you Sir
Knight, it seem impossible to comprehend, the accidents being in a manner so
infinite) yet in my judgment, they may be reduced under two principal
heads, as likewise all injuries and offenses. For either they be injuries of
words, or deeds: displease it not you therefore to answer, and deliver your
opinion, to such demands as shall be propounded, touching the conclusion of
peace: And Gualin: Although this argument requires longer and deeper
consideration, notwithstanding, as taken suddenly, I will endeavor to give
you satiffaction, and if I do no other good, yet shall give you occasion, to
meditate better thereon. Put case (added Turcho) that one had iniuried by
words, reproouing another of injustice or vility: and if that he iniuried,
returned it not with a lie, but swallowed up this injury: in what word could
the offender restore honor, so as he himself might not be touched? The
general rule in this case, as in alother, may serve the turn (answered
Gualinguo) For it the offender offered not injury in cold blood, which is
called an innocent and inexpected chance, as many times it happens, playing,
talking, or discussing any matter; in such a case we may attribute the fault to
anger: for anger, as the Pholosopher affirms in the first of his Ethics,
mitigateth greatly the offense of injustice, in that it seems the beginning
of action, proceeds not from him angry, but from the other, gining the
occasion of anger: but if he did it in cold blood, which is termed a case
premeditate, it may be excused by ignorance. In the first case the offender,
shall say to the iniutied, I overcome with the fury of anger, and being
without the bonds of reason, iniuried you thus, or thus in words: now taking
you for an honest man, and unworthy of contempt, penitent for whatsoever I have
spoken to your dishonor, I requesting you to be my friend: The iniuried may
answer: Seeing you know me for an honest-man, and repent you of what you have
spoken to my dishonor, I accept you as my friend. The first words disburden
the offender, in that the sin of incontinence, though it absolutely deserve
not pardon, yet nevertheless, it is worthy of excuse, being a very
difficult matter to resist affections, but especially anger.

The last remove suspicion of vilitie from the iniuried: in the second case,
the offender shall say, I through false relation, or probable conjecture,
entered into opinion, that you were such or such an one: but now assured of
truth, I know you to be an honest man, and unworthy of contempt: wherefore
repenting me of whatsoever to your dishonor I have spoken, I desire that you
will be unto me a friend: the first words showing, that the offender erred,
excuse his injustice: and the last work the like effect, as in the first case,
that is, they clear and discharge him iniuried.

And if he ssaundered, (added Beuelacqua) answer the calumniation with a lie,
how would you introduce peace: for according to Faustus, it seems this cannot
be done, except the iniurier eat his words: and thus doing, he accuses
himself to be malignant and a liar, and so rests infamous. And Gualinguo:
The opinions of Faustus in the subject of honor are so strict, as standing on
his foundations, there can no peace be introduced, but that one must remain
infamous, which is false: for whenever in peace it is manifested, that the
offense was not voluntarily performed, neither by election, but rather through
humane fragility, the offender rests not infamous, although the laws suffer
not offenses through ignorance to escape unpunished, or whosoever upon any other
affection of the mind committed. This shall take no place between particular
men, to whom the recovery only of honor, is sufficient. Therefore we will
affirm, that such a like quarrel may after this sort be accommodated. The
giver of the he, shall say thus: being certified, that you evil informed by
one that hates me, spoke thus injuriously of me, I confess, that
notwithstanding you have reported that of me, which is not true, yet have you
not lied, wherefore perceiving you to be a man of valor, and honor, I request
you to be friends with me. He offered the lie shall answer, I truly wrong
informed, and believing that you were such an one, uttered of you these
injurious speeches, but now confe^ssing my error, I know you for an
honorable and honest man, contenting my self to be your friend.

Declare unto me (said Beuelacqua) how in this the honor of the one and
other is satisfied: And Gualin: The words of the first lie-giuer, have
satisfied him offered the lie, because they declare, that he spoke that which
in his conceit he believed to be true, although through ignorance as cuill
informed he spoke slanderously: And the words of him offered the lie,
remove the calumniation objected to the Lie giver, seeing confessing, that he
is an honest man, he secretly, and by an honest mean, reuoketh his saying. Me
thinks, said Calcagnino, that in accommodating this quarrel, you proceed
contratie to that you ought: for as from the slaunderer the quarrel had
original, so ought he also to be the first, in speech of reconciliation, yet
you set down the contrary. And Gualinguo: You must observe, that in the
action of making peace, they proceed contrary to that course in combat; for
in combat, the first advancement or setting forward comes from the
assailant, as he that seeks to recover honor; but in effecting peace, the
first to move and speak, ought to be the defendant, as he, that has to
restore honor: further then this, if the slaunderer should first speak, it
would follow, that he of himself should come to give satisfaction, and revoke
his speeches, which could not but turn to his great shame, as Faustus says.
And if he first iniurying (said Turcho) should answer the lie with a box on
the ear, or other blow, what plaster might be found out fit for the
ripening of this impostume?

Although a blow on the ear, answered Gualinguo, improperly takes away the
lie (as has been said) the injury of deed not being sufficient proof to
show, that another has committed a particular offense, notwithstanding
generally it notes him stricken worthy of contempt: yet not swaruing from
this common abuse which reigns, according to which, he that suffers such
an injury, rests infamous, peace (in my opinion) may by these words be
labored and procured. Let us therefore imagine, that the iniurying had
said to the iniuried: Thou art a traitor: and after, having received the lie,
he had given a box on the ear, or offered some offense of deed, and desirous
to restore honor again, he shall say thus: I being wrong informed, entered
into wrong opinion, that you were a traitor, and therefore the other day I
told you that you were the same, as also I struck you: now being persuaded of
the truth, I confess that you are no Traitor, wherefore esteeming you for an
honest man, and as one that will urge some revenge upon me, as well for my
injury done unto you in words, as also for the other in deed, and repenting
my self heartily in having so sore offended you, I do request, that you will
be unto me a friend.

May it therefore please you, (said Count Iulio) to make known the force of
all those simples that do compound this plaster; for when the virtue of the
simples shall be understood, it will afterward be the more easy to apply
them to other infyrmities: It is not sufficient for a good Physician (answered
Gualinguo) to know the simples, but further, it is requisite and necessary
that he do understand the infirmity, minding to heal it: and therefore
before we proceed any further, let us first of all examine the quarrel;
which is the note of infirmity in the offender, and also in the iniuried: In
this quarrel therefore, on the offenders part there is a great want of
justice, and on the part of him iniuried, defect of valor, not without
suspicion of injustice: out of doubt it is great want of justice to injury an
other, first, with words full of untruth, which by the other man's lie is
manifested, and afterward with deed for sustentation of his slander.

And to support such an injury, is want of valor, for by not attempting just
revenge, it is further suspected lest the defect of justice by the iniurier to
him objected be true; it is therefore requisite to find out simples, which
together compounded, may have virtue contrary to these infirmities,
considdering that contraries by contraries are often times cured: and these
former recited, shall be the words of him first offending, which correspondent
to the quality of the dogs skin, shall be of force to heal this wound and
biting: and to the end we may distinctly consider of them, let us divide them
into three parts.

The first words therefore uttered, are of virtue to cure the lie: for they
make known that the iniurier has spoken untruth, he believing otherwise: and
that he notwithstanding erred spoke but according to his mind, yet being
deceived. The second, which begin: now persuaded or satisfied of the truth,
are of force to remove suspicion of the treason to him iniuried objected: the
rest of the words, wipe out al suspicion of vility in him iniuried, and
manifest, that he is not worthy of contempt, as also that the offender, is
penitent for his unjust fact, through error committed. There is no doubt
teplied Turcho, but the offender, by saying, that he iniuried, was a man likely
to revenge any injury, did free him offended from suspicion of pusillanimitie:
but thus doing, I can not perceive, how the iniurier should not remain greatly
prejudiced in honor; for after a close manner he confesses, that he iniuried,
is a man ready to redouble the blows: the which is confirmed by his last words
of submission, seeing he requesteth him to be his friend: and as for me, I
think it as much, as if he had said, because I know you will bestow upon
me some bastanadoes, or blows, I request, you not to offend me, but to be my
friend. If to be revenged, said Gualinguo, were always the self same, as to
give bastanadoes or blows, you should conclude well; but the matter stands
not so, for it may further be thought, that to carry an injury in n inde, is
to seek revenge of the received wrong by his own proper valor, showing unto
the world, that he iniuried is not worthy of contempt, and because this is an
action of fortitude, which principally is a virtue of the mind, and not of the
body, it suffices in such an action, to show animositie and crourage,
accompanying it with that force, which nature to the body has administered, how
great or little soever it be: and therefore such an one shall be said to have
attempted just revenge of an injury, speaking according to common Use, and
that by his own proper valor he has by all means contended after revenge,
although either in force inferior to his adversary, or by some other sinister
accident, he could not perform his wished desire: for the action of fortitude
consists not in ouercomming, but in fighting resolutely for an honest cause:
the offender therefore affirming, that the iniuried is a man sufficient enough
to seek revenge of the received injury, does not for all this priuiely
confess, that he is a man that will redouble upon him the blow, or give him
some wound; for it may further be understood that he confesses, and knows
him a man sufficient to call in question, or make trial of revenge, with his
own proper valor through the virtue of fortitude which is in him: so that
these words, though they restore honor to the iniuried, yet cause they not the
offender to be infamous, as also it no ways touches his credit, to entreat at
his hands, peace: for he may be there unto moved, not so much for fear, as
through the common desire every wise man has, to purchase unto himself rather
friends then enemies.

We therefore supposing, that in compounding peace, honor cannot equally be
dispensed, and therefore it is necessary, that some fallation be used; these
words are most proper, for in that they may be interpreted with diverse sense,
they are the apter to satisfy, each of the parties, making a construction
according to their purpose: and note thus much, that in procuring peace, it is
of special importance, to find out words of like signification, for with their
plau sibilitie many times, they make that bitter venime, inse^sible, which
infecteth honor: and therefore whosoever desires to bring peace to a good end,
it is necessary he contend more in this, then in any other thing. This is an
excellent advertisement (said Turcho) but how would you appease a quarrel,
where the injury of words is not returned with a lie, but with deed? as for
example, if the offender saying to the iniuried, thou art a murderer, he
iniuried at the same instant should answer him with a blow, and not with a
lie.

Although this be an improper mean of returning such a like injury (answered
Gualinguo) yet desirous to make peace, he that gave the blow shall say thus: I
having understood, that you rather subdued by force of anger, then by any evil
disposition of mind, called me murderer, repent my self that I struck you,
seeing I acknowledge you for a man of valor, and sufficient to seek revenge
of the injury I did you: and therefore request that you will be my friend. The
other shall thus answer: I confess, that overcome by anger, I wrongfully
called you murderer, and seeing you acknowledge me for a man of valor, and
sufficient to make revenge of the injury you did me, requesting my friendship,
I am contented to come to peace, and to be your friend. Questionles these words
are of great force (added Turcho) in that they can appease so great a quarrel.
And Gua: to the end you may conceive their force, you shall note, that he
first iniurying, has put his honor to compromise, through suspicion of two
defects, the one is that of injustice, because he offends another in word,
and the other is by defect of valor, because he puts up a blow: and the
first iniuried being the sccond iniurier, rests in suspicion of some murder:
for the blow, though it note the first offender worthy of contempt, yet does
it not deny his objection of murder, nor tie him any ways to auerre his
saying, although by putting up the blow, it urge him to challenge and assault,
enforcing him necessarily to make known to the world, that he is not a man
worthy of contempt: It is requisite therefore, for the taking up of quarrels, to
find out a mean, and words as apt as may be, for dissipation both of the one
and other suspicion: and therefore the first words excuse the injustice of the
first offender, because it declares that the offense was not committed by
election, but rather through inco^tinency, he iniuried not having had the power
to resist anger, amongst all the affections of the mind, the most violent and
furious. The second words uttered also touching the selfsame first offender,
annihilate the suspicion of vilitie in him, in that they affirm he is a man of
valor, and sufficient to revenge himself of the injury. Then those words
which by the first offender and last iniuried, are for answer produced, take
away suspicion of the murder objected; So that by this mollification, the
impostume is lenified, and finally, healed, which seemed at the first sight
altogether incurable, except with fire or sword. I judge the quariel far more
grievous (said Count Guido) when the lie-giuer answers the bexe on the ear,
with a wound or blow, because injuries then redouble of each party, although
the first offender and last offender remains with vantage of honor. And
Gualinguo: Although this infirmity seem incurable, notwithstanding this shall
be a convenient remedy, if the giver of the lie, being also he that wounds,
shall say thus, after this manner: I being persuaded that you evil informed,
uttered of me such an injurious speech, confess that you have not spoken
against your mind, yet I entend not that the lie I gave you, should any way
prejudice you in your honor, and knowing you for a man of valor, and
sufficient to be mindful of the wound I gave you, or of any other injury I
have done you, penitent for my offense, I humbly request you to be my friend.
The other shall say thus: It is true that evil informed, I spoke so injuriously
of you, but seeing you confess I have not lied, and acknowledge me for a man
of valor, and sufficient to revenge my self of the wound you gave me, as also
penitent for offending of me, you humbly require peace, I am content to be
your friend. Now I comprehend the virtue of these words (said Turcho) and
believe that we have in a manner satisfied al occurrences in these contentions,
if you would but only show how a quarrel might be taken up, where only an
injury of deed has happened. In this quarrel (answered Gualinguo) the honor of
the iniurier stands doubtful, for the suspicion there is of his failing in
justice, as also the honor of him iniuried, through presumption of cowardice:
or that he is worthy of contempt; it is requisite therefore to excogitate words,
that may excuse or remove the suspision of the one and the other defect: and in
my judgment, they may be of this tenor: when I did you such an injury, I
took you for a wicked man, and worthy of contempt: Nowesufficiently persuaded
of your integrity, and knowing you to be a man of valor, as also sufficient
to revenge the injury by me received, penitent for what I have done unto you,
I desire that you will be my friend. He iniuried shall answer: Seeing
acknowledging your error, you repute me for an honest man, and sufficient to
revenge the injury by you received, as also penitent for offending me,
request that I will be your friend, I am content to have peace with you. By
the words which you have declared in other quarrelles (said Beuelacqua) it is
easy to comprehend the force of these other: notwithstanding I am desirous you
would show the reason, why in these treaties of peace, you never use this
word, to Pardon, confidering, that unto him iniuried, it would be greater
satisfaction, when the iniurier should say, I request that you would pardon
me, than to say, I pray you be my friend. It is true (said Gualinguo) that to
him iniuried, it would be greater satisfaction, but so it should be too great
prejudice to the iniurier; because it is supposed, that setting down of
punishment is in the Pardoners hand: whereupon the offender should privily come
to confess, that he iniuried were far superior unto him, and that at his
pleasure he could chasten him, having no other remedy but to crave pardon: and
therefore equallitie in peace by all means possible being to be procured, that
other manner of speech is far more convenient, considering that to contend
after friendship with his enemy, supposes neither cowardice nor fear.

Me thinks, said Count Scandiano, we have left out one kind of quarrel,
which peradventure should have bin the first according to order, and it is
that, where the offenses are like: for sometimes it falls out, that betwixt
the one and other party, injurious words pass without any lie given: or else
that the one and other rests equally stricken or wounded, so that I pray you,
fail not, to accommodate also this quarrel. Some men hold opinion (answered
Gualinguo) that in such like brawles there is no impediment, but to make a good
peace, considering that honor by them is so counterpoysed, as the one
remains not in the others debt: Notwithstanding I hold this for a firm
conclusion, that by exchange there can no honorable peace be made, and much
less in this quarrel, wherein, as the injuries be equal, so is the dishonor
between them equal, and therefore I judge it necessary, that as they have
dishonored one another, so that interchangeably by words, they restore honor:
therefore in coming to peace, he from whom the brawle had his original shall
say thus: In that I know you for an honest and valiant man, it grieueth me of
whatsoever has passed betwixt us, and I request you to be my friend. The
other shall answer: I having also of you the like opinion, and minding well
unto you, gricued for what betwixt us has happened, I am content to be your
friend. In my judgment, this is a good mean to take up such a quarrel, (said
Count Alfonso Turcho) but to the purpose of these injuries: there yet comes
into my mind one doubt, whether one challenged to the trial of equal arms,
may with his honor refuse, knowing himself in force and skill of weapon
inferior to his adversary: By one reason me thinks he should; for God and
nature not having equally dispensed their graces: but unto one man given
greater perfection than to an other: a man as having reason ought to measure
himself, and give place to the other in that, wherein he knows himself
inferior, the which not doing, he performs not a virtuous action, and
consequently, does not preserve, but loses his honor, as rash and arrogant:
on the other side, if that be true, which Posseuino affirms, a man is bound
to manifest as great force and policy as the other, and enjoined to defend
him self from the same enemy, in all other circumstances having
indifferency: I therefore in this, sir Knight, expect your opinion. And
Gualin: Supposing that the challenger have just cause so to do; for being
otherwise, any one, as insole^t, is to be refused, and supposing, that he
challenged be an Armiger, intending by such an one, not only a soldier, but
any one that bears arms by his side, I hold opinion that he challenged,
cannot with his honor, refuse the trial of arms with his adversary, although
in force and knowledge he know him to be superior; for as Zenophon a
Philosopher, and most excellent warrior affirms, the sword and fortune
makes in battle all force equal. And this opinion takes not place only in
general battle, but also in combat, between particular men: in which, by
diverse examples, both ancient and of these days it has been seen, that the
weak has obtained victory against the strong, either by having more mortally
wounded them, or by some other accident. This other reason is annexed; that the
challenged by all reason has ever provoked the challe^ger by some offense;
whereupon as the other has been bold in provoking him, so he challenged
must not show himself cowardlike in refusing: and therefore I conclude, that
one bearing arms, cannot refuse with honor the challenge of any one
whomsoever, although he know himself in force and knowledge inferior to his
adversary.

Your conclusion pleases me (said Count Alfonso Turcho) because it is
conformable to the rules of knighthoode, and common use, notwithstanding from
it, me thinks there grows an inconvenience, for the unarmed touching honor,
shall be of far better condition then he bearing arms, as he that
iniurying, is yet free from challenge: and by this means the way of recovering
honor with proper valor, will be shut up tp him bearing arms, as further then
so, the terms of justice, would not be equally observed: For the bearer of
arms shall be tied to the trial of arms, and the unarmed free. When
Gualinguo: if that law which commands the plaintiff to appear before the
tribunal of the defendant be true, there is no inconvenience will ensue of my
conclusion: for he bearing arms, shall be tied to to leave his own tribunal,
being the proof of arms, and have recourse for recovery of his honor, to the
magistrates, and seat iuditial, it being the proper tribunal of those, that
make no profession of arms, and doing otherwise, he should rather diminish
then augment his own honor, and though the Armiger bearing of arms cannot
refuse, neither seat of judgment, nor tribunal of arms, yet is not his
condition for this the worse: First because the seat of judgment is common to
all men: secondly, for that the tribunal of arms, is proper to himself. Put
we the case (said Beuelacqua) one unaccustomed to bear arms, should
challenge another of unlike condition, could he challenged, with his honor
refuse the defiance, or should he be bound, upon equal terms, to come to
proof of arms? Judgment seat (answered Gualin.) belonging both to the one
and other, the defendant is not only, not bound to the challenge, but
accepting of it, he should perform an act unworthy of a virtuous or
honorable man, and show him self no less insolent, and foolish, then his
adversary: therefore those quarrels that fall out between such like men, are to
be determined, either with peace, or before the magistrates, and as the laws
command; for though honor be common to al men, as also the preservation of it,
by means honorable is as common, yet be those means very diverse, according to
the sundry conditions and professions of men. The gentlemen were not yet well
satisfied, with reasoning of those things pertaining to honor; when the
duchess dwarf came running in, who by order from his highness, went calling of
the Ladies and Knights to a comody prepared by the Gelosi. The discourse
therefore ended, Gua. with four other knights went into the hal where was his
highness, with all the ladies and gentlewomen of the court: And after having
attended, with much laughter and solace a most pleasant comedy, it being now
late, the tables were spread; and supper ended, certain measures once trodden,
the duke rose up, and every one went to his lodging. The day following, being
fair wether, and a calm sea,

His highness with the excellent Duchess, and part of the court, went to the
sea side to see a draught with the nets, and the usual company, with the most
noble Lord Don Caesare, and the marquess of Carrara, who had taken great
contentme^t in the discourse of honor, went to the chamber of madame the
Countess, where according to accustomed solemnity, the Lady Syluia Villa was
crowned Queen: even now lately married, and a young Gentlewoman exceeding
gracious, who causing the Ladies and Knights to sit round about her, spoke in
this manner.

Undoubtedly my error should be very great, if I (in a manner being but a
child) by imposing new laws to our contentments, should withdraw my self
from the accustomed manner. For this would be no other, but by too much
presuming of my self, to eclipse the commendation of these three Queens my
predecessors, whereof deservedly they may boast and vaunt, who in their Empire
procured no less profitable and honest, then delightsome and pleasing
entertainments: whereupon by their most happy furtherance, we have learned
what thing beauty is, and where it consists: we also know what Love is, and
how we ought to love: we have in like manner understood what Honor is, and
how it is lost, how acquired, and how preserved: which things having well
considered with my self, I cannot but greatly commend their wonderful
judgment, seeing they have labored, with our great contentment, to give us
knowledge in those things, whereof above all others, they discuss and argue in
Courts, amongst Ladies and Gentlemen nobly instructed: I therefore desiring by
imitation of their famous virtues, not to manifest my self altogether
unworthy of this Empire, have considered, that after honor, it befitteth
well to entreat of Nobility, to the end, that we never err in discerning
those Noble, from the Ignoble. For it seems that riches and sumptuous
vestments, are the principal caracters of Nobility, we seeing every day, that
the rich appearing in costly Robes, make profession of Gentilitie. And with
bold audacitie, (not to say presumption) establishing themselves in Princes
Courts, are suddenly without any other virtue, as Noble, reverenced, called,
and accepted: I command you therefore Signior Hercole Varrani, that in favor
of me, as also of all these Ladies and Gentlemen, you use some discourse upon
Nobility, withal, providing your self to resolve all the doubts, and answer
all the demaundes that in such an argument shall be made unto you: And
certainly Signior Hercole Varrani, is a Gentleman adorned with all those
qualities, which in a perfect Courtier are principally required. He having
therefore done reverence to the Queen, said in this manner: I should repute my
self too happy and fortunate (most excellent Queen) in that with singular
favor you have thought me worthy to entreat of so worthy a subject, as is
Nobility, if I knew not that in your highness mind, a false image of my virtue
were deceitfully impressed, I being very privy to my self, that my ssender
sufficiency will greatly frustrate your good conceived hopes of my performance.
Notwithstanding, seeing your majesty so commands, I will accept of the
enterprise, holding this for infallible, that disobedience brings far
greater reproach then ignorance, and pusillanimitie, then boldness.

The fifth days Discourse: Wherein is discussed of Nobility,
THere were some most grave and ancient philosophers, thrice excellent Queen,
so great contemners of Nobility, as they constantly affirmed it to be no
other, then a light blast of ambition, wherewith same Citizens more mighty
then the rest, were puffed up: and if notwithstanding there were any such
thing, in the world, it was no whit at all distinguished from virtue, but that
the man virtuous and noble, was all one and the self same thing: upon which
point having meditated, and being to discuss of Nobility, not to perplexe the
mind and understanding of the attendant, I will divide this my brief
discourse into three parts. First, I will show what Nobility is, and where it
consists; in the second, I will set down the principal reasons of those
philosophers, who contemn it as a thing vain and fantastical: and in the
third, I will make answer, and resolve them, to the end our Nobility may
remain most noble and apparent. I supposing therefore, that in certain
indiuidualles of humane kind, there shines an excellent quality which is
termed Nobility, affirm, that it is, no other, then a good of fortune, that
happens to man in his first original and birth, procured unto him, by the
honorable repuration of his predecessors, and glory of his country: by means
of which it is worthyly supposed, that he is much more capable and appliant
unto virtue, then another can be, borne of mechanical parents, in a country
obscure. This by a most proper term, was by the Grecians called Eugenia, which
signifies liberal and good birth, or original; conformable to that word,
we vsealso, to call them noble, well borne. I have affirmed nobility to be a
good of fortune, not because nature therein has no part, but in that, as the
Philosopher teaches, fortune of those things is said to be the occasion,
which fall out contrary to the intention of the worker; being therefore nature
intention in framing man, to make a reasonable creature, and not one noble, of
reason nature is the cause, and fortune of nobility. And I have placed in the
definition, that other clause, honorable reputation of his predecessors, as a
difference specificall, which distinguishes this good called Nobility, from
all other goods external, as likewise the last words of all, are by me set
down, to express in this definition, not only the cause material, formal,
and efficient, but also the final: in that Nobility, is for no other respect,
by all men had in price and estimation, but only because he noble seems borne
with a better inclination, and disposition unto verrue, then a plebeyan, or one
extracted from the common sort. He therefore shall be esteemed more apt unto
virtue, and shall be called truly noble, who legitimately descends, from men,
and women excellent, and famous, either for riches, or those things that most
among me^ are esteemed, and that shall have had many of his race in every age,
and of each sex, honorable and renouned, or that shall be borne in a City
built and replenished, with men heroical, and glorious: where upon the
greater have been the number of his commendable progenitors, the more noble
shall he be. Nevertheless, he may be called absolutely noble, who shall have
lost the memory of his ignobilitie, which memory remains, during the
revolution of three generations: and let this spoken suffice, to make known,
that neither riches, nor sumptuous vestimentes make a man noble, but further it
is necessary, that the renown of his progeny, thereunto concur: for he
borne of mechanical parents, although never so rich, cannot come within the
compass of this definition: which definition, notwithstanding it be well
grounded, yet by some Philosophers, and especially by the Stoickes, it is
altogether derided, whose reasons having foundation upon great probability,
are in no sort to be contemned; They say therefore, that all we springing
from a common root, which is God, principal goodness, and highest nobility;
every one, though vulgarly extracted, is noble, when not degenerating from his
first progenitor, he practices virtue: whereas on the contrary, he is truly
ignoble, who, notwithstanding he descended from the ancient Heroes,
degenerating, addicteth himself to vice: as Boethius affirms in some of his
verses: which in our tongue, sound after this manner.

All humane kind on earth, that draw their pace,
From one beginning come, and self same race:
For one of all things Father is, and guide,
By whom is governed the world so wide:
He to don Phoebus gave his beams of light:
And to the Moon her silver horns so bright:
The heaven with stars, he has adornd throughout:
And earth with creatures, herbs, and plants which sprowt
From whence proceeds this rumor of high blood?
And vaunts of our great grandfathers so good?
If first original and birth we way:
Of each thing maker, God we find always,
So that none vile, can well accounted be
But those that follow vice, and virtue flee:
Abandoning the stock of their degree.
And Seneca principal of the family of Stoickes, writes these formal words:
All men have the same original and beginning, none is more noble than another;
but he that has the better disposition, and apter wit to Arts, and Sciences
liberal: They that place upon the gates, or forefronts of their houses, for
prospectiue, the arms, and colors of their ancients, are rather by these
noted, than made noble. And the same Author says: Virtue found not Plato,
either noble or reverend, but it so made him. Of the same opinion was
Epycharmus the Philosopher and Poet, saying: By nature who inclined is to good,
To be a gentleman is understood,
Though from an Indian mother he derive his blood.


And Euripides: An honest man is truly noble found:
But he unjust, from Jove although he ground:
His high descent, with vice his birth does quite confound.


And Socrates demanded who was noble, answered: he that is temperate of mind
and body. Unto which saying Dant being conformable, affirms: Where virtue is,
there Gentry sure takes place.

Furthermore they allege: Nature is a kind mother to all, and a stepmother to
none, neither shuts she up the way of virtue, more to one than another: but
makes every one apt to attain to his proper end, which is felicity: neither
does Scythia, or any other barbarous region, prejudice man's soul; but which is
more, if the world were eternal, we are equally placed, in the same course and
way of eternity. If that had his beginning from our first Father (as no doubt
but it had) we al likewise from the same first father have our beginning and
original: which being true, it is madness to affirm that one offpring is
more noble then another: and they who puffed up with vain ambition, boast of
Nobility, may rather be called fools, than men noble; they argue also from
the inconveniences that would ensue, if nobility were grounded on the honor of
progeny: for first it would follow say they, that the first virtuous man of a
family, he remaining ignoble, should be the foundation of an other man's
nobility, a thing repugnant unto reason; for then that axiom, by all the
Vniuetsities confirmed, should be false, which is this: Whatsoeuet is the
cause, that any other thing is as it is, must much more be the same it self:
as for example: if fire be the cause that all things have heat, that of al
other must needs be hot. Neither prevails it to allege, that the like
happens to him who is the beginning of Nobility, as does to the point with
unity: considering, that though the one being the beginning of quantity
continual, and the other of discreet quantity, yet is there neither
continual quantity found in the point, nor quantity discreet in unity: for
nobility which is a quality of humane excellence, has nothing to do with
point, nor unity, which are in a diverse kind: as further than this, unity
is comprehended in number; considering that without, one, there can not be
twenty, neither can the line, superficies, or body, be without point, whereupon
in the number of many men noble, that cause nobility, he first must necessarily
be comprehended, who ought to be so much more noble than others, in that he was
the author of nobility, and renown of all the others. And moreover, it would
follow quite contrary to the rule of the Ciuilians, that one might give to
another, that which he has not himself: and that he being obscure, might
reach honor to another, a thing altogether disproportionable, and dissen ting
from reason: It is not therefore to be said, that nobility proceeds from
antiquity of blood: for if that were so, the saying of that holy man should be
true, that nobility were alied to brickes and tiles, seeing our original also
is of the earth. Last of all, they urge that saying of Aristotle, that the
beginning is the halse of the whole; which being true how should not he be
noble, that is the beginning of an other man's nobility, if on him alone depend
the scope and end of all nobility? with these and other such like reasons,
those wise men conclude, that nobility cannot be the renown of progeny: but
that by virtue of it self it is fashioned: in confirmation of which opinion
Dant says: That only he is excellent, who by himself does shine.

But notwithstanding all this. I am of opinion, that our conclusion, and
definition of nobility is true, and the reasons of these Philosophers vain,
and sophistical, which at the first sight appear to be of no small moment.
First therefore observe we, that as terms and bounds manifest that to sense,
where of any one is possessour, so definition (called of the Graecians by a
most proper name Orismi) which in our tongue importes bounds or terms, procure
intellect distinctly to conceive the proper essence, of every thing, unto which
the Perepateticke having had an eye, of all Philosophers the most sedulous,
labored, undoubtedly with admirable method, of althings to find out the
definitions, considering that this is the true foundation of Sciences, it
administering the middle term to perfect demonstration, as the Logicians very
well effect: As therefore al things in our mind by definition, are well ordained,
and distinguished, so from the same mind definition removed, there is procured
a most notable confusion altogether like that, which in the beginning of the
world, the Poets fabulosly called Chaos: Therefore it was an opinion of the
divine philosopher in Phedro, aproued by Cicero, in the first of his Offices,
that they who would entreat of any thing, should begin from the definition:
which being true, as it is, so they that have entreated of matters with out
defining them, have rather bred in the minds of others gross ignorance, then
distinct and absolute knowledge. Seeing that from good definition the solution
of all doubts which occur in science springs. Into this error many ancient
Philosophers, and diners modern writers are fallen: and amongst others,
touching this subject we now have in hand, the error of Mutius
Iustinopolitane, (a wit questionless very rare) is inexcusable: who
refusing the Philosophers definition of Nobility, has himself thereof given
no definition at all, which may make it distinct in kind, from other things:
wherefore, laboring to show contradiction and error in Aristotle, he has
discovered himself to be but vain, and rather a professor of the laws, then
a good Philosopher. But further, let us observe lines, which beginning from
one center, extend to the circumference in the same center, and are both one
thing, and diverse: so al things created, as from God they take their beginning,
be all one, but in respect to diverse forms they be ordained, they be diverse.
If we therefore consider things created in their beginning, which is God, not
only men, as these wise men affirm, but all other things also, are equally
good, noble, and excellent: but if we consider them according to their
exterior forms and kinds, they are between themselves very diverse: and
therefore the Philosopher in his Divine Philosophy, says, that kinds be
like numbers, minding to infer, that as numbers in unity be the self same
thing, neither does the one exceed the other in perfection, but when from
unity they are separate, and fashioned in kind, one is then more perfect and
excellent then another. So all the kinds of things, in their beginning are the
same, but once framed into form, are diverse: further more let us note (and
from hence grows the error of the Stoicke, and his followers) that this
bounty, excellence, and this their original Nobility, as by proper virtue it
cannot be acquired, so may it not by vice be lost, and therefore Lucifer
considered in his first instant nature, is no less perfect and noble then
other angels: for his sin does not procure, but as other angels, so he has
had his original from God. Which error they had very well prevented if they
had been circumspect, and sought after the definition of Nobility, which is
an esteemable condition, that in some indiuidualles of humane kind is found:
for willing to have defined it, they should not have said, that Nobility was
an excellent quality in all things created, depending on their beginning which
is god, the father of all things, and that in those things it is preserved,
when they abandon not the first root and stock, nor practice not Vice: for
they might have perceived, that in this definition, there is a notable error,
and most special inconuencience; the error is, that they having to define a
particular quality, which in humane kind is observed, defined a common
quality, which is not only found in diverse kinds, but also in many things
differing more the^ in kind: the inconvenience is great, for if their
definition were good, an Ass should be of far better condition, then man:
in whom as neither virtue, nor vice can concur, so could he never degenerate
from his first stock and original; and so consequently, should ever be noble:
as on the contrary, a man sometimes virtuous, sometimes vicious, should now be
noble, and anon after ignoble. Mutius says, that Nobility consists in
perfection in kind, determining to infer, that those things which in their
kind are perfect, be truly noble: the which being true, that creature from
whose flesh the Jews abstain, being perfect, might be numbered amongst those
noble: he adds afterward, as greatly in himself perplexed, that although he
descended from ancient lineage be noble, yet is not he so descended, only noble,
for by this means, says he, we should infringe the power of nature and virtue,
that they could not generate a new nobility. Mutius therefore contendeth to
prove, that there be three sorts of nobility: of the first, conformable to
the Perepateticke, he makes antiquity of blood the auther; of the second,
nature, drawing near to Seneca, who affirms in the place by me cited, that
he is more noble then another, whose disposition is better, and wit more apt
to liberal arts: of the third sort, he makes virtue productresse, following
the opinion of Boethius, that he is noble, who degenerateth not from his
original, and applies himself to virtue. This man questionless in his
profession learned, did not mark, that he dividing nobility into two diverse
kinds, has not showed nor defined the nearest kind, wherein they agree: for
if he had examined his definition, he might easiely have foreseen, that they
not being to be reduced, under univocal kind, and very hardly under
analogy, no more could different kinds be fashioned, after such a manner as
he framed them: he has therefore Vainly alleged, that nature, or the
intention of nature, may generate nobility, for as we have declared, nature
of her self, is the cause of reason, and by accident of nobility: for if she
distribute nobility, as well as reason, all men, as they are reasonable, so
should they be noble; but in that the cause of nbilitie is fortune (being a
cause contingent) of men we see some noble, others ignoble. That virtue is the
cause of nobility we grant, but not the virtue of one alone (as he affirms)
but rather the virtue of many: we grant also, that nature in respect of her
self, is to all a kind and loving mother: notwithstanding let us add, that
she working by seed, manifests herself a stepmother to some: considering
seed from the heavens, places, nourishment, and sathers, receives diverse
disposition, sometimes good, some times bad: whereupon indiuidualles of the
same kind (but especially in humane kind) as they are of diverse temperatures,
so in them ditters inclinations, and in their minds different effects and
affects are discovered: from whence it proceeds in reason, that some are
esteemed of noble race, and others of ignoble: some ingenious, others stupide:
some prevail with force of mind, and are truly worthy to command, and others
be as it were lumpish sturdy, with whom servitude better befitteth: Unto which
the divine Philosopher alluding says, that in the generation, of men, there is
a mixture in some of gold, and those are always worthy to command, others have
commixtion with silver, and these are fit, sometimes to obey, sometimes to
command; the third and last sort, participate with iron. Wherefore, as of al
others, most vile, they are ever fit to serve, and never to command.
Consormable to his master was the great Perepatitian, who showed by most
evident reasons, that by nature the Lord and servant was allotted: Nobility
therefore is not contrary to the laws of Nature: Because Nature made all
things necessary, common to all, and those which are accidental and
contingent, she left them subject to instabilitie: for if we see by
experience, that in the sons bodies oftentimes, the similitudes of fathers,
grandfathers, and great grandfathers are represented, why should we not grant,
that in the mind with the body conioynd the like may com to pass? and that in
them the like inclination and facility, sometimes unto virtue, and otherwhiles
to vice, may appear. This for the most part falls out, whether the world be
eternal (as the Perepatetiks falsely affirm) or by the omnipotent God created
(as the Dinines soundly hold) for that in the course of this mortal life, the
variety of reasous, customs, manner of life, norishments, and such like, make
near causes different, out of which afterward diverse effects are produced:
notwithstanding, in my judgment, the opinion of Aristotle is worthy to be
approved, that nobility by all men is to be had in estimation: for it is
conformable to reason, that from better the better should spring, the which by
Horace was confirmed in these verses: Strong men do oftentimes children of
force vpreare,
The fathers virtue, in young heifar does appear:
And horses fierce and stowt: for seely fearful Dove.
Had not the Eagle sure for sire, that mounts above.
But to prove the contrary of these arguents, I affirm, that it is, not only
no inconvenience, but further it is necessary, that the first virtuous of a
progeny, without he himself being absolutely noble, should lay the foundation
of an other man's Nobility: and to the end my conclusion may be manifest, we
must consider, that as to procure the transmutation of any thing into fire, it
is first requisite, that it acquit eight degrees of heat; so to make one
noble, it is necessary, that besides his own excellency, he join unto
himself the glory at least of iii. other lights, that is, that he be enobled
by three other of his predecessors: whereupon, as that shall not be fire which
retains only two or three degrees of heat, although there shall be fire kindled
and begun, so shall not he be noble, that has only his own private renown
to stand upon, although he be the beginning of nobility: neither has that
axiom here any place that says, whatsoever is the cause, that another thing
is as it is, must much more be the like it self: for it has annexed unto it
many limitations; and it may be verefied in these causes, which of the
Logicians and Philosophers are called, causes rotal, that is, which are of
themselves, and only causes: but he which is the beginning of nobility, is not
alone the cause of nobility, but concurreth therein, with many other. Let us
grant, that he as the point in continual quantity, and unity in discreet, is
comprehended amongst those noble, yet not as absolutely noble, but as he that
only has one degree of nobility, being as it were the beginning: confess we
also, that one can not give what he has not himself; and that the first
virtuous can not give unto an whole race, nobility: but add we this
thereunto, that he may give what he has, which is that first degree, with his
own virtue acquired: and affirm we, that the virtuous son of a virtuous
father, is more noble, he inioying, not only his own, but also his fathers
glory; though this man also, standing but upon ii, discents, cannot be said to
be absolutely noble, as that cannot termed fire, which has only four degrees
of heat: lastly, that saying of the Philosopher impugneth not our definition,
that the beginning is the half of the whole, because it behooves, we
understand it truly: he minding to infer, that to give beginning to any
thing, is of such importance, as it seems whosoever has begun, is at the
midst of his work: But granting them that this proposition is true, we may
conclude against themselnes, that he which is half partaker of Nobility, is
not wholly noble: so that to such an one, our definition cannot be applied:
which remains firm and immovable, that is: that perfect nobility is a good
of fortune, derived from the virtue of our progenitors, together with the
country wherein we were borne: through which it is supposed, that he noble
borne, is more apt and disposed unto virtue than an other ignoble. For if we
esteem the goodness of diverse creatures, by their races, how much more ought
we to prognosticate the virtue of men by his stock, and progeny, considering
that not only secret virtue of seed, but also reason does instigate a man, to
immitate the revealed virtue of his progenitors, not to show himself
altogether unworthy of their splendour and glory.

Here Varano stayed, imagining that he had sufficientlye declared, what
manner of thing Nobility was, when the Queen made a sign to Signior
Francisco Patritio, that he should utter somewhat, for the drawing out a little
more at length, this begun discourse. Patritio therefore turning himself
toward Varano: You Signior Hercules explaining the definition of Nobility
said, that he shall be truly noble, who lawfully descends from famous men
and women, or that for riches, or such things amongst men are most esteemed,
so that, not only virtue, honor, magistracy, and glory, for those be the
things most reputed of: but also riches, be the authors of nobility: a point
(in my opinion) dissenting from all reason: For if riches produced Nobility,
riches being the lawful begotten of avarice, who sees not evidently, that
Nobility should spring from a very corrupt generation. Show us therefore
how it may be that men through riches, should become famous, and be
foundation of Nobility. And Varano: As virtue without riches can very hardly
appear: he which is poor, as the philosopher affirms, not being able to
accomplish magnificent actions: so those riches which are not the companions of
virtue, cannot be founders of nobility: wherefore the covetous man, usurer,
and he which addicteth him self to sordide gain, although he should heap
up together more riches then Craesus, yet could he not of himself, be
beginning of Nobility: although the first descendant from this man, might well
acquire this beginning, if with his received wealth, he should couple virtue.
Notwithstanding all this Signior Hercole (added Patritio) you make me suspect
this your noble born babe to be infamous, I fearing, that he is rather an
imaginatiue, then a true and lawful offspring, seeing you are of opinion, that
virtue without the seed of riches, suffices not to better him: but if that
were true, it were a wonder to point out one Noble, considering how hard a
matter it is, that riches should accompany virtue: and therefore good Diogenes
was wont to say, that Virtue could not inhabit in a City nor in a house where
was riches: and the self same Philosopher demanded what sort of men were most
noble, made answer, the contemners of riches, glory, and pleasures: and
Plutarch said, that the appetite of nature was of it self incorrigible, but if
abundance of riches thereunto were added, it became altogether wild and
unbridled: and if we shall imitate the wiser Philosophers, but especially
Seneca, we may rather term riches the mother of pride, insolence, ambition,
intemperance, then of Nobility: And if we respect the founders of ancient
Nobility, we shall find many more examples of men poor and virtuous, who
despising riches, by virtue only made their progeny illustrous, then of the
rich virtuous: For beginning from the ancient Romans, Fabritius although he
were poor, rather desired triumphs, then the riches of the Samnites, having
with maruailous greatness of mind, rejected both the gifts, and giuers: Menenius
Agrippa, who was of so great authority, that many times he took up the
discordes between the Senate and the people, lived so poorly, as after his
death, if there had not been a common collection made amongst the people,
there had not been sufficient left to bury him. Attylius Regulus, a man
renowned for his virtues, was so poor, as that he being to maintain the
war, it was necessary his wife and children should live at public charge:
and for this occasion was a daughter of Cneius Scipioes married with a public
dowry. But to make recital also of the Grecian Histories, Phocyon Athenian,
when he might have made himself rich with those gifts offered unto him by
king Phillip, would not accept of them: and being put in mind by the Kings
Ambassadors, that he should do well to accept of them for his children, who
without riches, could hardly preserve their fathers glory. If they prove like
me (answered he) the self same little field will bring them up, which
has raised me to this dignity, and if they resemble me nothing at all, I
desire not that their intemperance should be nourished and augmented at my
charge and expense. Lysander Lacedemonian, who made Athens Tributarie to
Sparta, was so poor, that after his death, his Daughters Husband, not having
received their dowries, would have refused it, but that by the Magistrates they
were compelled to hold and keep them: Epaminondas, who deprived the
Lacedaemonians of the principallitie of Graecia, and made his country free,
which before, and after him, was always in servitude: of all the victories he
obtained, never took any thing for himself, content only with Glory, and
was so indigent, that not sufficient being found after his death for
perfourmance of his obsequies, he was buried at public charge: I could bring
forth infinite other examples for demonstration, that riches has no part of
nobility: the which for to avoid prolixitie, I pass over with silence: only
I will allege, that the Philosopher in his Rethoricke, amongst noble families,
numbreth the descendentes of Socrates; and Socrates as he was esteemed for a
Virtuous man, so was he not rich, nor from a rich father extracted: we must
necessarily therefore affirm, that these men, adorned only with virtue, were
ignoble, in that they were not rich (which would be an exceeding paradox) or
else that only virtue, and not riches is she, that makes a family noble.
The definition I have set down of Nobility (said Varano) as it is true, so
will it resolve all difficulties, and not being sinisterly interpreted, will
not be altogether discrepant from your opinion.

These two conclusions therefore are inferred: the first is, that virtue is
properly she, that brings forth Nobility, The second, that Nobility cannot
be nourished, nor brought to her perfection, without riches. The first
conclusion is manifest of it self, the second is proved by this reason: for
as the practice of mechanical and vile trade, is proper to him ignoble, so
belongs it to him noble, to use freely liberal arts; and therefore the
Philosopher affirms, that the life of mechanical artificers is base,
degenerating from virtue, and unworthy a civil man: considering, that to
acquire virtue, quiet, and leisure is requisite: where upon it may be noted
against the Stoicke, that Nobility takes not his beginning, so much from
abandoning of vice, as from giving over base practices, and mechanical arts,
and applying ones self to those liberal. And because these cannot be freely
exercised without riches, therefore are Riches necessary for the preservation
of Nobility: in that one oppressed with poverty, cannot have a quiet
peaceable life, he being enforced to gain his living by manual aite: And
therefore the Philosopher in his Politickes, if I remember well, says;
Nobility consists of ancient richesse and virtue: minding to infer, that
though Nobility has virtue for foundation, yet can it not be nourished nor
continued without riches; the which, the greater antiquity they be of in a
family, the more special token give they of Nobility and virtue, seeing
ancient riches can, not be preserved without ancient virtue: that Nobility is
by riches preserved, and through want thereof lost, experience and reason
manifests it: for principalities and riches once lost, we see most noble
families come to contempt, and loose their Nobility, those Noble being
constrained through want, to apply themselves to base courses, and mechanical
arts: wherein, as the body is contaminate, so is Nobility stained. Let us
then auerre, conformable to your judgment, that the poor man through singular
virtue, may be foundation of Nobility: but then we must add also, that it
cannot be nourished and reduced to due and proportionable stature, nor in a
family be preserved without riches: whereupon as Fabritius, Menenius, Agrippa,
Attilius Regulus, Cneius Scipio, Phocyon, Lysander, Epaminondas, and Aristides
the just, being poor, were for their notable virtue, a sufficient beginning of
Nobility: so by defect of wealth, it was quickly annihilate in their
discendants. And if the offspring (said Patritio) were as virtuous as the first
founder, might not nobility be nourished, and take propagation without riches?
And Varano: Noble race would either be very rare, or none at all, if
segnealate and heroycall virtue, were as necessary for the nourishment, as
generation of Nobility, this being a thing so admirable and rare to be found.
Therefore I say, that as by excellent and singular virtue she is generate, so
is she fostred and maintained by riches and indifferent virtue. Declare unto
us I beseech you (replied Patritio) before we proceed any further, what is
segnealate and excellent virtue, and what virtue indifferent: for I did not
think that in virtue there could have been any defect, mediocritie, or
excess, the Philosopher having told me, that there can never be too rertuous
a man.

I am sure, signior Patritio, answered Varano, you feign ignorance, to the end
that others may the better understand, as he that no less desires to assist
others, than help himself; I therefore, to satisfy your good intention, will
feign also to instruct you, to the end others may learn: and therefore I say,
that if we consider virtue in her self, she being a mediocritie equally
distant, betwixt two extremes, cannot participate of more or less: but if
we respect the subject into which virtue is received, she shall not be in all
points equal: For, as in men, complexions, exercises, and studies be diverse:
so will some particular virtue, in one, be more splendant than in another: as
for example: in a man of war, he being always conversant about things
terrible, the virtue of fortitude shall be more noted, than in a civil man,
who applies himself to the government of the common wealth: For in him the
virtue of justice will be more famous, as in the Philosopher the virtue of
temperance. The excess then of virtue, according to the Philosopher, is after
this manner expressed: the which excess is of such a nature, as it cannot pass
into vice, but rather is properly that which makes a man magnanimous; and it
is called virtue Heroical, as that which participateth both of humanity and
divinity: and this is either excellency in profession of arms, accompanied
with moral virtues, or great wisdom, and civil understanding: insomuch as
from these two virtues, cities receive cheifest good and benefit. But because
these excellencies are not granted to every one, neyrher is it generally given
to all men, to be apt to warfare, or inclined to the study of good letters, I
will count him possessed with indifferent virtue, in whom shall appear gentle
customs, that shall be continent, modest, not envious, no evil speaker, a
keeper of promise, a friend to right and equity: faithful in preserving
things committed unto him, as well money, as secrets, a lover of truth, that
through deprauation of mind consents to no brutish action, nor through temerity
enacteth no indecent thing: and that above all the rest, shall be religious and
liberal. And to conclude, an enemy to al vice, and a friend to virtue: when
it is therefore said, that they also shall be noble, whose predecessors
through riches have been renowned, indifferent virtue is not excluded: for
then the proposition would be most false, but rather that virtue heroycall, the
which of it self without riches is honorable: whereas the Philosopher in his
Rhetorike has numbered the offpring of Socrates amongst those noble, supposing,
which yet may be doubted, that Socrates, and those that tame of him were poor,
we must observe, that he in his Rhetorike entreatiug of things, which in the
eye of the people be apparent, he does not always philosophically, but
sometimes, after a centaine manner, speaks and discourses particularly,
tying and accommodating himself, rather to vulgar opinion, than pune verity:
and there is no doubt, but if thatq excused him not, he should many ways
contradict himself: for there could not also be any antiquity of blood, nor
of spring of Socrates in Aristotle's time. Seeing that, as Ammonius affirms in
the life of Aristotle, he at 17. years of age, went to hear Socrates, and was
his disciple for three years. Considering for my sake (said Patritio) you
confess that virtue is the mother, I am content, in favor of you, that riches
may be the tutresse of nobility: which ought to nourish and reduce her to
perfection. Then signior Alfonso Turcho, desirous to hear further of the
matter: Me thinks said he, signior Hercole, your opinion is very conformable
to truth, which is, that Nobility takes original, rather from giving over
mechanical arts, and base practices, than from abandoning vice: the
philosopher confirming the same, where he says, that he which is employed in
base practices, cannot exercise virtue: and there is no doubt, but all common
wealths, as well ancient, as modern, distinguish by this Caracter, the noble
from the vulgar sort: And the Philosopher would, not only, that the plebeian
should be free from vice, but further allotteth unto him a certain portion of
virtue, saying, in the mechanical man so much virtue suffices, as wherewith he
may justly practice his trade and profession; but for all this, I am doubtful,
for if Nobility should have her original from leaving trades mechanical, and
not from abandoning of vice, this inconvenience would follow: For the professor
of mechanical arts, being without vice, should be ignoble, and he practicing
liberal Arts, though vicious, must come to be noble, and so consequently, any
wicked man, applying himself to liberal arts, might be author of Nobility.

This your doubt arises (answered Varano) from not having well understood,
all the circumstances, from which Nobility is derived, although I described
them unto you: because it is necessary, that the first founder of Nobility,
give not over, only arts mechanical, and apply himself to the study of arts
liberal, but further, that he virtuously, and with decency practice them;
which doing, he can never be vicious. You will then infer, added Turcho, that
he who will be truly noble, or beginning of nobility, ought, not only to
abandon mechanical professions, but also to fly vice. Even very so, said
Varano. And what understand you, replied Turcho, by those words, to exercise
liberal Arts virtuously? And Varano: These words declare, that it is proper
to one noble, to practice liberal Arts without vice: because he is bound to
use them, not for avarice, or ambition, as many do, but only for honesty.
And what understand you by liberal arts, said Turcho? And Varano: By liberal
arts, I generally intend al those exercises, as well of the mind, as body, which
are worthy of a virtuous and civil man, as are all the Sciences, as well divine,
as humane, and the arts which unto some Sciences are annexed and subalternate,
but above all others, the Art of War, and study of the Laws: For the one
preserves, and the other governs a Commonwealth: And therefore al those,
who addict themselves to these exercises, not to reap thereof benefit and
gain, but in favor of themselves, their frinds, and of honesty, either they
are the beginning of nobility to their discendants, or else not degenerating
from their predecesslors, may be recounted amongst those noble. You impose too
severe a law, added Count Scipio Socrate, upon Nobility, you holding opinion,
that they noble, are enjoined to practice liberal arts, without hope of
drawing from them any benefit: so that Doctorshippe, which by Emperors is so
privileged, should very seldom be the beginning of nobility, we
continually seeing, that the multitude of doctors, especially of Lawyers, is
always ententiue to gain. And Varano: He that has a generous and noble mind,
shall easily observe this law, but to the degenerate and base mind, it may well
seem rigorous. Therefore I reply, that those doctors, who sell words all the
day long for gain, yea and for lies also, cannot but acidenrally be authors of
Nobility, notwithstanding they should acquire greater wealth, then Crassus; but
their inheritors, by employing this obtained wealth, and exercising decently
liberal arts, might well lay the foundation of Nobility to their progeny. And
if a doctor, reading or instructing (said Socrate) should receive some public
stipend, would it any thing prejudice him in Nobility? And Varano: Public
stipend being in anu^ber of things honorable, and honor of an houest man
desired, as an ensign of virtue, to receive it inward, especially through her
beneficence, does not only, not prejudice, but moreover exalts to Nobility:
By the same reason also, a stipend which the Prince bestows on those noble,
to serve him upon occasion in the war, or in any other honorable action,
does not a whit blemish, but rather makes nobility the more to shine and be
resplendant, in that the stipend of a Prince, who represents the
Commonwealth, is a public stipend, and notes virtue in him noble, and that
he either has, or is fit to perform some benefit to the prince or
commonwealth. But Count Hercole Tassone, who sat by him said: I would
willingly understand, if to practice merchandise were any obstacle of Nobility:
Ferif that should be true, the Venetian Nobility, so highly esteemed of, would
be nothing worth, in that there be seldom any of their nobles, which are not
also merchants, they being of opinion, that Nobility can hardly be preserved
without merchandise, being the mean to hold and augment wealth. And I have,
and do know some princes, that are given to trade of merchandise, and yet
amongst others noble, those princes are most noble: and Varano: Although the
Philosopher affirms, that the life of merchants is base, and contrary to
virtue, as also the Thebanes made a law, that none might be capable of honors
in the commonwealth, except they had given over trade, for the space of ten
years before: notwithstanding, I make this distinction: For merchandise may be
practiced two manner of ways, the one, by causing to be brought out of far
countries, those commodities which are not in their own, to their own gain,
and for benefit also of the commonwealth, the other, by not respecting public
benefit, but only to enrich himself, buyeth up the commodity of his own
country, whereof there is abundance, expecting occasion to sell them again at
a greater price, and this being grounded Upon avarice, and a sordide gain, as
it is from virtue far remote, so does not that other blemish at al Nobility,
especially, if it be practiced with Decorum. And how may it be practiced with
Decorum (added Tassone?) He noble in using trade, shall obserus Decorum (said
Varano) if for all this he give not over liberal arts, but shall use the other
by the hand of his agents, and not sell his commodity by retale, setting forth
shoppes with it, but utter it in grosle, and for a reasonable price, having
ever his eye no less to public benefit, then unto private gain: with this
Decorum the Venetian Nobility practice it: For they noble, not forsaking
profession and arts liberal, as also not neglecting affairs, and public
magistracies, procure with their ships, commodities to be transported out of
other countries, for which cause they maintain their factors, selling
altogether in gross, helping by this means, not only their country, but also
many other neighbor provinces, and therefore in this manner preserving and
increasing wealth, they do no whit infringe their nobility. Those Signiors
Undoubtedly are noble (added Tassone) for besides their being most opulent
both in public and private, and lords of so miraculous and great a city, as is
Venice, and most mighty also by land and sea, they may further be esteemed the
only nobles of Italy, Nobility in their ancient families having never bin
defaced, the original whereof is reckoned from nine hundred years, by the
Barbarous nations, the which by their Cities of Italy cannot be affirmed,
wherein some of the nobles vaunt themselves to come out of Germany, others out
of France, and many out of Spain. But to return to our purpose, seeing he
noble may traffic, I would also understand, if without touch of nobility, he
may heap up treasure or no: for of this I doubt, especially having read, that
amongst the Romans it was highly commended, neither to deminish nor augment a
patrimony, that generous people imagining, that it was a hard matter to
accumulate gold and treasure without vice. To gather wealth (answered Varano)
is in the number of those actions, which of themselves are termed neither good
nor bad, but by the circumstances, mean, and end wherefore they are performed,
they become either good or depraved; it shall be lawful therefore for him noble to
store up wealth, so often as in this he observe a mediocrity, and do it to good
and honest end, and this mean may by him be kept, if considering himself, and
his wealth, he live with that decorum, which for his nobility and faculty shall
be convenient, endeavoring that every year of his revenues there may rather
auance, the^ come short, to the end, that by sinister occasion of fortune, he
fall not into some distress: for there is not a greter indignity, nor any thing
that more preiudiceth nobility, then for one noble, through want, to go led, as
we commouly say, by another man's hand, as on the contrary, there is not any
point that gives greater reputation, or that nearer appears to magnanimity,
the^ not to be in want or necessity of any thing. The end shall be honest, in
gathering wealth for our children: which is also by the Eua^gelical law
permitted, as likewise to be mindful of our friends, and that we may honor, and
succor our cuntry in her necessities, a thing which the Venetia^ nobility is
wont to perform, who bring into the common treasury, the particular treasures
heaped up by industry, and frugalitie, offering it with their singular
reputation to the service of their country: and therefore by fools, who
respect no further then a certain vain exterior appearance, this their
frugalitie is fondly taxed, as those, who in apparel and diet, consume not
their wealth: where upon they call the nobles of Venice miserable and
covetous, although notwithstanding throughout their whole city, they may see
manifest signs of their magnificence: but if we use by the house, to measure,
not only the condition and state, but also the mind of the patron, that for
his own use has built it: what is he, who beholding the stately and
magnificent palaces, consecrated to eternity, which the Venetian nobility,
for themselves, and public ornament, questionless with heroycall charge do
build, and may not perceive in the^ a mind more then great, or will not term
them (undoubtedly most worthy) by the titles of magnificent and excellent? and
let not the^ scoff at that nobility, who with notable vanity, are to no other
thing addicted, the^ the excess of pompous attire, and sumptuous fare; who
being continually followed by Parasites, and Sicophants, with shame, and loss
to themselves, and their children, utter their wealth downwarde in the priuies.
The honest frugalitie and moderate living of the virtuous (said Tassone) is
rather to be attributed to those excellent laws, and good customs, wherewith
that most prudent commonwealth is governed, the^ to the virtue of particular
men: for diet, by the laws is moderated, and sumtuous apparel, as well in
women, as men forbidden: for the magistracy of Censors, which is a place of
great dignity in the commonwealth, is principally intentive about this,
severely chastising those, who contemning the laws, exceed the mean set down,
in their apparel, diet, or other supersluities. This law (added Varano) is of
so great importance, that by it principally, the commonwealth flourishes, and
is maintained: for richesse by this means, is not only preserved (the props
of Nobility) but also pride is abated, all occasion of envy taken away, of
hatred, disdain, and consequently of all seditions: In that those men, equal
in Nobility, but in riches inferior to others, not being able to tolerate,
the pomp and pride of them more opulent, in apparel, and other exterior
apparances, excelled by these discontented with their own estate, they would
easily labor after innovation of state in the commonwealth: and there is no
doubt, but if the prince with laws bridle not the subjects folly, that men in
cities shall live scarce happyly, seeing men by nature, are so vain and
ambitious, as the vulgar sort, by apparel strive to seem noble; as they
noble, also contend to appear like princes: and setting their whole desire
upon no other then an exterior appearance, they respect not to be seen beggars
in their houses, so that in the market place they may appear rich. Seeing you
have here made it known (said count Caesar Tassone) in what manner it is
lawful for one noble to traffic and enrich himself: displease it not you
also to declare, whether a Prince, without blemish to his Maresty, may heap up
treasure: by one reason it seems he may not, for as the Philosopher
affirms, accumulating of treasure is proper to a Tyrant: honor and glory
belonging to a right and good Prince; and considering, that a Prince may at his
pleasure, dispose of his subjects and wealth, he makes a far better
reckning, by laying up his treasure in the purses of his subjects, and
friends, then ever gleaning from them, to lock it up close in his own
treasury: in that by there hiding the^, he alienateth from himself his
subjects minds, making himself only Lord over gold: but contrary wise,
laying them up in their purses, he becomes tyrant both of their gold, and
minds: then which mind, there is nothing more difficulte to be governed, as
that, which not by force, or violence, but only with beneficence may be
acquired: but further, what need a prince hoard up treasure, when by the same
means he can never become poor, how royal and magnificence soever he be,
in that at his pleasure he might furnish himself with his subjects wealth. It
is not only lawful (answered Varano) but also is necessary that a Prince
should gather riches, seeing he represents the common wealth; considering
that the treasure of the prince is public treasure, wherewith he defends the
City in time of war, and in time of peace supplyeth the peoples wants, and
which most imports, by them the greatness and reputation of principality is
maintained, not being any thing that makes a Prince more highly esteemed, then
to be rich of treasure, money being as it were the nerves and sinews of war:
wherefore above al other matters, a Prince ought to be respective of falling
into want of treasure: for he no sooner discovers himself needy, but, though
a very great prince, he suddenly grows into contempt, and easily becomes
a pray to his enemies. A good Prince therefore, ought in gathering of wealth,
to have an eye always to honesty, contending to increase his treasure, rather
by avoiding superfluous and excessive expenses, then by imposing new and
unwonted exactions, to the end he show not a desire to enlarge his own
royalty, by deminution of his subjects store, for this should be no other, the^
of a good Prince, to become a tyrant: the true Prince no otherwise differing
from the tyrant (as the Philosopher teaches) but that the prince rather
seeks to enrich his subjects, then himself, and a tirant, as he that
considers not that a prince is ordained for his subjects good, and not the
subjects in favor of the prince, not a whit respecting the good of his people,
performs all things for profit, and to please himself: and therefore the
object of a true prince is honessie, and of a tyrant, his own will and
contentment. He then that shall store up treasure in such sort as is
convenient for a true Prince, preserves his reputation in peace, and makes
himself strong for war, and by nor oppressing the minds of his subjects, he
shall ever be a true and lawful potentate. The answer of Varano was by the
whole assembly commended, as if in that, secretly were expressed the wisdom
or virtue of their Prince. And count Caesar replying no further, signior Guilio
Caesar Brancaccio: I well remember, said he, Signior Torquato Tasso in one of
his dialogues, which he entitled Forno, entreating of nobility, holds this
conclusion, that a man of valor, though he be not honest, is properly he, that
gineth beginning to nobiltie, by acquiring power and riches, leaving them to
his progeny: which conclusion, he verifieth by the example of Caesar, who
though he was not an honest man, yet because he was most vaiorous, left his
posterity great, and mighty: From this conclusion, there arise in me two
doubts, the one is, whether from one not good, nobility may take original,
the other is, whether vice and valor may stand together: upon these
difficulties, Signior Hercules, I expect your opinion. And Hercules: Before we
proceed any further, it will be good, that the first discoursing search out the
true signification, and from whence these terms, a man of valor, be derived,
the which, neither with the Latins, nor Grecians I never find expressed, and
I do not believe that they can be set down in such manner, and with that grace
as they sound in our language: for my part, I should think that this word
valor, were derived from the vulgar word Valere, which we commonly use in
those things that are sold for price: and that speaking properly, it importes
as much to say, as this thing is of great value, as to say, it valueth, or is
worth so much: or the price of it is so tated: and forther, I am of opinion
that those things are absolurely of value, which in their kind (be they
artifinall, or natural) are good, and apt to that end, whereunto art or nature
directs, and not being such, although they may welserue to some such use, yet
may they not absolutely be termed of value; which being true (as it is) so
cannot he be absolutely a man of valor, who is not honest, considering he is
not apt to that end, whereunto uature and the author of her, has directed him,
which is felicity: and I say absolutely of valor; because it is not to be
otherwise thought, but that he being expert in some art, or science, may be of
indifferent estimation. This is conformable to the Philosopher, where
entreating of wisdom, and wise men, he says, that this name properly agrees
with those, that of all humane actions perform ever the best: but for all
this, those also, who in some one Art are excellent, do usurp this term:
whereupon we use to say, that Praxiles and Phydias were expert and excellent
Grauers. Now to our purpose: If Tasso understand, that a man not good, may be
called absolutely of valor, in my judgment, he is deceived: but if he
intends, that valorous may be applied, after the same manner, as Phydias was
said to be wise and excellent, which was only in the art of Grauing, he spoke
well: In like manner, he is deceived if he believe that the man valorous,
accompanied with vices, may of himself be founder of Nobility, and I say of
himself, in that by accident he is not forbidden, such an one leaving riches
and power to his posterity, by mean of which, they may with honor exercise
virtue, and liberal Arts. Your opinion, said Brancaccio, is conformable to my
humor, and grounded upon preualent reasons: For if by nobility we suppose an
inclination unto virtue, in him noble, it being likely, that from the better,
better still springs; if he first had been wicked, both supposition and
proposition would be false: For from one not good, another good should take his
original; but according to my observation, this word valor, seems properly
to be usurped in those uses appertaining to war; so that when we say, he is
valorous, or of valor, presently we understand it in Arms. Art Military,
answered Varano, as it has ever been, of all others the most noble and
honorable, so those who make profession of bearing arms, notwithstanding for
the most part, they be menquellers, and most wicked, usurp, not only the
name and title of valorous, but also of honest men: as though it were all one,
to be valiant with arms in hand, and be an honest man: but as it is false,
that one wicked by being valorous may be good, so is it as falfe, that he may
be termed a man of valor. Signior Guilio Caesare confirmd this saying, and the
Count Scandiano, doubted after this manner: You signior Hercules, amongst the
principal properties of Nobility, have placed, not only renown of
auncesters, but also of Country: as though the property of ancient and famous
blood, were not sufficient, notwithstanding one were borne in a small village,
to illustrate and make noble a progeny: but if we turn over ancient and
modern Records, we shall find most noble and famous families, to have taken
their original, in base and humble place: and to discourse somewhat further,
the same heaven covers all things, and heateth them; the self sun
illuminateth; and to man of al other creatures most excellent, there is not
limited one earthly habitation only as to the other, but through divine favor
the whole world, he being in his life time an inhabiter of the whole earth;
and being worthy, after death to be a citizen of heaven: wherefore good
Diogenes demanded of what country he was, a citizen of the world, answered
he: minding to infer, that not a man's country, but virtue administreth honor
and glory, and that a man ought to boast, not of his country, but only of
virtue: the which of it self is sufficient, to illustrate the obscurest
country whatsoever, as Anacharsis the Scithian Philosopher expresses very
well, who to a foolish Athenian, that objected unto him the baseness of his
country, answered: My base country I by virtue ennoble, and thou thy country
noble, obscurest by vice: And we read, that the virtue of Homer, moved
emulation amongst seven of the principal cities of Graecia, each of them
vaunting, that he was borne their original citizen, doing this for no other
cause, but to make themselves famous, with the renown of this man's virtue:
by which it is manifest, that the virtuous man gives, and receives not honor
from his country: As I believe therefore the definition of nobility would be
much more perfect, if it wanted this clause: notwithstanding I expect that you
lay open my error.

And Varano: As Nature and GOD have made manne Lord of the earth, and citizen
of the world, so has he not in the globe of the whole earth, one place more
then another, appropriate for his birth, and habitation; in that as experience
teaches, he might live, and inhabit in all places: notwithstanding by fortune
he has his birth more in one, then in another, and the place where he is
borne and nourished, we call his country, and native soil: A man therefore by
nature is a citizen of the world, and by fortune of the land and province
where he was borne: neither can it be denied also that cities and places of a
land, are greatly different, as also I will not here move consideration, of
diversity of climates, which (as appears also in unreasonable creatures)
ordinarily make wonderful difference, in the stature and complexion of the
body, and affections of mind, as the Philosopher affirms, speaking of the
nature of the people of Asia, and Greece: but diversity of laws, manners, and
customs, are such, as what in one city seems unjust, and impious, in
another is admitted, as honest, and just: which being true, we must of
necessity confess, that one borne, and nourished in a city built and
augmented by men heroycall, grounded by excellent laws, where prudence,
sapience, and all other liberal arts, are practiced, is reputed much more
virtuous, then another borne and brought up in a country, where barbarous
laws, uncivil customs, and no other arts be professed and practiced, but
those mechanical, and base: with which reason moved, the Philosopher said,
that Barbarians never were, nor could be called, perfectly noble. Country
therefore imports so greatly, as without the glory of it, no perfect
nobility can be framed; I say perfect, because he may also be called noble,
who is descended of ancient and virtuous parentage, although in mean and
humble place. You have so well resolved my doubt (said Scandiano) as that I
cannot but reply, and confess that honor of country, is necessary to perfect
nobility. Signior Varano, must needs satisfy me also (said Guirino) for it
will not sink into my head, that Nobility is an extern all good, or of
fortune, especially he having assirmed, that nobility is ever joined with
virtue; the which virtue, as it is neither of Fortune, nor by Fortune, the
Philosopher so teaching, so can it not be an eternal good: For virtue being an
habit, and perfection of our mind, it cannot but be numbered amongst those
goods, which in us be intrinsecate: loose therefore my doubt, and this your
manifest contradiction. And Varano: Signior Guirino propounds an excellent
problem, whether nobility be in the number of those goods internal, or that
it be external, and of Fortune: and to show the dexterity of his singular wit,
as though he conceived not the truth, he concludes by our own position, that
nobility is not a good external, nor of Fortune, we having affirmed that in it
virtue, as also other points precious and honorable were contained. To which
we easily make answer, if we shall but consider what before I have said, for
it is true, that nobility may be placed amongst those goods of Fortune, as that
which happneth beyond the intention of Nature, and is by the Philosopher
numbered among those goods which are not in our selves: for although it have
original from virtue, yet depends it not of the only virtue of him that
possesses it, but rather of the virtue of his many predecessors, which is
truly that, that produces glory in him noble, being termed Nobility.
Whereupon as the virtue of the most guttering sunne-beames, is of force to make
things obscure visible, so the virtue of many discendants of a most bright
beam, may illustrate an obscure lineage, how hase or vile soever; and as the
sunne-beames are not in the thing illumined, as in proper object, so the glory
of predecessors is not in him noble, as in his particular subject, but he,
together with others of the same blood, dof enjoy the resplendant brightness
of their predecessors. Is Nobility (replied Guirino) be a virtue of stock or
kind, a the Philosopher says, and depends on antiquity of blood, we
receiving blood from the bodies of our predecessors, I cannot see how it
should rather be a gift of Nature, then Fortune, being to be recounted rather
among those goods within our selves, then amongst other external. And Varano:
A man noble is begotten, by Nature, seed, and Fortune: for Fortune is no other,
but a concourse of diverse causes, whereof the most near, is a cause
undetermined: Man, as man, is derived from nature and seed: but in respect of
nobility, from Fortune for it is a thing contingent, and no ways known unto
Nature, that a man should be borne, whose predecessors have been renowned
and glorious.

Tell me in earnest (added Guirino) is it not the intention of nature to make
man, as all other things, in such perfection, as that he may easily attain
his proper end. This proposition (said Varano) is necessary and always true,
that nature guides by infallible providence, makes ever the best of all
things, if she be not hindered. And Guirino: If therefore in him noble, there
is greater perfection then in all other conditions, and that Nature always
intends that perfect, me thinks, it necessarily follows, that he should
be borne Noble, not by Fortune, but by intention of Nature, and consequently,
that Nobility is the gist of Narure, and not of Fortune.

You may perceive Signior Guirino (said Varano) that this your conclusion is
not necessary: for all propositions of a syllogism, are not ever true and
necessary: for though in him Noble, greater perfection is supposed then in
others, yet many times the contrary falls out, as every day experience
plainly teaches, and therefore I deservedly found fau^t with Mutius his
definition, that is, that Nobility is not the perfection of every thing in his
kind, but rather, an inward supposition of virtue, as has bin said, which
depends on the glory and fame of his predecessors.

Guirino replied no further: And Count Hanib all Turcho: You, Signior Hercole,
if I carry well in mind, said: that he cannot be noble, who is not borne
legitimate, if that were true, in would follow, that the son of a noble father
and mother, might be ignoble, this seeming inconvenient: for if it be true,
that Nobility, as the Philosopher affirms, is a virtue of kind, it has
original from seed, and not from marriage: for marriage in respect of nature,
is a thing accidental, neither can it augment or diminish perfection in seed;
and to stand upon natural example, as to generate a courageous horse, it
suffices to put together a noble Stallion, and a goodly Mare: so to make one
noble, without other marriage, the union of a noble man, and woman, shall be
sufficient. And Varano: Although matrimony is not essential, having respect
to generation, and that the union of male and female suffices, yet is it
necessary, for the framing of one perfectly noble: considering that one
perfectly noble is he, that has had all his predecessors renouned, and famous,
as also with vice immaculate: In that therefore it cannot be denied, but the
bastard has had his father and mother, contaminate, with the vice of
intemperance, as those who came together contrary to honesty, and repugnant
to that, the laws both divine, and humane command, although many of his
predecessors were noble, yet must he needs confess, that himself is not
perfectly noble: but that he wants an ounce of arriving to perfect nobility:
and I say perfect nobility, because it is not denied, but that bastards also
may have some part in nobility, and in virtue be like to their grandfathers,
and great grandfathers.

And if bastards were legitimate (added Count Haniball) should they not supply
the ounce they want, and become perfectly noble? Wise Lawgiuers (said Varano)
to avoid the vice of intemperance, having deprived bastards, as well from
succession of their fathers goods, as of any other good of fortune, being
those, who contrary to the disposition of the laws and commandments of God,
were begotten, it was provided to mitigate severity of law, that by chief
Princes, who be the laws superiors, they might by privilege be admitted to
succession. So that legitimation may make them capable of riches, but not of
perfect nobility I am satisfied, said Count Haniball: And Count Hercules
Beuelacqua: I have seen, said he, while I was in the French Court, privileges
of nobility given by that king, to persons ignoble, yet deserving well of the
crown of France; as also, other men most noble, to be deptiued of nobility,
for their contrary demerites, how which should be done, I cannot see, if
nobility were restrained to those families, who pretend themselves descended
of ancient blood: declare unto us therefore, if Princes may give, or take away
from another nobility. And Varano: It is a conclusion approved by Doctors of
the law, that Princes by their authority, may not only give nobility by
writing, and privileges, but may also secretly give unto another those degrees,
which appertain to men noble, by inuesting him with some noble infeofment, as
also that it is in their power, to deprive nobles of their degrees of
nobility. And Bartolo, a principal doctor, writes: that if a man should live
a thousand years replenished with chief virtue, yet could he never be noble,
while by the Prince, some dignity or nobility, were bestowed on him, by which
he might be distinguished, from the common people: Notwithstanding, I am of
opinion, that this Doctor, together with others, have greatly etred: and in no
other respect, but that speaking and discussing of nobility, they have never
defined it, but confounded it with titles, magistracies, dignities, and other
preemenencies; all which be parts of honor, and rewards of those actions,
which depend on the virtue, of one alone: And I cannot but wonder at Mutius, a
man certainly both learned, and judicial: who, after having confounded diverse
kinds of nobility, moves this question, who is more noble, he that is
descended of ancieut blood, or another enobled, by his Prince? and he answers
it by these formal words: If the Prince give nobility to another for true
testimonial of virtue, he shall be most noble: but if it be placed through
humor, or appetite, he borne of ancient blood, shall be more honorable: we must
therefore affirm according to Mutius, that to be noble and worthy of honor, is
the selfsame, being most false: for virtuous actions, and not nobility, is
worthy of honor: and if nobility be honored, it is not in respect of it
self, but as it is presumed, that she is with virtue conjoined: But if to be
noble, is a thing diverse from being worthy of honor, who sees not, that
Mutius in his demand, has begun (as in proverb we say) a gallon pot,
and turning the wheel, like an unskillful potter, has finished a cruse: But
leaving Mutius, with all the other Doctors of the law, in their confused
Chaos, I affirm that a Prince, how great soever, cannot give nor take away
nobility, if it be such as either we have, or ought to be defined.

A Prince may well give titles, magistracy, enfeofments, place, dignity, and
other such like most special honors, but he can never effect, that one borne
of the vulgar sort, should be descended from illustrous family, nor that he
noble, by the renown of his predecessors, should be borne of base and ignoble
parents, although he dishonored him never so much. In your foundations (added
Count Hercole) you discuss, as though yours were the true definition of
Nobility, which neither Mutius, nor the other doctors by you named, would ever
grant you, for they understand this term nobility, much more amply, then
does that Greek word Euguenia sound: If they should not believe me (said
Varano) yet would they give credit to authority of their Emperors, seeing
Frederick the second, who beside his dignity had the name to be greatly
learned, demanded what nobility was: made answer, ancient riches, and excellent
customs: as also Sigismond the most wise Emperor, whom a man of the vulgar
sort, by him very well esteemed, entreating that he would create him noble,
made this answer, I may make you rich, and grant you all manner of immunitie,
but noble I can no ways precure you to be. Leaving authority, and coming to
reason, either nobility is in the world from other things distant, or else
with others the self same, as with virtue, riches, praise, honor, and with
other goods internal, or external. If it be the selfsame with others, then is
the distinct discussion thereof superfluous: If it be from them separate and
apart, as particular treaty is necessrrie, so is it as behoouefull to find
out desinitions, and essentially differences, by which the nature there of may
be known, to be from other things different.

The definition being given, conformable to the doctrine of the Philosopher, is
such, as that it shows this excellence which we term Nobility, to be of
different nature from all other goods and properties, therefore it is
sufficient and good. But the definition of Mutius and other Doctors, can
neither be blamed, nor commended, they never having defined, or given any sign
thereof, whereby we might distinguish it from virtue, praise, and honor, but
have so obscured it, with the colors of other things, as that there is no
sight so quick, which is able to comprehend it. Me thinks (said Count
Hercole) that from Mutius, which I have also seen, the definition of Nobility
may very well be drawn: for he affirming that Noble signifies one worthy
to be known, it may be said, that Nobility is a good, which makes another
man worthy to be known.

See you not (answered Varano) that by this definition, virtue, riches, hnor,
and other goods, which make another man worthy to be known, are not a whit
distinguished from Nobility, which the Philosopher shows, saying, That there
be three sorts of Citizens in a Commonwealth, worthy to be known, those be
the rich, noble, and virtuous, and there is no doubt, but one may be rich,
popular, and virtuous, and yet not well borne: and for all this, he shall be
worthy to be known. But to return to our purpose, they greatly abuse
themselves, who baselie borne, grow proud of received Nobility, as though
the authority of the prince had made them regenerate and borne anew. But what
say you of the Nobility, added count Hercole, which the Signiory of Venice
usually gives to them, that have performed any singular benefit to their
commonwealth? is not that true Nobility? as they did to Giacomo Cauallo, of
Verona, who was created a noble man of Venice, with all his posterity, for the
egregious virtue, and valorous attempts, that he performed, in that most
dangerous war they had with the Genowayes at Chioggia, and together with
him for the self same occasion, they made thirty pleibean families of the
City of Venice noble: ennobling those that then lived, as all their d^scendants
perpetually: and they being the first, were gentlemen, without attending any
third or fourth generation. If Giacomo Cauallo were in his own City noble
(said Varano) he acquired not nobility in the Venetian Common-welth, but by
being made a member of that commonwealth unto which he was vassaile, he
attained some title and preeminence of great honor and benefit, in that he
like other Gentlemen, might stand for all honors, magistracies, and dignity.
And by the reasons above, by us alleged, those first who of common people
were made noble, were truly honored: but yet not ennobled with true and
perfect nobility: whereupon they were rather a beginning of Nobility to their
posterity, then truly noble: and to conclude, Princes may by their authority,
give beginning of Nobility to a family, as likewise of disgrace and
ignobilitie, and especially, when through desert of virtue they honor good men,
and for vice, reproach those wicked. Your conclusion (said count Hercules) is
so comfortable to truth, as I am out of al doubt. I have good cause to doubt
also (said Count Guido Calcag.) neither will it ever sink into my head, that
nobility (as Varano has set down) is in the kind of good things, being rather
to be nu^bred amongst those evil, which hinder felicity: in that nobility in
him noble, does no less poison and corrupt his sweetest contentments, then an
other may be, who is rejected. Behold a fine paradox (said Varano.) That is a
padox (replied Calcgnini) which is not with sound reason accompanied: for how
can that be a good, which depriueth of liberty, and binds with hard knots of
servitude? and who sees not that nobility is such, seeing he noble, can
neither do nor say any thing without consent of nobility? he being continually
enjoined, to his great discontentme^t, to speak, walk, stand still, be
apparrelled, use wealth, and to perform all his operations not as he would,
but in such sort as his nobility urges him, with having an eye ever to
decorum, and not to obscure the glory of his predecessors: the which cannot by
ignobilitie be affirmed, in that full of most pleasant liberty, it gives
license to the ignoble to live not only after his own mind, but liscentiously
to cease upon al those contentments, which beast please him, without having
respect, to time, place, or the dignity of his predecessors. To this truth,
these illustrous Princes, most noble Ladies, and honorable Knights, will
readyly give testimony, who never more sweetly taste their delights, then when
dispoyling them selves of that prosopopeia which this beast of nobility
carries about with her, they are apparrelled with that liberty, which to
pleasing and iocund ignobilitie is ever annexed: From hence it proceeds, that
to us gentlemen in Carneuale time, masking is so acceptable, in that at our
own pleasure, we may transform our selves, sometimes into the habit of a
porter, other whiles, of a country man, and sometimes into any other person
more base and vile, taking incredible pleasure, in immitating their speech and
gate, and practicing their mechanical and licentious customs, sometimes
freeing our selves from the insolency of servants and boys, which continually
run gaping at our tails, we prove how sweet it is to go alone, now running,
then leaping, sometimes skipping, by and by laughing: as also that we may
enter into any place, without being noted, and execute any knaueries. Surely if
we well consider, we shall find, that this glory which is termed nobility,
is no other but a light, which makes the defects of men noble to every man's
eye apparent. How many may we say, have bin, and are the men of base
condition, who have run a life no less brutish and dissolute, then
Sardanapalus Lidiane, Philopater Acgiptian, Heliogabalus and Comodus roman
Emperors, and yet having been of base quality, by the eye of the world, they
have not been discovered: whereas on the contrary, of the intemperate, and
vicious life of those in noble estate, books and whole volumes be replenished.
But what say you of nobility, she being found (as many times it happens)
coupled with poverty? what burden is more intolerable?

The poor gentleman, not content with that which is necessary for sustentation
of humane life, superfluous things wanting, where with nobility is puffed up
in pride, he yerneth inwardly, and grieuing a thousand times a day, at his
noble birth (as he that is ashamed, to apply himself to base course of life)
languisheth in great misery: whereas contrariwise the poor mechanical man,
accustomed to labor, and an homely life, no whit careful for things
superfluous, by art or mechanical industry, preparing those only, which are
sufficient for humane living, leads a pleasant and contented life: many other
reasons might be produced, to show, that nobility, is rather in the kind of
things wicked, then good, which not to appear a Rhethoritian, I will pass
over: being well assured, that there is not any of these most noble gentlemen,
which to themselves are not privy, of the truth of this my conclusion, and
that repent not themselves a thousand times the day, to have been noble borne.
It befitteth not (signiour Count) answered Varano, your noble mind, nor these
most gentle creatures, which here give care round about us, to enter into so
sinister opinion: For Nobility is not only, not to be recounted amongst things
wicked, but is a most precious good, by all qualities and conditions of men,
honored and esteemed, and so far off is it from depriving of liberty, that
rather it reaches a helping hand to deliver from servitude, there being no
greater servitude then vice, as before I have said, and the Divines affirm,
Nobility as a most clear seeming glass reflecting continually on the eyes of
him noble, the glory of his ancestors valor inuiteth to illustrate his mind
with virtue, to resemble them, as also to shun vice. Whereupon Q. Fabius Maximus
and Scipio were wont to say, that beholding the Images of their predecessors,
they found their mind wonderfully inflamed unto virtue. I confess signior
Conte, that Nobility is a clear lamp, which causes wicked actions, no less
than good to appear, and in this respect, is principally worthy to be placed
in the kind of things good, for she spurreth and enflameth unto virtue, as
well with fear of infamy, as with hope of commendation, wherefore this glory
of Nobility not discovering it self, in the operations of them ignoble, they
want this prick of fear and reproach, neither think they themselves bound to
proceed further then that their predecessors have performed: and to men noble
it seems great opproby, not to attain at least to the bounds, set down
unto them by their first founders, and therefore in a manner it always falls
out, that in arms, and virtuous actions, the most singular and excellent men,
be of nobility: For Nature has inserted a certain secret virtue, in the seed
of all things, which gives them force and property, to be like the beginning,
from whence they are derived: The which is manifested, by that we every day
see in men, who are borne of shape and proportion, not only like to their
fathers, but also resembling many times, their grandfathers and great
grandfathers.

The like is perceived also in the race of horses, bullocks, and other
creatures, as further even in trees, that the boughs and branches do always
in a manuer resemble the stock and trunk of the tree: And if at any time they
degenerate, it proceeds from the Husbandmans negligence. The like whereof
happens to men, who being borne, if with good education they be manured,
are always in virtue like those from whom they do proceed, and oftentimes
better too. But if they want good pruners, and those that of them should have a
care, they become wild and savage, never bringing forth good fruit: I grant
also, that nobility in the end sinketh under that ponderous weight of poverty;
notwithstanding, if he noble, together with riches, has not wholly lost his
generositie of mind, there can not want means, and honorable courses for his
raising up, three of which, in my opinion, are of great moment; one is, by
consecrating himself to God, and even as he by fortune is abandoned, so with
heroycall virtue, to show himself a contemner of the world and fortune:
another is, by dedicating himself to the honorable service of princes: the
third is, by practicing the most noble profession Military. And there is no
doubt, but that he noble, has ever a special advantage over him ignoble,
although in virtue they be equal. For, if there should be two men, who had not
by good or bad actions, given any former trial of themselves, presently as it
is known that the one is nobly borne, and the other not, with every one he
ignoble shall be less esteemed, than the other, noble; and it is necessary,
that one ignoble, by many endeavors, and in long time, imprint in the mind of
men, a good opinion of himself, which the other in a moment, and only by being
a Gentleman, has acquired. All the standers by, confirmed this opinion of
Signior Hercole. And Count Palla Strozzi, seeing that Calcagnino replied no
further, I would willingly understand, said he, from whence this word Gentleman
has had his original; as also if it be alone, to be noble, and to be a
genileman: in that by these last words you uttered, wherein you confound these
terms, it seen eth they are the self same things. Notwithstanding I see many,
who though of mean quality, yet being but well apparelled, they profess
gentilitie; and ever they confirm their speeches, by swearing by the faith of
a Gentleman, this making me doubtful, and sometimes absolutely to believe,
that to call a Gentleman does not properly signify noble, but rather, and
honest man, and of gentle customs. And Varauo: Touching your first demand, I
am of opinion, that this word Gentle was derived from the Latin, as also the
greater part of those terms, which in our vulgar tongue we commonly use: For
gentle, among the Latins, signifies as much as, of the selfsame family; and
in like manner, they were called gentle, who had the selfsame name, as we read
in Cicero, who speaking of Tullius Hostilius, calls him gentle, and writes
in his Topickes, that they be gentle, who amongst themselves are of one name,
and have their original from free men, whose predecessors have never endured
servitude. Whereupon we may gather, that this word gentle, agrees with no
other, but with persons of noble families: And therefore I judge, that this
word, which in old time signified thus much, that this man was noble,
together with him of such a family, and these men were noble with those of
another family, enlarging now somewhat his signification, generally notes
unto us, that one noble is somewhat more, and as amongst them they were called
gentle, who descended of noble family, so now those noble are called
Gentlemen: so that we may conclude, the name of gentleman to be proper to him
noble, and that to one ignoble it can no ways be applied. To the second
demand, notwithstanding, Dant, Petrarch, and Boccace, have indifferently used
these two terms, Noble and Gentle: yet do I make some difference betwixt them,
and hold opinion, that the name of gentleman has a far more restrained
signification than this word, noble, and that a gentleman is he, who by the
Philosopher is called Geneos, as much as to say, governors, in whom appears,
not only the virtue of kind, but also that of his proper self: for though as
I said, the name gentle is proper to him noble, yet without virtue, he shall
ever be an unworthy possessor thereof: and therefore I thus conclude, that the
man noble without virtue, and he virtuous without nobility, can never properly
be termed a gentleman. Then, as your conclusion stands with reason (said
Strozza) so do I conjecture, that the number of true Gentlemen is very small,
whereas on the contrary the multitude of them is infinite, who usurp this
title: (being not only men noble vicious, and the ignoble virtuous, but also,
whosoever by mean of wealth can live idly, although he be most ignoble and
vicious, professes himself a gentleman, so that if any man should object unto
him, Thou art not a Gentleman, presently, as if he had received some notable
injury, he would make answer with the lie: neither would he refuse combat
upon this quarrel, as being persuaded, that he fought in a just cause. Your
opinion, said Varano, is conformable to that the Philosopher says, which is,
that all men, in words, usurp virtue, and nobility, but of such as be truly
noble and good, there is not twenty, in any one place, to be found. This
demand of Count Palla, pleased all the knights and gentlemen very well: and the
answer, thereunto, of Varano, was highly commended. When Caualiere Gualing:
You hitherto Signior Hercules, have so plentifully and particularly discoursed
of nobility, as from this day forward we may think that there remains not
any thing further, which upon this argument can be produced: yet for all this
shall I not be fully satisfied, if you set not down, some distinct
insormation of the degrees of Nobility: for that is no true nor sufficient
cause, of ones being more noble than another, in that the antiquity and
number of his predecessors is the greater, as in the beginning it appears you
would have inferred: for being so, it would follow, that a private gentleman,
whose blood were more ancient, than that of a King, or Duke, should then
either king or duke be more noble: the which as an inconvenience to some, would
never be yielded you. I desire you therefore touching this point to run over
the degrees of nobility Varano made answer, It appears to be a subject
proper unto the Ciuilians, for a part of justice, being conversant in in
distributing punishments, rewards, and honors, it is requisite that the
Ciuilians understand distinctly, and discuss of degrees of nobility, to the
end that with geometrical and equal proportion, they may confer their
dignities, titles, and preeminences, whereof Nobility seems principally
worthy. Notwithstanding, to give you satisfaction, building upon my
foundations: I divide nobility into five degrees or orders. The first
ascending, is them noble, who having taken original of riches and indifferent
virtue, never increased nor diminished, are called private Gentlemen. The
second is, of those who are honored further with noble enfeofments, as also
with jurisdiction and title of Counts. The third have equal jurisdiction, with
title somewhat more eminent, and are called Marquesses. The fourth is the
dignity of Dukes: the fifth and highest is that of Kings. These degrees, have
amongst themselves like proportion of nobility, as in them of virtue there is
supposed. Seeing honors and prerogatives, are imparted to nobility
correspondent to the virtue, which in their kind is presumed to be: the first
degree therefore grounded on indifferent virtue, is iuferior to all the rest:
and the last, wherein virtue heroycall is supposed, being that of kings (called
for the same reason by Homer, shepherds of people) is most superior: the
other three be part inferior, part superior: seeing the second more noble
then the first, must give place to the third, fourth, and fifth: the third
superior to the first and second, shall give preeminence to the fourth and
fifth, the fourth, before the other three inferiors, shall yeede preeminence to
the fifth.

If I conceive you rightly (added Gualinguo) you would say that private
Gentlemen must give place to Countes, Counts to Marquesses, Marquesses to
Dukes, Dukes to Kings, and this stands with reason. Although in Germany it
may be through abuse, Countes go before Marquesses: as also in the kingdom
of Naples, Princes before dukes. To this title of Prince (said Varano) I have
ascribed no particular degree of nobility, considering it is an attribution to
al great Lords, and that distinguishes not one pote^tate from another, but the
prince from his subjects: and if it be particularly ascribed, it agrees as
seems, to the eldest sons of kings and Dukes: I believe also (said Gualinguo)
that not without some special reason, you have omitted the principallest degree
of Nobility, whereunto all those noble, and most noble, do willingly give
place, and that is the degrees of the Emperor and Pope. The Emperor as
Emperor, and the hie priest as Pope, cannot concur (answered Varano) with
the definition of nobility, nor make any order of nobility: and I say, as
Emperor, or Pope: For there is no impediment, but that one chosen Emperor, or
Pope, may come of royal and most noble stock, which may manifestly appear
unto you, seeing a man brings nobility from his mothers womb, but so can he
not bring with him, either the Empire, or Popedom, each of these degrees being
disposed by election and not by succession: but a man may be borne, a Marquis,
a Duke, or a King, speaking of such principalities and kingdoms as come by
succession. And though Emperors go before Kings, and the Pope not only before
Kings, but also, before the Emperor himself: of this, nobility is not the
cause, but their dignity, the which notes in those subjects so great
excellency of virtue as is worthy of all supereminencie. How can it be,
replied Gualinguo, but if the Emperor and Pope, have prerogative to distribute
the greatest titles of nobility, considering they may make, Counties,
Marquesses, Dukes and Kings, that they should not be noble, yea and most noble
themselves? And Varano: I proved unto you by lively reasons, that no Prince,
how mighty soever, can give nobility, although he may adorn, and amplify it,
with titles, enfeosments, and honors, which be the rewards, not so much of
nobility, as virtue: but if I should grant you, that the Emperor or Pope,
might make an other man noble, yet could you not conclude for this, that they
were to be recounted in the number of those noble: for the Sun also is of
power to produce heat in these inferior bodies, yet the Sun (if we will
give credit to the Philosopher) is not hot himself. Very well (said Gual.) I
now understand you, your meaning is, that the Emperor and be noble virtually,
but not formally (to use these scholastical terms) which has no other
signification, but that they in one sort more excellent the those noble
themselves, possess nobility, as they that have the authority to create and
augment Nobility: and for this I rest satisfied, although I desire yet to
understand somewhat further, whether in every one of these orders of
nobility, there be degrees of more and less, or if all those that are of the
self same degree and order, be equally noble: so that amongst them no
precedence occurreth. In that those noble of the selfsame order, (answered
Varano) when they meet together, cannot set all upon one seat, nor be
comprehended in one place and circuit, being necessary, that one must needs
sit on the right hand, another on the left, one above, and another underneath:
so is it requisite for the giving of due place to every one, that some
circumstances of better and worse, be considered, which circumstance and
difference for all this, shall not be specificall, nor change the nature or
substance of the thing, but rather be universal and general, to all the orders
of Nobility: And surely it is very convenient, that amongst private
gentlemen, there be no account at al made of this difference, or precedence:
for besides the decency for young men to give place to the elders, it is further
liberal education, and noble courtesy, for one Gentleman to honor another,
laboring ever to assign him the superior place, but amongst great princes,
there is special returning made of it, and often times question is moved,
touching preeminence. And what is the difference? (said Gualinguo.)

In my judgment (answered Varano) the differences are of two sorts, which in all orders of Nobility, be worthy to be equally counterpeased, and whereunto
in all reason, preeminence is to be given: one is, antiquity of blood, that is,
the number of worthy predecessors, the other is, that Nobility which is termed
the four discentes, that is, of those who descend from four generations, not
only of men, but also of women noble, and this kind of nobility is so highly
esteemed in Spain, as that the Catholic King gives the Knighthoode or order
of Saint James, to none but such noble, as besides the demerite of their own
proper virtue, prove also this lineal discention* Gualinguo replied no more,
and signior Hercules now weary of discoursing, thinking he had sufficiently
satisfied the Queens commandment, would have given place to some other
recreation, and contentment; but the Queen beckened to Signior Antonio
Barisano called the Greek, to come before her, who being arrived that day,
stood by in a corner of the room to hear this argument, and smiling
commanded him, that he also should move some doubt, and oppugn Signior
Hercules. This man is an honorable Citizen of Scio, who after the Turks
occupying of that Island, not being able to endure the hard servitude of these
Barbarians, came into Italy, and known in Ferrara for one learned, he was
entertained by his highness, with a stipend, and had the public reading of the
greek tongue committed unto him: and further, being of pleasant and iocund
conversation, as one that takes great delight in facet iestes, being audatious
to utter his opinion in any argument, he is therefore most acceptable to all
the nobility of the city, but especially to women: having therefore done
duty to the Queen, he spoke after this sort. It were easy for me (most
famous Queen) it having been very doubtful, to contradict, whatsoever has
been delivered by signior Hercules, but because it wants not much of supper
time, I will only allege, how I cannot tolerate, that women, being most
imperfect creatures, should have any part in nobility, as he rather like a
sicophant and slatterer, then a sincere approouer of truth, without any shame
at all has affirmed; he to himself knowing very well, that he speaks both
against reason, and common use: which acknowledge nobility from no other but
the man, and that deservedly: for the female (if the philosopher be worthy of
credit) is no other then an imperfect male, framed through the error of nature:
who intends ever to fashion male, and a woman compared to a man, has the
like proportion, as there is, betwixt sense, and reason; and to argue somewhat
more effectually, it is a thing certain, and by the same philosopher affirmed,
that in generation of man, male gives form, and female matter: this
conclusion also in all universities is received, that al deformity, and
imperfection, in any thing generate, proceeds from matter, as on the
contrary, all good properties depend on form: neither for any other respect,
are incorporeal substances excellenter than those corporeal, but that these
with matter are conioynd, and the other from it altogether separate; which
being true, how can it be affirmed, that a woman, who by administering matter,
is the cause of al imperfection, should give to a man the least shadow of
nobility? That a woman has no part in nobility, and that she wholly depends
on the man, the laws and records of Roman Emperors do confirm: and amongst
other, there is a text in Vlpine, where we read, that husbands bring their
wives, excellent dignity, as also their fathers do the like, while they com
to be married with men of common sort: besides this, there is a record of
Antony, that the women born of Consolar, or Pretorian fathers may retain the
gentilitie of their stock, being married to noble men, and not of private
condition, as also there is another testimonial of Valente and Valentino, that
wives may be honorable, though ignoble, and be enobled according to the
nobility of their husbands, but afterward, if they take an husband of meaner
condition, deprived of their dignity, they follow the quality of their
husbands: who sees not that from these laws and records, a most infalible
conclusion may be drawn, that women have not any part in nobility: but follow
the nobility and quality of man, as the shadow does the body: So that of
themselves if they have no nobility, how can they place it upon an other?
Wherefore Signior Hercules, laying aside adulation, and the over great desire
you have of their grace, and favor, sincerely confess the truth, and exclude
women, as most imperfect creatures, from this esteemed and embraced condition,
which we call Nobility: Signior Barisano (most excellent Queen) (said Varano)
putting confidence in a poetical and vain fable, that women naturally love
where they are not beloved, and esteem greatly of such as contemn them, by
rejecting women openly, labors to satisfy the great desire he has of them
to be beloved and regarded: But as in censuring the natural dispositions of
women, he is deceived, and as he boldly produces slander for truth, so hope
I, that in vain he desires their grace and favor: I affirm therefore, that
women most beautiful and perfect creatures, may, not only enoble themselves,
but further with their proper virtue, make another partaker of Nobility, and
that they, as to form man, so to accomplish him entirely noble, are most
necessary: I yield that nobility principally depends on man; but so I add
withal: that the nobility of a woman so greatly imports, as that he cannot
be counted perfectly noble, who shall be borne of a base woman: neither will I use
any other arms in subduing you, then your own: For it is true, that in the
seed of man, life is potentially contained, which is form: and blood in the
womans womb is the matter, whereof the body is formed, so that the soul from
man, and the body from woman, have their original: But further also I auerre,
that if noble form, shall be brought to noble matter the thing compou^ded will be
perfectly noble: but if the matter be base, notwithstanding the form be noble,
the compou^d will not be absolutely noble, but shall want one degree of nobility
being that of matter. Tell me in earnest, signior Antonio would you not more
respect theimage of Caesar in gold, then the same, and by the self same hand,
engraven in lead, or brass? and this would you do, neither for the form which
is is the same, nor in respect of the artificer being alone, but only for the
matter which is more beautiful, and excellent. I grant you that material, and
corporal things be less excellent then those immaterial and corporeal: as also
that matter is a cause of imperfection, as she is the subject of alteration,
transmutation, and instabilite in things not permanent; notwithstanding
comparing of the material and corruptible things one with another, they which
have more pure, and better disposed matter, do questionless prove the much
more worthy and excellent things; which the Philosopher here confirms,
saying, that in all things wherein matter is required, the better matter
shall be the more beautiful, and excellent will they fall out: and to prosecute
their purpose, if it be true, that the soul follows the temperature of the
body, as the learneder sort affirm, and as we our selves have experience, how
can you deny, that the temperature of the body, given by woman, should not be
of great moment to the framing of nobility, as well as celestial influence,
seeing the mind, if it have a body evil tempered, and inclined to vice, can
hardly be resplendant by those virtues, whereupon nobility is grounded: You
cannot deny, and I know it assuredly, but that the body made by woman, has
part in nobility (although it administreth matter) seeing we perceive, that
daily from the qualities of the body, as from manifest caracters and
demonstrations, we usually prognosticate another man's conditions, in that the
shape, countenance, gestures, and motions of the body, many times procure us to
know a man or a woman, not so much as ever seen by us before, to be noble, or
ignoble. You say, that woman is an imperfect man; admit I should grant you
this, which notwithstanding is false, yet would I affirm that this
imperfection is not substantial, but accidental: for the Philosopher
intends not, that she should be less reasonable, then man; but calls her,
imperfect man, in that she wants but one thing only to be man, and this thing
is of no importance to humane perfection: so that as the being more then woman,
gives not perfection to man, so does not the being less then man, bring
imperfection to woman: although I think it as far off from truth, that woman
is a defect of nature, or formed against her intention, as I judge it false and
untrue, that nature minds not the preservation of humane kind, which no
less by woman, then by man, is made perpetual: whereof the philosopher
aduising himself, in the selfsame book, he adds, that nature, inteutiue to
universal good, with special providence, fashioneth, sometimes male, and
sometimes female. The defects of nature, be no other but monsters, and seldom
are produced; women are so far off from being monsters, that of all things
under heaven, there is not any one more excellent or beautiful; who not
seldom, and in small number, but in far greater multitude then men, are
produced into the world, through singular grace and favor, of loving and
gentle nature, and by the author himself of nature. Confess therefore your
offense, signior Antonio, and demand pardon; for your Vlpian in those imperial
records by you cited, shall not be sufficient to mittigate the least dram of
those punishments, which from these Ladies hang over your head, in defense of
whom against the laws and records by you alleged, I will introduce the
authority of Virgil, and a decree, of the most prudent Venetian commonwealth,
for manifestation, how great a portion women have in nobility, Virgil speaking
of Dranes, says: This man his noble raca, by mother took most sure,
For by the fathers side, base was he, and obscure.
Who sees not, that by these verses, Virgil intends, that women should, not
only have a part in nobility, but further, that by themselves they are
sufficient to give noble descent. The Venetian decree, commands, that the
sons of a base woman, although borne in lawful matrimony, shall not be
accepted to the trial of nobility, neither in any sort be admitted to their
magistracies, and councels; those most prudent and noble Signiors imagining (as
truly they may) that without the nobilite, and generositie of mothers,
nobility in children cannot be preserved immaculate. If women, added the
Greek, be incapable of those virtues, that make men noble, and famous, how can
it be, that they should have any part in nobility? except peradventure, you
think, that the practice of needle and spindle, deservedly ordained to women,
are amongst all liberal arts, the most noble. And Varano: The needle, and
spindle used of women without avarice, as they are noble and commendable
exercises, so be they no impediment, but that they may proportionably be
capable of al those virtues, as well to customs appertaining, as to the mind
which concur with men: seeing they want none of those faculties, nor any of the
instruments, which the mind imploieth in virtuous operations. But if God and
nature, never made any thing in vain, as all the wise affirm, then we cannot
suppose, that understanding senses as well interior, as exterior, and also the
corpore all instruments that women have like to men, be made in vain, and
that they as well as men, may not use the same instruments for the acquiring of
prudence, knowledge, wisdom; and finally, for the practicing of any liberal
art: therefore the divine Philosopher, in favor of women, in his common wealth,
by lively reason, labors to prove, that women are apt to al those things,
whereunto men accommodate themselves, as also are capable of heroical virtue:
and Plutarch made a book of the virtue and excellency of women And although the
Philosopher affirms, that betwix: women and men there is the like proportion,
as between sense and reason: yet intends he not by this, that a man should
be reasonable, and a woman deprived of reason: but he dilating of domestical
society, minding to infer, that as sense naturally must obey, and reason
command, so in the best government of an house, a woman naturally should obey,
and a man command. And this jurisdiction which a man has over a woman, says
he, ought to be a civil, and not servile dominion: and a little afterward, he
adds, that though a woman have not mortal virtues in that perfection as has
a man, yet notwithstanding, that she also is endued with fortitude, justice,
temperance, and with that prudence, which of it self is sufficient to obey
well, toward him that knows as well how to command. Although women,
replied the Greek, have in them those points by you delivered, yet are they
with so many other evil qualities accompanied, as that hardly they can effect
any thing good. As they that are naturally cold, of bodies tender, soft, and
over delicate, nature having framed them, rather for procreation of man, than
for any other effect: seeing in all other respects, they are but impedime^ts:
therefore Cato said, that if the world could be without woman, our conversation
should be like unto God: this great wise man, by this minding to infer, that
man living in the company of so imperfect a creature, he could not but lead a
miserable life. But that you signior Hercules believe not, that I utter as we
prouerbially say, nothing but wind, and that I am rather a slaunderer, than a
reporter of truth, hear what the Philosopher says, describing the nature of
women: Woman is apt to mourning, lamentation and despair: she is envious,
slanderous, bitter, obstinate, pensive, impudent, a liar, slouthful, fearful,
and easy to be deceived: And the Philosopher in the sixth of his laws
affirms, that feminine sex is so wicked, and by nature so malicious, as that
hardly it can be brought in subjection under the laws. What think you of the
commendations these Philosophers attribute to women? are they not sufficient to
show, how worthy they be, to have any part, or preeminence, in nobility? Defend
them as much as you will, for you shall never make me believe, that of an ass,
may be made a gallant courser. If at this day (answered Varano) al writings
were not replenished, with the praises of women, I would contend with
magnificent phrase to set forth the greatness of their virtue: seeing the
examples of heroical virtue in women, ancient, and of these times, is no less
to be observed, then in men, but considering their commendations are already
well known, it is not now my intention to play the Orator: only as a defender
of equity, I will affirm so much, as may suffice for the brideling of your
maledictions. It is true, and I deny it not, Signior Antonio, that the author
of nature, minding to place, the flower of beauty in women, fashioned them,
with a beautiful, soft, and delicate body, to the end that, together with the
sense of sight, giving delight to feeling, they might inflame in man that
desire which causes eternity: whereupon, as in woman, beauty is a great
ornament, so to be soft and delicate, procures in her no imperfection: but if
that be true which the Philosopher affirms, that those delicate of skin and
flesh, are the more pregnant of wit, we may conclude, that women are more apt
than men, to science, sapience, and all those virtues, which most of al in men
appear. It is also true, that Nature intentive to general preservation, in all
kinds has placed a female sex, and male, or the virtue of the one and other;
but so is it false, that woman is produced to no other end, than for the
fourming of man: for to beget their own likes, is the proper end, of pla^ts
and creatures unreasonable; but of the reasonable creature, felicity is the
proper end, which man in this life can never enjoy without woman, which by
testimony of the Philosopher is confirmed, who in his Oeconomiks says, That
man, as other creatures is not made only to be, but to be well, and therefore
the natural conversation of woman, is necessary for him, not so much to
generate, as from her to receive great benefit, which being true, as doubtless
it is, so shall it be a special heresy to affirm, that a woman is any burden, or
that without the woman our conversation could be happy, for this repugneth to
reason, experience, and to the authority of this great Philosopher, who also
affirms, that the family can not be perfect without woman: and that as a woman
is the half of a family, so be women the half of a City: and further, in
his Economy he says, there can not be any thing more holy, or worthier of a
wise man, than to seek conjunction with an excellent and commendable wife, and
by her to bring forth children: as also that to a man of sincere mind it is no
ways befitting, rashly to converse with every woman, to the end that of a
corrupt wife, he beget not children like their mothers: by which words, it may
easily be imagined how highly the Philosopher esteemed the mothers nobility
and generositie in procreation of children. Further with the authority of
Homer, he affirms, that in this life, there cannot greater felicity befall men,
than when the husband, and wife govern their family with one will and consent.
And Hesiodus contrary to Catoes severity, said, that three things to a man
were Very necessary, an house, a wife, and a yoke of oxen, minding to
testify, that domestical conversation with a woman, was necessary for the
good and happy life of a man. And the Philosopher in his Oeconomikes, says,
that the husband who esteeneth not his wife, is no less ingrate, then he,
which contemns his benefactor: by this inferring, that woman is not only a
comfort, but also to man a special benefit. Seeing the honest and chaste woman
is, not only a companion to her husband in his bed and contentments, but
further, an ease to his labors, in his afflictions, a comfort, in his
infirmities a medicament, full of loving and affectionate servitude, neither
can man, without the assistance of the woman, govern well his house, seeing
whatsoever the man gets abroad, she faithfully disposes and preserves in
the house. But whom will we believe, if we give no credit to experience? Do
not we our selves find, that without women, there is no pleasure or sweet
contentment to be tasted, as they, who with their sweetness, temper the bitter
of this our life, the which without women would be more rusticall and inculte,
then that of the most wild and savage beasts, they remoouing from our hearts,
vile and base thoughts, ease vexations, miseries, and those turbulent cares,
that often accompany us, and with their great beauty, ever representing
before our eyes, the image of divinity, so far off are they from withdrawing us
from worthy enterprises, that rather they stir up our wits, and exalt the^ to
knowledge of greatest and highest things. But this your deprauatio^ is
exceeding great, Signior Antonio, seeing, to procure credit to your
calumniations, you Use the Philosophers authority, in sinister sense, who though
describing the nature of women, he places in the^, the excess of some wicked
inclination, yet does he not altogether free men from them: but which is worse,
you a prodigal dispe^ser of their rebukes, and in their commendations, most
covetous, spend many superfluous words, in discovering their vices,
malignantly concealing their are virtues: and yet your own conscience knows,
that in the same place by you cited, he describes women to be more merciful
than men, better retentiue of memory, more vigilant, more sober: And Plato in
Menone, and in the fifth of his Commonwealth, esteems woman; in a manner equal
in virtue with man, who ordained, that the government of the City, the
magistracies, as well of war, as peace, and all other offices, should be
common betwixt men and women: and the Philosopher, although he esteem not
woman in every respect, equal with man, notwithstanding, proportionable, he
attributes unto them, temperance, justice, and fortitude: but if without
preiudicing truth, I should grant you, that women naturally were inclining to
some vice, I would also affirm, that they are so much the more to be
reco^mended, by how much subduing their wicked inclinations, they live
virtuously. Here Varano stayed: The Greek being about to reply, as he who
wants no words, the lady Tarquinia Molza smiling said, Now for gods sake
proceed no further, Signior Barisano but be contented with what you have
hitherto spoken, in reproach of women, to the end these Ladies, who here round
about attend, deservedly provoked against you, after the manner of Baccides,
make you not a new Orpheus, The Greek laughed and said these Gentlewomen, most
gracious Lady, have rather cause to thank me, than to be offended: For if I
had not contradicted Signior Hercules, they should never have heard so great
commendation, as he has bestowed on them: and I am assured, that the more I
had charged the^ with blame, the more had their praises like the Palm tree,
reached up even unto heaven. With these words the discourse was concluded, and
the Queen perceiving, that it would not be long ere the Court returned,
commanded the Lady Camilla Mosti, and the Lady Camilla Beuelacqua, that they
should dance: when they suddenly taking hands, troad two measures to the sound
of the lute, and danced the Canaries with good grace, and to the contentment of
those that beheld them: but the Duke, with the rest of the Court arrived: the
Queen rising up, all departed to the Duchess lodging, where was prepared a
most melodious Consort, of diverse musical instruments and sweet voices, which
consort continued a good part of the supper: the tables taken up, some time was
spent in diverse sports, and other pleasant relaxations: when the duke
perceiving the air ouercast with most obscure clouds, and that the winds
with violent blasts, threatened continual and pouring raines, in prejudice of
their pleasures, in hunting and fishing, gave order to set forward the morning
following. His highness therefore rising betimes, and hearing the ordinary
divine service, embarked himself with the excellent duchess, the Lady Donna
Marfisa, the Lady Donna Bradamante, with the dames of the Court, in a most
sumptuous bark, causing the Buccintore to be appointed for the Lady Countess
of Sala, and the rest of the Court. This is a great vessel built with such art
and workmanship, as than that there could not any have been made, either more
beautiful, or sumptuous, considering it has Hals, Chambers, Galleries, and
seats, so that to the beholders it seems a most admirable sight: and I am
certain, that if it had been in the time when Jason salled to fetch the
golden Fleece, this, and not that of the Argonantes, should thither have set
sail: The Knights and gentlewomen therefore accommodating themselves in this
bake, after that with most dilicate vinds they had broken their fast, the Lady
Countess of Sala, made a motion that there might a Queen be chosen by
election, and not by lot, whose Empire should not further extend, then the
Bark they were in, and was to continue for the whole passage, to the end that
she by moving some pleasant discourse, might cut off the tediousness of the
voyage: Each one therefore beginning to whisper in the ears of another, by
little and little, with the general applause of all, the Lady Tarquinia Molza,
a Gentlewoman of Modona, was chosen Queen, for her rare and extraordinary
wit, by the duchesle wonderfully beloved, and of all the Court reverenced, who
after modest refusal, in the end accepted this honor and Empire: Every one
stood doubtful, expecting, what the new Queen would command, for
entertainment of that evening, when she, after some indifferent meditation,
said: Amongst all the goods termed external, or of fortune, me thinks, that
after honor, riches holds the chiefest place, we seeing by experiense, that
riches in a manner of al men are desired, they judging, that nothing is more
proportionable to humane felicity, than riches: I therefore considering, that
the other day honor, and yesterday nobility was very well discussed, provided,
I thought, that this should be acceptable to the company, I would make election
of him, who to day should discourse of riches: and I believe this would not be
greatly from the purpose, Signior Hercules Varano, having by lively reasons
auerred, that riches are the supportance, and stay of Nobility. Then all the
standers by began to say to the Queen and among themselves, that this could not
but be a most pleasing and profitable discourse: and they were very instant,
that she would command, who might thereof entreat. The Queen therefore
turning to Count Hercole Tassone, a Gentleman of good customs, and with good
letters adorned. You Signior Conte, said she, shall be the man, who must
undertake this enterprise, to discourse of riches: provided, it may be lawful
for any that will, to contradict you in all those things, which to them shall
not seem alowable or convenient: as also, that you in like manner be enjoined
to make answer, according to the begun method and course. Seeing it so
pleases your Highness (renowned Queen) said Count Hercole, that I, among so
many of greater worth than my self, should be he to undertake this burden and
charge, not to oppugn your Highness judgment, which I esteem far above my
own, I neither can, or will in any sort refuse it: and so much the more
willingly will I accept of it, by how much it is permitted any one to contradict
me: For I having (as the reward of my barren invention) little or nothing at al
to bring forth, riches in my hands may easily fall into poverty, and become
beggarly, if these abundant wits by plentiful contradiction, do not sustain
and reduce them to their proper end. Here Tassone musing to himself, began
afterward in this manner.

The sixth days Discourse: Wherein is contained, a discussion of Riches.
THere be some (thrice excellent Queen) who having employed their whole
endeavor in acquiring of riches, and afterward, either through hard fortune,
or by their own proper defects, finally constrained to live poorly, not
knowing how to be revenged, play the hypocrites; and showing themselves
contemners of riches, by filling other men's ears with their blame and
reproach, term riches, the mother of arrogancy, insolency, and intemperance:
affirming last of all, with Diogenes the Cinicke, that virtue cannot abide with
riches. I both ever was, and am now more then ever, far off from their
opinion, and hold this as a firm conclusion, that a man in this world,
cannot enjoy a perfect and good life, without riches: conformable to which my
opinion, assigning the proper definition of riches, I affirm, that it is no
other, but an heap and collection of all such instruments, and means, which
to the sustentation, benefit, and ornament of an house, and civil life, are
necessaiye; without which, man cannot be called perfectly happy: and therefore
I say, it is an heap of al those instruments, because any of these failing, a
man cannot absolutely be counted rich: as also I affirm, that without riches a
civil man can not be happy: it being the principal instrument where with to
exercise virtue; and therefore riches is no less worthy, by men to be esteemed,
than it is: these instruments, which gathered together, make that heap, which
we call riches, is divided into seven parts, that is, possessions, cattle,
houses, money, jewels, rich furniture, and servants: possessions and cattle,
serve for sustentation of humane life: houses, money and servants for benefit:
precious jewels, and rich furniture for ornament. He then may truly be said
to be rich, who has sufficient, land, money, herds, flocks, and of al other
sorts of creatures, as well commodious as delectable: he that has a convenient
and fair house, rich furniture, as well in vestments as ornaments of the
house: and that possesses al these things securely and justly, being his after
such a property, as that he may sell or bestow them at his pleasure, and shall
generally use all these things, partly for commodity, alotting some of the
other only to ornament and contentment: Let him have therefore, his farms and
possessions both fruitful, and beautiful: seeing fruitfulnes shall turn to his
benefit, and beauty to his pleasure, and contentment: It is then requisite,
they be planted and graffed with goodly rows of vines, and fruitful trees,
and near unto them, a fine summer house, with gardens, fair orchards,
pleasant, and shadowy groves, of which orchards, and gardens, he shall not
make any emolument of importance, but only use them for pleasure and delight:
I conclude therefore (most excellent Queen) that who in so many commodities
shall be abundant, may be termed fortunate and happy, if he be also of them a
faithful destributer and dispenser.

Here Tassone making some pawse, the Greek, either believing he had no more
to say, or at the least, very hasty, to contradict, stepping forward: Your
discourse said he, Signior Conte, has had in it this one thing good, that it
was but short and brief: touching therest, the conclusion you inferred is
altogether false, contrary to divine and true Philosophy, the which by lively
reasons I hope to make known to this most famous Queen, all these gracious
Ladies, and most noble knights. Soft and fair (said Tassone) peradventure you
will not find it so easy to prove my conclusion false, as you have been
ready to cut off my discourse. Pardon me (replied the Greek) if I have bin
somewhat too forward: for ielous of public good, I could not tolerate, that
you should further proceed, delivering false doctrine: not being any thing
more contrary to truth, then to place riches in the number of those goods,
which are proportionable to humane felicity, it being in effect no other then
a mass and heap of those external euilles, which of themselves are
sufficient to break and discipate all internal goods, whereof whosoever is
possesser, he is worthy to be called happy. The truth of which my
conclusion, I hope to prove unto you, by the reason and authority of the
wisest Pholosophers. And beginning first from the very birth and original of
riches, it cannot be good, seeing they spring from a corrupt and pestilent
generation, they being the infamous offspring of Covetousness, and guilty even
of the same flagition: and therefore the Philosopher says: every rich man is
wicked, or the heir of a wicked man: this man has been enriched by vsuries,
he by spoils, another by treason: one is made rich by flattery, another
gains by incest and adulteries: a third sort advance themselves by lies:
there be such as make benefit of their own wives, daughters, and sisters, as
also to others, bloudshedding is profitable: Finally, it is but very rare that
wealth is gathered together justly, and with honesty, so that if it should
bring felicity to man, we might conclude, that felicity were no other but a
reward of iniquity. I further allege, how that is not good, which makes not
good the possessor thereof, but riches do not only, not make good, but procure
the possessor of them to be wicked. That riches cannot make their possessor
good. Seneca testifies, saying, What do riches advantage a fool, seeing by
them he cannot become wise? but that they make a rich man to be wicked, it may
by the testimony of the Philosopher be proved, who after this manner describes
the properties of the rich: the rich says he, are proud, great iniuriers,
insole^t, delicate, and intemperate. And Seneca conformable to this says, that
riches puffs up the mind, hatcheth insolence and pride, acquireth envy,
disturbeth the mind, and induces fear, whereas on the contrary, modest
poverty makes a man modest, industrious, secure, and is as it were a whip,
that scourges one to virtue: therefore Arcesilaus said, that though poverty
were bitter, yet brought it forth excellent children. And good Diogenes called
poverty, the wisdom that by it self was learned: minding to infer, that
poverty, and not wealth, makes a man wise: Thirdly, I will allege, how that
it is no true good by an honest man to be esteemed, whereof the man wicked may
as well be possessor as the good, yea, be he never so odious or contemptible a
man. And who sees not that a ruffian, bawd, or any other common Vintner, may
not be a possessor of riches. Fourthly, amongst humane kind, that is no
convenient or proper good, which cannot be possessed without the wrong of many,
but such is wealth, in that one cannot be rich, but many must therefore become
poor: therefore riches is no true good: Finally, that cannot be good, which to
humane generation is an occasion of infinite evil: But riches are of this
nature, for from them spring discordes, contentions, wars, enmities, rancois,
and other such like euilles, therefore they are not good. Signior Count
affirms, that this beatitude which we term riches, serves both for profit
and ornament to humane life: and if he lived commodiously that had need of
many things, this conclusion should be true: but who seeeth not, that the
richer any man is, of so many things the more he has need, he not being
able to use or preserve wealth without many instruments and helps? and therefore
that sometime is true, that whosoever possesses much, wants much: and
contrariwise, he that measures his abundance, not by superfluity, but by
natural necessity, has need of little: But what commodity so great may riches
bring, as may recompense the jealousy and care they minister unto man, or
requite that danger, which puts to compromise the souls health, and bodily
security of him rich? The rich, and not the poor, are a prey to murderers,
thieves, menquel lers, against these be poisons practiced, and these be the
men, who in strongest castles fear trecheries: O happy riches may we then well
say, seeing they art no sooner possessed, but security fails them. And what
shalwe say of ornament? It cannot be denied, but that costly garments, precious
jewels, sumptuous palaces, magnificent furniture, are a special ornament and
glory to the possessor thereof, that to have a chest replenished with gold and
silver, to be ever accompanied with a great train of seruitors, make a man
worthy of great estimation. But O most transitory kind of glory, seeing man,
by darkness it self, seeks after light, not considering, that in fair
apparel, and sumptuous palaces, men admire the nature of matter, art, and
the architects invention, rather than the possessor of al these, and that the
brightness of iewelles is their own proper splendour, and not of the man that
wears them: as also gold and silver, is no other but red, and white earth,
esteemed of only, through men's error; finally, to be environed with many
servants, is nothing but to be beset with many enemies, which be so much the
fitter to offend, as the other be external, and these domestical enemies. If
all these commodities gathered together, most renowned Queen, serve for
benefit, and ornament to humane life, or whether they make a man happy or
unhappy, anyone of judgment may discern: for my part. I would rather affirm,
that if felicity (as says Aristotle) is our own proper good, and cannot by
any accident whatsoever be taken away, then that riches therein should have no
part, as it that by fortune given, may by her also, in a moment be taken away:

As further I would affirm, that chief good in this humane life, were no
other, but a stable and constant tranquillity of mind, which despising al
those goods whereof fortune is proud; and above all others, insolent riches,
to be only confident in virtue: Notwithstanding, I attend my answer.

Behold (most illustrous Queen) answered Tassone, one of that erroneous crew,
who iniuried by fortune, in revenge, contendeth to prove, that she has not, so
much as the least interest in humane felicity, and that the goods she
courteously administreth, amongst which, riches are of no small esteem, are not
to be recounted in the number of humane goods, as disproportionable unto that,
which of it self being sufficient, is called chief good: notwithstanding, I
hope by so lively reasons, to discover this hypocrifie, as that there shall not
be any of so simple judgment, who giving credit to his allegatious, will
become a contemner of riches. I say then, that man, as he is in form from
other creatures different, so is his end from theirs, very diverse: the end
of other creatures, is no other, but living, to generate those like themselves.
Man borne in the Kingdom of Nature and Fortune, is not only to live and
generate, but to live well and happily: Nature of her self provides for other
creatures, things sufficient unto life: Nature procures man to live, but
reason and Fortune cause him to live well: creatures live after the laws of
Nature, man lives by Reason, Prudence, and Art: living creatures may live a
solitary life, man alone, being of himself insufficient, and by Nature, an
evil creature, without domestical and civil conversation, cannot lead other
then a miserable and discontented life: and therefore, as the Philosopher says
very well: That man which cannot live in civil company, either he is a God, or
a beast, seeing only God is sufficient of himself; and a solitary life best
agrees with a beast. Want therefore, and natural desire of company, and not
fire (as others falsely affirm) gave beginning to houses, villages, and
Cities, which houses, villages, and cities, as without their necessary
instruments, they cannot be sustained, so without wealth are they of
themselves insufficient, wealth being the principal of those instruments,
that maintain houses and cities: now a city being nothing else, but a body of
men united together, sufficient of it self to live, it is necessary, that like
to a humane body it be compounded of unlike members, the which in goodness and
dignity, among themselves unequal, all notwithstanding concur to the good
establishment of a City: whereupon as it would be a thing monstrous, and
incommodious, to see a humane body wholly compounded, of heads, arms, legs, or
of other members uniform in themselves; so would it be altogether as
disproportionable, and a thing so would it be altogether as disproportionable,
and a thing of it self insufficient, if all men in a City, were artificers,
husbandmen, soldiers, judges, or of one self condition, and quality: There
cannot therefore be any so uncircumspect, but he may perceive, that for the
preservation, and living well of a city, it is requisite, there be artificers,
mercinaries, husbandmen, marchantes, soldiers, Judges, Magistrates, Princes,
and Priests: which being (as it is) true; so is it likewise convenient, that
there should be poor, rich, noble, and ignoble. And therefore they, who
labored to bring in a commonwealth, al men to one condition and quality,
created a policy rather of celestial, the^ terrestrial men: having no less
erred, then did that Physician, who sought to make harmony of notes vnisone:
for as of diverse notes and tunes it is compounded, and reduced only to one
note, cease then to be harmony, so of the diverse qualities of men is a
city ordained, and reduced to one condition of citizens; only, is not then
any more a city, nor of it self sufficient. If therefore all these
allegations be true, you can never Signior Antonio, banish riches out of a
city, seeing they are a necessary instrument for her sustentation, and well
imployd, be the supporters not of vice, but of virtue, and liberal arts: as
contrariwise poverty is the proper nourishment of arts mechanical, which
arts have had their original, from nothing else, then from humane indigence.
And if you, admitting riches to be in a city, should but be thereof a just
distributer, I am sure you would rather bestow the^ on those who exercised
liberal arts, and were capable of virtue, then on mechanical, mercenarie, or
husbandmen; seeing these being unapt to virtue, and rather instruments, then
parts of a commonwealth, their sordide lives requires it not, whereas
otherwise it is requisite, that virtuous men should live with some liberal and
commendable decency. Speak not therefore, Signior Antonio, against your own
mind, but yielding to reason, freely confess, that riches in themselves are
good, and worthy to be placed, among those goods wished for: and though
sometimes, they appear wicked, yet is not this their own defect, but rather
the fault of his depraved mind, that possesses, and badly uses it: for as
Signior Varano, yesterday showed, they are the mother of liberal arts, the
proppe of Nobility, good education, and gentle customs. And therefore the
Philosopher says, that doctrine, and nobility, rather accompany the rich,
then poor, in that he cannot have leisure, that wants commings in:
affirming likewise, that from hence it proceeds, that the rich abounding in
those things, for want whereof, others commonly are unjust, and injurious,
rich men are better, then poor, and worthy to be called noble. I confess,
Signior Antonio, that virtue only is the artificer that frames felicity, but
as the Artificer cannot work, without convenient instruments, so virtue, without
the gifts that nature and fortune join unto her, cannot be perfect, nor true
felicity: but what need we use authority, and arguments, to persuade this
our Greek, to favor riches and rich men, seeing by his own example, if not
testimony, we may prove, that riches are good, and rich men virtuous, and
well instructed, we seeing daily, that he as a virtuous man, and well brought
up, so does he always converse with the rich, and altogether shun the
familiarity of them poor, as separate from virtue, and all good customs: as
also that he, by those rich, as lovers of virtue, and men virtuous, is better
beloved and esteemed then the poor. It is true (said the Greek smiling) that
I frequent the houses of the rich, and not of the poor; But yet, as does the
Physician, who visits the sick, and not the whole: as also, the self same
Physician is more by the weak desired, then the whole. But for all this, you
not having overthrown my reasons, I assure you, they standing firm, I mind
not to change my opinion. I am sure indeed (answered Tassone) that you will
never change the houses of the rich, for the poor: for the poor envy your
virtue, and the rich love, and strive to imitate it: and therefore it will be
no difficult matter for me, seeing you affect the rich, to make you also
restore due honor to riches. Beginning therefore at your first opposition, it
is false, that riches either have, or may have, evil spring or original, as
those that borne with the world, and with the same coeternall, in respect of
themselves, are good, and so known unto you, by whom in favor of felicity,
they are desired and sought after: but in that they may be heaped up together,
both by mean lawful, and unlawful, yea, and through humane malice, for the
most part, they are by unlawful means acquired: hereuppon it seems, that
riches grow from that corrupt stock you have spoken of: notwithstanding, the
defect is not in the riches, but in the man wicked, that badly acquireth,
possesses, and uses them: yet may they for all this, as I say, have a good
original: For often times, together with honor, they are given in reward of
virtuous actions, as also further, good Fortune, sedulous industry, honest
frugalitie, may to another heap up riches, as Hesiodus in these verses
teaches, A little to a little, add thou still,
And to this little less, by art and skill.
By doing thus, thou shall soon drive away,
Unhappy want, and poverty, I say.


I yield unto you, that riches cannot make good the possessor of them, neycher
can they make a fool, wise: seeing that only internal goods, which be the
perfections, and virtues of the mind are of force to make a man good: riches
being a good external, can neither make the possessor of the^, good, or
wicked: It is true also, that the Philosopher describing the customs of the
rich, terms them, insolent, proud, injurious, and by such like titles: yet so
we must observe, that in his Rhethorike, discoursing of the customs, and
inclinations of all qualities, and conditions of men, thus describes them, as
enclining to vice, to the end the orator, according to the disposition and
inclination of the auditor, might the sooner move him to that affection
whereunto he was bending, and after this manner easily persuade him: but he
never affirms in any place, that riches is not to be placed among those
goods, that assist to humane felicity, seeing both houses, and cities,
languish and consume without riches. It is no less true also, that every
wicked and vile man, may possess riches, and yet is this no obstacle, but they
may be good, and by a virtuous man esteemed: for if this reason should prevail,
health, strength of body, and beauty, should be goods unworthy of a virtuous
man, seeing likewise in men contemptible they are many times found. Signior
Antonio further alleges, that riches to humane kind, is not profitable or
good, seeing without the wrong of many, they cannot be possessed, in that one
cannot be rich, but many through the same must become poor, and herein he is
not advised, how he contradicts his own self: for supposing poverty to
be evil, he comes to confess, that riches, contrary to poverty, is good: he
adds more over, that riches is not good, because it is occasion of many
evils, which amongst men fall out, as controversies, discordes, wars,
murders, thefts, rapines, and such like. This opposition, is a most preualent
proof for understanding, that riches is a principal good, seeing they move
every ones desire and will, to endeavor by all means to attain unto them:
and therefore he had assigned a truer cause, in saying, that humane malice and
pertinacie, and not riches, were the cause of all the abouenamed euilles: we
might also prove by more reasons, that poverty were rather the cause of those
inconveniences, seeing the want of those things wherewith the rich men abound,
kindles desire and greediness in the poor, that afterward is the cause of
all those evils, which every day are committed: And therefore the Philosopher,
contrary to your Arcesilaus, says, that poverty brings forth seditions,
and maleficences. Our Greek yet further affirms, that riches is not
commodious, saying: that the richer any one is, the more things he has need
of: but if the definition of riches be true, of necessity his position must be
false, for where is the heap and collection of all necessary instruments, for
sustentation, benefit, and ornament of humane life, there can be no defect, or
want of any thing: and though riches procure a man to be jealous over him
self, and sometimes puts him in danger, yet from this reason can we not
conclude that they are wicked: but rather the contrary, seeing there is no
fear of loosing badde, but good things, which of their own nature, bring the
possessor into no danger, but rather is procured by man's covetousness and
deprauation: as in like manner, lust is the cause, that the chastity of a fair
woman is hardly secure, and yet must we not therefore say, that beauty is a
wicked thing. I grant unto you also Signior Antonio, that in fair apparel and
sumptuous palaces, the nature of matter and Architects wit is rather admired,
then the rich possesser of these things: and that splendour and brightness, is
proper to the jewels, and gold, and not to the man rich, who therewith adorneth
himself, but not withstanding this, if the rich man had not made this rich
apparel, or built a sumptuous house for his own and public benefit, neither
could the nature of matter, nor the Architects wit, and invention of
themselves, procure admiration: as also the beauty and splendour of jewels should
remain buried in the inwardmost caves of the earth, except the rich man,
discovering as it were the treasures of Nature, should not offer them to the
beholders eyes: beside this, in all these ornaments, the beams of magnificence
shine, which is numbered amongst the principallest virtues heroycall. To
possess therefore, and use all these things, both how, when, and with
convenient measure and quantity, brings unto man a singular decency, being
truly worthy to be placed in the numbers of goods desired; and to be sought
after, as in like maneral other kind of riches: I say likewise, that felicity
is proper to us, and cannot be taken away: as also, that riches being a good of
Fortune, remains in the power of the same fortune. But we must observe, that
felicity may be considered two manner of ways, the first, as it depends of
his proper efficient cause, which is virtue: the second, as it depends not
only of the efficient, but also of al causes isntrumental, and the
circumstances necessarily conjoined with the cause efficient, in the first
manner considered, it is our own proper, and cannot be taken away, because
virtue true productresse of felicity, is not subject to blows of fortune,
neither have honor, riches, nor any other external goods in it any part. In
this manner the Philosopher observes felicity, in the first of his Ethikes,
when he distinguishes the felicity of Platoes Idea, from Riches, honor, and
those contentments that the vulgar sort esteem. In this manner also did he
consider it in the seventh of his Politikes, where he said: Felicity
happens not unto us through the goods of Fortune, but every one, the more he
possesses of virtue and prudence, and after them frames his opperations, the
greater is his felicity: and this is proved by the testimony of God
himself, who not for any good external, but of himself, is happy and
blessed. Felicity considered after the second manner; it being no other but
a collection, and heap of humane goods, as well internal, as external,
which jointly together concur, by mean of virtuous action, to the enjoying
of perfect and chiefest contentment: although it can not be wholly taken away,
yet notwithstanding in many circumstances it may be hindered. After this manner
the Philosopher considers it in the first of his Rhetorike, where he does not
only place, the goods of the mind, amongst the parts of felicity, but also
the goods of the body, and those external: In this sort also does he observe
it, in the seventh of his Ethickes, where he plainly affirms, that an happy
man, has need of goods external, and of fortune, to the end, that in his
operations he may not be hindered: which thing, says he, being very well
known, prosperous fortune, and felicity, by many come to be termed, the
selfsame things. We must further note, that the Philosopher in the place by
you cited, Uses these formal words: Chief good is our proper own: being
such, as that hardly it can be taken from us: He denies not therefore, but
that felicity anay be taken away, but yet he says, very hardly, minding to
infer, that it could not be absolutely removed, but may peradventure be
defrauded of his circumstances. Out of which, we may very well conclude, that
felicity should be deprived of her principal instrument, wanting riches: and
that he which is not rich, can not be perfectly happy, considering that he
cannot exercise the Virtue of liberality, beneficence, and magnificence, which
make a man worthy of honor.

Me thinks, Signior Antonio, said the Queen, your cause is in such sort
overthrown, as that it booteth you little to reply any further: and I am
assured, that from these Signiors, you should not receive the least
suffragation of poverty, if you were to gather their voices by scrutanie.

It would not be a just and indifferent scrutany (most excellent Queen, said
the Greek, smiling) if the number of the rich were not equally balanced, with
as many poor: because passion, which is ever in the rich predominant, and not
equity, would give sentence: Notwithstanding I will accept your Majesty's
judgment, as a firm decree: neither will I further reply, expecting that one
day I may be made to conceive, by one that with effects, and not words, shall
prove, that riches are good, and worthy of a virtuous man.

And although other persuasions were not sufficient, said Count Guido
Caleagnini, yet might experience manifest it unto you, which every day shows,
that riches is not only a necessary instrument of felicity, but further, that
among all worldly goods, it holds chiefest place: seeing riches without
labor, dispenses liberally to him rich, of all other goods, which the poor
man by virtue, can not with great industry attain unto: And it seems he
richly borne, is in like manner borne gracious, virtuous, worthy to be
beloved of every one, and commended: the which by you learned, being well and
rightly understood, you dedicate your labors, not to the virtuous, but unto
the rich: And furthermore, we see that Titles, and honors, are by Princes,
rather dispensed, to the rich, than to the poor, as likewise for one virtuous,
that they retain in their Courts, we may reckon ten rich: as those that
are reputed, much more profitable and honorable to the commonwealth and
Prince. with their riches, than are the virtuous with their virtue.

How greatly wealth exceeds virtue (added Count Palla Strozzi) in my
judgment, that wise answer given by Sophocles, to the wife of Hiero tyrant
of Syracusa, manifests: For he by her demanded, whether it was better to
be rich or virtuous. I see the virtuous (answered he) every day at the rich
men's gates, but never did I see the rich at the gates of the virtuous, being an
evident sign, that riches holds virtue as mercenarie.

Signiour Count (answered the Greek) and if the rich would but look into
their own defects, as they conceive the necessities of the virtuous, the
contrary would happen: for then the rich would resort to the virtuous men's
houses, neither would they ever from them depart: for another can not give
judgment, in that he himself knows not: The wise and virtuous know what
gold and silver is, and to what use their dispensation serves. But of the rich
questionless many not knowing, what sapience and virtue is, buried in the
darkness of their ignorance, they make thereof the like account, as did Aesopes
Cock of the precious stone: but seeing, in favor of riches, you have cited the
example of a flatterer, for so may Sophocles with that foolish woman be termed
sufficient for my part in favor of virtue, to recite unto you the beginning of
a Letter, which Antigonus the most mighty king of Asia wrote to Zeno Citico a
most wise Philosopher: I, said he, as I exceed thee in fortune, and glory, so
in sapience, liberal studies, and perfect felicity, which thou possessest, I
know my self far inferior unto thee. The King knew himself by the Philosopher
exceeded in perfect felicity, reputing riches and glory for things most vain:
King Antigonus knew well what he had need of, and therefore he drew near unto
him, one that was wise: the which if many other rich men knew also, they would
hunt after the virtuous, much more than they do, neithes would they so swell,
or be puffed up with their riches wanting sapience: for they might conceive,
that the rich without virtue are no other, but sheep that have their fleece of
gold, as the magnanimous king Alfonso of Aragon was wont to term the^: further
alleging, that rich men, like tapistrie hangings, served rather for
ornaments, of halles and chambers, than for any other purpose: they being in
effect, not much unlike to painted images; but in his affairs he used those
virtuous, who as they be rare, so of necessity, in Courts they must needs
be the less in number. But peradventure I have said too much.

Speak what you please, said Count Alfonso Turcho, for my part, I make no
doubt, but that riches is one of the greatest goods, that may befall a man in
this life: yea, and I hold opinion, that the more riches increase, the more
humane felicity is augmented: so that he most rich, may be said to be also
most happy. In this last part, Signior Conte (said Tassone) you are deceived,
seeing felicity rather consists in indifferent than excessive riches. You
having proved (replied Tuncho) that riches is a good, I cannot see, but that
riches increasing, good is thereby augmented, and conse quently felicity.

Goods (answered Tassone) as has other wise been affirmed, are of diverse
sorts, that is, of the body, mind and of fortune. And between the goods of
the mind, and those of Fortune, there is this notable difference, that excess
in the goods of fortune, as are riches, either hurt, or help not him that
possesses them: but goods of the mind, to the greater height they attain,
so much the more make they their possessor happy. And if Signior Barisano had
tied himself to this conclusion, that not riches, but immeasurable riches,
were rather impediment, than fur therance to live well, and happily, I should
have been conformable to this opinion: For superfluous riches bring often
times upon him rich, those inconveniences, which he has recounted: and
peradventure in this respect, those severe Philosophers blamed riches,
therefore the Philosopher says, that prosperity of fortune, when it
exceeds, it is an impediment to felicity, so that in such excess, it cannot
in reason be termed prosperity. And in another place, likewise he affirms,
that indifferent possession of the goods of fortune, is worthy to be counted
best, the which easily obeys to reason, as does excess the contrary: And
further he adds in praise of mediocritie, that all those indifferent rich,
are apt to preserve themselves: in that they desire not other men's goods, as
do the poor, neither are theirs by the poor desired, so much as the goods
of them rich: whereupon they themselves neither circumuenting, others, nor by
others laid in wait for, or circumuenced, they live without danger. In like
manner Phocilides affirmed, that for the happy state of a Commonwealth; it was
to be wished, that Citizens should have indifferent, yet sufficient riches:
minding to infer, that so much riches sufficed, as wherewith veitue might
with decency be practiced: and that those, who in riches, power, or friends
do superabound, are good Citizens, because they neither can, nor will support
another man's dominion: that mean wealth is not only sufficient of it self to
felicity, but also to the happy state of a commonwealth: by this it may be
comprehended, that the Lawgiuers were indifferent rich: for Solon as we read
in his verses, was indifferent rich, and so was Lycurgus, Charondas, Faleus
Carthaginian, Hyppodamus Milesian, and Finally, the greater part of all the
others: so that it is evident, that moderate, and not immesurable riches, are
the furtherance to happy life. I shall remain satiffied, if to this you have
delivered, you add but some firm and sound reason, said count Alfonso. And
Tassone. I commend your wit, seeing you rely not on bare authority, but behold
the reason: It is a thing most certain, that the instrument wherewith the
artificer exercises his trade, ought to be proportionable, both to the same
artificer and art: for if it be diminished, or too exceeding great, neither
to the artificer, not the work it self, will it succeed well. Riches
therefore, being the instrument, wherewith a virtuous man practices virtue, it
is necessary that after such a sort, they be unto virtue proportionable, and
the man virtuous, as neither through defect, nor excess, virtuous actions
(wherein felicity consists) be hindered: and in that moderate riches is
between the defect and excess, this of necessity must needs be the
sufficient and proportionable instrument: and excess shall either be hurtful,
or no whit at all furthering felicity. But moreover, if from increase of riches
felicity should take augmentation, considering riches may multiply infinitely,
it would also follow, that felicity, which is the end of man, should be
infinite: whereupon man, not being able ever to attain unto it fully, of all
other things created, he only should fail of his proper end: I conclude
therefore, that as without riches, there can be no perfect felicity, so the
excess of riches either hurts, or helps not at all: and that mediocrity is
an apt instrument unto virtue, and an happy life. These reasons, are so well
grounded, said Turcha, as that in them I remain fully satisfied. Out of doubt
added Gualinguo, whosoever cannot practice vortue with moderate riches, will
much less practice it with excess: seeing superaboundance of riches is far
more proportionable to vice, then virtue: And ordinarily in them most rich,
those evil dispositions are discovered, which by the Philosopher are ripped
up in his Rhetoric, seeing in that place he understands it by them
superaboundantly rich, and not by the other, rich with mediocrity, considering
that in them, insolence, pride, intemperance, and many other vices abound,
whereof immeasurable riches is the proper nourishment. I believe (said Count
Hercules Beuelacqua) that so it is: but yet further I desire to understand,
whether he is rich that possesses, or he that uses them, for of this I am
doubtful, in that I see diverse, who notwithstanding they make thereof no use,
yet are they esteemed most rich. Vain is possession without use (answered
Tassone (as the divine Philosopher affirms in Eutimedo) therefore to be rich
consists, not only in possession, but also, in using riches: and he that
should say, more in use then possession, might not peradventure speak much
amiss, in that he which makes no use of them, is in no other respect
different from one poor, but that the poor man is poor through necessity,
and he through will and election: and therefore many not knowing, that to be
rich, consists principally in using of wealth, are deceived: and not
foreseeing thus much, by forbearing the use of them, impouerash themselves.
Nay, and I promise you, I am of opinion (said Count Hercules,) that these
sort of men are much more miserable then the poor: for the poor desire
Riches to supply their wants, and these men hunt after them, to the end, that
in abundance, they might yet live in want: neither can I imagine the cause and
reason, of so great folly. Avarice (said Tassone) springs from a firm
hope, of long life, and never thinking to die: for who is so foolish, that
would spare to day, if he believed to die to morrow,? But a man promising unto
himself, long life, as if he were to live ever, storeth up riches and money
infinitely, hoping that one day he shall rejoice in them, and in this vain
hope, feeding himself with air, he lives like a Camelion, and finally, in
the midst of abundance, dies in want. How can it be, said count Scipio
Sacrati, that to be in hope of long life, should make a man covetous, we seeing
by experience, that avarice, is a particular vice to old men, who hourly
expect death? Old men (said Tassone) do not expect, but fear death, as they
that are much more desirous of life, then young men, and therefore Marcus
Tullius said, that there was not any one so de crepite, which did not yet
promise unto himself some years of life: but for another cause also old men
are covetous, for blood in them coming to refrigerate, and not being able to
joy any more in those contentmentes, wherein youth is commonly prodigal: as
also having many times proved want in times past, fearing the like should
happen to them again, they addict themselves to the heaping up of money,
reposing in it all their joy, and contentment. Having observed (said the Count
of Scandiano) these men, that greedy of riches, are called covetous, I find
them after such a manner intentive, to the heaping up of money, as that it
excepted, all other riches seems unto them nothing worth, which makes me
believe, that in the possession of money confisteth true riches: seeing by the
means of money, we may iuioy all other riches, yea and it appears, that they
who are monied, be in a certain manner Tyrants over others, as though all
things should obey unto money: And therefore Phillip the father of great
Alexander was wont to say, that there was not any fortress so great and well
munified, but if an affe laden with gold might but aproach it, would be
expugnable. It cannot be denied, (said Tassone) but that money is very
commodious, and in a certain manner, necessary, to live well, being impossible,
or at least wise very difficulte, to live in common society, without exchange,
or permutation of things: considering that oftentimes one has need of that,
whereof another abounds, now in that there can be no just permutation, but by
means of money (as the other day Caualier Gualinguo declared) it being that
which makes all contracts just and equal, in this respect money is truly worthy
to be esteemed, and placed in the number of riches: notwithstanding in it self
considered, it is no true, nor sincere riches, as that which of it self,
supplieth not the wants of nature, considering that one possessing it, may die
for hunger, thirst, cold, or any other want, no less then he that has it
not, which is confirmed by the fable of Mydas. And there upon it proceeds,
that the riches of money is of all other insatiable, yea and the more the heap
thereof augmenteth, the more likewise increases desire, for money serves nature
to no use at all, as does bread, wine, fruit, and al other riches, wherewith
humane life, is sustained, and ordained: the superfluity of which things
causes lothsomnesse and sacietie.

Think you not (said Signior Gualinguo) that money of it self, without other
help, deserves to be esteemed, being compounded of so noble a matter as is
gold or silver? The which gold is so resplendant and beautiful, as therefore
it was consecrated to the Sun: as also that being most secure and temperate
from all corruption, it was in like manner dedicated to Jupiter: whereupon, no
marvel if any one beholding it, he remain surprised and taken. Although
silver and gold (answered Tassone) of alother metals, be the fairest and most
beautiful, yet are they least profitable: wherefore, having respect to that,
which more benefiteth humane life, we may make better account of iron,
although of all other metal it be the grossest: seeing of iron, and with
iron, the instruments of all trades are made, and iron makes men valiant
amiddest the most cruel wild beasts: sinally, in the city, and within our
own houses, it makes us secure: which being known to wise Solon; he advised
Craesus to change his abundance of gold (showed unto him by that foolish
King, for ostentation) into iron, prognosticating, that if he presently did it
not, his gold, kingdom, and self, would be a prey to Cyrus; who empty of
gold, but laden with iron, and full of valor, came to assault him. I conclude
therefore, that money in it self, is of small or no assistance at all, to
humane life; as that which by the Lawgiuers was invented, to prove equality in
bargains, and contracts: for a mason could make no exchange with a shoemaker,
seeing the building of a house, is of far greater value, then a pair of
shoes, if money were not, which ballanceth the contract: And therefore money by
the Graecians was called Numisma, as it were by the laws ordained: for Nomos
signisieth law, and the Latins for the selfsame cause, called it Nummus: and
there is no doubt, but money comes to be esteemed, through the opinion only of
men, who as hitherto they have esteemed thereof, if for a little while, they
should but begin to hold the same (as indeed it is) but base and vile, we
should find it, no question, but an vnprositable weight and burden. That
invention of money (said Signior Patritio) serves for no other use, but for
permutation of things, it appears by another reason: for having respect only
to domestical society, within the limits of an house, where permutation is
not requisite; it is altogether unprofitable. And how is permutation
unnecessary, or at leastwife unprofitable in a house (replied, Signior
Hercules Varano?) Because between husband and wife (said Patritio) betwixt
father and children, servants and masters, and brothers, while they remain
together in one familte, that permutation is not requisite, whereunto money
concurreth for equality of bargain and contract: and therefore money, within
the limits of an house is altogether unprofitable, but only serves abroad in
civil company, and sometimes for contract, and exchange. Me thinks (said
Signior Scipion Gilioli, that general rule should have an exception: seeing in
the house betwixt master and servant, there is permutation, and money takes
place; the seruitor offering his labor and service, to his master, and the
master due hire to such a servant in exchange: observe (said Patritio) that by
a servant I intend not these, which go about every day, serving sometime this
man, otherwhiles that for hire: For these sort of people, be rather
similitudes, then true servants, as they that acknowledge not their master,
for their head, neither fear by him to be punished, for the insolences, they
daily commit in the house: wherefore they are altogether unworthy to be placed
in the number of those, which make a domestical society: being for the most
part, vagabonds, and cooseners, directing their actions, rather to some other
end, than to serve their masters. But I mean that servant, the use of whom
not only, but even of his goods and substance is in the masters power, which
by us at this day is called a Slave: for such an one is a true seruitor, and
one of the principal instruments wherewith a master gouernes his house. This
man, partly for fear of his master, as also through hope of liberty (the
reward of good service) serves his master most saithfully: and between this
servant and his master, occurreth no permutation, wherein money is requisite.
Now I conceive (said Gilioli) that your rulehath no exception, and that money
is no riches, which passes betwixt them of one famille, although it be
necessary for maintenance of the house, as Signior Conte has very well
explaned, who in the argument of riches, has given so good satisfaction, as
peradventure little remains whereof we may doubt.

The which likewise, being by all the rest confirmed, the discourse ended, and
his Highness with the thrice excellent Duchess, even now landed at the
village of Cosandoli, the Queen rose up, with all the rest of the company, and
leaving the Barge, they followed the Court, which went to a lodging, prepared
in a most sumptuous palace, not far distant from the banks of Poe, built
sometimes with magnificent charge, by the ancie^nt Princes of Este. Here, after
cuerie one had taken a little repose in their particular partitions, being even
now night, all went to the Chamber of the renowned Duchess, where with music
and other pleasing sports, they passed the time while supper: which ended, and
the tables taken up, they used diverse forms of dancing, but being very late,
al departed to their rest, expecting the morning light. The morning following,
his highness, the excellent Duchess, and all the rest of the Court, having
heard with devotion, ordinary divine service, they went root by foot to the
rivers side, where each one entered into their barge, except the Secretaries,
Counselors, and other Magistrates, who invited by the Lady Countess of Sala,
the Lady Tarquinia, and by the most illustrous Lord Don Caesare, accommodated
themselves in the Buccyntore, imagining discourse would fall out upon some noble
subject and argument: and amongst these, was Signior Antonio Montecatini, of
all Philosophers of our age, the most principal, Signior Gainbattista
Landerchi, the renowned of the Laws, Signior Benedetto Racualdi, Signior
Achilli Fantini, Signior Gian Maria Crispo, and Signior Cati, men, not only in
the profession of the laws most excellent, but in all other kinds of
excellent and choice studies, learned and judicial. There were in like manner
placed upon the side of the bark, diverse companies of Musicians (of which in
his Court, there be many rate and excellent, to the end, that playing and
singging together to sundry instruments, they might with their melody no less
delight the sense of hearing, then did the dames with their beuty, content the
eyes and sense of seeing. But after that with pleasure they had made some
reasonable way, dinner time being at hand, by the Queens order, the tables
were covered in the hall, and on the one side, the dames, and those roabed:
oueragainst whom sat the Knights and men of order, the Queen her self being
placed at the end of the table, in regal majesty under a canopie. Dinner
ended, which thrughout was accompanied with most melodious music, there was
by provident officers, as on the water the custom is, brought forth cards,
tables, and chesse boordes. But the Queen with a sign having imposed silence,
spoke after this manner. As there be two conditions of men esteemed worthy of
true honor, one of those, learned, and the other of them, that make profession
of Arms, so is there many times disputation, to whither of these preeminence
is due: Considering therefore with my self, that in this noble assembly, of
one side, here be the flower of the learned of our age, and on the other part,
Knights, that in military profession are most excellent: taking hold of this
good opportunity, I determine that to day, for entertainme^t of our passage, by
way of argument, it be discussed; which is most worthy of honor, the man
learned, or the Soldier: and to the end, that in grapling together, there grow
no confusion, I mind it shall be fought out by several champions, which may be
done, they learned choosing out one for their part that may speak, as also
the other, another: And because no controversy can be determined without a
judge: I will, that both parts being heard, they shall stand to the sentence,
of Madam Countess of Sala. This judicial order of the Queen, highly pleased
the Lord Don Caesar, and all the rest of the Ladies: and they attended the
Champions coming forth: for those learned, after a low muttering and
consultation, they denounced Signior Patritio for Champion: and of the Knights
part, the Lord Guilio Caesar Braneaccio, not only amongst all the rest, the
oldest Soldier, and in knowledge of Arms most excellent, but further, a
gentleman, very learned, eloquent, and with all manner of virtue adorned. This
election once made, the Queen breaking silence, commanded Patritio, that he
should first enter into the field, who smiling: Although (most renouned Queen
said he) it is no small prejudice to the learned in this action to be
assailants, but is as it were half a confirmation of precedence to arms:
notwithstanding, seeing your Majesty so commands, I will not refuse to be
the chalenger: yet with this condition, that in this conflict, there be no
other arms used, then those wherewith the learned accustom to subdue their
adversaries: for if soldiers should but draw their swords, out of doubt
syllogisms, inductions, cuthememes, examples, and the learneds Champion
himself, would be ready to she the field. Then Signior Guilio Caesar smiling:
Although election of arms belongs unto us as defendants, yet to the end our
victory may be more glorious, we accept of combat with your own arms: so
now Signior Patritio, frame your tongue to this warlike assault; for as equity
and reason stands on our side, so hope I by my valor, courageously to
sustain it. Patritio therefore having a while pawsed with himself, begun in
this sort.

The seventh days Discourse: Wherein is determined the Precedence of Arms and
Letters.
IT is a very deep and doubtful question (most famous Queen) which you have
propounded to be disputed of this day, seeing that Arms and Letters are both
of them so Noble professions, and so excellent, as that it is difficult to
judge, to whether of them the Palm is due: Considering by arms we defend
and amplify kingdoms, and by Letters we preserve and govern the same, so
that the one of the other stands in such need, that neither this without the
other, can be justly extended, nor the other without the first, be securely
maintained: Notwithstanding, seeing it so pleases your Highness, that the
tediousness of our journey, be passed over with some ingenious and pleasant
discourse, I will contend to manifest, as a valorous Champion of the learned,
that the balance fitteth on our side: and in that the soldier and scholar
cannot sit both on the same stool, the Soldier must give place to the
scholar. Now to come to the knowledge of truth, which we seek after, I think
it necessary, that to discoursing briefly, we first of any other thing entreat
of those perfections, which of themselves are sufficient to bring a man to his
true end, which is felicity, to the end, that seeing in what degree and
perfection Letters stand, and in what art military we may draw out an
infallible judgment, to whom the first degree of honor ought to be given,
whether to the Souldior, or Scholar. I say therefore, that man for no other
cause, of all other Creatures, is only capable of felicity, but in that
beyond vegetative, and sensaliue faculties, he is endued with understanding,
by mean of which, working virtuously, he may come to chief good, and enjoy
highest delight. In this humane intellect, two most principal faculties are
found, the one of which is called by the Philosophers, understanding
speculatiue, whose object is truth, the other, practike understanding, which
is conversant about that good in humane opperations confisting. By all reasons
these two faculties are placed in humane understanding, considering that of
all things which this universal frame contains, some be the works of the
greatest god and Nature, other be humane opperations: In the works of God and
Nature, truth is sought after, in humane opperations, good. By mean of these
two faculties, man acquireth two sorts of perfections: one of which is called
Habit speculatiue, the other, Habit practike. Habit speculatiue is no other
but a knowledge of all those things, that comprehend the universal frame, the
which, as they are of three sorts, so be there three several speculatiue
habites: seeing that some are by their own proper essence, separate from
sensible matter, as is the omnipotent and most excellent God, the Intelligences
assisting the Celestial Spheres, and those, which of the Metaphisicks
themselves, are called Transcendentes, as Ens, good, truth, the thing, and such
like, the knowledge whereof, is deservedly called Wisdom: some again by their
essence, are wholly drowned in se^sible matter, and with motion conjoined, and
these be the heavens, elements, and bodies mixed: the knowledge of these
things, is called natural Philosophy. There be yet some other, which in effect
can never be separate from sensible matter: notwithstanding naturally they are
such, as by part imaginatiue, and with the mind, they may be considered, or
imagined: without consideration or imagination of matter, and this is
mathematical knowledge, divided into Geometry, which handles continual
quantity, that is, line, superficies, and body: and arithmetike, being
conversant about discreet quantity, which is number: there be further some
speculatiue habites comprehended under these three heads, by the Logitians
termed, sciences subalternall, or half sciences: for in respect of the
subject, whereabout they are conversant, they participate of natural
knowledge, but considering the manner, by which they prove their conclusions,
they are mathematical, as those, that embrace mathematical conclusions, for
their beginning. Amongst these, is Astrology, considering bodies, and motions
celestial, the like also natural knowledge doing, but in a diverse manner:
then prospectiue, which entreats of visible line, Steremetrie, being employed
touching solid bodies; and music, respecting number harmonicall, with other
such like: And these be all the sciences and habites, wherewith intellect
speculatiue is adorned, in inuestigating, and finding out of truth. Practicke
habit, is no other, but the knowledge of all those things, whereof man is the
beginning: and they be divided into two heads, active, and doing, part active,
is a firm understanding of those things, which appertain to the good
government of himself, his house, and finally of the common weal. The doing
or performing habit, is that knowledge, which is called art: this being
divided into those mechanical, and liberal. But leaving apart mechanical art,
as impertinent to a civil man, we will affirm, that amongst liberal arts,
Grammar is numbered, Rhethorike, Dialect, Poesy, Music, both of voice and
instrument, painting, Architecture, and the art of Physic, and amiddest all
these, we will allot the principallest place to art Millitarie, as of al other
the most excellent, which by the Philosopher was placed in the number of arts,
it having belonging unto it, all those conditions, which in an art are
required, that is, material subject, end, and the instrument, which to the end
conduces, neither wanting there also firm beginnings and principles wherewith
every day, great soldiers serve their turn: material subject is battle,
victory the end, and arms the instrument: These are all the perfections (most
famous Queen) which may bring a man to his end, being felicity: of which no
doubt, those are the most excellent, and worthy of greatest honor, that more
readily may make a man happy. If therefore I shall show, that learning and
habites speculatiue, have greater part in felicity, than art Military, I
believe the learned shall have won the day. If that be true, which all the
piudent affirm, that of things created, the same exceeds all others in
perfection, which draws nearest to divine bounty, and does of it most
participate: Out of question the man learned, in bounty and dign^tie will be
superior to the soldier; in that he learned, is endewed with that virtue,
which makes a man like to things divine. For science and sapience which be
incident to the learned, by mean of contemplation, make a man companion with
God, unites him with chief good, and true felicity: The Philosopher
confirms the same in the tenth of his Ethickes, where he says, that those,
who busy their minds in contemplation, addict themselves to the study of
good letters, and are, than al others, by God better beloved; because they
adorn that part of the mind, which has greatest similitude with things
divine: whereupon God kindles the light of his divine grace in their souls,
comforting them with highest joy, and true beatitude: As also otherwhere
commending Metaphy sick, he says, that though it be not profitable, yet
notwithstanding it is worthy of supreme honor, as that which raises our
understanding from earth to heaven, exalting it to the knowledge of high and
divine things: and therefore he worthily affirms, that the wiseman gonerneth
the stars: as he that far remote from a vulgar life, being of himself
sufficient, lives most happy. M. Tullius in first of his Tusculanes says,
that Philosophy is a gift given by God, and that in this world there can be
nothing more sweet or excellent: what thing is to be desired more excellent or
worthier of a man, then sapience: this by administering the knowledge of al
things diume and humane, procures the mind to be settled and replenished, with
chief joy: if this be not a thing worthy of commendations, what is to be
commended? And Architas Tarentine says, that wisdom, amongst al other things
humane, is most excellent, and is as sight among the senses, understanding in
the same soul, and as the Sun amongst the stars, sacred. Philo sophie
procures not the felieitie of one particular alone, but further, assisteth the
happy living of an whole City, as divine Plato affirms in his Meneseno,
saying: to the Philosopher, and no other, appertains the government of a
City: and in the fifth of the Commonwealth: Those Cities cannot be happy,
where Philosophers do not govern, and the governors sufficiently know
Philosophy: but he said not, where art Military, and excellent warriors
govern: For the art of war has not only no part in felicity, but rather
is contrary unto it, considering that it destroys humane generation, and is
so much the more imperfecter then science, in that the end of art Military,
may be prevented by fortune, as often times it falls out, which in science
takes no place: and it is most certain, that where Fortune swayeth,
understanding little prevails, and where understanding prevails not, there
is a manifest sign of imperfection. Further I allege, that by how much the
mind is more excellent then the body, by so much are the actions thereof more
excellent then those of the body, which being true, even so must they learned
needs be more excellent then Soldiers.

Considering the actions of the learned have no need of any corporal virtue,
and those of Soldiers are most principally exercised with bodily force; the
philosopher proves that our mind is divine, and immortal, in no other
respect, but because it has his operations distinct from the body: The
learneds operations therefore, being from the body disioyned, they must needs
have in them something divine, and be truly worthy to be placed amongst the
things most honorable: the which notwithstanding by Soldiers cannot be
affirmed: whose actions being wholly intermixed with the body, have in them
that imperfection which the body brings to the mind, and all matter to his
proper form. I could produce many other arguments, to show, that Arms ever
ought to yield to Learning (as good Marcus Tullius affirms) and grant the
Laurel garland to the tongue and eloquence of the learned, which notwithstanding
for brevity sake I pass over; And only in our behalf, I will set down some
examples, for manifestation, that good letters are of force, to exalt men up,
even unto heaven, and to place them amongst the Gods. Lisanias a Noble man of
Arcadia, as Leontius the Greek declares, being in Sciences most profound,
went to Athens, and stirred up such admiration in those people then rude and
barbarous, as that they made him not their King, but worshipped him as a god,
and having dedicated unto him a Temple, was the first that was called Jupiter,
Apis, the son of Toroneus and Niobe: he passing from Argos to Egypt, by
mean of the Sciences, he attained that reputation, as besides, being made
king, he was held and worshipped for a god: And so great was the reverence
toward him, as that by public Edict there was a capital punishment set
down against whomsoever should be so hardy as to call him a mortal man.
Belus, who as Paulus Orosius declares, seigniorized in the uttermost confines
of Egypt, for being an Inuenter and teacher of celestial doctrine, was judged
so worthy, as unto whom there should be built a Temple in Babylon, and it was
called, the Temple of Jupiter Belus. Hermes son to Phylo, a mean man of
Arcadia and Proserpina his own daughter, to avoid the infamy of his
incestuous original going into Egypt, and being in the sciences profound, but
especially in Geometry, Arithmeticke and Astrology, was held for a God, being
called the son of heaven, and day, as he that descending from heaven, in the
day light came to be noted and known. I (most illustrous lady) with these few
and simple reasons, authorities, and examples, have endeavored to confirm our
cause: which of it self is so firm, and secure, as there is no need of
Rhetorical art, for sustentation of it. I assure my self, Signior Brancaccio
in his own conscience well knows, that he defends an unjust quarrel:
although like an honorable Knight, he enters now the field, not to loose
his honor. I can be well content, Signior Patritio (said Brancaccio) that you
may confirm the possession of honor: seeing that can not be lost, which
hitherto is not possessed. It is now long since (answered Patritio) that
reason stood to the arbitrament of Arms, against whose violence learned men
could make no resistance: but now brought to the tribunal of Justice, I hope
the matter will otherwise succeed: and that at last the learned shall be
established intheir proper place and dignity.

Then the Queen: It is hie time you use your arms, Signior Brancaccio, for
otherwise I perceive you in very eminent danger. The affection which your
Highness deservedly bears toward soldiers, (said Brancaccio) is rather an
occasion of your fear, than any eminent danger: for if that be true, which
the other day Signior Gualinguo showed, that honor is the reward of virtuous
actions, and sign of beneficence, the learned shall not only, not have
precedence of the Soldier, but further in honor have little or no interest at
all: Considering honor to science improperly: and to Art Military it properly
belongs, in that from Art Military those actions proceed, whereof honor is
a reward, and from the learned there proceeds no exterior action, whereby he
may be judged worthy of honor. But behold another reason, Signior Patritio,
grounded upon the words of your own Philosopher, in the first of his Ethikes,
where co^paring public with private good, he said: that is to be beloved which
is profitable to one alone, but much more divine and excellent is that which
benefiteth nations, and cities; but this being truth, behold what a good
Logitian I am: Art Military is a perfection which does not help one alone, but
is a furtherance to Nations and Cities: whereas science profits none but the
possessor of it: Therefore Art Military is more excellent and honorable than
Science.

That it is such an help and furtherance, it is a thing very manifest, in that
by his Art, Nations and Cities are defended from ravenous and insolent
ennemies, liberty is preserved, and religion protected: this causes
observance of the Laws, without which the Common wealth would be, as a body
without a soul. Wherefore it was wisely set down in the Proeme of
Institutions, that imperial Majesty ought, not only to be garnished with
Laws, but also with Arms to be adorned. Considering that (as the Ciuilians
do affirm) right and equity smally prevail in a City, and if the sword
procure not obseruaunce thereof.

And Cicero in his Oration for Aulus Cluentius Albinus does affirm, that
warriors are the defenders and ministers of Justice: And the Philosopher
refers one of the principallest parts of a common wealth, to Soldiers: As
also Paulus Orosius writes; the selfsame being by the Philosopher in his
Politickes confirmed, that the first Common wealth amongst the Graecians
ordained, consisted of none other than warriors. In like manner great Lycurgus
knowing, that to a common wealth there was not a more excellent or more
profitable thing than this most noble Art, directed all his Laws which he
gave unto the Spartaines, to the perfection and greatenesse of the Art
Millitarie: through which Laws, the Spartaines becoming most excellent
warriors, they defended and maintained, not only their own liberty, but
further, all Greece, from the innumerable army of Xerxes: that vniuetsall good
is to be preferred, before the felicity of one alone, and Art Military
before science: Marcus Tullius plainly shows in the first of his Offices,
saying in this manner: who is he so curious to understand the nature of things,
that a danger hanging over the head of his country, will not suddenly leave
contemplation, though he thought to measure the greatness of the world, or
number all the stars, and run to succor? We may and ought therefore to
conclude, that art Military as an universal good, ought to precede science,
being but good particular, and consequently Soldiers, the learned: but above
all others, before them, which are called Philosophers, and wise men, who not
content with matters terreine, like the Giants, endeavor to ascend up into
heaven, and make themselves equal with God, as also nourished in idleness,
and knowing themselves unapt to action: attaining to Magistracy, or honors,
swelling up themselves in pride, they retire from civil company into a
solitary life: and after having been mewed up to their studies and Books,
they become lean and macerate, and not able to determine in what manner the
Sun heateth, wholly confounded, they waste themselves in melancholy humors.
But leaving them apart, and coming to the excellency of Art Military, it is
truly an heap of all those perfections, which make a man heroycal in an
eminent degree: and beginning from the virtue of fortitude, this is most proper
to Art Military, and is no less from it inseparable, then light from the Sun.

By this virtue Horatius Cocles was worthy of eternal praise, who alone upon
the bridge opposed himself to the power of al Tuskane, for the safety of his
country. And no less worthy of honor was Leonidas Spartane, who fighting
for his country, yea, and for the liberty of all the Greeks, with three hundred
valiant soldiers, sustained at Thyrmopylis, for the space of three days, the
force of Xerxes army. Temperance, as the preserver of prudence, is necessary
to the perfection of this art: In that he can hardly subdue his enemy, which
has not first an habit in conquering himself: The act of temperaunce toward
the fair women of Daryus, was no less glory unto Alexander, then were the two
victories obtained, by valor, and fortitude: by this virtue, Scipio Affricane,
brought principal glory to himself, and benefit to his country, who in
Spain, being a young man of four and twenty years of age, and without a
wife, restored unto her husband, a most beautiful and noble young woman,
returning unto him for her dowry, the money of her ransom: and by this most
virtuous action he tamed the sierce courage of the Celtyberians, which
peradventure by fortitude he had never subdued. Finally, the Romans, as we
read, triumphed over the whole world, no less by being temperate, than
valiant. The virtue of liberality is altogether necessary, in warrelike Art:
for by this the generous Captain, alluring the minds of his soldiers,
makes them prone to battle, and obtaining of victory. By this virtue, great
Alexander, drew the Macedonian Phalanx into the uttermost parts of the East,
through whose valor he triumphed over Asia. By this Julius Caesar subdued, not
only the barbarous nations, but also drew unto himself the minds of his own
soldiers, to spoil themselves and their own country of liberty, to make him
lord and monarch: and certainly liberty may be said to have bin only proper to
Caesar: magnificence also is no small ornament to this our Art, seeing the
magnificent captain, by this, not only with his own men, but also amongst
strangers, acquireth reputation and glory. Octauian ever coveting to exceed
Mark Antony in those spectacles, the one and other presented to the people, as
in all actions of magnificence, so in battles was he ever against the self
same man victorious: and Alcibiades rather by this, than any other virtue,
obtained honors in his own country, and abroad: magnanimity is no less an
adiunct of military profession, then is whitnes of snow: for that warrior who
has not a lofty and magnanimous mind, shall never accomplish glorious
enterprises: Caesar was of so great a mind, as passing by a little obscure
village, he said unto a soldier that discommended the place; understand
thou, O friend, that I would rather choose to be chief in this place, then
second in Rome: and Alexander for this virtue, surnamed the great, was of so
haughty a mind, as having understood by some, that there were diverse worlds,
sighing, greatly lamented, that being now seven and twenty years of age, he
had not yet conquered nor gotten one. As vaineglory and ambition, obscure the
actions of this ar^e, so does the virtue of modesty, cause it to be
wonderful resplendant: the good African acquired no less glory in refusing
with modesty, the superfluous honors offered unto him, by the Senate, and
people of Rome, then he did in vanquishing and subduing the proud forces of the
Carthaginians: As on the contrary, Alexander obscured his famous acts, by the
vice of ambition, he accepting, by sycopha^ts to be called the son of Inpiter
Hammon, and finally, with all those honors, to be honored, which rather agreed
with the supernall gods, then any mortal man. Clemency also moderatrix of
anger, is in a manner necessary to the managing of this art, in that anger is
an obfuscation to the virtues of the mind, and impaireth bodyly force, and
vigor: wherefore an angry Captain forgetting his art, and stratageme, easily
becomes a prey to his enemy: Caesar, as he was, and ever shall be the
warrior of the world without peer, so of al others was he most courteous and
gentle; neither can we find, that be fought at any time with his enemy
being in fury: and by being much more ready to pardon, then revenge, he
remained finally betrayed, and slain. Whereas on the contrary, Alexander by
the vice of anger, obscured his great victories, for in fury he delivered
Lysimachus to the Lion, pierced the breast of Clito with a lance, and put
Calistheues to death. Affability, and courtesy, though to the severity of
this art, they sceme little befitting and convenient: yet are they profitable,
as the things that procure a Captain to be acceptable, and beloved of his
soldiers, by this virtue Scipio African obtained great honor, and profit: for
he was so affable and domestical amongst his soldiers, that although he had
an exceeding great army, yet saluted he them all by their names. As virtue
cannot be practiced without justice, so also without justice cannot art
military consist: by this the valorous Captain procures himself to be
beloved for hope of just reward, as also to be feared through expectation of
deserved punishment: And not onley moral virtues, but some liberal arts also
seem necessary to the perfection of this art: and amongst others Rhethoricke
produces most admirable effects, which the lesser Scipio manifested in Spain,
who finding his army very licentious, and corrupted altogether with depraved
customs, by a most eloquent oration, without any other means, reduced them to
the Roman discipline: and Julius Caesar by this art of speaking, confirmed
his Soldiers minds in France, astonished with the hugenes of the duch men's
bodies, and therefore he obtained a most glorious victory against proud
Ariouistus: Finally the ancient Captains so esteemed, as also those of these
days, hold the force of cloquence to be so great in art military, that
seldom or never, they enter into battle; but first they confirm the minds
of the Soldiers, by a Martial Oration, enflaming them unto battle. And
being of most notable importance, and a singular precept of art military, to
preserve an army healthful, I will also affirm, that to have knowledge in
some things, which appertain to the art of Physic, cannot but be a
special assistance: for it shall wonderfully import a skilful Captain, to
understand the quality of the air, the goodness of waters, and wines, the
properties of meats: as well in choosing out situation for his encamping, as
for the nourishment of his army: and we may read, that Roman Captains
contended no less in this, then in other martial practices. Architecture
further is necessary to this art, especially that part, which appertains to
fortification, for wanting this knowledge, a captain can neither defend,
offend, nor expugne a city. In this point Julius Caesar was so excellent, as
that of himself he brought admiration to the world, through the towers,
bridges, fortresses, and engines, whereof even yet to this day, there appear
diverse monumentes, and representations. In my opinion (most illustrous lady) I
have manifestly enough declared, that this our noble art, is a consent, and
harmony, of all the worthiest perfections, and an heap of all the virtues:
being an art truly worthy of those men, who for participating of deuinitie,
and mortality, are termed Heroes: wherefore no marvel though Curtius, most
valiant of any other Roman Knight, was by the Oracle of Apollo, approved
worthy to fill up that huge gulffe, in the market place of Rome, as the most
excellent and precious thing which in that city could be found, neither can it
be alleged, but that there were also at the same instant in Rome, men in
learning most excellent, Pythagoras, and Numa having there planted their golden
philosophy. I could further by infinite examples make demonstration, that
military art, is of all other perfections, aptest to exalte a man, even to
the highest degree of glory, but all volumes and writings being heerewith
replenished, I refer my self over to that which the historiographers affirm.
Notwithstanding to open the eyes of the learned, I will affirm, that amongst
the ancientes, arms were ever in greater estimation, then letters, which may
be conceived by the statues, and images, framed of their cheifest gods, and
painted, not with books, or scroules of paper in their hand, but with
instruments of warlike art, they minding to manifest, that without arms,
there could be no perfect deity: they gave therefore unto Jove lightning, to
Neptune and Pluto, a tridental mace, to Saturn, a sickle, or sith, to Apolle,
a bow, arrows, and a darte, to Hercules, a clubbe, to Pallas a shield, a
lance, and helmet, to Diana, a bow, shafttes, and a darte, unto Cupide a bow,
and fatal arrows. And further, the ancients esteemed this art of so great
excellence, as that it could not continue without the protection of some
particular deity. And therefore they esteemed Mars and Bellona, gods of war,
adorning their Statues with warlike instruments, which instruments, they also
thought worthy to be made by divine hand and workmanship, and therefore they
believed Vuicane to be the Gods armourer, which Plutarch shows, saying,
Vulcane at his hot work, does sweat and blow,
To make the piercing shaft for Jove his bow.


Finally, the holy scripture calls the great God, the god of Armies, and not
of the learned: so that Signior Patritio, you may yield your self vanquished,
and not put your soul to compromise, for you well know, that you defend an
unjust cause. Patritio laughed, and said: You Signior Brancaccio show your
self ingrate, yea, and treacherous toward the learned, seeing the Arms, and
art of speaking, from the learned obtained, you use against themselves. And I
am out of al doubt, that if you were not as great a scholar, as a soldier,
you could never in this conflict, have showed your self so aduenturous a
Champion: and yet for all this, the victory shall not remain on your side,
though you have lightly wounded me, for with more mortal blows I have
pierced you. I understand you (said Brancaccio) you would infer, that your
arguments remain yet firm and unshaken, whereunto I have not yet made any
answer: and by commending Arms, that I have not a iotte obscured the glory of
Letters: Therefore from that I have alleged, it may be gathered, that your
first foundation goes to ground: for honor is not a reward of perfection,
which procures the felicity of him alone that possesses it, but is a reward
of beneficence, that helps others: and that it may appear, how your reasons
conclude not against Soldiers, I will set down the difference, which your
Philosopher makes between praise and honor, touched the other day by
Caualier Gualinguo. Praise (says he) is that speech, which notes
singularity of virtue, and is proper to habit, whereupon we usually commend
Praxiteles and Phydias for the habit of sculpture which they had in
excellency: but honor agrees not properly to habites, but virtuous
opperations, For it is the true reward of excellent action, in that if one had
virtue, and should be idle, he might rather be praised, then honored. Now
virtuous opperations being in two kinds, some internal, as to contemplate,
and others external, as to practice arms: it is a thing manifest, that honor
cannot belong to internal opperation, for internal action, being known to
none but to him only that works, it cannot stir up any to honor it: It
must needs therefore be the reward of external action, which being manifest,
not only to the worker, but also to others, moves, and urges the honourer,
who knows it, to give honor thereunto: And therefore the Philosopher says
well, that honor rather consists in him honoring, then in him honored,
minding to make known, that to attain to honorable action, it is necessary
that the action be known for virtuous by the honourer. The actions therefore
of men learned, Signior Patritio, as your self have concluded, being actions
intrinsecall, and only of the mind, as by you learned only they are known and
understood, so you by your selves may inwardly honor them, but these not
manifest to others, you shall rather be worthy of praise then honor: And on
the contrary, the opperations of us Martialists, grounding their internal
beginning in the mind, and discovering themselves to the eyes and ears of
others by mean of valor and virtue of our bodies, as well of praise, as
likewise of highest honor, we are thought worthy: neither can fortune be an
impediment of our glory, although sometimes she hinder victory: For art
Military, as diverse others also, having two ends, the proper end thereof is
victory. And therefore Haniball obscured not a whit his warlike honor, by the
last battle he lost in Affricke, he (according to Scipioes judgment) not
having failed to perform all that, which belonged to a most expert warrior
for the obtaining of victory: neither unto you Signior Patritio, will it be any
blemish, to have been subdued by me this day in combat: for though you have
not persuaded, yet notwithstanding have you spoken in all excellency touching
persuasion. Signior Patritio further alleged, that art Military had no part
in felicity, and much less in honor, seeing it is a consumer of humane kind:
and in this he is deceived, having been by us declared, that it is a good
which universally assisteth nations, and cities, by procuring unto them
observation of laws, and defending them from ennemies: and therefore Marcus
Tullius says well: that of necessity war must be made, to live in peace.
Your Philosopher also commends the making of war, undertaking it for defense
of our country, and to procure safety to them, with whom we have war. This is
conformable also to the holy scripture, where we read that God permits,
yea and commanndeth war, saying to the Hebrew people, Arm you, and confound
these Philistines, enemies to the people of God: and in Jeremy also we may
observe, that God said, Prepare your shields and helmets, put on your
breastplates, ride your horses, and take up your lances against your enemies,
gathering your selves all together to bartaile, and accursed be he who shall not
shed blood against the enemies of the people of Israel. And in the Machabees we
read, that God ever moved and stirred up the people to battle against the
enemies of Israel: And therefore David in the Psalms writes, Blessed be the
Lord, who instructs our hands to battle. And in all the Books of the
Kings, we find, that God commanded battle for the chasticement of
rebels, overthrowing of tyrants, and for the occasion of peace in the
world. Wherefore it would be both a lawful and commodious war, if christian
princes did arm their people against the cruel sword of the East, and enemies
of the elect and chosen people, endeavoring to abate the pride of so outrageous
a tirant, and by force of arms to reduce those nations to better life, and
worship divine, then as they now live with all savage customs. And although it
cannot be done without effusion of humane blood, and some act of injustice,
notwithstanding, of it no reckoning were to be made, seeing without fire and
sword, such a Physician could not heal the like impostume. And not to pass
over any thing whereof our adversary boasts, I say, that Lysanias, Belus,
Hermes, Apis, and other such, were deified, not so much for the knowledge
wherewith they were adorned, as through the action of beneficence. For as these
opperations may by every one be comprehended and conceived, so internal
actions, especially to luskish and stupide people, being concealed and hidden,
they cannot be honored. And this is a thing so manifest, as it booteth not
herein to make any other or further replication. Signior Brancaccio having thus
argued, it seemed to the Queen and all the standers by, that the victory
remained on the Knights part: when Signior Renato Cati standing up on his
feet: Be it lawful for me (said he) most famous Queen, to defend our cause,
seeing Signior Patritio (rather a partialist, then faithful Champion of all the
learned, contemning the preualent arms of Ciuilians, has only drawn out
against him the weak tempred sword of contemplative Philosophy, and yet he
infallibly knows, that these sort of learned, though worthy of praise and
commendations, yet nevertheless are they poor, naked, and contemptible. This
indeed we see every day (said Patritio) for no other cause, but because the
foolish multitude is intentive on base gain, and discerns not the virtue and
demerite of honor. It is proper to the Ciuilians, (thrice excellent Queen
(said Brancaccio smiling) to confound the laws, wherefore no marvel though
Signior Cati, a most famous Ciuilian, has broken the Law of combat by
Champion, and suddenly as a warrior fresh in breath, comes to assail,
judging that I am already weary, and sore wounded: but he is deceived, for I
want neither voice, tongue, nor words, to answer, not only two, four, or
six, but even to the whole rowte^ and troop of learned, and if they have any
thing to say to me.

It is proper to Ciuilians (said Cati) to reform the laws, reducing extreme
severity to terms of equity, for uttermost rigor and severity, is no other
but extreme injury: and it might worthily be thought an injury, if we
without audience or any attention, should loose our action for an other man's
defect: Be it therefore lawful for me to defend the right and prerogative of
Ciuilians, and to give the attendant to understand, that by great odds we
ought to have precedence of Soldiers. And because Signiour Brancaccio
groundeth his intention upon the definition of Honor, which is the reward of
beneficence, not swaruing one jot from it, but to overthrow this argument
with his own arms, I mean thus to argue: whether is of greater moment to
humane kind, Arms, or Letters: It is manifest, that Laws by the great God
were produced together with the world: an infallible Law moves and governs
the heavens: And firm and just law, tempereth the violent contradiction of
elements, seeing whatsoever in one part, the one usurps of an other, in
some other respect at the same instant it restores and recompenceth: To the
inviolable law of Nature, plants give place, and creatures obey. Finally,
laws descended from Heaven, rule this inhumane globe. Arms not from heaven
(although the Poets fabling, and Painters faining adorn therewith the Images
of the gods) but from the profound center of the deeps, by some most malignant
spirit brought to light, so far off are they from helping and benefiting the
world, that rather they waste and tear the Image of God, consume the works of
nature, and overthrow humane inventions. He that should take arms out of the
world, so should he remove injuries and oppressions. For not remaining any
one, who by force would usurp upon another, all things, by the whole some
administration of laws should be governed in peace: And therefore good
Agesilaus was wont to say, that if all were just, there would be no need of
Arms, nor of valor.

He that should remove Laws out of the world, not only cities would
remain as a body without a soul, but al things being left to arbitrament, of
violent arms, and being none who might prescribe just and upright wars, with
the manner how with justice to put them in execution, every thing would go hand
over head, and injuries should never have end, and this would be nothing else
but to remove out of the world that felicity which mortal men in this life
may enjoy. Here peradventure Signior Guilio Caesare will allege, that without
arms, the world should want a great ornament: and that arms (as experience
teaches) are much more apt to make men great and glorious, than any kind of
learning: as also, that statues, crowns, triumphs, and all supreme honors,
are appropriate to vanquishing warriors, and not to Ciuilians or Lawyers, and
he will further urge, confirming the same before he spoke, that arms justly
undertaken, are no other but good. But I against all this will auerre, that
arms are greater trouble, than ornament to the world, they being the beginning
of usurping other men's goods, and bringing free cities into into llerable
servitude, forcing many times wise men, to obey the folly of flagitious and
cruel tyrants: I affirm that unjustly, and through abuse, they erect statues,
give crowns, and triumphs to conquering Soldiers: For what greater abuse or
thing more inhumane can there be, than to seek greatness and glory, from
slaughters, deuastations, incests, sacrileges, rapines: and finally, to triumph
in humane miseries? I say further, that there can no just war be extended,
but that which in defense of our country is made: and all other war, (with
the Philosophers leave be it spoken) is contrary to laws of Nature: which,
as it permits that others may defend themselves, and recover their own, so
suffers it not, that for desire of reigning, one should usurp that whereof
another is lawfully possessor: nature not minding, that one should perform to
another, what he would not have done to himself: but further supposing, that
one might move war against another, how great be the iniquities, that ensue
of that injustice? the innocent people, whom it concerns not to examine,
whither the war be just, or unjust, who are enforced to obey their Princes,
under pain of disloyalty, and rebellion, and the greater part of them having
never taken sword, or weapon in hand against enemies, are taken prisoners,
hewn in pieces, slain, there houses robbed, wives violated, and finally,
Towns, Castles, and Cities put to fire and sword, so that what nature, art,
and humane wisdom, in many years have compassed, by force of arms, in very
short space conmeth to be defaced. Signior Giulio Caesar affirms, that virtue
little prevails in a city, if there be not those, that may procure the
observance thereof: and that vain is council in the Senate, if there be none
to put it in execution: as also that armed Knights, be the ministers of
justice: and in all this, as he says well, so unawares, he secretly confirms
precedence of honor, to the Ciuilians, if peradventure he do not mind to
hold a paradox: that they who execute, are more worthy of honor, then those
that command. Wise Ciuillians, first judge, whether the war be just, or
unjust, neither moves the Captain, or the army without his decree, and
commission, command him: and therefore the divine Philosopher sairh, that the
science, which debateth of war, should sway and rule over the other, which
executes it, minding to infer, that the Ciuillians should, not only have
precedence, but further, even command soldiers: And the Philosopher himself
was of the same opinion, subiecting art military, to imperial art, and
civil science. Our adversary seeks to prevail by an opinion confirmed of
the Philosopher, that the universal must be preferred before the particular:
which being true, arms out of doubt, will give place to the laws; for the
laws without any detriment, bring universal benefit to the whole world. and
arms, though they help, so is it but only one people, and one Prince alone,
whom they further: and yet cannot they effect this, without preiudicing of
many. I would feign find out a Prince, who by his soldiers help, had ever
performed such a benefit to the world, as did the Emperor Justinian by the
Lawyers assistance, in ordaining of laws: this question esse, was an
universal benefit, whereof the whole world might have use, through infinite
ages: but if honor be measured from beneficence, so much more worthy of honor
was Justinian then Caesar, by how much he without detriment, did good unto
all: And Caesar by winning four and fifty battles, benefiting only the
people of Rome, and rather his ownr self, caused the death of many hundred
thousands of men, and defaced an infinite number of Cities and Castles.
Signior Brancaccio further in favor of Soldiers alleges, the authority of
Lycurgus the divine Philoso pher who places warriors amonst the principallest
members in his common wealth. Touching Lycurgus, I refer my self over to
that which the Philosopher affirms in his Politickes, seeing he by most
effectual reasons shows that the laws of Lycurgus, and comonwealth of the
Spartanes, is in the number, of dishonest, and evil ordained co^monwealths: As
for Plato, he in his second, and fourth books of his commonwealth, setting
down the duty of Soldiers, speaks thus: We have placed in the City,
Soldiers as dogs, who to the principal Citizens are to obey, as to Pastors
of cities: and there is no doubt, but by principal Citizens, those are
intended, who administer equity, and justice, as the Lawyers do, and to noble
and geneious dogs, this divine Writer resembles the soldiers, saying, that
like good dogs, they should be vigilant to observe the enemies, ready to
prosecute and follow them, and having overtaken, valiant to set upon them. Out
of this place of Plato, may be gathered conformable to my opinion, that all
other war is unjust, but that which in defense of our country is undertaken:
seeing he ordains soldiers for no other end, but to guard the city, and he
that of them makes other employment, abuses them: and our mortal enemy Cato,
animating unto the virtue of fortirude, says: fight in defense of thy
country: and not to acquire another man's dominion and empire. As therefore it
cannot be denied (most famous Lady) but that arms are for behalf of the
laws, and unto them subject, so must we conclude, that soldiers are far
inferior to professors of the laws, considering that in a city, the one be
as pleaders, and Rhethoritians, the other as porters, and guardians: and this
unto me seems so manifest a thing, as that it cannot be contradicted. But
because I perceive by the gestures and motions of his person, that our
obstinate adversary, long since, impatient of attention, is most defirous to
speak, I will here pawse, assuring my self, that he, considering he wants
neither voice, tongue, nor words, will never give place to manifest reason: but
confident in his eloquence, he will attempt to retort, the upright and sincere
judgment, of our most gracious Queen. Eloquence prevails greatly in lawyers
(said Brancaccio) and so far, that many times it hazardeth the good conscience
of a sincere and equal Judge: whereof I doubting, to the end that the entire and
impartial indgement, of our illustrous moderatrix, may remain unspotted, and
immaculate; I will make it known, that Signior Cati, has done like that
incircumspect Greek, who to terrify the Trojans, putting off his own, armed
himself with the arms of fearce Achilles. Notwithstanding, before I lay open
his sophistications, it is necessary, that somewhat more amply difcoursing, of
that which to a warrior appertains, I play the Philosopher searches out the
secrets of Nature, and infallible providence of God: it cannot be denied most
famous Lady, but that Nature is unto man a scepmother, and to the other
creatures a most kind and tender mother, for she has not only made them
strong of body, but with natural garments so covered, and natural arms so
fortified them, wherewith most fierce, they proudely go forward, without
fearing offense: and such creatures as she has produced them, weak and
unarmed, so has she provided them swift feet, or light feathers and wings,
to the end, that flying or running away, they might withdraw themselves from
danger. Man should have been naked, unarmed, and of al other creatures weakest,
and exposed to all kind of injury, if by fingular grace of the heavens there
had not been granted unto him, the excellent gift of the mind, and light of
reason: the which, what Nature has denied him, it does doubly suppeditate.
This at one instant adorned him with arms, and armed him with laws, to the
end, that by arms, he might securely walk amongst the most cruel beasts,
and by laws lead a perfect and civil life. It is therefore to affirm, that
laws descend from heaven: and arms were drawnefrom the deep, for both the
one and the other were works of reason and equity; and consequently, were
both celestial inventions. And as it is true, that laws without arms cannot
consist, so is that false which the adversary affirms, that to take arms
out of the world, were a bringing in of that felicity, which most of all in
this mortal life is desired: for without arms, the laws would not only be
vain and frivolous, but a man, botne to rule over Creatures, being weak and
unarmed, should be a prey to more terrible beasts; neither should they
against them have any greater defense, then have the little Pigmeans against
the Cranes. But admit we grant without prejudice to truth, that Laws are more
noble then Arms, yet for all this cannot Signior Cati conclude, that the
Ciuilians Doctrine is of greater esteem then Art Millitarie, nor that
Generals of Armies are to give place to Doctors of the Laws. For if such a
prerogative should be granted, it must not concur with the Ciuilians or
Lawyers, but with the Law giuers, considering that those who establish Laws,
be great Princes, or commonwealths most prudent men, or for some heroycall
virtue most excellent as were Draco and Solon, who gave Laws to the Athenians,
and Lycurgus the Lacedaemonians Lawgiuer, Numa Pompylius that prescribed laws
to the Romans. Faleus to the Carthaginians, Mercurius Tresmygistus to the
Egyptians, Zoroastres to the Persians, and Bactrians, Minos to the Cretans,
Charondas to those of Tire, Zalmosi to the Tartarians, Hippodamus to the
Milesians, Plato to the Cicilians, and other such like: But to dilate alittle
touching that doctrine, whereof the Ciuilians do so insult, as Signior Patritio
numbering up the Sciences, and Arts liberal, has not placed it in his
Catalogue, so think I it a thing very difficult, to find any place for it
amongst habites speculatiue and active. Among the Sciences it cannot be
recounted. For Science being nothing else, but to understand the thing by his
proper and infallible cause.

The Ciuilian demanded of that he knows, can allege no other cause, but
that the Laws say so, or Doctors thus affirm: It cannot also properly be
termed an Art, except after the same manner as Petrarch calls it, that is, an
Art of selling words and lies: For though she be conversant about the Laws,
as the proper argument of her doctrine, yet can she not alter nor transform
them into diverse forms, as other Arts do their matter and subject: For Laws
by the Ciuilians cannot be transinuted, but by great Princes and Lawgiuers:
which the Lawyers observing, and not knowing with what other title to honor
this their science, have termed it knowledge of equity, or iuris prudentia,
which signifies no other, but that wise dome which is conversant in
administering equity and justice, according as the Laws command. Nay but I
will further affirm, that this their faculty cannot likewise be aumbred
amongst the moral virtues: For the Philosopher discussing of that particular
virtue called Justice, says, that it is conversant about justice distributrue
and commutatiue, that is, in placing reward and punishments, and reducing
contractes and permutations to equallitie. And this virtue being well
considered in her foundation, is not proper to Lawyers, but unto Law-giuers:
For the Lawyer or Cruilian is about three things conversant: To interpret the
written laws, To aunsweare according to Law, And to judge aunswerable to the
Laws, or according unto those customs, which by inueteration are of like
force and vigor as the Laws. Out of this we may draw a conclusion
conformable to the Philosopher, that the written Law, is a silent Law: And
the Lawyer is no other, but the lively or speaking Law: and so consequently,
that the virtue of Justice depends not on him, but on the Lawgiuer and Law.

The Philosopher affirms, that there be three conditions or qualities of men:
some distrusting authority, yield only to reason: Others not Very capable of
reason, easily rest satisfied in authority: And a third sort, who incapable of
reason, do likewise contemn the authority of the wise; and as these last, of
all other be the worst, and the second give proof but of a dull conceit, so the
first note a most eminent and pregnant wit, and such are the Philosophers
speculatiue, who seek after truth, and not authority. And the Captains in
war be those, who despising other men's authority, are governed only by reason;
among the second sort, lawyers are recounted, whose doctrine is wholly grounded
upon authority, and therefore they were wont to say, that one is not worthy to
be heard, that speaks without authority; and out of this a maxim may be
gathered, that Lawyers of themselves know nothing, but that their knowledge
depends upon other men's opinions, so that many times when they would
answer, or determine, without having any eye to the force of reason, where
there is no written Law, they fall a reciting their opinions, who have
scribled a number of Book cases, and for the most part, tie themselves
thereunto, as to a most certain and infallible rule. And the confusion of
these Doctourshippes is so great, who have written rather for gain and
oftentation, then through any zeal of justice, as that often amongst
themselves, they plead not what is most reasonable and just, but what is most
usual and common: a thing surely worthy of division, and also compassion, as
though the opinion of ten ignorant were more to be esteemed, then the sentence
of four wise me^: whether these sort of learned (most renowned Lady) should
precede warriors, who with notified valor adorn their countries, with a
thousand Troops, administer argument to writets, to immortalize themselves,
and consecrate unto memory martial proceedings, and magnanimous attempts, it
is easy to judge. By that which has been spoken, it is clearly manifest,
that Signior Cati sets forth laws with the person of the Lawgiuers, unto
whom they bring princes and men heroycall, it shall not be greatly
inconvenient, that armed men give place, seeing these determine and command the
wars, as also determine the place of Generals in an army, and not Ciuilians,
as he constantly affirms, except peradventure he mean, that it is all one
to command over Soldiers, as over executions, or the minister of justice,
this being a proper office of ciuilians. This truth may be conceived by the
description the philosopher makes of his excellent and well ordained
commonwealth, wherein he divides the Citizens into four orders, that is,
Warriors, Senators, judges, and priests, and describing their offices, he
calls not the soldiers by this brutish terrne of dogs, but maintainers,
defenders, and ministers of just wars: and to the Senator, he allotieth
administration and government of things public: And these men it concerns to
determine of war or peace, and to these soldiers give place, for in such a
degree they are to be reputed as Lords and princes. And to Judges, who are no
other then ciuilians or lawyers, belongs the office of determining and
deciding controversy. The priests who are the ancientest, reduced as it were to
their last and most perfect end, he assigns the care of things holy. And we
must observe, that although to frame a city of it self sufficient, there be many
conditions of men required, notwithstanding, to fashion a commonwealth, the
philosophers mind is, that these four orders should suffice: and he
altogether excludes those mechanical degrees, which practice sordide, and base
professions, as those, who of virtue are incapable, the rather being
instruments, then part of a city. If therefore authority grounded on
effectual reason, be worthy of credit, it cannot be true, that ciuilians in
a city, are as Rhethoritians, neither that their office is to command over
Warriors, although their authority stretches to command over sergeantes and
executioners: for they sit to judge and determine controversies, and not to
govern public affairs: yet is this no impediment, but that a Lawier may have
place in the Senate, and be in the number of Rhethoritians, when he shall not
only understand that which Vlpian teaches, but shall further possess a part of
those singular virtues, wherewith Signior Cati is adorned, and al these most
excellent Ciuilians, out of doubt most worthy counselors, of our thrice
illustrous Prince. Seeing unto these the name of Lawgiuers, rather agrees,
then ciuilians or Lawyers: Signior Cati further infers, that of laws, and
lawyers the benefit is much more universal, then that of arms, and soldiers:
seeing Laws assist the whole world, and arms benefit but one city, or a
Prince alone: and that the benefit of the laws, is ever without other
detriment: but arms cannot pleasure without others offense: we have
sufficiently declared, that arms universally are beneficial, if they be moved
and undertaken with justice, and that God him self, by his own mouth
commands wars: as also that just victory is no less profitable to the
vanquished tha^ victors: For they vanquished, are by it reduced to a better
life, for if arms were wicked, because of offending others, the like should
the laws be, which cannot be executed without blood: The laws command that
menquellers be slain, quarrellers, and wounders, to be recompensed with the
like measure, that thieves, adulterers, sacrilegious, and finally all
malefactors, be bitterly punished: notwithstanding, because this is done
through zeal of justice, and that the good may enjoy peace, those laws are
good, as also the Lawyers, if with justice they execute them: but if they be
unjust, they do more hurt then wicked soldiers, for soldiers preserve
their friends, and by all evil means offend their enemies, whereas covetous
and auaricious Lawyers, by giving hope of safety to their friends, have no
other drift or intention, but to gnaw them even to the bones. And to speak
truth, of all sorts of men, the unjust Lawyer is most pernicious. I could
allege (most illustrons Lady) many other reasons, to manifest, that Lawyers,
though they be worthy of honor, yet are they not therefore to be preferred
before soldiers: but because I see my ship now approaching near her port,
passing over to custom and common use, I affirm thus much, that Dukes, Kings,
and Emperors themselves, are called Knights, but never Doctors: and armed in
Iusts, Turneyes, and also in the midst of the field, in Battle they show
themselves amongst warriors, but in assemblies and Courts of Ciuilians,
Lawyers, or other learned, they never present themselves for disputation sake:
and this for no other cause, but in that the exercise of arms is proper to
great and mighty men, and more honorable then that of Letters. Do we not
further see, that in solemnities and ceremonies, where precedence is specially
regarded, that great Captains and men of war, go nearer the person of the
king or Emperor, then Secretaries, Chancellors, or Counselors, although they
be great Doctors, and maruailous learned men: this being a manifest sign,
that of the same Kings or Emperors, Arms are far more highly esteemed then
Letters, and Soldiers then Doctors. But if nothing else sufficed, the
judgment of women ever infallible, might serve for certain proof, that
warriors are more to be esteemed then Doctors, we seeing that the greater
part of women are rather carried away with the love of knights, then men
learned, neither can the joy be imagined, which they feel in their hearts,
when they see their lovers appear in Iusts or Turneyes, armed with their
embleames and fanours by them given: and for their sakes to arm themselves,
break lances, and run their gallant steedes and Coursers. So that grieve it
you not, Signior Cati, to rest content in common sentence and approbation, and
to leave unto us warriors the highest degree of honor, seeing we have both
obtained and preserved it, not with writings or vain words, but with true
valor, labor, and blood, putting your self in mind of Milciades answer, who
deruaunded which was worthiest of greater estimation, Homer the great learned
man, or Achilles the noble warrior, so much more, said he, is Achilles to be
valued above Homer, as is the Conqueror more then he, who with sound of
trumpet publishes his victory. Here Signior Giulio Caesare stayed: and
Signior Cati minding to reply (whom preualent reasons failed not for defense
of Lawyers, the Queen with her finger imposed filence, and commanded the noble
Lady Countess, that she should pronounce her sentence, who after a little
meditation, censured in this manner; We having heard, and well considered the
reasons both of one and other party, do determine that Civil honor, which is
the reward of excellent and heroycall actions, ought more specially to be
yielded to men of martial profession, and that veneration, proper to things
divine, befitteth the wise and learned: but reforming better this our
definitive sentence, let us enact, that watriours be esteemed honorable, and
doctors reverend. This deep judicial sentence of the Lady countess, was by all the standers by, admired. And with this, issuing out of the Barge, and
mounted in sumptuous Coaches, the Ladies and Knights having accompanied the
Duke and Lady Duchess to the Palace, they all departed to their several
houses.

FINIS.
