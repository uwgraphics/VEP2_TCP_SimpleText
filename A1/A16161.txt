THE PROTESTANTS EVIDENCE, TAKEN OVT OF GOOD ^^^ORDS; Showing that for Fifteen
hundred years next after CHRIST, diverse worthy ^uides of Gods Church, have in
sundry weighty points of Religion, taught as the Church of England now does:
DISTRIBVTED INTO SEVERAL CENTVRIES, and opened, By SIMON BIRCKBEK, Bachelor in
Divinity, sometime Fellow of Queens College in Oxford, and now Minister of
Gods Word (...) Gilling in RICHMONDSHIRE.

LONDON, Printed for Robert Milbourne, and are to be sold at the Sign of the

TO THE RIGHT WORshi^full, HV^FREY VVHARTO^ of Gillingwood, Esquire, Receiver
General of his Majesty's R^v^nues within the Arch-Deaconry of Richmond the
Bishopric of Durham, and Northumberla^d, my much respected Patron, Grace and
Peace be multiplied.
Sir,
THe free access which you made me, for the exercise of my Ministry within
your donation, (what time, besides other Suitors, you had a son of your own,
whose sufficiency of Gifts might have anti-dated his years, and made him
capable of greater Preferment, had God been pleased to have continued his life)
has so far engaged me unto you, that I have laid hold on the first
opportunity, whereby I might manifest my thankfulness unto you; which I could
not better express, than by Dedicating this Treatise to your Name and Memory,
beseeching God, that as he has hitherto done great things for you, and given
you a Benjamins portion above your brethren, Gen^s^^ 3.34.
so he would still continue his favors to you and yours, and bless you, both
in your own person, and in your fruitful and promising offspring. Now if
this Treatise seem not no suitable a Present either to your years or
disposition, which call you indeed rather to a point of Devotion, than
Disputation; the truth is, it is a Controversall Treatise, yet it is withal a
just and Defensive War, which I have undertaken, rather for the clearing of our
own (cast, than the infesting of others; and the end I aim at, is to discover
the truth, and guide others therein; And I know it would please you at the
heart, to see such as have gone astray, reduced into the old way, Ierem. 6.1^.
which the Prophet calls the Good way. If any shall reap benefit by this
Work, and thank the Author for his pains, I shall forthwith take them up,
and bestow them wh^re they are due, namely, next under God, upon your self,
upon whose Gleabe these first Fruits of mine grew, and are now (in such sort as
you see) gathered into this Storehouse, and sequestered into several
Centuries, for the Churches use and benefit, by one of her meanest Proctors, but

Your much bounden Kinsman, and Beneficiary, SIMON BIRCKBEK.

TO THE READER.
CHristian Reader, this Treatise was first occasioned, and afterward composed
in manner as follows: The Prophet Hosea 7.8.
Hosea says of Ephraim, that he had mixed himself among the people; that
Ephraim was as a Cake on the hearth not turned, baked on the one side, and raw
upon the other; that is, Popula^ Israel non solum f^it inf^ctu^ Idololatria
Jeroboam, sed and Idololatrijs Gentilium existentiu^ circa populum Israel. Lyra
in loc.
in point of Religion, was partly a Jew, and partly a Gentile. It was my lot to
fall upon a Charge, which like Ephraim, was part Protestant, part Papal, and
the one side questioned with the other, Where their Religion was before Luther?
Whereunto I addressed such answer, as I thought might satisfy the weak, and
repress the clamourous; but the matter growing to farther debate, it
occasioned me to draw a Catalogue of our Professors. Now it fell out, that
about the same time, M Doctor ^e^^ly (one who is exc^llently verst in
Controversies) had with good success stood up in this quarrel with Jesuit
Fisher. I acquainted him therefore with the business, and he gave me the
right hand of Fellowship, Galath. 2.9.
encouraging me to go on with my Catalogue: but I found it too hard a task for
me, (though I had good helps from others, namely from the wel-furnished
Libraries of my much respected friends, Master D. Potter, the worthy and
learned Provost of Queens College in Oxford, and Mr. W. Richardson, Minister
of Gods Word at Borough Church in Westmerland, a very learned and revere^d
Divine, and also my good neighbor M. Nathaniel Hawksworth) to procure such
Records as might prescribe for 1500 years together: so that it caused me
travel as far as Oxford, there to visit those famous private and public
Libraries, where I became an eyewitness of diverse parcels of Evidence, whereof
I made use in this Treatise. And now havi^g my materials about me, I though^
my self tollerablie furnished for the Work; and yet if I had had ^he whole
Bodleian-Vaticane Library about me, I might sometime have bin at a stand, if I
had not had some Living Library to consult withal. Whereupon (having to deal
with a company of subtle Adversaries, like the sons of Zerviah, of whom
David complained, 2 Samuel 3 39.
that they were too hard for him; and lest the truth, and the Churches Cause
might seem to suffer through my weakness) I repaired, by intercourse of
Letters, to my learned Counsel Mr. Dr. Featly, and he (I thank him) was
ready to resolve me when I was in doubt, and to direct me, (yea and correct
me also) when I was at default; and indeed I was well pleased with the
Obeliskes and dashes of his pen; for, as Solomon says, The wounds of a lover
are faithful. Prove. 27. v. 6.
I have used the help of Ancient and Modern Writers, foreign and domestic,
and namely, the Reverend and learned Bishops, and Doctors of our Church;
insomuch as I may say in Samsons language, Judge, 14.18.
That if I had not ploughed with their Heifer, I had not so easily unfolded
diverse Popish Riddles. I have dealt faithfully in the business, not wresting,
nor wittingly misalleadging any Authors testimony, nor yet slightly
proposing the Adversaries Argument: for that had been to have set up a
shaw-fowle of mine own framing, and then have battered it in pieces with mine
own Ordna^ce; but I have done as the Israelites, who went down to the
Philistims to sharpen their tools: 1 Samuel 13.10.
I have set as keen an edge on the Adversaries Arguments, as Bellarmines,
Parsons, or Brereleyes Forge could afford. I conf^sse the Work is larger, than
I either desired, or expected; but it could not well be otherwise and speak
fully to a thousand years and a half, and withal clear the Evidence as it
went, from the Exceptions of the Adversary. I have also been long about it and
so my worthy Doctor tells me; but withal he puts me in hope, it may prove
like the ^ardius enascitur seris umbram factura N^potibus Cupressus.
Cypress tree, which though it be long a growing, yet when once it is grown
up to a tree, the shade of it s^rves for an harbor to the child unborne, the
issue hereof I leave to GOD. This only I may truly say of this Work, It has
stood me to some charges, and cost me much pains and travel; Al which (were
it an hundred times more than it is) I should think well bestowed, if the
Church of God, and my Charge profit by me, and the Christian Reader pray for me.

THE PREFACE TO THE PROTESTANTS EVIDENCE.
PAPIST. GOod morrow Neighbor, are you going to Church so early?


PROTESTANT. I am Sir, and I should be glad of your company.


PAP. So should I be of yours; but I doubt, we go not to the same Church.


PRO. I am going to a Protestant Church, and I take that to be a true member of
the Catholic.


PAP. It is not; for the true Church is ever gloriously visible, and had
visible Professors in all ages; but yours was not in being, ( Prot. Apolog.
Tract. 3. chap. 2. sect. 2. p. 330.
says Father Brereley) until Luthers days: and Father Campian Testes res
omnes and reculae, nullam in orb religionem nisi nostram imis unquam radicibus
insedisse. Camp rat. 10.
calls to witness, res omnes and reculas, all things both great and small,
things and thinglings, that never any other Religion but the Catholic, took
any deep root upon the face of the earth. And he says further, That Seculis
omnino quindecim, non oppidum, non villam, non domum reperiunt imbutam doctrine
sua. id. rat. 3.
one cannot spy out so much as one town, one village, one house for fifteen
hundred years that savoured of your doctrine: And Jesuit Coster says,
Constat manifest, nemine^ to^o o^be mortalium, ante M. Lutherum, hoc est, an^e
annu^ 1517 (...), qui eam fidem ten^r^t. Coster. E^ch^^id. Co^trovers. cap. 2.
It is manifestly evident, that none in the universal world before Luther, in
the year 1517, held that Faith, which Luther, and Calvin's Scholars professed.


PROT. This is but a vain ^lourish of the Jesuits, and controuled by their
own man Bristow, who acknowledges, that Bristowes Motiv^s. Presat. and Motive

some there have been in many ages, in some points, of the Protestants opinion.

Now for our Tenet, this it is; The Church, (that is the society of Christian
people, professing saving faith) is never totally hidden; but there be still
some, that hold the right faith, and deliver it over to others; and yet in time
of persecution, and the like cases, the Church is not always so conspicuous,
as that a man seeing her outward pomp and ceremonies, may point her out, and
safely join himself to such a company: for thus Sub regimine Romans P^rt -- i^a

Bellarmine makes the Church to be a Society subjecting themselves to the Sea
of Rome, teaching truth without error, and this Company as visible, as are
the Citizens of Rome. Now for the Protestant Church, though it have not bin
always gloriously visible; yet it has been evermore so visible, as the true
Church ought to be.


PAP. Saint Austin says, In Sole, id est^ in mani^estatione. Aug. t^m. 7. cont
lit^ Petil. l. 2. cap 32.
He has set his Tabernacle in the Sun; Is not the Church then conspicuous as
the Sun?


PROT. You may not argue from such Allusions as are taken from the outward
pomp of the world, thereby to describe the inward beauty of the Church.

2. Besides, according to the true reading, So^t po^uit taberna^al^m in eis, id
est, in ci^ti^ Hie^on. i^ Psalm. 18. to. ^.
the mea^ing is; he has set up a seat for the Sun in the heavens, that there
it might be viewed as on a scaffold: now this Sun may be eclypsed.

3. Again, this was only an Allusion which Saint Austin used against the
Donatists, (who pinned up the Church within a corner of Afri^k, as now the
Papists confine her to Rome) thereby telling them, there were many Churches
besides theirs, to be seen as clear as the Sun, if the Donatists could
discern them.

4. Lastly, though Austin termed the Church in diebus illis, in his own time,
to be set as it were in the Sun; yet he denies not, but that afterward, in
declining ages, this Sun might be darkened, and the Church make but small
appearance in the time of persecution, as the same Father Ecce^^ia non
apparebit, impi^s tunc persecuto^ibu^ v^tra modum savientibus. Aug. epist. 80.
tom. 2.
speaks.


PA. The Church is as a City upon an hill Math. 5.15.16.
, a light upon a Candles^icke, and therefore conspicuous.


PRO. 1. This also is an Allusion, which yet Saint Chrysostom Chrysostom. in
Math^ c. 5. hom. 10. tom. 2.
understands to be meant of the Apostles; that they were to look to their
car^iage, since they were to preach abroad, and had many looke^s on.

2. Again, though the Church be set on a hill, yet as the Aramites could not
discern ^he city of Samaria, whither the Prophet led them, till their eyes
were opened, 2 Kings chap. 6. no more can one discern, or difference the true
Church from the malignant, and conventicles of the wicked, until his mind be
enlightened. And thus Austin Montem ^on vide^^, n^lo mireris; oculos non habent.
August tract. 1. in epist. Joan. tom. 9.
told the Donatists, they could not see the Church on the hill, because their
eyes were blinded, to wit, either with ignorance, or malice.

In a word, this Hill may be hid with a mist, this Sun obscured with a
cloud, and the Moon ecclipsed. The blessed Apostles were no corner-creepers,
yet were they not seen and acknowledged for true prof^ssors by the Scribes and
Pharisees, that dwelt but hard by in Iewrie.

Howsoever, what is this to Rome, if she hold the socket, and want the light?
if she be seated on a hill, yea seven hills, like A^o^al. 17.9.
Babylon?


PA. Will you call Rome Babylon?


PRO. Your own Jesuits Babylon matter fornicationum, Roma quidem est. Ribera
in cap. 14. A^ocal. nu. 39.
call Rome Babylon; neither can this be meant of Heathen Rome, but of Rome
Christian, and as it shall be at the end of the world: for so speaks De Roma
intelligendum, non solum quali^ sub Ethnicis I^peratoribus olim fuit, sed etiam
qualis i^ fine seculi futura est. Riber. in 14 Apocal. nu. 42.
Rib^ra; and Colligitur ^o^am, extremis mu^di ^^mp^ribus, post quam a f^ie
defe^erit, ad s^mm^m potentiam perve^^uram. Vi^gas in cap. 18. Apoc. com. 1.
sect. 4.
Viegas says, After that Rome shall fall from the faith. Now Heathen Rome
could not fall from the faith, since it never professed the faith: therefore
the prophecy is to be fulfilled in Rome Papal, and Christian.


PA. If thy brother offend thee, Math. 18.17.
tell the Church; then must we needs know the Church.


PRO. 1. We are bid tell the Church, that is, her Pastors and Governors, when
there is such a standing Ministry, and public discipline exercised.

2. But in case Tyrants hinder the open meetings of Christians; even then also
in some good sort, though she be not so outwardly visible to her foes, yet
may the Church take notice; as the faithful in the primative Church met
together privately, and observed orders for reforming of abuses, being known
one to another as friends, but unknown (as such) to their foes.

In a word, one may tell the Church, though for the time she be hid from her
foes; even as one may tell a message to his friend, who for the time is hid
from his enemy.


PA. Some of yours say, Napier (...) the Revel. P^op. 35.
The Church was invisible for diverse ages.


PRO. They say not it was simply invisible, but they speak respectively; so
that looking on those times, which fell out somewhat before, and after the
first six hundred years, and seeing the title of Universal Bishop (which
Grego^y detested as Quisquis se univer^^le^ Sa^er^otem ^o^at in ^^tion^ sua
Anti^h^^st in (...). Greg. ^pi^t. lib. 6. ^p 30 to. 2.
Antichristian) settled on the Pope, about the year 666, and that this Revel.
13.18.
number so fitly agreed to the Man of sin: as also looking downward to the
thousand year, wherein Satan was Revel. 20.3.
loosed, and the Turk and Pope grew great; looking hereon, and comparing the
Church as she was then (under Gregory the seventh, Ann. 1075.
Hildebrand, forbidding Marriage, and deposing the Emperor) with her self in
the primitive ages, they said she was in manner invisible in the Western
Horizon, to wit, in respect of that degree, and measure of the light of the
Gospel that brake forth in the time of the Reformation. Besides, during the
time mentioned, it was visible enough, in the Greek and Eastern Church: and
for the Western, it had the same subsisting and being with the best members
in the Roman Church.


PA. Master Napier says, Napier on the Revelat. p. 68. and 191 and 161 cited
by the Prot. Apology tract. 2. cap. 1 sect 4.
Our Religion has reigned universally, and without any debatable contradiction
1260 years; Gods true Church most certainly abiding so long latent and
invisible: And Master Perkins (...) E^posit. of the Creed. page 400
Pe^kins says, That for the space of many hundred years, an universal
Apostasy overspread the whole face of the earth, and that your Church was not
visible to the world.


PRO. Master Napier says not, that your Religion reigned so universally;
neither does he speak in general of the whole body of the Romish Faith, and
of the universal Antiquity thereof, which is the point in question; but only
of the first original of the papal dominion, and Antichristian kingdom, as
he calls it, as Bishop Morton has well Prot. Appeal. ^. 1. c. 8. sect. 2.
in Marg. lit. F.
observed: neither yet was this papal Hierarchy, or as Master Perkins calls
it, Master Perkins on the Creed. page 307.
popish Heresy of being entitled, Universal Bishop of the Church, carried
without the opposition of several Counsels, and Worthies in Gods Church; as
(God willing) hereafter shall appear.

For the place cited out of Master Perkins, it is as we in our common phrase of
speech use to say, That all the world is set on mischief, because so many
delight in wickedness. Neither is this manner of speech unusual in the
Scriptures, From the Prophet to the Priest, all deal falsely, says Ie^emy
6.13. and Omnes querunt que (...). (...) in 2. (...) Ph^lip.
Saint Paul says, All secke their own, and not that which is Jesus Christ's,
Phil. 2.21. besides he says, I^ had overspread the face of the earth: Now a
large fi^ld may be overspread with Tares and weeds, and yet some good corn
in the field: Neither says Master Perkins, that our Church was simply
invisible, but that it was not visible, to the world; and withal he tells us
where it was. It lay hid (says he It lay hid un^e^ the ch^ffe of Pope^^^, and
the truth of this, the Reco^ds o^ ^ll Ag^^ ma^^fe^^. M. ^^rkins on the (...).
^ag. 4.^.
) under the chasse of Popery. Now the grain is not ut^erly invisible, whiles
it is mingled with cha^se in the same heap.


PA. Was not the Church ever gloriously visible?


PRO. It was not; for (as S. Austin (...) in solo Ab^l (...) August. in Psalm
12^ tom. 8.
says) it was sometimes only in Abel, and he was slain by his brother; in
Enoch, and he was translated from the ungodly; it was in the sole house of
Abraham, Noah, and Lot.

Afterward how was it so notably conspicuous, when as both Israel and Judah
fell to Idolatry, 2 (...). 28.24. and ^9.7.8.
in the times of Achaz and Manasse? when as those Kings caused the Temple to be
shut up, the Sacrifice to cease, and erected Idols in every Town?

Besides, at our Saviors coming, we find but a short Catalogue of true
professors mentioned, to wit, Joseph and Mary, Zachary and Elizabeth, Simeon
and Anna, the Shepherds in the fields, and some others.

When Christ suffered death, his little flock (as he called it) ^
was scattered, his disciple ^led, ^
and none almost durst show themselves, ^
save Mary and John, and some few women, with others.

After our Saviors death, the Apostles, and their followers were glad to meet
in ^
Chambers, whiles the Priests, Scribes and Pharisees bare all the sway in the
Temple; ^o that (as the Page 1^.
Treatise of the true C^urch^s visibilitie ha^h it) if a we^ke body had then
enquired for the Church, it is likely, they had been directed to them.

In ^he time of those Ten persecutions, there could not be any known assembly
of Christians, but forthwith ^he Tyran^s labou^ed to root them out: but (as
T^rtullian says) S^men est Sanguls Christianorum. Tertull in Apologet. cap. 50
to. 1.
The blood of the Martyrs was the seed of the Church, they were pe^secuted, and
yet they increased.

Af^erwards, when the Arrian Heresy overspread all, so that all the world was
against Athanasius, and he, and some few Confes^ors stood for the Nicen Faith;
(insomuch as Hierome said, Ingem^it totus orbis, and Arri^num se esse miratus
est. Hieron. advers. Luciferian. tom. 2.
The world sighed and groaned, marveiling at it self, how it was become
Arrian,) what a slender appearance did the true professors then make? and yet
in such dangerous and revolting times, even small Math. 18.20. Phil^m. 2.
assemblies of particular congregations, wheresoever dispersed, serve to make
up the universal Church Militant: so that the Reader is not to be discouraged,
if he find not the Protestant Assemblies so thronged, since it was not so with
the primative Church; and S. John foretold, Apocal. 12 14.
That the woman, that is, the Church, persecuted by the Dragon, that old
Serpent the Devil, and his instruments, should fly into the Wilderness,
where the Lord promised to hide her, till the tempest of persecution were
over-blowne; wherein God dealt graciously with his Church, for had her enemies
always seen and known her professors, they would (like cruel beasts) have
labored to devour the damme with her young, the mother with her children.

Now whereas the Papists brag of their Churches Visibilitie, their own
Rhemists are driven to confess, Rhem. Annot. on Thessal. 2.2. sect 6.
that in the reign of Antichrist, the outward state of the Roman Church, and
the public intercourse of the faithful with the same, may cease, and practice
their Religion in secret: And Jesuit Suarez thinks it probable, Non est
incredibile, Romam prope Antichrist^ tempora, it a a^^lic^a^, ut quasi in
Angulo, ^el in ^avernis terrae delitescat. Suarez Defensio fide^ Cathol. lib.
5. c. 21.
That the Pope shall profess his faith in secret. Where is then your
Tabernacle in the Sun? your light in the Candlestick? when as your Church
and Pope shall walk with a dark Lantern, and say Mass in a corner.


PA. Why was not the Church always so conspicuous?


PRO. Because sometimes her best members, (as Athanasius, Hilarie, Ambrose, and
others) were persecuted as Heretics, and ungodly men; and that by learned
persons, and such as were powerful in the world, able to draw great troops
after them, of such as for hope, favor, fear, or the like respects, were
ready to follow them: In this, and the like case, when false Priests broach
errors, and deceive many, Tyrants persecute Gods Saints, and cause others to
retire; then I say, (when the faithful want their ordinary intercourse one
with another) the number of the Church malignant maybe great, in comparison of
those that belong to the true Church.


PA. If the Church were not always so conspicuous, in what sort then was it
visible? a visible Church you grant.


PRO. In the general militant Church, there have in all ages been some Pastors
and people, more or less, that have outwardly taught the truth of Religion in
substance, though not free from error in all points; and these have been
visible by their ordinary standing in some part of Gods Church.

Besides, for the more part there have bin also some, that withstood and
condemned the gross errors and superstition of their times; and these good
men, whiles they were suffered, taught the truth openly; but being persecuted
by such as went under the Churches name, even then also they taught, and
administered the Sacraments in private, to such faithful ones as would join
with them; and even in those harder times, they manifested their Religion by
their Writings, Letters, Confessions; at their Judgment, Martyrdom, or
otherwise, as they could.

Now (as learned Doctor White in his Defense of his Brothers book has
observed) The Orthodoxe F^i^h. chap. 3. Paragraph 3.
whenever there be any Pastors in the world, which ^ither in an open view,
or in the presence of any part thereof do exercise (though in private) the
actions of true Religion, by sound teaching the truth, and right administration
of the Sacraments, this is sufficient to make the Church visible, by such a
manner of visibilitie, as may serve for the gathering and preserving of Gods
elect. Now such visible Pastors and people, the Protestant Church was never
utterly destitute of.


PA. You seem to make the Church both visible, and invisible.


PRO. May not one be within, and seen with his friends, and yet hidden to his
enemies? visible to the seeing, and invisible to the blind? Indeed Tyrants,
Infidells, and Heretics, they knew the true believers, as men of another
profession; but blinded with malice and unbelief, they acknowledged them not
for true professors: Acts and Monuments. vol. 2. lib. 10. pa. 1616.
as M. Bradford told D. Day, Bishop of Chichester; the fault why the Church is
not seen of you, is not because the Church is not visible, but because your
eyes are not clear enough to see it; and indeed, such as put not on the
spectacles of the Word to find out the Church, but seek for her in outward
pomp, are much mistaken.

Aelian in his History tells us of one Nicostratus, who being a well-skilled
Artisan, and finding a curious piece of work drawn by Xeuxis that famous
Painter, one who stood by, wondered at him, and asked him, what pleasure he
could take, to stand as he did, still gazing on the picture: to whom he
answered; (...). AElian. (...) Histor. lib. 14. cap. 47.
Had thou mine eyes, my friend, thou would not wonder, nor ask me that
question, but rather be ravished as I am at the inimitable art of this rare and
admired piece. In like manner, if our Adversaries had their eyes anointed with
the eye salve of the holy Spirit, they might easily discover the Protestant
Church, and her visible congregations. The Aramites, 2 Kings 6. chap. could not
discern the city of Samaria, whither the Prophet led them, until their eyes
were opened; no more can one discern, or difference the true Church from the
malignant, and conventicles of the wicked, until his mind be enlightened. And
thus Saint Austin told the Donatists, Mo^tem non vident, nolo ^^^^eris; oculos
non habent. August. Tract. 1. in epist. Joan. tom. 9.
They could not see the Church on the hill, because their eyes were blinded, to
wit, either with ignorance, or malice.

Saint Austin compares Ecclesia propter ipsam mutabilitatem Luna nomine in
Scripturis signatur. Aug. tom. 8 in Psalm. 10. and tom. 2. ^p. 119.
the Church to the Moon, which waxes and waneth, is eclipsed, and sometime,
as in the change, cannot be seen; yet none doubts but still there is a Moon.
The Church sometimes shines in the clear days of peace, and is by and by
over-cast with a cloud of persecution, as the same Austin Aliquando obscuratur.
Id. ep. 48.
says: The Moon is not always in the Full, nor the Church ever in her
glorious aspect.


PA. If your Church were always visible, where then was it before Luthers time?


PRO. I might also ask you, Where was a great part of your Religion before the
Trent Council, which was but holden about the year 1534.

Now for our Religion, it was for substance, and in the affirmative parts, and
positive grounds thereof, (the question being not of every accessory, and
secondary point,) it was I say, contained in the Canonical Scriptures, whereas
you are driven to seek yours in the Apocryphal, in the Trent Creed, the Trent
Council. Now ours it was contained in the Apostles Creed, explayned in the
Nicene and Athanasian, confirmed by the first four general Councels, taught
in the undoubted writings of the true, ancient, and orthodox Fathers of the
primative Church, justi^ied from the tongue and pen of our adversaries;
witnessed by the confessions of our Martyrs, which have suffered for truth, and
not for treason. This is the Evidence of our Religion; whereas for proof of
yours, in diverse points, you are driven to fly to the bastard Treatises of
false Fathers, going under the name of Abdias Linus, Clemens, S. Denis, and the
like; as sometime Perkin Warbek a base fellow feigned himself to be King
Edward the fourths son, and for a time went under his Fabian. Chron. ad Ann.
1495.
name: and yet these Knights of the post, must be brought in to depose on your
behalf, though others of your side have cashiered them as counterfeits Se^ D
James of the Bastardy of false Fathe^s, and D. Raynolds Conference, Chap 8.
Divis. 2.
.


PA. If your Professors were so visible, name them.


PRO. This is no reasonable demand; you have rased our Records, conveied our
Evidence, clapped up our Witnesses, and suborned your own; you have for your
own advantage, (as is already showen by that learned Antiquary of Oxford, D.
James A Treatise of the corruption of Scripture, Councels, Fathers.
, and others, and shall (God willing) appear in the Centuries following,) you
have I say, corrupted Counsels, Fathers, and Scriptures, by purging and
prohibiting what Authors, and in what places you would; and now you call us to
a trial of Names.


PA. Particular men may mis-coat the Fathers, but our Church has not.


PRO. You have; witness your expurgatory and prohibitory Indices, or Tables,
whereof since my self have of late bin an eyewitness, and seen diverse of
them both in the public and private Libraries in Oxford; I will therefore
acquaint the Reader with the mystery thereof.

When that politic Council of Trent perceived, that howsoever men might be
silenced, yet books would be blabs, and tell truth, they devised this course:
They directed a Commission to a company of Inquisitors, residing in several
places, and thereby gave them power to purge and prohibit all manner of Books,
Humanity and Divinity, ancient and late, in such sort as they should think
fit. Upon this Commission, renewed as occasion served, the Inquisitors set forth
their several expurgatory, and prohibitory Indices, printed at Rome, in
Spain, in the Low Countries, and elsewhere; and in these Tables (yet to be
seen) they set down what books were by the^ forbidden, and which to be purged,
and in what places ought were to be left out, whenever the Works should be
printed anew: for according to their Tables or Corrections, books were to be
printed afresh. Now to make sure work, they got as many of the former Editions
of the Fathers works, as they could, into their hands, and suffered no new
Copy to come forth, but through their fingers, purged according to their
Receipt: neither feared they that their adversaries would set forth the large
volumes of the Fathers Works, or others, having not the means to vent their
Impressions, being forbidden to be sold in Catholic countries. By this means,
the Roman Censurers thought to stop all tongues and pens, that none should
hereafter speak or write otherwise than the Trent Council had dictated^ and
so in time all Evidence should have made for the Roman cause.

Hereby the Reader may perceive, that had their device gone on, they would in
time, by their chopping and changing the writings of the Ancient at their
pleasure, have rased and defaced whatsoever Evidence had made for us, and
against themselves. But so it pleased God, that howsoever they had carried the
matter cunningly in secret, yet at length all comes out, their plot was
discovered, and their Indices came into the Protestants hands. The Index of
Antwerpe was discovered by Iunius D. James part 4. of the Mystery o^ the
Indices expurgatorij. page 21.
; the Spanish and Portugal was never known till the taking of Cales, and then
it was found by the English.


PA. Might we not purge what was naught?


PRO. Indeed, if you had purged or prohibited the lewd writings of wanton
Aretine, railing Rablais, or the like, you had done well: but underhand to go
and purge out the wholesome sentences of the Fathers, such as were agreeable to
the Scriptures; thus to purge those good old men, till you wrung the very blood
and life out of them, bewrays, that you have an ill cause in hand, that
betakes it self to such desperate shifts.

Neither can you justly say, that you have corrected what others marred: for it
was your side that first kept a tampering with the Fathers Works, and corrupted
them. Francis Iunius reports, ^unius in praefatione art ^ndicem Expu^gato ium
B^lgi^um ^ se editum. 1586. referente Andr^^ Rivet lib. 3. Critici Sacri. cap.
16.
that he coming (in the year 1559) to a familiar friend of his, named Lewis
Savarius, Corrector of a Print at L^yden, found him over-looking Saint Ambrose
Works, which Fr^llonius was printing; whereof when Iunius commended the
elegancie of the Letter and Edition, the Corrector told him secretly, it was of
all Editions the worst; and drawing out many sheets of now waste paper from
under the table, told him, they had printed those sheets according to the
ancient and authenticke Copies: but two Franciscan Friars had by their
authority cancelled and rejected them, and caused other to be printed, and
put in their rooms, differing from the truth of all their own books, to the
great loss of the Printer, and wonder of the Corrector: so that had yo^
prevailed, neither old nor new, Greek, nor Latin Fathers, nor later Writers,
had been suffered to speak the truth, but either (like Parra^s) been ta^ght to
lispe Popery, or for ever bee^ put to sil^nce. The best is, the Manuscripts
(which by Gods providence are still preserved amongst us) they m^ke for us, as
D. James, excellently versed in Antiquity, has showen at large D. Ia^e^ his
Manuduction to Divinity.
.


PA. Have ^ee purged ought in the Fathers, or Scriptures, that was not to be
purged?


PRO. You have, as appears by these instances following; St. Chrysostom in
his third Sermon upon Lazarus, and elsewhere maintains the pe^spicuitie and
plainness of the Scrip^ures, saying, In (...) S^riptur^s (...) quaecunque ^unt
nec^ssaria Ch^ysos^. tom. 4. in 2 Thess^l. h^mil. 3.
That in divine Scriptures all necessary things are plain. He likewise
holds, that faith only suffices in stead of all, saying, Illud unum
ass^verave^im, quod so^a fides p^r se salvum sec^rit Chry. ^o. 3. de Fide and
L^ge natu^^. and to. 1. in P^al. 13.
This one thing I will affirm, That faith only by it se^fe sa^eth. In like
sort Saint Hierome holds, Impium per sol^m ^idem ^usti^icat De^s Hier. to. 9.
in ca. 4. ad Romans
That faith only justifies, that works do not justify, that Images are not
to be adored. Now all this is to be found, even totidem ve^bis, in the self
same terms in the Fat^ers text; and yet the Index of Spain (published by
Cardin^ll Quiroga, and reprinted at Samur, by the honor of the French
Gentilitie, the Lord of Plessis) comes in, and gives these Fa^hers a strong
purge, commanding ^x Chrysost^mi Indice edit. Basi^^ae delea^tur --
Iusti^^^^tio ex fide sol^; Scripturae omnibu^ volentibus perviae ac ^a^ile^ --
^x Ind^ce Hieroa^^^ ^^lende sunt -- Fides sola justi^icat. Imago (...) tanti^

Sal^u^i. 1601. and M (...). 1584.
all the sentences above named, to be blotted out of the Fathers Indices, or
Tables.

In like sort has another Index of Spain Ind^x (...) j^ssu Be^nar^i ^e
Sand^^al and R^xas M^^i^i, 1^^2. and per ^ur^etin ^en^u^ 1019.
, printed at Madrill, reprinted by Turretine, and still preserved and kept in
the Archivis, or Treasury of Monuments in the ^ublike Libra^y at Oxford, dealt
with the Index, or Table of S. Austin and Athanasius, as by these few instances
may appear.

Blot out, say the Spanish Inquisitors, Ex Indi^e Augustini delent, Non m^r^t^
nostra^ seu^ (...) De^^ coro^^t in nob^^; ^el^nt^ Sancti ^o^norandi imit^ti^^e,
non ad^ratio^e; Ex Athanasij Ind^ce d^^ent, Ad^ra^i solius Dei est. Creatura
nulla ad^ran^^. Creatura^ creatura no^ ado^er. Index Expurgator^ quo su^ra.
these words out of Saint Austins Index, to wit, When God crowns our merit^s
(that is good deeds) he crowns nothing else but his own gifts: and, The
Saints are to be honored for imitation, not to be adored for Religion: as
also out of Athanasius Index, that God only is to be worshipped, that the
creature is not to adore the creature. Now all these must be rased out,
notwithstanding they be the selfsame words, which these Fathers used in the
Text Ipsissima verba sun Augustini; C^m Deus coronat merita nostra, nihil aliud
coronat quam munera sua. tom. 2. ep. 105. Et Honorandi sunt propter
imitationem, non adorandi propter religionem. tom. 1. de vera relig cap. 55.
and (...). Athanas. orat. 3. contra A^rianos.
.

Now this is no good dealing, since these Tables and Indices t^uely gathered
out of the Fathers Works, might have served for a hand to point at the
chiefest Sentences in each Au^hour; but they have either remooved, or turned
the hand aside, to the great hi^derance of those, which upon a sudden occasion
are to see what such a Father says to such a point, and have not the leisure
to peruse over the whole book.


PA. We have not purged the Fathers Text, but only the Index.


PRO. You have put out the very Text it self out of Saint Cy^ill, whose words
are; Cy^il. Al^xandr. to. 5. comment. in Esaiam lib. 1. cap. 1. Fidei autem
gratiam, etc.
Now this faith which is the gift and grace of God, is sufficient to purge, not
only them which find themselves somewhat ill, but those also that are
dangerously diseased: Now all this is commanded to be blotted out by the
expurgatory Index of Spain Ex Divi Cyrilli Commentarijs in Isaiam Laurentio
Humphredo int^rp^ete; ^x T^xtu deleantur illa verba; Fidei autem gratiam, cum
his qui valde inquinati sunt, tum etiam paulum m^rbo ^ff^ctis, satis ad
emundationem valituram esse fidem dicit. Index Expurg. per Quirog. Mad^id^ 1584.
.

Neither can it be justly replied, that these words are put out of Cyril, as
not being the Authors words, or not truly translated by our men; for they be
Cyrils own words faithfully translated, and the copy agrees with the
Original; yea, this golden sentence thus rased, is still to be found in
Cyrils Works, set fo^th by your own man Gentian Hervet.

Neither yet has Gods Book escaped your finge^s, witness the Bible set forth
by your own men: The B^ble of Robert Stephens, with the double Text, and
Vatablus Annotations.
there we read in the Text [ Levit. 26. chap.] according to your translation;
Thou shall not make to thy self an Idol, and graven thing: your Index says,
Deleatur illud, Sculptilia prohibet si^ri. Ind. Expurg. per Quirog. Madrid.
1584.
Blot this out of the marg^nt, that graven things are forbidden.

Again the Text says [1. King. 7.3.] Prepare your hearts to the Lord, and
serve him only; your Index says, Deleantur illa Verba. rv^endum soli Deo.
Blot out this gloss, that we must serve God only. Besides, Christ is noted
to be the sacrifice for our sins; now these words, Christ is the sacrifice
for our sins, must be dashed out Psalm. 39. lit B. ad ma^g deleantur illa
verba; Christus hostia p^o peccatis nostris.
. In like sort, they have blotted out these words in Vatablus Annotations Ex

qu^ vero non^ peribunt. ^ud. Ex^^^^. M^drit. 1612.
; They that believe in God shall be saved, and they that believe not shall
perish.

Now if these sayings alleged, be to be found in the Fathers and Scriptures,
not only in the same sense, but totidem verbis, in the same terms; why do
they then blot them out of the Fathers Indices, or the Margents and
Concordances of the Bible? they might as well raze them out of the very Text of
Fathers and Scripture; but this they durst not openly attempt, and therefore
under hand they wound both Scripture and Fathers through the sides of their
Expugatorie and Prohibitorie Tables.


PA. Your men have published Parsons Resolutions, and Grenades Meditations,
and therein have changed and altered diverse sentences.


PRO. Some private men amongst us have dealt so with some late Writers; but
withal they professed, that they had changed and altered their words; thereby
to show, that with a little help, your books, such as do tend to godliness
of life, might lawfully be r^ad of us; now what you did, you did it secretly,
and under hand, whereas ours dealt plainly and openly. Besides, you have
altered, and changed the writings of the Ancient at your pleasure; and then
would make the World bel^eve, you have only corrected the faults of the Print,
or some such matter.

Now as you work by your Expurgatory Indices; so do you also by your other
trick of Prohibitorie; whereof you make this use, that in case (upon the
evidence given in by good Authors) the verdict be like to go on our side;
then you bring a Prohibition^ and remove the matter to be tried by Tradition.

But it is no wonder you prohibit our Writers; for you have forbid Gods Book;
and called it into the Inquisition; Forbidding the having, or reading of any
part of the Bible in the vulgar Tongue Quaeritur, (...) ex^ediat sacra volumina

, tho it be set forth by Catholics; and, howsoever you wink at the matter
where you cannot help it, yet in countries generally Popish, as in Spain, and
elsewhere, The Bible and each part thereof in the vulgar tongue, is utterly
prohibited, as your own Jesuit witnesses In H^spania, in Indice librorum

To close up this point, you have labored to root out all memory of our
Professors: for example sake, Is King Edward the sixth styled (and that
worthily) A Prince of admirable towardness? Is Frederick Duke of Saxony
termed, Christianissimus Princeps, A most Christian Prince; this commendation
of King Edward must be left out in the next impression, and so must the Dukes
title of Christian Prince: and thus they deal with our Writers, Is Melanch^on
termed A man famous for all kind of learning? and Bucer surnamed the Divine?
does Beatus Rhenanus in his notes upon Tertullian call Pelicane A man of
admirable learning and holiness of life? All these Epithets and Titles the
Romish Inquisitors have commanded to be blotted out Page 148. Ex Michaelis

Translations. And another Jesuit tells us Ex^ungenda sunt nomina, nisi in

, that Our names must not be suffered to stand upon Record: nor Protestant
Writers once so much as to be named either in their own Works or others,
unless it be per contemptum, by way of scorn and reproach; and yet you bid
us name our men.


PA. We have purged some books, but not corrupted the Scriptures.

Traditions of equal credit, and to be embraced with the like godly affection,
as the Scriptures are to be reverenced. Is not this to mingl^ water with wine,
base metal with good Bullion? and so indeed a corrupting of Scripture.

Besides, you have (which is Revelat. 22.18.19.
fearful) detracted from Gods Word, tha^ which was written with his own
finger, to wit, the second Commandment, against the worship of Images; and
because the words thereof are sharp, and rip up the heart strings of your
Idolatry, you have therefore omitted them in your Catechismes, Vaux Catechism

Pius Quintus; and to salve up the matter, lest thereby we should have no more
then nine Commandments, you have cut the tenth into two. You might well have
left the words ^here, that Gods people might know there was such a
Commandment, howsoever they had counted it, the first, or the second.

Now, as you have detracted, so you have added to the rule of Faith, by
thrusting into the Canon, the Apocryphal books, which Hierome (the best
languaged of all the Father,) Hi^ronym tom. 3. in Prologo Gal^ato in Prae^at.

rejected.

Lastly, you do not only allow, but impose on others a corrupt translation of
Scripture, to wit, the vulgar Latin Edition, whereas we refer our selves to
the Originals. Now surely, we may better trust an original Record, than a
Copy extracted thence; and it is more wholesome to drink at the wellhead,
than at a corrupt and muddie stream. Now the Latin Edition (which you follow,
and prefer before all others) it is but a Translation it self; but the
Hebrew and Greek which we follow, are the Well-springs and Originalls. Is not
this now a manifest corrupting of Scripture, to bind all men, (as your Trent
Council does Nemo illam reij cere quovis praetextu audeat. Synod. Trid. Sess.

PA. I look to have your Professors named.


PRO. Restore us entire our Evidence which you have marred, and made away;
return us our Witnesses which you have chained up in your Vatican Library, and
elsewhere, and we accept your challenge. But do you indeed look to have our
professors named? and why so? the true Church of God may be visible, though
the names of her visible professors from time to time can not be showed: there
might be thousands of professors in former ages, and yet (happily) no
particular authentic Record of their names now extant; or if extant, yet so as
we cannot come by them. Nevertheless (to answer you at your own weapon) I
hope to make it clear, that God has dealt so graciously with his Church, as
that he has continually preserved sufficient testimonies of his truth, that
are ready to be deposed on our side, and that successively from age to age: so
that I may say, as Saint Ambrose did in the like case; Et literas quidem
potuistis abolere, sed fidem non potuistis au^erre. Ambros. ^om. 2. de Spirit^
Sancto. lib. 3. cap. 11.
You may well blot out our Letters, but our Faith you shall never abolish.
Papists may conceal our evidence, and wipe out the names of our Professors out
of the Records; but when all is done, the Protestants faith is perpetual.

Now, in that we yield thus far to their importunity, we do not this, as if
it were simply necessary for the Demonstration of our Church, to produce such a
Catalogue of visible Professors in all Ages; but only out of the confidence of
the truth of our cause, and partly to stop the mouth of our clamorous
adve^saries; For it is Tertullians Rule, Tamen in ea^em side ^onspirantes non
mi^us (...) d^pu^antur pro ^^orsangui^^^ate (...) ^e^^ullian. de (...) ^dve^s
(...) tom. 2.
that A Church is to be accounted Apostolic, if it hold Consanguinitie of
Doctrine with the Apostles. Now, what though we could no^ successively name
such as taught as we do; yet because God has promised there should be always
in the world a true Church, (having either a larger or smaller number of
Prosessors, (it suffices that we are able out of Scripture to demonstrate that
we maintain the same Faith and Religion, which the holy Apostles taught, and
Christ would have to be perpetual; this I say suffices to manifest our
Succession, although all Histories were silent of the names of our Professors.

Now, that I am to speak of the Church in her several and successive
Centuries and Ages, to give the Reader some Character and touch thereof, I will
begin with the first 600. years next after Christ; wherein ten several
times during the first three Centuries, the Church was persecuted by Tyrants,
and almost continually assaulted by Heretics; yet in the end, Truth prevailed
against Error, and Patience overcame her Pers^cutors. This is the time wherein
our learned Bishop Jewel, challenged the Papists, to show any Orthodoxe
Father, Council, or Doctor, that for the space of those 600 Years, taught as
the present Church of Rome did: the like challenge was lately renewed by my
dear friend, that worthy Divine, Doctor Featly of Oxford, challenging ^
the Jesuits to produce out of good Authors, any City, Parish, or Hamlet,
within 500. years next after Christ, wherein there was any visible assembly,
that maintained in general, the Articles of the Trent Council, or such and
such points of Popery, as at the Conference he named in particular. Now of
this period, the first 300. years thereof, ^
were the very flower of the Primitive Church, because that in the^e days the
truth of the Gospel was infallibly taught, by Christ and his Apostles, and
that in their own persons; as also by othe^s that lived to hear, see, and
converse with those blessed Apostles, and disciples of Christ Jesus; and this
(happily) made Egesippus, an ancient Author, call the Church of those days,
(...). Hegesippus apud Eusebius lib. 3. Hist. cap. 32. and lib. 4. cap. 22. edit.
Graec.
an incorrupt and virgin Church: and yet was this virgin Church ill entreated
by such a sowed the tares of error, which yet the careful husbandman in time
weeded up: neither indeed for the space of these first 300, could those Tenets
of Popery get any footing, their Papal Indulgences were yet unhatched, their
purgatory fire was yet unkindled; it made not (as afterward) their pot boil,
and their kitchen smoke; the Mass was yet unmoulded, Transubstantiation was
yet unbaked, the treasury of Merits was yet unminted, the Popes transcendent
power was uncreated, Ecclesiastickes were unexempted, and deposing of Kings yet
undreamed of: the Lay People were not yet couzned of the cup, Communion under
one kind, was not yet in kind, it was not then known, that Liturgies and
prayers were usually and publicly made in a tongue unknown: they did not then
worship and adore any wooden or breaden god; they worshipped that which they
knew, and that in Spirit and truth John 4.22.24.
, and they called on him, in whom they believed Romans 10.14
: so did they, and so do we. In a word, in the former ages of the Church,
Satan was bound, after the thousandth year he was loosed, and after the
middle of the second Millenary, about the year 1370, he was bound anew.
Concerning the Churches estate in the next five hundred years, The Estate of
the Church in the 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 Age.
it grew very corrupt: so that of these times we may say, as Winefridus, borne
at Kirton in Devonshire, after surnamed Boniface, was wont to say, Beat
Rhenanus lib. 2 rerum Germanic. page 98. Bonifacius rogatus an liceret ligneis
cal^^ibus sacrificare; respondit, oli^ aureos sacerdotes ligneis vas^ulis

In old time there were golden Prelates, and wooden Chalices, but in his time
wooden Prelates, and golden Chalices; knowledge was now decayed, Princes,
Prelates and others were now more busied in building, or beautifying material
Temples and Chapels, than in the gathering together of living stones, and
reedifying Gods spiritual Temple: so that in this time of Monkery, many
religious Houses were erected, either out of voluntary Devotion, or enjoined
Penance: Now, instead of the right administration of the Word and Sacraments,
came in the dumb guize of the Mass; and the people instead of the pure milk
of the Word, were entertained with feigned Liturgies, Legends, and Miracles,
and their consciences laden with a number of unprofitable Ceremonies, and
unwarrantable Traditions; now there was great con^idence put in holy Grains,
hallowed Beads, Agnus Dei's, and the like Babies; and the honor due to the
Creator, was given to the crea^ure. Now the people made many fond vows, went
many merry Pilgrimages, and beheld many garish Processions; now they were
taught that ab^tinence from meats and drinks was Meritorious; that the opus
operatum, the work done was sufficient in their Sacraments, and their
Devotions, and much of this service performed in an unknown tongue. Now the
crowns of Martyrdom wherewith the first Bishops of Rome were honored, were
changed into a Triple Crown, and the Pastoral Staff, began to quarrel
with the Princely Scepter; and all these things were carried by the name of the
Church, the People many of them believing as the Church believed, and this
Church was the Roman, and this Roman Church, was the Pope.

The Chur^hes state in the 12.13.14.15. and 16. ^entu^^^s.
Concerning the Church in the next 500. years, even to these our times; the
Church began to recover her strength^ and the light of the Gospel was notably
discovered by Waldus in France, and his followers, Wickliffe in England, John
Hus, and Martin Luther in Germany. Now also by the benefit of Printing (which
was found out in the fifteenth Century,) the Tongues came to be known,
Knowledge increased, Books were dispersed, and Learning communicated; the
Scriptures were perused, the Doctors and Fathers read, Stories opened, Times
compared, Truth discerned, and Falsehood detected.

Now because there has already, and will hereafter be occasion to speak of
Antichrist; I will therefore here point out his several Ages. About the year
607. Antichrist began in part to appear and show himself, rising by degrees
until he came to the height of impiety; for as other things, so Antichrist
also, was to have his rising, growth, height, and fall; even as monstrous and
huge Beasts go with their young ones many years, as other creatures do many
months. The maine strength of the Romish Antichrist consisted in those two
Swords, the Spiritual and Temporal; now the Pope did not at once attain to
the managing of these two Swords; but by degrees he came to usurp this
twohanded Sword.

The first step that he made to the throne of pride, was about the year, 607,
when Pope Boniface the third, by the grant of that murderer Phocas, took to
himself the Title, Authority, and Supremacy over the whole Church.

The next time, that he notoriously showed himself, was after the thousand
year, when Gregory the ^eventh claimed and usurped both the Swords; that is, a
Sovereign and Universal Jurisdiction, not only Ecclesiastical over the
Clergy, but also Temporal over Kings and Emperors: unto this second
Soveraigntie they had long aspired, but never attained until the time of this
Hildebrand, in whom Antichrist came to his growth: yea, the Pope was discovered
to be Antichrist by those Catholic Bishops, the Bishop of Florence Florentinus
Episcopus a^firmare solitus [est] Antichristum natum esse. Platina in Paschal.
2.
, and Robert Grosthead Bishop of Lincoln Ergo si qui^ animas perdere non
^ormidat, nonne Antichristus merito est dicendus? Math. Paris. in Henr. 3. ad
an. 1253.
, and others. Upon this discovery of the Man of Sin, sundry of Gods people
refusing the Mark of the Beast, severed themselves from the Papal Communion;
whereupon the Pope and his Faction raised grievous persecutions against the
servants of God.

To speak yet more particularly; the degrees of Antichrist may thus be
reckoned. He had his Birth or rising in Boniface the third, Anno 607.
who took to himself that Antichristian title, of universal Bishop, which
his Predecessor Gregory so greatly condemned. He had his growth, Ann. 788.
or increase in the time of Pope Adrian the first, and the second Council of
Nice, who jointly agreed to set up the Adoration of Images, and the practice
thereof to be generally received in the Church.

Ann. 1^75.
He came to his Kingdom, and reigned in Pope Hildebrand, who excommunicated
and deposed Henry the fourth, the lawful Emperor, and gave away his Empire to
Rodulph, and after his death to others.

Ann. 1517.
He was in his jollitie, and triumphed in Pope Leo the tenth, and his Lateran
Council; s^ewing himself a God in pardoning sins, delivering souls out of
Purgatory, defining Faith; setting himself above a general Council,
controuling, and judging all men, himself to be judged by none; professing
(for so it is recorded of Gregory the seventh (...) Deus (...) se errare n^^
p^sse gloreatur. Ave^t n. Annal. Bo^o^^^ l^^ 5. p^g^ 5^3.
) That he was a God, and could not err.

In a word, (as my learned kinsman has deciphered him) (...) of the sit^ (...)
Co^n^ell. (...) ^3. (...).
when he usurped an universal authority over all Bishops, the Pope was but
Antichrist Nascent; when he maintained the doctrine of Adoration of Images, he
was Antichrist Crescent; when he exalted himself above all Kings and
Emperors, he became Antichrist regnant; but when he was made Lord of the
Catholic Faith, so that none must believe more, nor less, nor otherwise then
he prescribed, he became Antichrist Triumphant. Thus did the Pope in process
of time become a perfect Antichrist, playing the Hypocrite and Tyrant, both in
Church and State; exalting himself a^ a Monarch over Gods house; making his
own word, and definition, of equal authority with holy (...) Pontisi^is
Summ^^ (...) and (...) lib. 2. c^p. 2.

(...) B^ll^r. lib. p^imo page 1^. c^p. (...).

Scripture; usurping temporal Jurisdiction over Civil States, murdering
Christ's servants that yielded not to his beck. His last Age, is his declining
age, wherein the Lord by the spirit of his mouth [2 Thessalonians. 2.8.] that is, by
the Ministry of his Word, Shall consume this Man of Sin; and this is come
to pass in part; For he is already fallen into a Consumption, whereon he
irrecoverably languisheth, notwithstanding all the help that can be made him,
by his College of Physicians, Canonists, Schoolmen, Priests and Jesuits; but
for his final Destruction we must expect it at the glorious coming of our
blessed Savior.

The sum of all is this, the Pope having pearkt himself above his fellow
Bishops, it grieved him to be subject to Kings and Emperors; not to exalt
himself above them, he distracted both Church and State in the point of
Image Worship, which occasioned much bloodshed in Christendom, and then having
weakened the Empire, he became superior to Kings and Emperors: there being
nothing now but the Church in his way, he prevailed over it by his Lateran
Flatterers, who set the Pope above a general Council, that is, above Gods
Church; a General Council being indeed the Representative Church of God here
on earth, and the Pope himself being the Vertuall Church, for so Gretser
confesses, Per Ecclesiam intelligimus pontificem Remanum. Grets. Def. cap. 10.
li. 3 de verbo Dei Iam. p. 1450. and ibid. A^. page 1451. non abnuo.
that by the Church they do mean the Pope for the time being. Now to this
height the Pope came under pretense of the Churches government, the Churches
discipline racking the spiritual censure to a civil punishment; by the Church
solemnities in crowning Emperors; by his Excommunications, Absolutions, and
Dispensations, he rose to his greatness of state; by the doctrine of works
meritorious, Jubilees, Pardons, and Indulgences, he maintained his State.

And now I come to show out of good Authors, that in nine several weighty
points of Religion, the best guides of Gods Church for the space of 1500
years, have taught as the Church of England does.


THE FIRST CENTVRIE, From the first year of Grace, unto the year One Hundred.
Christ Jesus and his Apostles the Protestants Founders.
PAPIST.
WHom do you name in this first Age, that taught the Protestant Faith?

PROTESTANT.
I name our blessed Savior Christ Jesus, and his Apostles, Saint Paul, and his
Scholars, Titus and Timothy, together with the Churches which they planted,
as that of the Romans, Corinthians, and the rest. These I name for our first
Founders, and top of our kin, as also Joseph of Arimathea, that buried Christ's
body, a special Benefactor to the Religion planted in this land. These taught
for substance, and in the positive grounds of religion, as we do in our
Articles, Liturgies, Homilies and Apologies, by public authority established
in our Church of England. Besides these, there were but few Writers in this
age, whose undoubted Works have come to our hands; yet for instance sake I name
that blessed Martyr of Christ, Ignatius Bishop of Antioch, who for the name of
Jesus, was sentenced to be d^voured of wild beasts, which he patiently
endured, saying, Eusebius Histor ^^cles. lib 3. cap. 33.
I am the Wheat or grain to be ground with the teeth of beasts, that I may be
pure Bread for my Masters tooth: let fire, rackes, pulleys, yea, and all the
torments of Hell come on me, so I may win Christ. Here also, according to
the Roman Register, I might place Dionysius Areopagita, whom they usually place
in this first Age, as if he were that Denis mentioned in the Acts 17.34.
Acts, whereas indeed he is a post natus, and in all likelihood lived about
the fourth Age, and not in this first; for Denis (...). Dionys. epist. ad
Demophil.
says, That the Christians had solemn Temples like the Jews, and the
Chancell severed, with such and such sanctification, from the rest of the
Church; whereas the Christians in this first age, made their assemblies to
prayer, both in such private places, and with such simplicity, as the Apostles
Acts 1.13. and 12.12. and 20 8.
did, and as the times of persecution suffered Andr. Rivet. Critici Sacri. lib.
1. cap 9. rat. 6.
them.

Again, Denis tells us, that when he wrote, Monks were risen, Dionys.
Eccles. Hierar^h. cap. 6.
and they of credit in the Churches, and many Ceremonies to hallow them;
whereas in the Apostles time, when the true Dionysius lived, Monks were not
heard of; yea, Chrysostom says, (...). C^^ys. Homil 25 in Moral. super cap.
11. ep ad Hebr.
That when Paul wrote his Epistle to the Hebrews, there was not then so much
as any footstep of a Monk.

PA.
I challenge Saint Denis for ours; he was ( as our Rhemists Rhemists Annot. on
Acts 17.
say) all for the Catholics.

PRO.
Take him as he is, and as he comes to our hands, he is not wholly yours, but
in some things clean contrary to you; as namely in the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper, wherein you vary from us most. Besides, he has not your sole
receiving of the Priest, nor ministering under one kind to them who receive, nor
Exhortations, Lessons, Prayers, in a tongue which the people understand not, he
has not your Invocation of Saints, no^ adoration of creatures, nor sacrificing
of Christ to God, nor praying for the souls in purgatory: so that in things of
substance, and not of ceremony only, he is ours, and not yours, as I hope will
appear by his Writings: for we will (for the time) suppose him to be a Father
of this first age, although the books which bear Saint Denis his name, seem
to be written in the fourth or fifth age after Christ.

PAP.
Can you prove that Christ and his Apostles taught as you do?

PRO.
We have clear testimonies of Scripture, Math. 26.27. and 1 Cor. 11.23, etc.
which appoint Gods people to receive the blessed Cup in the Sacrament, and to
be present at such a divine service as themselves understand 1 Cor. 14.15, etc.
; we have express command forbidding Image Worship Exodus 20.4. Deuteronomy. 4.15.
; against Invocation of Saints it is said Esaias 63.16.
, that Abraham knows us not, and Isaac is ignorant of us; and the blessed
Angel refused all religious honor and Adoration Apoc. 19.10. and 22.8, 9.
. Likewise against Merit of works, and works of Super-erogation, it is said
Romans 8.18.
, that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with
the glory which shall be revealed in us; and that we are unpro^itable
servants, when we have done all that was commanded us, we have but done that
which was our duty to do, and the like.

PA.
You allege Scripture, and so do we; yea in some things the Scripture is
plain for us, as where it is said, Math. 26.26.
This is my Body.

PRO.
What though it make for you in show? so does it for the Anabaptists, where it
is said, Acts 4.32.
that the Christians had all things common: you will not hence infer, that
because in such an extremity, their charity (for the relief of others) made
things common concerning the use, that therefore we should have no property in
the goods that God has given us? It is not the show and semblance of words,
but the sense thereof that imports the truth. Saint Paul says of his Corinths,
1. Cor. 12.27.
Ye are the body of Christ, yet not meaning any Transubstantiation of
substance: but h^reof anon in his due place.

PA.
The Scriptures make not for you, but as you have translated them.

PRO.
For any point we hold, we refer our selves to the Originalls; yea, we say
further, let the indifferent Christian Reader, (who has but tolerable
understanding of the Latin Tongue,) compare our English translations, with
those which your own men, Pagnine, Arias Montanus, and others have published,
and they will find but little countenance for Popery; and namely, for
Communion in one kind, and Service in a strange Tongue, which (as is already
proved) has been decreed directly contrary to Gods express word, but let us
come to the particulars.

Of the Scriptures sufficiency, and Canon.
The Church of England holds, Arti^les of Religion. 6. Ar^i^.
that Holy Scripture contains all things necessary to salvation: so that
the^e is no doctrine Homily 1. the first part of the exhorta^ion to holy
Scripture.
necessary for our everlasting salvation, but that is (or may be) drawn out
of that Fountain of truth, as being either expressly therein contained, or
such as by sound inference may be deduced from thence: and this is witnessed
by Saint Paul, saying, that 2 Timothy 3.15, 16, 17.
they are able to make us wise unto salvation, that the man of God may be
perfited, and thoroughly furnished unto all good works; which they should not
be able to do, if they contained not a perfect doctrine of all such points of
faith, as we are bound to b^leeve, and duties to be practiced. And if it be
said, that S. Paul speaks of the man of God, such an one as Timothy was, it
holds in others also: for if the Scripture be so profitable for such and such
u^e^, that thereby it perfects a Divine, much more an ordinary Christian; that
which can pe^fit the teacher, is sufficient for the learner.

PA.
Do you disclaim all Traditions?

PRO.
We acknowledge Traditions concerning Discipline, and the Rites and Ceremonies
of the Church; but not concerning the doctrine, or matter of faith and Religion.

You equalize unwritten traditions to holy Scripture, receiving them, says
your Trent Council, Nec^on traditiones ipsa^ tum ad fidem, tum ad mores
pertinentes -- Part pietatis affectu as reverentia suscipit, and veneratur.
Council. Trid. S^ss. 4 Decret. 1.
with equal reverence, and religious affection, as you receive the holy
Scriptures themselves: we da^e not do so, but such traditions as we r^ceive,
we hold and esteem far inferior.

Concerning the Scriptu^e Canon, the Trent Council accurseth Si quis librum

the same Canon which Christ and his Apostles held and received from the Jews,
unto whom were committed the Oracles of Rom 3.2.
God, being, as Saint Augustine speaks, Codicem portat Iudaeus unde credat
Christianus; Librarij nostri facti sunt, quomodo solent servi post Dominos
codices far. August. in Psalm 56. to. 8.
The Christians Library-keepers. Now the Jews never received these Books
which we term Apocryphal into their Iosephu^ contra ^^pionem. lib. 1.
Canon: yea, Christ himself divided the Luke 24.44.
Canon into three several ranks, i^to the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms;
now the Apocryphal come not within this reckoning. Indeed (as S. Hierome says)
The Church reads these Books for example of life, and instruction of manners;
but yet it does not apply them to stablish any Doctrine.

Of Comunion under both kinds, and the number of Sacraments.
If any shall say, The Church was not induced for just causes to commun^ca^e
the ^ay people under one kind, v^z of bread only, and shall say they ^rred in
so doing, let him be accursed, Si quis dixerit Ecclesi^m non ^ustis causis
adductam ut Latios sub panis ta^tummodo spe^^e co^municaret, aut in eo errasse,

says the Trent Council. Now our Church holds, Arti^les of England, 30. Art.

That both the parts of the Lords Sacrament, ought to b^e ministered to all Gods

the practice of the Church in his time, on this manner; After the Priest has
prayed that he may ho^^ly distribute, and that all they that are to partake of
the Sacrament may receive it worthyly; he breaks the Bread into many pieces,
and divides one Cup among all. Ignatius, who was Scholar to Saint John the
Evangelist, says; (...). ^gnat. ^p. ad Philadel^h.
That one Bread is broken unto all, and one Cup distributed unto all.

the words of Ignatius are not as you allege them; There is one Cup
distributed unto all; but, there is one Cup of the whole Church, and though the
Greek Copies read as you do, yet he says, That much credit is not to be
given to them.

PROT.
Shall we give more credit to a Transl^tion, then to the Original? If the
Wellhead and Spring be cor^upted, how shall the Brook, or Stream run
clear? It may be indeed that diverse errors are crept both into the Greek and
Latin Copies, but for the place alleag^d, there is no color of corruption, in
as much as the same that Ignatius spoke of the Bread, the same are repeated of
the Cup according to Christ's Institution; and howsoever Bellarmine may produce
some Latin Copy, that translateth the words of Ignatius, as Bellarmine sets
them down, Vnus Calix totius Ecclesiae; yet (as D. Featly observes in the
Grand Sacrilege of the Romish Church) Vitlemius, and diverse other Latin Copies
following the original verbatim, render them thus, Vnus Calix omnibus
distributus, that is, One Cup distributed unto all, and not as Bellarmine, and
Et unus Calix qui pro omnibus nobis distributus est. Bar. Annal. tom. 1. ad
ann. Christ. 109. Ita legit locum Ignatij Ep. ad Philadelph.
Baronius ad Ann. 109 sect. 25. would have it; as if Ignatius had said, that
one Cup was distributed not (...), omnibus, but (...), pro omnibus, not to all,
but for all, that is, for the behoof and benefit of all. Howsoever they wrest
it, Ignatius tells us of one Cup, and this not the Priests Cup, but the Churches
Cup, and this Cup was distributed. But now adays in the Mass, there is no
distribution of the Cup.

PA.
Christ spoke these words, Drink ye all of this, only to the Apostles,
Mandatum solis Apostolis datum ^uit. Bellarmin. de Euchar. lib. 4. cap. 25.
^estat.
as they were Priests, and not to the Laity.

PRO.
By this means, you might take away the Bread, as well as the Cup from the
Lay People; for when Christ administered the Sacrament, none were present (for
ought we know) but only the Apostles.

Besides, the Apostles were not yet fully ordained Priests, though they had
been once sent to Preach; Christ after his Resurrection breathed on them the
holy Ghost, and fully endued them with Priestly power. John 20.22.

Again, the Apostles at this Supper were Communicants, not Ministers of the
Sacrament; Christ was then the only Minister in that Action. Now Christ
delivered them the Cup as well as the Bread, saying to the same persons, at the
same time, and in the same respect, Drink ye all of this, to whom he had
said before, Take, and Eat, giving both alike in charge; so that you must
either bar the people from both, or admit them to both: now if neither
precept of eating or drinking belong to the Laity, the Laity are not at all
bound to receive the Sacrament.

PA.
Although it be said of Drinking the Cup [Doe this in remembrance of me;] Yet
the Words [Doe this] are spoken Absolutely Post p^nis conse^^^tionem ab^^lute
pon^tu [ h^c ^ac^t^] p^st ^alic^n vero idem ^^p^titur, sed ^um ^^nditione,
Quo(...) b^beritis, Id. ibid.. (...).
of the Bread, and but Conditionally of the Cup, namely [as often as ye shall
drink it: 1 Cor. 11.25.] So that these Words, Do this in remembrance of me,
infer not any Commandment of receiving in both kinds.

PRO.
According to your Tenet, our Savior says not, Do this as often as you Lay
men communicate; but whenever you receive the Cup and drink, then do it in
remembrance of me; as much as to say, as often as you Lay people drink, which
needs never be done by you (according to Romish Divinity) Do this nothing
in remembrance of me: Besides, as there is a Quotiescunque, as often, set
before the Cup, As often as you drink; so there is a Quotiescunque set before
the Bread, As often as you shall eat this Bread, (verse. 26.) so that
quoti^scunque biberitis, as often as you Drink, cannot make the Precept
Conditional in respect of the Cup, more than of the Bread; it being alike
referred to the Bread and to the Cup.

PA.
We wrong not the Laity, ministering unto them under one kind only; they
receiving the same benefit by one, that they should do by both, Christ's body
and blood being whole in Council. T^id. Sess. 13. cap 3.
each; so that the people receive the blood together with the Host, by a
Concomitancy.

PRO.
In vain have you devised Concomitance, to disguise your sacrilege of the Cup
taken from the people; as if our Savior Christ were not sparing enough in
ordaini^g as few outward Ceremonies as might well be; but that he must do that
by two, which might have been compassed by one; or as if he would have the
Ministers receive his body and blood superfluously; that is to say, both in the
Bread, and in the Cup too, which was sufficiently received in either of them.
Again, though the devout Communicant, receiving Christ spiritually by Faith,
is thereby possessed of whole Christ crucified, in the inward act of the soul;
yet we deny, that the whole is received Sacramentally in this outwad act, under
one only part of this Sacrament: so that if Concomitance were granted, yet
Communion in one kind is not justifiable; for although it deprive not people
of Christ's blood, as it is a bodily part contained in the veins; yet it
depriveth them of the blood of Christ, as it was shed, powered out, and offered
in sacrifice for them; neither can such manner of receiving show forth the
Lords death, which is one chief end of the celebration of this Sacrament, 1
Cor. 11.28. The breaking of Bread repesenteth in no wise the effusion of blood;
this is lively represented by the pouring out of the consecrated Wine, and
d^inking of the Cup, there being a perfecter signification in both kinds then
in one.

Lastly, though the people might receive the blood together wi^h the host, ^et
he that so receives the blood, cannot properly be said to drink: now Christ
says expressly, Unless you drink his blood, you shall not have life in you,
John 6.53. which place your Papists themselves understand of the Eucharist.

Concerning the number of Sacraments, the Trent-Councell accurseth Si quis
dixerit, aut plu^a esse Sacramenta, ^ut pauciora quam septem, Anathema sit.
Council. Trid. Sess. 7.
all such as shall say, that the number of Sacraments is either more or less
then seven: but our Church holds, Art. 25.
that of the Sacraments of the New Testament, there be two ordained of Christ
our Lord in the Gospel, that is to say, Baptism, and the Lords Supper; and
those five, which by the Church of Rome are called Sacraments, to wit,
Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and Extreme Unction, are not to be
accounted Sacraments of the Gospel Art. of Ireland. Art. 87.
.

Now that there are and ought to be two Sacraments only in the New Testament,
appears hereby, in that there is no promise made unto us of life everlasting
in Jesus Christ, which is not sufficiently witnessed, and assured unto us by
these two 1 Cor. 10.1, 2, 3. and cap. 12. verse 13.
Sacraments. For the sum of all the promises of God in Christ, is reduced unto
these two heads: that for his sake we are received into the favor, and
household care of God; and that being once received, we shall be continued in
the sa^e for ever: the former whereof is sealed unto us by Baptism for our
entrance and admission into the Covenant; and the later by the Lords Supper,
for our continuance, growth, and confirmation therein. These two were
instituted by Christ; Hoc facite, Do this in remembrance of me Math. 28.19.
and Luke 22.19.
, is our warrant for the one; and go teach and baptize, for the other x; there
is deep silence in the rest.

Of the Eucharist.
The Trent Council holds, Synodas declarat, per consecrationem pa^is and vt^i,
conversion^m sieri t^tius substantiae p^n^s in substantiam corporis Christi,
and to^i^s ^ub^tan^iae v^ni in substantiam ^anguinis ejus. Council. ^^id. Sess.
13. cap. 4.
that there is a conversion of the whole substance of bread and wine into the
substance of Christ's body and blood, wrought by the words of consecration; and
that there only remain the semblances and shows, the outward shape^,
Romanentibus duntaxat spectobus (...) and vini. Id. Ibid. Can. 2.
forms, or accidents of bread and wine: yea, the Council accurseth Id. ibid.
Can. 2.
such as affirm bread and wine to remain in this Sacrament after
consecration. And yet S. Paul tells us, 1. Cor. 11.26.
that after consecration it is bread, which is broken and eaten; and it is no
less than fivetimes so called after the pretended change. Neither is it called
Bread, because it was bread, but because it is bread, not in name only, but in
nature and properties: for after consecration, the bread and wine they nourish
the body, and comfort the heart as before but the bare forms of bread and
wine, as the roundnesse of the Host, or color of the Wine, (such as they say
only remain, the substance thereof being abolished) cannot nourish without
corporal substance. Now our Church holds, A^ti^ of England^ 28 Of Ireland ^3.
that the change of the substance of the bread and wine, into the substance of
the body and blood of Christ, commonly called Transubstantiation, cannot be
prooved by holy Writ, but is repugnant to plain testimonies of holy Scripture.

PA.
How does it appear that Christ's body and blood are not corporally given and
taken in the Sacrament?

PRO.
By these reasons: First, we receive the body and blood of Christ in the
Sacrament, as the Disc^ples of Christ did in the first I^stitution of it. Now
the body and blood of Christ were not corporally received by them, but only
spiritually.

Secondly, Christ his body is ascended and taken up into heaven, and the
heavens must contain him, Acts 3.11.
till the end of the world.

Thirdly, Math. 28.6, 7. Luke 24.39. John 20 27.
Christ has but one body, and that a true body, and such as cannot be in many
places at once and it fills a place wheresoever it is, and may be both seen
and felt. This was also the judgment of other^, whom you much reverence.
Dionysius Areopagita held not Transubstantiation^ For he distinguishes
b^tweene the substantial Sign^s, and Christ sign^fied by them, saying; (...).
Di^nys. Areopag. Eccles. Hierarch. cap. 3.
that By those reve^end Signs and Symboles, Christ is signified, and the
faithful made partakers of him. He calls not the ministration of the holy
mysteries the sacrificing of Christ unto his Father (as the Papists do;) but a
Typical or (...). Id. ibid. c^p 3.
Symbolicall Sacrifice, that is a figu^e or sign of that great sacrifice: and
the same Denis (as Imm^ and Dionysius cap 3. Eccles. Hier^rchiae Eucharist^^m
vocat Antitypon. B^ll^rm. lib. 2 de Eucha^ist. c. p. 15. Sed hoc.
Bellarmine confesses) calls the Sacrament an An^i^ype, and that after
consecration; so that according to Saint Denis, the Elements of Bread and Wine
in this Sacrament, are Types, Antitype, and Symbols, that is, Figures and
Signs of the body and blood of Christ; and yet not only bare, naked, and
Signs significative, but re^lly ex^ibiting Christ, for that is Denis his word,
to wit, (...), that the faithful thereby partake Christ Jesus.

PA.
The Scripture is plain for us, where Christ says, This is my Body. Math.
26.26.

PRO.
Although Christ say, This is my Body, yet he says not (as you do) this is
made, or shall be changed into my Body; he says not, that his body and blood
is contained under the shapes or forms of B^ead and Wine.

Again, you that stand so for the Letter, take not Christ's Words literally;
for it is an improper speech to say, This is my Body, that is, the thing
contained under these forms, is by conversion, and substantial transmutation,
my Body; but your Papists mainteining Transubstantiation, expound Christ's words
in this, or the like manner; therefore in the point of Transubstantiation, you
depart from the Letter, and consequently make it figurative. You indeed allege
the Words and Letter, but not the true meaning; we believe Christ's words in
their right sense; now the show makes for you, the sense and substance for us.
Now though Christ's Body is not according to his material substance wholly and
entirely, under the outward elements, yet the Bread may be truly termed
Christ's Body, because of a Relative and Sacramental union, and donation of the
thing signified, together with the Signs worthily received.

PA.
What reason have you to interpret these words figuratively; this is my body,
that is, this bread is a sign of my body, and not plainly and literally as
they sound.

PRO.
Figurative speeches are oftentimes plain speeches; now there be no other
Figures or Tropes in the Lords Supper, but such as are, and always were,
usual in Sacraments, and familiarly known to the Church. Now Sacraments must
be expounded Sacramentally, and accordingly the words alleged must not be
taken literally, but figuratively. Christ taking bread, and breaking bread,
said of the same, [ This is my body] now this cannot be properly taken,
therefore for the right expounding of these words, we are necessarily to have
recourse to a figurative interpretation; and the reason hereof is that common
Maxim, Bishop Morton against the Mass. Book 2. chap. 1. sect. 4. and cha. 3.
sect. 6.
Disparatum de disparato non proprie praedicatur, that is, nothing can be
properly and literally affirmed jointly of another thing, which is of a
different nature. By this rule, bread and Christ's body cannot be properly
affirmed one of another; bread being of a different nature from flesh, can no
more possibly be called the flesh or body of Christ literally, than lead can be
called wood: and this makes us interpret the words figuratively; and we have
in Scripture most manifest places, which prove these wo^ds, [ This is my body]
to be figuratively taken and understood, because in Scripture whenever the
sign (as the Bread) being called Christ's body, has the name and appellation
of the thing signified, the speech is always tropicall and figurative. And
this agre^th with S. Austi^s Rule: Si enim Sacrament^ quandam similitudinem
earum ^erum quarum S^cramenta sunt, non ha^erent, omnino Sacramenta non essent:
ex hac autem similitudine plerumque etiam ipsa^um rerum nomina accipiunt. Sicut
ergo secundum quendam modum Sacramentum corporis Christi corpus Christi est.
Aug. tom. 2. epist. 23. ad Bonifac.
Sacraments be signs, which often do take the names of those things, which
they do signify and represent: therefore do they carry the names of the
things themselves: thus is the sign of the Passover, the Lamb, called the
Passover, Math. 26.17. Exodus 12.11, 27. the Rock, the sign of Christ in his
passion, is called Christ, and the Rock was Christ, 1. Cor. 10 4.
Circmmcision, the sign of the Covenant, called the Covenant, and Bap^isme the
sign of Christ's burial, called Christ's burial: for so says S. Augustine, Vt
Baptismus dicitur sepulchrum; sic, H^c est Corpus meum. August. cap. Faust.
lib. 20 cap. 21.

Non enim Dominus dubitavit dicere, ^oc est corpus meum, ^um signum daret
corporis sui. August tom. 6. contra Adimant. cap. 12.

-- Figura est ergo praecipiens passioni domini esse communicandum. Id tom. 3
lib 3 de Doctr. Christ cap. 16.


that as Baptism is called Christ's burial, so is the Sacrament of the Body of
Christ called his Body. Now this show, or semblance of words concludes not,
that Christ or the Lamb were really the Rock, the Passover, but that these
things are meant figuratively, it being usual in Scripture, specially in such
Sacramentally speeches as this is we are now about, to give the name of the
thing to that which it betokens; and so to call, Circumcision the Covenant,
because it is a sign that betokneth the Covenant, and so of the rest. Besides
the other part of the S^crament, to wit, This Cup is the New Testament in my
blood, Luke 22.20. is figurativ^, and not to be literally taken: for you your
selves s^y, Non ^^gamus in verb^ (...) ^^pum es^e. Bell(...) lib. 1 c^p. 11.
R^s^ondeo.
that Calix, or the Cup is there taken for that which is i^ the cup: so that
your s^lves admit a trope in the institution of this Sacrament.

PAP.
If these figurative spe^ches were true, yet I cannot see what argument you can
draw from hence, or how you can hence prove any thing against our Tenet, says
our ^nglish The Lord Ar. Ba^o^ num^^ ^^, 4^ touching some mis-allegations.
Baron: for it is a rule in Divinity, that Theologia Symbolica non est
a^gumentativa, that figurative speeches afford no certain proof in matters
of Faith.

PRO.
The ze^lous, Reverend, and learned L. Bishop of Dur^sme, Doctor Morton, tells
A discharge of five Impu^^^ions of mis-allegati^ns, ^^lsely c^a^ged upon the
(now^ Bishop of Dure^me, by an English B^^on. page 133, etc. ad. number. 42.43.
your Baron and his Suggester, that upon the no-p^oper sense of the words, [
This is my body] it must follow, that there is no Transubstantiation in your
Romish Mass, no Corporal presence, no r^all Sacrifice, no proper eating, no
lawful divine adoration thereof: and as for the rule, that Symbolicall
arguments m^ke no necessary Conclusions, the said learned and reve^end Father
says, That this makes not against us, touching the fi^urative wo^ds of Christ,
This is my body, the position makes only against them, who extract either a
lite^all sense out of a parabolicall and figurative speech, as Origin did, when
having r^ad that scripture^ Th^re be some that castrate th^ms^lves for the
kingdom of God, (which was but a p^rabolicall speech) he did really, and
therefore f^^lishly castrate himself: or else, when men t^r^e the words of
Scripture, properly and literally spoken, into ^ figurative meaning^ as when
Pope Inno^ent the third, t^ p^oove that his Papal authority was above the
Imp^riall, a^l^dged that Scripture, Genesis 1. God made two great lights, the Sun,
and the Moon; as if the Imperial like the Moon, had borrowed its authority
from the Papal, as from the Sun: or as Pope Boniface 8, from those words, Luke
22. Behold, here are two swords, argued, that both the temporal and spiritual
sword are in the Pope, as he is Vicar of Christ. Now such kind of Symbolicall
reasoning is indeed of no force. ^ut by that position was it never forbid,
whenever in Scripture the name of the thing signified, is attributed to the
symbol or sign, that then the Symbolicall and Sacramental speech should be
judged tropicall. But this kind of exposition was always approved of Christ,
and by his Church: so here, Christ taking bread, and breaking bread, which was
the symbol and sign of Christ's body, and saying of the same Bread, [ This is
my body] the sense cannot possibly be literal, but al^ogether figu^ative, as
has bin shown by diverse ^xamples in Scripture, to wit, the sign of the
passing over, called the Passover; the Rock, but a sign of Christ, called
Christ: In each on^ of these the Symbols being a Sign and Figu^e, the speech
must infallibly be Figurative. And therefore Bread, being a Figure of Christ's
Body, is called Christ's body Figuratively. And thus far our learned Bishop of
Duresme.

Of Images, and Prayer to Saints.
The Church of Rome holds, Imagines hab^ndas and r^tinendas esse, a^que ^is
debitum honorem ac venerati^nem impertiendam. Bull^ Pij qu^rti super forma
Iu^am^nti, ad calcem Council. Trid. and Conc. T^^d. Ses^. 25.
that Images are to be had and retained, and that due honor, worship, and
veneration is to be given to them; The Church of England holds, Ar^ic 22.
that the Romish doctrine of Adoration of Images and Relics, and also of
Invocation of Saints is grounded upon no warra^tie of Scripture, but rather
rep^gnant to the word of God. And so indeed we find, that the Lord in his
Moral law has condemned Exodus 20.5. Levit. 26.18.
in g^nerall all Ima^e^ and Idols devised by man, for worship and adoration.
And this Precept being a part of his Moral law, it binds Deca^ogi verba ipse
per seme^ipsum om^ibus simititer Dominus ^^quutus est; and ideo sim^^^ter
pe^manent a^ud ^os, ^xtension in and aug^entum, sed non dissolut^o^^m
a^^^pientta, per ca^^^tem ejus ad^^ntum I^enaeus ^o^^^. Haere^. lib. 4. cap 31.
us in the state of the new Testament, as it did the Israelites of old: for in
all the Apostles doctrine, we do not find that ever this pr^c^pt was
ab^ogated; so that it binds, Israelites, Christians, and all.

PA.
If all worship of Images be forbidden, (Exodus 20. ver. 4, 5.) then all making
of them is forbidden, for the same precept which says, thou shall not bow
down to them, nor worship them; says also, thou shall not make to thy self
any graven Image.

PRO.
Our learned Bishop White, has answered for (...): the Ground and Proposition
of this argument (says he) D^ctor Whites Reply to Jesuit Fish^rs Answer. First
point.. 3. p. 266.
is fal^e; for worshipping of Images is forbidden, as the principal object of
that negative precept, and as a thing Morally evil in his very kind: but
making them is forbidden, (only) when it is a means subservient to worship;
and because it may be separated, both in his own nature, and in man's intention
from that end and use; therefore the one is simply forbidden, and the other is
only prohibited, when it becomes a means, or instrument to other: for we
mislike not pictures or Images for historical use and ornament; now this
distinction and disparitie between making and wo^shipping, is comfirmed by the
example of the ^razen Serpent, made by Gods own appointment; for when the same
was only made, and looked upon, it was a Medicine, when it was worshipped, it
b^came a poison, and was destroyed. 2 Kings 18^4.


To proceed^; the Church of Rome holds, Sa^^^os un^ ^um Christ's regnante^,
venerandos a^que i^vocan^os esse Bulla P^^ Q^^^^ quo s^p^a. ^t Con^. Trid.
Sess. 25.
that the Saints reigning with Christ, are to be worshipped and pray^d unto;
but this we hold is not warranted by Gods word, but rather repugnant to it: for
we are commanded to invocate God in the name of Christ John 16.^^.
; and our Savior himself inviteth us, to approach with confidence to the
throne of his grace John ^5.16. Ephesians. 3.12. Hebr. 4.16.
: he is rich in mercy ^phes. 2.4.
, to such as call upon him; and more compassionate, better able, and more
willing to help us than any Saint or Angel; and he is appointed by God to be
our Intercessour Romans 8.34. H^br. 7.25.
We read in the new Testament, many examples of people which made supplication
immediately unto Christ, but not of one which made intercession to the Virgin
Mary, or to the blessed Saints or Angels. And if any question with this our
negative concluding from Scripture; Saint Hierome upon occasion did the like,
saying, Non credimus, quia non legimus. Hieron. advers. Helvidium. tom 2.
we believe it not, because we read it not.

I will close up this point with that advise which Ignatius gave the Virgins of
his time; (...). Ignat. in Epist. ad Philadelph.
not to direct their prayers and supplications to Saints or Ang^ls, but to the
Trinity (only). O ye Virgins, have Christ alone before your eyes, and his
Father in your Prayers, being enlightened by the spirit.

Of Faith and Merit.
The Trent Si quis dix^rit, sol^ side impium jus^ifica^i, Anathema sit Conc.
Trid. Ses^^ 6. Can. 9.
Counc^l accurseth all such as say, that a si^ner is justified by Faith only,
or deny that the good works of holy men do truly Merit everlasting life, Si
quis dixe^it justifi^ati hominis opera bona non vere mereti vitam aete^nam^
Anathema sit. Idem S^ss. 6. cap. 16. Can. 32.
our reform^d Churches hold, Artl^. of England 11. and of Ireland 34.
that we are accounted righteous before God, only for the Merit of Jesus
Christ, applied by Faith^ and not for our works or Merits. And when we say,
that we are justified by Faith only, we do not mean that the said justifying
Faith is alone in man, without true repentance, hope, charity, and the fear of
God; for such a Faith is dead, and cannot justify. Art. of Ireland^ 36.
Even as when we say, that the eye only sees, we do not mean, that the eye
severed from the head does see, but that it is the only prop^rtie of the eye
to see. Neither does this Faith of Christ, which is within us, of it self
justify us, or deserve our just^fication unto us (for that were to account our
selves to be justified by the virtue or dignity of something within our
selves:) but the true meaning ther^of is, that although we hear Gods Word and
believe it, although we have Faith, Hope, Charity, Repentance, and the f^are
of God within us, yet we must renounce the Merit of all our virtues, and good
deeds, as far too weak and unsufficient to deserve remission of our Sins,
and u^ justification; and therefore we must trust only in Gods mercy, and the
Merits of our only Savior and justi^ier Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, because
Faith does directly send us to Christ for our justification, and that by Faith
given us of God, we emb^ace the promise of Gods mercy, and the remission of
our Sins, (which thing none other of our virtues or works properly does:)
therefore the Scripture uses to say, Romans 3.28. -- 42, etc.
that Faith without works, and the ancient Fathers of the Church to the same
purpose, that only Faith does justify us. Homily of Salvation 2. Part.


Now for the Point of Merit, it is neither agreeable to Scripture nor reason,
for we cannot Merit of him whom we gratifi^ not; we cannot gratify a man with
his own; now all our good is Gods already, his gift, his propriety: What have
we that we have not received? says the Apostle, 1. Cor. 4.7
not our Talent only, but the improvement also is his mere bounty; there can
be therefore no place for Merit.

PA.
We hold the ancient Roman Faith.

PRO.
That is not so, as may appear by these instances.

Saint Paul taught Rom 9.11. Rom 11.5, 6.
his Romans, that our Ele^^ion is of Gods free grace, and not ex operibus
praevisis, of works foreseen.

He taught, that we are justified by Rom 3.28. Rom 4 2, etc.
Faith only; we conclude that we are justified by Faith without the work^s of
the Law, which is all one as to say, a man is justified by Faith only.

He taught, that eternal life is the gift of God, Romans 6.^3.
and therefore not due to the Merit of works: that, the good works of the
Regenerate are not of their own condignitie meritorious, Romans 8.18.
nor such as can deserve heaven, and the sufferings there expressed are
Ma^tyrdomes sanctified by grace.

He condemned Images, though made to resemble the true God; and taught Romans 1
23, 25.
that to bow the knee religiously to an Image, or to worship any creature, is
mere Idolatry.

He taught Romans 10.13, 14.
that we must not pray unto any but unto God only, in whom we believe: and
therefore not to Saints or Angels, since we believe not in them.

He taught that Rom 7.7. -- 8.10.
concupiscence is a Sin, even in the regenerate: Apos^olus Concupiscentiam
peccatum voca^; non licet nobi^ autem ita l^q ^^. Possev. in Apparat. verbo
Patres.
and Possevine the Jesuit confesses, that Saint Paul called it so, but says
he, we may not call it so.

He taught, Rom 4.9, 17, 23.
that the Imputed righteousness of Christ, is that only that makes us just
before God.

Thus taught Saint Paul, thus the ancient Romans believed: from this Faith our
latter Romanists are departed.

Here then let the Reader judge, whether it be likely that Saint Paul, who (as
Theodoret Variam quidem and Om^is generis doctrinam per haec scripta exhibet
Apostolus. Thedoret. tom. 2. in argum. Epist. ad Romans Gen^iano Herveto
Interp^et.
says) delivered doctrine of all sorts, and very exactly handled the Points
thereof, should nevertheless (writing at large to the Roman Church) not once
mention those maine points, wherein the life of Popery consists; namely, the
Popes Monarchical Jurisdiction, Transubstantiation, Communion in one kind,
Service in an unknown tongue, Popes pardons, Image worship, and the like, if
the Church of Rome were then the same that now a days it is.

Now if these points mentioned, were no Articles of Faith in the ancient Roman
Church, in Saint Paul's days, when their Faith was spoken of throughout the
whole world; Romans 1 8.
then they be not Articles of Faith at this day, but only Additions to the
rule of Faith, such as the corruption of the times has patched up, and pieced
it withal: for it is a ruled case in the Quan^um ad sub^stantiam Arti^ulorum
fidei, non est sactum little augmentum, sed quantum ad ^xplicationem, quia
quaed^m explicit cognita sunt a poster^oribus, quae a prioribus non
cognosceba^tur explicit. Aquin. ^^.2 ae. qu. 1. Art. 7.
Schools, that the body of Religion may grow in respect of farther
Explanations, but it cannot increase in Substantial points; even as a child
(as Vicentius Lirinensis Imi^etur anim^r^^ Religio rationem co^po^^i, q^ae
licet annorum pr^^^ss^ num^ros suos evolv^^t and explicent, ^alem tam^n quae
cra^t perma^ent; qu^^ parvuloru^ a^tus (...) i^o^um. Vincent (...)^ contra
Haeres. ca. 29.
^aith) though he grow in stature, yet has he no more limbs, when he becomes
a man, than he had when he was a child; so the Church has no more parts, or
Articles of Faith in her riper age, than she had in her infancy, and by this
rule, new Rome is a Monster, if she have more ^word o^ li^bs of Faith now in
her declining age, than ancient Rome had in her flourishing age.

And herein we challenge our adversaries to show the body of their Religion
pe^fited in this first and purest age, what time the Church was in her vigor,
and the Scripture Canon finished and consigned: but they dare not be tried by
the book of Scripture. Now for us, we willingly put our cause to be tried by
that honorable and unpartiall Jury of Christ and his twelve Apostles, and the
Evidence that shall be given by the testimony, and viva voce, of holy
Scripture; but they turn their backs, and fly from this trial.

But I proceed, and come to Joseph of Arimathea, whom I named for one of our
Islands special Benefactors; it was this Joseph (as our best Antiquaries say
Gildas in the life of Aurel. Ambr^sius; and William Malm^bury apud C^^^b^en. in
Belge or S^^me^jet.
) that together with twelve other Disciples his Assistants, came out of France
into Britain, and preached the Christian Faith in the Western part of this
Island, now called Glastenbury; which place in ancient Charters, was termed the
Grave of the Saints, the Mother Church, the Disciples foundation: whereby it is
very likely, that our land was first converted by Joseph of Arimathea being
sent hither by S. Phillip, and not from S. Peter, and that not from Rome, but
from Arimathea, which was not far from Jerusalem, so that Jerusalem is the
Mother of us all, as both Hierome Io Hieru^alem primum fund. t^ Ecclesi^.
to^ius o^b^ Ecclesias sem^^^it. Hieron. tom. 2. in Isai cap. 2. [Ex Sion I^x
ex^^^^, and v^^bum Domi^^ex Hieru^^lem]
and Theodoret (...). Th^odoret Histor. Eccles l^b 5. cap. ^.
say. And this is the rather probable, because that upon Austin the Monks
coming into England, the British Bishops observed their Easter, and other
points of difference, according to the Gre^ke or Eastern Church, and not after
the Roman Western Church; which makes it probable, that our first conversion
came from the Christian converted Jews, or Grecians, and not from the Romans;
but howsoever it were, or whence-soever they came, we bless God for the great
work of our conversion.

THE SECOND CENTVRIE, From the year of Grace, 100. to 200.
PAPIST.
WHom do you name in this Age?

PROTESTANT.
In this Age lived Hegesippus of the Jewish Nation, afterward converted to
Christianity. Melito Bishop of Sardis: Iustine Martyr, who, of a Philosopher,
became both a Christian and a Martyr. Now also lived Irenaeus Bishop of Lions
in France, sometimes Scholar to Polycarp, and both of them Martyred for the
name of Christ; of this Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna it is recorded, Eus^b. lib.
4. cap. 15.
that being urged by the Roman Deputy to deny Christ, he stoutly replied on
this manner: I have served him these foure-score and six years, and he has
not hurt me, and shall I now deny him? Now also lived Clemens Alexandrinus, who
was Scholar to one Pantenus, these two seem to be the Authors of Universities
and Colleges, for they taught the Grounds of Religion, not by Sermons and
Homilies to the people, but by Catecheticall doctrine to the Learned in the
Schools.

Now that in point of doctrine we consent with the Worthies of this Age, it may
appea^e by the testimony of Iren^us, a Disciple of those that heard Saint John
the Apostle, for he Irenaeus lib. 1. cap. 2. and 3.
lays down no other Articles of Faith, and Grounds of Religion then our
ordinary Catechism teaches: besides he shows that in the unity of that
Faith the Churches of Germany, Spain, France, the East, Egypt, Libya, and all
the World, were founded, and therein sweetly accorded: as if they had al dwelt
in one house, all had had but one soul, and one heart, and one mouth. Regula
est autem Fidei, ut ^am hinc quid ^redamus prositeamu^, illa scili^et: qu^
creditur unum omnino D^um esse, etc. Tertul. de p^aes^^ip^ione advers. haeret.
c. 13.
The like does his contemporary Tertullian, he gives the fundamental points of
Religion, gathered out of the Scriptures, and delivered by the Churches, the
same which our Church delivers, and no other for the Rule of Faith.

Of the Scriptures Sufficiency, and Canon.
Irenaeus says, Quia S^^ipturae quidem perfec^^e sunt, quippe ^ ve^bo D^i and
spi^itu ejus dic^ae. ^en. lib. 2. c. 47.
The Scriptures are perfect, as spoken from the Word of God, and his Spirit:
and Erasmus Solis Scripturarum praesidijs pugnat a^ve^sus ^atervam.
Here^ic^rum. Erasm p^aefat. in Iren
observes, that Irenaeus fought against the troops of Heretics, only by the
forces and strength of Scripture, indeed he sometimes charge them with the
Churches tradition, (wounding them with their own weapon:) but this was with
such undoubted tradition, as were in his time thought to be Apostolic, which
he might easily discern living so near the Apos^les days.

Melito, Bishop of Sardis, being desired by Onesimus to send him a Catalogue of
the Books of the Old Testament, (...). Eus^b. lib. 4. cap. 26.
makes no mention of Judith, Tobit, Ecclesiasticus, nor the Maccabees: and yet
he profes^eth that he made very diligent search to set down a perfect Cannon
thereof. And this is likewise confessed by Bellarmine; many ancients Multi
vete^um ut Melito, aperte s^q^^ti sunt Hebreos^ non G^ae^os. Bell^r^ de ve^b.
Dei lib. 1. cap. 20 Ad alter in.
(says he) as namely Melito^ did follow the Hebrew Canon of the Jews.

Of Communion under both kinds; and number of Sacraments.
Justin Martyr says, (...). Just. Ap^log. ^. in fine p 162.
they which are called Deacons among us give to every one that is present of
the consecrated Bread and Wine^ adding withal, (...) In^^^. Id. ibid.
as Christ commanded them: now these words which mention Christ's Commandment,
Respondeo, illa verba Iustini, ubi commemoratur Christi praceptum, non
pertinent ad Communionem, sed ad consecration^m. Bell^rm. lib. 4 de Euchar.
cap. 26.. Respondeo.
Bellarmine would have to belong to the Consecration only, and not to the
Communion; whereas I^stin extends Christ's precept to both, both being enjoined
in that precept, do this in remembrance of me: so that we have both Christ's
precept, and this Ages practice for our Communion in both. Clemens Alexandrinus
wrote a book against the Gentiles, Stromata.
which he calls (...), (as ye would say) woven after the manner of coverings,
mixed with the testimonies of Scriptures, Poets, Philosophers, and Histories,
and therein he has these words: (...). Clem. Alexandr. Stromat. lib. 1. page
94.
When they distribute the Holy Eucharist, as the custom is, they permit every
one of the people to take a part or portion thereof: and what he means by
Eucharist, himself explaineth, saying, (...). Idem Paedagog. lib. 2. cap. 2.
page 35.
the mingling of the drink and of the Water and the Word, is that which we
call the Eucharist: so that according to him, not Bread only, but Bread and
Wine is the Eucharist, and of this every one of the people participated in his
time, and therefore all drank of the Cup. Iustine Martyr in his Apology for
the Christians Justin. Apol secund^.
specifies no other Sacraments, than Baptism, and the Lords Supper; and yet in
that treatise of his, he was justly occasioned to mention the Sacraments of the
Church; and there he relates the manner of their Church Service, Liturgies, and
Commnuion: so that there had been a fit place for him to have named those
other five, if the Church had then known them.

Of the Eucharist.
That the substance of Bread and Wine, remains in the Sacrament after the
words of Consecration, albeit the use of the elements be changed, is clear by
the Fathers of this Age. Iustine Martyr says, Justin. Apolog. 2.
that the elements of Bread and Wine in the Sacrament of the Supper, are made
flesh, and the blood of Jesus, in that same manner that the eternal Word of
God was made flesh: but so it is, that the substance of the Divine nature,
neither evanished nor yet was changed into the substance of flesh: and in like
manner, the Bread is made the Body of Christ, neither by evanishing of the
substance thereof, nor yet by changing the substance thereof into another
substance.

Iustine Martyr tells us, that the Bread and the Wine, even that (...)
^u^^in. Apolog. 2 in sin
sanctified food wherewith our blood and flesh by conversion are nourished, is
that which we are taught to be the flesh and blood of Jesus incarnate. Our
Lord, says Clemens of Alexandria, (...) C^m. Al^^andr. Paedagog lib. 2. cap.
2. page 38.
did bless Wine, when he said, take, drink, this is my blood, the blood of
the Vine. Irenaeus says, Quomodo autem just Dominus, si alterius Patris
existit, hu^us ^onditionis quae est secundum nos, accipi^ns pa^em, suum corpus
esse consit^batur. I^en. lib 4. c p 57^
that our Lord, taking Bread of that condition, which is usual among us,
confessed it to be his Body: and Et cali^em similter, qui est ^x ea c^^atur^,
quae est se^undum nos, suum sanguinem con^^ss^s est. Id. ibid. lib^ 4. cap 32.
the Cup likewise containing that creature which is usual among us, his blood:
so that in their construction, it was Bread and Wine which Christ called his
Body; it was Bread in substance, mate^iall Bread, and the Body of the Lord in
signification, and Sacramental relation. The Lord called Bread his body, now
since Bread could not be his body substantially, it must needs be, it was only
his body Sacramentally.

Of Images, and Prayer to Saints.
Concerning the use of Images, we find that in these best and ancient times,
Christians were so far from bringing them into their Churches, that some of
them would not so much as admit the Art it self of making them, so jealous
were they of the danger, and careful for the prevention of deceit, whereby
the simple might any way be drawn on to the adoring of them: we are plainly
fo^bidden, says Clemens Alexandrinus, (...)^ Clement. Alexan. Protrepti^. ad
Gent. page 24.
to exercise that deceitful Art; for the Prophet says, Thou shall not make
the likeness of any thing, either in the Heaven, or in the Earth beneath.
(...). Id. Pae^dag. lib. 3. cap 2. p^g 58.
Moses commands men to make no Image, that should represent God by Art,
(...). Id. P^otreptic. page ^1.
for in truth, an Image is a dead matter, formed by the hand of an artificer,
but we have no sensible Image made of any sensible matter, but such an Image as
is to be conceived with the understanding, (...). Id. in Protreptic. oratione
Adhortat ad Gentes. page 23. -- (...). Ibid. page 20.
yea but thine Images are of Gold: be it so: now I pray thee, what is Gold, or
Silver, Iron, Brass, Ivorie, the Adamant, Diamond, or Precious Stones? Are
they not terra et ex terra, are they ought but Earth and made of the Earth? now
being nothing else but a piec^ of more refined Earth, I have learned (...), not
(...), terram calcare, non colere; to walk on the Earth, and not to worship
it; to set my foot on it, not to bow my knee to it. And thus far Clement of
Alexandria, holding it a monstrous thing to bow down to a stock or a stone.

Irenaeus reckons it among the abuses of the Gnostikes, Imagines quasdam
depictas, quasdam de reliqu^ Materi^ fabricatas habent, dicentes formam Christi
factam ^ Pilato, e^ has coronant. Iren. lib. 1. cap. 24.
that they had certain painted Images, and others made of other stuff,
saying, that it was the Picture of Christ made by Pilate.

When the Emperor Adrian, in favor of the Christians Alexander Imperator
Christo templum facere voluit, eumque inter Deos recipere: quod and Adrianus
cogitasse fertur, qui templa in omnibus civitatibu^ ^ine simulachris jusserat
fieri, quae hodie idcirco quia non habent numina, dicuntur Ad^iani^ quae ille
ad hoc parasse dicebatur, sed prohibitus est ab ijs qui consulentes sacra,
reperera^t omnes Christianos futuros si id optato eveniss^t, and templa reliqua
deserenda. Lamprid. in Alexandro.
had commanded that in every City, Churches should be built without Images,
which at this day are called Adrians Temples, because they have no Gods in
them; which they said he made for that end: to wit, to pleasure the Christians;
it was presently conceived, that he prepared those Temples for Christ, as
Aelius Lampridius noteh, in the life of Alexander Severus: which is an evident
Argument, that it was not the use of Christians in those days to have any
Images in their Churches.

Learned Master Casa^bone in his notes upon this place of Lampridius, Historiam
istam ad Tiberium potius referenda^ puto, quam Adrianum. Hadrianum autem templa
sieri suo nomini mand^sse, quae eo morte praerepto imperfecta postea and fine
simulachris mansere; unde factum ut in animum inducerent multi non ^ibi sed
Christo templa ista extruxisse Adrianum, quibus assentitur Lampridius; ut qui
norat, quod ignorare tum poterat nemo, and Iudaeos o^im in Hierosolomytana aede
(...), Deum co^uisse, and suis etiam temporibus Christianorum templa ejusmodi
esse, qualia adhuc memoria sua B. Augustinu^ cum alibi prodit fuisse, tum in
Psalmi 103. enarratione. Isaac. Causabon. in notis in hunc locum Lamp^id.
thinks that this story is rather to be referred to Tiberius the Emperor,
^han to Hadrian: and that Adrian causd Temples to be dedicated to his own
name, and th^se Temples, Adrian being prevented by death, remained unfinished,
and without any Images at all: whence it came to pass, that many w^n thought
that Adrian built those Temples not to himself, but unto Christ, and with
these agrees Lampridius^ as one who knew, that which none could then be
ignorant of, that both the Jews in the Temple at Jerusalem did worship God
without Images and Pictures, as both Strabo and Dio write, and that in their
days the Christian Churches were such, as afterward Saint Austine reports
them to have been in his days.

Saint Austin upon the hundred and thirteenth Psalm, Hoc enim venerantu, quod
ipsi ex auro argentoque ^ec^runt, sed enim and nos plaraque inst^umenta and
vasa ex hujus modi materi ^ vel metallo habemus in usum celebrando^um
Sacramentorum Et sunt pro^^cto etiam illa ins^rumenta vel vosa, q^^d aliu^ quam
opera manuum hominum? ve^untamen nunquid or habent, and non loquentur? Nunquid
its supplicamus quia per ea supplicamus Deo? plus val^nt s^melachra ad
curvandam infael^^m animam quod os hubent, oculos, aures; quam id corrigendam,
quod non loquentur, non videhunt, non audient. Aug. in Psalm. 113. conc. 2.
expounding those words of David, that Idols have a mouth and speak not, makes
this objection, that the Church has also diverse instruments and vessels made
of gold and silver, for the use of celebrating the Sacraments: but he answers,
have these instruments mouths and speak not, eyes and see not? do we address
our prayers to them? now surely he could not have spoken thus, if he had Images
in Churches, or if Images had bin a part of the Churches Vtensils and movables
in his days.

Concerning Prayer to Saints, Iustine Martyr, Clemens Alexandrinus, and
Tertullian have reported the public forms of Christian service, and Religious
excercises of the Primitive Christians, and yet make no mention of Prayer to
Saints, or Angels, but only of Prayer directed to God in the name and
mediation of Christ alone.

Irenaeus tells us, Ecclesia per u^iversam mundum -- Nec invocationibus
Angeli^^^ fac^^^ a'^quid, nec incantationibus, n^^ aliqua prava curiosirate^
sed munde, and (...) and m^^i^^este orationes di^igentes ad Dominum qui omnia
facit, and nomen Domini nos^^^ (...) Christi [^nvo^ant, virtu^t^s] secundum
utilitates b^^onum sed non a^ se^ducti^ne^ per^e^it. ^^n. ^^ 2. c^p^ ^7. (...)
Fe^^ de^ tius.
that in his days the Church, per universum mundum, throughout the whole
World, does nothing by Invocations of Angels, nor by Incantations, nor any
wicked curiosity, but decently, comely, and manifestly, directs her Prayers
to God, which has made all, and calls upon the name of our Lord Jesus.
Irenaeus ^aith not (as ^Nec invo^ationibus Ang^l^^^] mal^gnorum vid^^^^^
^p^^tuum. ^ev. ^d. ^. t^s in locum Ir^n^ei.
Fevardentius, and the Papists now a days would teach him) that the Heretics
called upon false and imaginary Saints and Angels, and the Church upon the true
Saints, and holy Angels; but this he says, that the Church called upon God in
Christ Jesus. Eusebius in his Story, sets down Verbatim a long Prayer used
by Polycarp the Martyr, at the time of his suffering, wherein, if Invocation of
Saints had been reputed any part of Christian devotion in those days, he
would undoubtedly in so great peril and at his death, have recommended
himself to God by the Prayers and Merits of Saints: but his form of Prayer is
Protestant-like, tendered to God himself only by the mediation of Christ,
concluding his Prayer in this manner: (...). Eusebius. Hist. lib. 4. cap. 15.
therefore in all things I Praise thee, I bless thee, I Glorify thee through
the eternal Priest [of our profession] Jesus Christ thy beloved Son, to whom
with thee, O Father, and the Holy Ghost, be all Glory, now and for ever. Amen.

When the people of the Church of Smyrna desired to have the body, or bones of
their Martyred^ Bishop Polycarp to burial, the Jews persuaded the Governor
not to grant it, for that then the Christians would leave Christ, and worship
the body of Polycarp: to which surmise they re^urne this answer: (...). Eccle.
Smy^n, apud Eusebius. l. 4. hist. cap. 15 page 39.
we can never be induced either to forsake Christ, which has suffered for all
that are saved in the World, [(...) (...) with religious worship.
] or to worship any other for him, being the Son of God [(...)] we adore
him; but the Martyrs, as the Disciples and followers of the Lord [(...)] them
we love worthily. Now when they say, that they cannot worship any other: our
learned and divine Antiquarie Doctor Usher An Answer to the Jesuits Challenge.
Of payer to Saints. page 426.
observes, that the Latin Edition of theirs, which was wont to be publicly
read in these Churches of the West, expresses their meaning in this manner:
Nunquam Christum relinquere possumu^ Cristiani, neque alteri cuiquam precem
orat^onis impendere. Ex Passionario MS. vij. Kalend. Febr. in Bibliotheea
Ecclesiae Sarisburiensis, and D^ Robert^ Cottoni.
We Christians can never leave Christ, who did vouchsafe to suffer so great
things for our Sins, nor impart the supplication of Prayer unto any other.

PAP.
Irenaeus terms the blessed Virgin V^i virgini^ Evae virgo Maria ^ie^e^
Advoc^^a. I^en. lib. 5. c. 16. edit Gallasij c. 19. edit. Fevard.
the Advocate of Eve.

PRO.
Indeed Bellarmine Bellar. l. 1. de Sanct. Beat. c. 19. quid clar^us?
cries up this place with a quid clarius? what can be said more plainly? and
Fevardentius, answerable to his name, falls not upon Gallasius about this
place. Now Irenaeus his meaning (as elsewhere he expresses himself, Sicut Eva,
and fibi et universo generi humano causa facta est mortis; sic and Maria, e^
^^^i, and universo generi humano causa facta est salutis. Iren. lib. 3. cap. 33.

[Causa salutis] causa pro organo exteriore accipitur. N^col. Gallas. in loc.


) is this, and no more, that as by Eva Sin came into the World, and by Sin
death; so by the Virgins means, life and salvation instrumentally, in that she
was that chosen vessel of the Holy Ghost, to bear him in her womb, who by
taking flesh of her, redeemed us from the curse of death. And thus she was the
Advocate or Comforter of Evah and her children, by bearing Christ, and not
because she was invocated, as a mediator, after her death by Evahs children.

Of Faith and Merit.
Irenaeus (as Chemnitius observes Et ^^^e quid allud est, quam exclusiva, quod
Ire^au^ habet. lib. 4. c. 37.38. Non aliter servar^ homines ab antiqua
Se^pentis plag^^ nisi credant in cum, etc Chemnit. loc. Theolog. de Iustif. 2.
part p. 773.
) though he speak not expressly of Sola Fides, yet he uses terms equivalent
to that exclusive particle: saying that there is no way to be saved from the
sting of that old Serpent the Devil, but by believing in Christ.

The Fathers of this Age, the most of them alleged (if not all Mi^i nondum
satis liquet Graece ne scripserit, an Latin, etiamsi magis arbi^^or L^tine
scripsisse. E^^^in^ pr^fat. in Iren.

Phrasis ejus [^^en^e^] Graecismum redolet. Bellarm. de S^riptor Eccles.


) wrote in Greek, and could not understand Merit. And Polycarp the Martyr in
his Prayer above mentioned, uses the term (...), not for to deserve, but for
to attain, procure, or find favor. I thank thee O Father (says he (...).
Eusebius. lib. 4. cap. 15.
) (...), that thou have graciously vouchsafed this day and this hour to allot
me a portion among the number of Martyrs. Now surely had the doctrine of Merit
been Catholic in his days, he would doubtless being now in extremis, and
upon his fiery trial, have recommended himself to God by the Prayers and
Merits of Saints; but he neither pleades his own, nor others Merits, none but
Chaists.

In this Age Polycrates Bishop of Ephesu^, and other Easte^ne Bishops in Asia,
withstood the Pope about keeping the Feast of Easter; Eusebius. hist lib. 5 ca.
^1.22, 23.
they prooved their custom to be received from Saint John, and that it was
practiced and continued by Polycarp the Martyr, and others. This did so vex
Pope Victor, as that he excommunicated the Churches of Asia V^ omnes Eccle^ia
A^^^ ab eodem V^ctore Romano ^xcommunicat^ ^ueri^^. Bell^^. de verbo Dei lib^
3^ cap. 6. Secundo.
: neither did he revoke his Q^^d Vic^^^ sententia^ s^^^m m^^^ve^it, nusquam
le^im^^ Bellarm. lib^ 2. de P. (...) c 19. ^ at obijcit.
censure for ought that Bellarmine can find: and yet Irenaeus a godly Bishop of
Lions in France, sharply rebuked Eusebius. cap. 23.
the Pope for troubling the peace of the Church: yea P^lycrates stood at
defiance with the Pope, and contemned his threats, Eusebius. cap. 22.
to wit, excommunications.

PA.
This was no great difference.

PRO.
If it were a matter of small weight, why then would the Pope excommunicate so
many famous Churches for dissenting from him therein? Besides, Bellarmine
says, Qu^niam ergo Papa vide^at illam diver^itatem de Paschate adferre secum
Haere^in. Bellar. de Romans Pont. lib. 2. cap. 19. S. Quoniam.
that the Pope conceived that this difference might breed heresy; belike then
he thought it a matter of consequence.

Howsoever by this oposition to the Sea of Rome we may observe: that had those
ancient Churches of Asia acknowledged the Popes Supremacy, they would not have
thus opposed his Constitutions, nor slighted his Censures.

In this Age also I find that when Lucius a Christian Prince in this our
Britain, sent to Pope Elentherius, to receive some Laws thence, the Bishop
returned him this Answer, as appears by a Letter or Epistle usually inserted
Haec Epistola communiter habetur inter leges Divi Edwardi. Antiquitat. Britan.
page 5. in Margin.
amongst the Laws of Saint Edward the Confess^ur: Habetis penes vos in regno
vtramque paginam, c^^ illis Dei gratia per Concilium regni vestri sumere
po^estis legem, vicarius vero Dei ^^^is in regno. Antiquitat. Britan. p^g. 5.
There are already within your own Kingdom the Old and New Testament, out of
which by the Council of your Kingdom, you may take a Law to Govern your
people, for you are the Vicar of Christ within your own kingdom. Whence we may
observe, that (howsoever the Papists now adays labor to prove Bellarminus
lib. 2. de Romans Pont. ca. 19. probare nititur primatum Papae^ ex ferendi^
legibus, and censuris.
the Popes Supremacy, by his giving of Laws, and inflicting his Censures on
others,) yet in these ancient times, even by the Popes own acknowledgement,
the King was held to be Supreme Governor within his own Kingdom.

PA.
Belike then, Britain was now Converted to the Faith.

PRO.
It was converted before this time, for in the Reign of this Lucius, Dicetas,
Deane of London, a Manuscript in the Kings Library ad ann. 178. alleged by M.
S^^eds History of Great Br^tain, Book 6. cap. 9. sect. 18.
lived those two learned British Divines, Elvanus of Glastenbury, and Medvinus
of Wells; and these two were sent by King Lucius to the Bishop of Rome, to
desire a supply of Preachers to assist the Britains; and with them returned
Faganus and Damianus, and these jointly with the Britains, preached the

rather a new supply of Preachers^ for John Capgrave a Domynick^ Friar, (one

Doctor to preach the Faith of Christ throughout the whole Island; which shows
that when they were sent Ambassadors to to Ele^therius Bishop of Rome, they

calls them.

THE THIRD CENTVRIE, From the year of Grace, 200. to 300.
PAPIST.
WHom name you in this Age?

PROTESTANT.
In this Age there flourished Tertullian, Origin, and Saint Cyprian; now also
lived Minutius Felix a famous Lawyer in Rome, Arnobius and his eloquent
Scholar Lactantius. Tertullian was a man of a quick and pregnant wit; he
wrote learned and strong Apologies in the behalf of Christians; Cyprian read
daily some part of his writings, and so reverenced him, that he used to say to
his Secretary, Ad notarium dicere consuevit, Da Magistrum, Tertullianum
videlicet designans. Hieron. in Catal. Scriptor. Eccles.
Da magistrum, help me to my Tutour, reach me my master; meaning Tertullian:
afterward, through spite of the Roman Clergy, he revolted to the
Montanists, and was taken up with their idle Prophecies, and Revelations.

Origin was in this his age, a mirror of piety, and of learning of all sorts,
both divine and humane; he conferred the Hebrew text, Eusebius. lib. ^. cap. 16.
with the Greek translations, not only of the Septuagints, but also the
translations of Aquila, Theodosion, and Symmachus; he found out other editions
also, which he set forth and called them Octupla or (...), because every page
contained eight columns, or several translations, such as were then in
estimation: he was of so happy a memory, that he had the Bible without book;
Scripturas memoriter tenuit. Hier. ad Pammach. and Ocean.

Novu^ et vetus Testamentum v^lut alter Esdras memor^ter noverat. Tri^hem. de
scriptor. Eccles.


and could at the sam^ time dictate unto seven several Clerks or Notaries:
Septem Notarijs potuit dictare. Trithem. Ib.
he was of such esteem, that diverse would say, Vincent. Lirinens. de H^res.
cap. 23.
Malle se cum Origene errare, quam cum alijs ver^ sentire; that they had rather
err with Origin, than think aright with others: he exhorted others to
Martyrdom, and from his childhood was himself desirous of the honor
thereof; but in the seventh persecution under Decius he fainted, and his heart
was so overset with fear to have his chaste body defiled with an ugly
Ethiopian, that he chose rather to offer incense to the Idol, then to be so
filthily abused; for this cause he was excommunicated by the Church of
Alexandria, and for very shame fled to Judea, where he was not only gladly
received, but also requested publicly to preach at Jerusalem: But so it was,
Epiphanius co^tr^ H^resin 64. lib. 2. tom. 1. in ^dit. L^^.
falling upon that place of the Psalmist; Unto the ungodly says God; why do
thou preach my Laws, and take my Covenant in thy mouth? whereas thou hate
to be reformed, and have cast my words behind thee: [ Psalm. 50.16.17.] These
wo^ds so deeply wounded his heart with grief, that he closed the book, and
sat down and wept, and all the congregation wept with him. In expounding the
Scriptures, he was curious in searching out of Allegories; and yet falling on
that place Math. 19.12. Some have gelded themselves for the kingdom of heaven,
he took those words literally, and gelded himself, to the end he might live
without all suspicion of uncleanness: Amore castitati^, ut mulier^bu^ secure
auderet pradicare, se castrari fecit. Trithem de Scriptor. Ecclesiast.
whereas he expounded almost all the rest of the Scriptures figuratively. He
held a fond opinion, concerning the pains of devils, and wicked men, after
long torments to be finished. It is usually said of him, Vbi been scripsit,
nem^ melius, ubi male, nemo pejus: where he wrote well^ n^ne better; so that
we may say of him, as Jeremy of his figs, the good, none better, the evil,
non^ worse, Ier. 24.2. Cypria^^ was a learned godly Bishop, and glorious
Martyr, he erred (indeed) in that he would have had, such as had been baptized
by Heretics, if afterward they returned to the true Church, to be
rebaptized: yet he was not obstinate in his error: he was as A^stin says of
him, Non solum do^^^^ sed etiam do^ibilis. August. l. 4. de Baptis. cap. 5.
not only learned, but docible, and willing to be learned; and that Satis
f^cilime o^tendit se correctu^um fuisse sententiam suam, si quis e^
demonstraret. Id. Ibid. lib. 2. cap 4.
he would most easily have altered his opinion, had this question in his life
time been debated by such learned and holy men, as afterward it was: so that
S. Austin makes this observation touching Cyprians error; Prop^ere^ non vidit
aliquid, ut per ^um aliud super eminent^us videre^ur. Id. Ibid. lib. 1. cap. 18.
he therefore saw not this one truth touching Rebaptization, that others might
see in him a more eminent and excellent truth; to wit, his humility, modesty,
and ch^ritie.

Of the Scriptures sufficiency and Canon.
Tertullian, though he stood for Ceremonial traditions unwritten, and for
Doctrinall traditions which were first delivered from the Apostles by word of
mouth, and afterward committed to writing; yet dealing with Hermogenes the
Heretic in a question concerning the faith, (whether all things at the
beginning were made of nothing?) presses him with an Argument ab Authoritate
negative; Whether all things were made of any subject matter, I have An autem
de aliqua subjacenti materia f^cta si^t omnia, ^usquam adhuc legi; Scriptum
esse doceat Hermogenis Officina. Si non est scriptum, tim^a^ vae illud
adijci^^tibus aut de^rahentibus des^inatum. Tertul. advers. Hermog. cap. 22.
as yet read no where (says he) Let those of Hermogenes his shop show that it
is written: if it be not written, let them fear that w^e which is allotted to
such as add or take away: but for himself he professes, that Adoro
Scripturae pi^n^tudin^m. Id. Ibid.
he adoreth the fullness of the Scripture. And why may not we also argue
negatively, touching diverse Tenets of Popery? that from the beginning it was
not so, Math. 19.8.

In the two Testaments (says Origin In quibus liceat omne verbum quod ad D^um
pe^tinet r^quiri et discuti; atque ex ip^is om^em rerum scientiam c^pi. Si qu^d
^^tem super^uerit quod non divina Scriptura decernat^ nullam aliam de bear
terti^m scripturam ad authoritatem scientiae suscipi. Orig. in Levit. Homil. 5.
tom. 1.
) every word that appertains to God may be required and discussed; and all
knowledge of things out of them may be understood: but if any thing do
remain, which the holy Scripture does not determine; no other third Scripture
ought to be received for to authorize any knowl^dge. Origin in his exposition
upon the first Psalm, faith, w^e may not be ignorant, there are two and
twenty books of the old Testament after the Hebrews; which is the number of
the Letters among them. This is likewise witnessed by Eusebius, Eusebius. lib. 6
Histo^. cap^ 24.
that as Origin received the Canon of the Jews, so likewise he rejected those
six books which we term Apocriphall with the Jews.

Of Communion under both; and the number of Sacraments.
Tertullian speaking in general of Christians, says, Caro corpore et sanguine
Christi ^escitur, ut and anim^ de Deo saginetur. Tertul de Resurrect. cap. 8.
the flesh feeds upon the body and blood of Christ, that the soul may be
fat^ed, as it were of God: he speaks of the body and blood of Christ as
distinct things; saying, Corpore and sanguine; and elsewhere he mentions the
Cup given to a Lay-woman, saying, De cujus manu d^^iderabit? de cujus po^ulo
participabit? Ter^ul. lib. ^. ad V^orem cap. 6.
from whose hands shall she desire the Sacramental Bread, of whose Cup shall
she participate? he speaks of a Christian woman married to an Infidel, and
shows the inconvenience of such a match, whereby the faithful wife was like
to be debarred of the comfort of receiving the Sacrament, and drinking of the
Lords Cup. Origin makes this question; Populus in usu habet sanguinem bibere.
Origin. hom. 16. in Number.
What people is it, that is accustomed to drink blood? and he answers the
faithful people. Hereunto Bellarmine says; Respondeo, habet in usu, non in
precepto Bellar. de Euchar. lib. 4 cap. 26.
the people did drink, but they had no comm^nd so to do; where he grants us,
that communicating under both kinds, was the Agend or Church practice in this
age: besides, Origin in this very place alleges Christ's praecept for the Cup
out of the sixth of John.

Cyprian speaking of such as in time of pers^cution, had lapsed and not stuck
to the truth, and ther^upon were barred from the Communion, he desires that
upon their repentance they may be admitted, and he gives this reason: Quomodo
a^ Martyrij poculum idone^s facimus si non eos pri^s ad bibendum in Ecclesi^
pocu u^ Domini jure co^municationis admittimus? Cyprian. epist. 54. ^om. 1. --
lib. 1. epist. 2. in alijs edit.
How shall we sit them for the Cup of Martyrdom, if before we admit them not
by right of Communion to drink of the Lords cup in the Church? And again; In
calice Domini sanctificando, and plebi ministrando, non hoc faciunt, quod Jesus
Christus sacrificij hu^us auctor et doctor, (...) et do^uit. Id. Epist. 63. --
lib. 2. ep. 3.
Because some men out of ignorance, or simplicity in Sanctifying the Cup of the
Lord, and ministering it to the people; do not that which Jesus Christ our Lord
and God, the Author and Institutour of this Sacrifice did and taught: Where
albeit the maine scope of the Epistle be, to prove the necessity of
administering the Sacrament in Wine, and not in mere water, as the Aquarij did;
yet on the bye he discovers the practice of the Church for both kinds; and
says expressly, that the Cup was ministered, or delivered to the people.

Tertullian, in diverse places Nec alibi conjunctos ad Sacramentum Baptismatis,
and Eucharistiae admittens. Tertul. advers. Marcion. lib. 4. cap. 34. and de
Co^ona Militis. cap 3.
of his works acknowledges the same Sacraments with us, to wit, Baptism, and
the Lords Supper: and Beatus Rhenanus in his notes upon Tertullian, observes
the same, and for this he is brought under the Spanish inquisition, Censurae
Inquisitionis Hispanicae in B. Rhenani Aannotationes ad Tertullian. Prout edita
sunt in ^udice Libror. Expurgator. jussu Quiroga. Madriti 1584. ex libro 4.

Sacramenta Primitivae ecclesiae.]
and roughly entertained for his pains, as appears by a Censure passed on
him, and extant Tertulliani opera cum c^stigat. Fr. Iunij in Bibliop.
Commel^^^^^o. 1609.
in the latter end of Tertullians Works.

Of the Eucharist.
Tertullian disputing against Marcion, who denied that Christ had a true Body,
confuteth him by a reason drawn from the Sacrament of the Supper, in this
manner.

A Figure of a Body, presupposes a true Body, for of a show or fantasy there
can be no Figure.

But Christ gave unto his Disciples a Figure of his Body.

Therefore Christ had a true Body.

Tertullians words are these: Ac ^ptum panem and distributum discipulis, corpus
suum illum fecit, hoc est corpus meum dicendo, id est, Figura corporis mei:
figura autem non fuisset, nisi veritatis esset corpus: c^terum vacua res, quod
est phantasma, figuram capere non posset. Tertul. advers. Marcion. lib 4. cap.
40.
Christ taking the Bread, and distributing it to his Disciples, made it his
Body, saying, This is my Body, that is to say, this is a figure of my Body, but
a figure it could not be, unless there were a Body of a truth and in deed: for
a void thing as is a fantasy, can receive no figure. Here Tertullian affirms
expressly of Bread, which he received into his hand, and distributed to his
Disciples, that it it is a figure of Christ's Body. The Rhemists answer,
Rhemists Annot. on Math. 26. chap. sect. 9.
that when some Fathers call the Bread, a figure or sign, they mean the
outward forms of Bread and Wine; but Tertullian proving the truth of Christ's
humanity, by the Sacrament of the Supper, interprets these words, This is my
Body, that is to say, the figure of my Body; where, if by the figure of Christ's
Body, there were nothing else to be understood, but the forms, and outward
shapes, the Here^ike upon this construction might have concluded for himself;
that the figure of his Body is nothing but a bare form and shape of a thing,
therefore he himself was nothing else but a show of a Body, no true Body.

Others expound Tertullians words in this sort: Master Fisher in D. White^
Reply 6 point. pa. 400.401.
The figure of my Body is my Body, or this Bread which under the Law, was a
figure of my Body, is now my Body.

But Tertullian both here, and in diverse other places, (...) Deus in Evangelio
reve^avi^, panem corpus suu^ appellans. Tertul. con. Marcion. l 3. c. 19.

Panem quo corpus suum repraesentat. Ibid. l. 1. c. 14. Et contra Iudaeos. cap.
10.


makes Bread the Subject of the proposition, this is my Body, now the Accidents
and shape of Bread, are not Bread.

In a word Tertullian shows that Christ called Bread his Body, in saying,
this is my Body, as the Prophet Jeremy [ Venite mittamus lignum in ^^nem ejus.
Ierem. 11.] Vtique in corpus; sic enim De^s in Ev^ngelio, panem corpus suum
appellan^^ ut and hin^ ^am eum intellig^^ corpori^ sui figuram p^ni dedisse,
cujus retr^ co^poris in panem Prophets figuravit. Tertul. l. 3. advers.
Marcion. c. 19.
called the body bread, in saying, Let us put wood upon his bread, meaning his
Body; showing them both to be spoken equally in a figurative sense. For
although Tertullian say, that the Bread of the Old Testament was a figure of
Christ's body, yet he denies not thereby that it is so in the new.

The truth is, Tertullians exposition is so full for us, that Gregory Valence
rejects it. Greg. de Valent. in Sum. Aquin. tom. 4 disp. 6. de praes^nti^
Ch^isti in Euchar. page 968. Paris. 1609.


Cyprian in the third Epistle of his second book, says, Vinum fuit, quod
sanguinem suum dix^t.
We find that the Cup which the Lord offered was mixed, and that that which he
called blood was wine. So that if we ask Cyprian, what consecrated thing it
was which Christ had in his hands, and gave to his Disciples? he answers,
D^dit Dominus noster in mens^ proprijs manibus panem and vinum; in cruce vero
manibus militum corpus tradidit vulner^^dum.

-- Vt significant^^ and significata eisdem vocabuli^ consecre^tur. Cypr. lib.
de V^ctione number. 7.


it was bread and wine; and not absolutely that, which he gave up to be
crucified on the Cross by Soldiers, (namely) his body and blood; if again we
demand of Cyprian, why Christ called the bread which he had in his hand, his
body? he readily answers, saying, the things signifying (or signs) are
called by the same names, whereby the things signified are termed.

Objection.
Cyprian says, that this bread is changed, not in shape, but in nature, natura
mutatus, Panis iste non e^^igie, sed natura mutatus omnipotentia verbi factus
est caro. Cypr. de coena. Dom. nu. 6.
and by the omnipotency of God, is made flesh: now omnipotency is not
required to make a thing to be a sign significant. Omnipotentia non
requiritur, ad faciendum ut res aliquid significet. Bell. lib. 2. de Euch c. 14.


Answer.
Bellarmine says, Bellar de scriptor. Eccles. and lib. 2 de Euch^r. cap. 9.
extet.

Et de Confirmat. lib. 2. cap. 6.


Cyprian was not the Author of the book De Coena Domini; and he says well,
for these Sermons are extant Doctor James of the Bast^rdie of Fathers. Part. 1.
page 12.
in All-Soules College Library in Oxford, in an ancient Manuscript under the
name of Arnoldus Bonavillacensis, and Dedicated not to Pope Cornelius, (as
these are pretended) but to Adrian the fourth, about the year 1150, the same
time that Saint Bernard lived, and wrote an Epistle to this Arnoldus.

But to let it pass for Cyprians; it follows not, the bread is changed in
nature, therefore it is Transubstantiated; for every change of nature is not a
change of substance; nature implies qualities and properties, as well as
substances: an evil man changes his nature when he becomes a good man, yet is
he not Transubstantiated; bread is ch^nged when of common it becomes
consecrated to an holy use, and office, and omnipotency is required to make
the dead and corruptible elements, a bit of bread, and a draught of wine, not
only significative, but truly exhibitive seals of the body and blood of
Christ; and to elevate them so high as to be channels and effectual
instruments of Grace.

Besides, the Author by the words natura mutatus, changed in nature, understood
not a coporall change; for in the same sentence he declares himself, Et sicut
in person^ Christi, humanitas videbatur, and la^ebat divinitas; it^ Sacramento
visibili, ineffabiliter divina se insudit essentia. Cypr. de coena Dom. number. 6.
by the example of Christ's humanity, which being personally united to the
Deity, is changed, but not so as that it loses his natural form and
substance.

Origin against Christ's Body going into the Draught.
To proceed, Origin says, Ille cibus qui sanc^i^icatur per verbum Dei, perque
objecrationem, juxta id quod habet materiale, in ventrem abit, and in se^essum
^ij citur; caeterum juxta precationem qu^ illi a^cessit pro port^o^e ^idei fit
ut^lis: nec materia panis, sed super illum dictus sermo est, qui prodest non
indigne domino comeden^i illum: and haec quidem de Typico Symbolicoque corpore.
Origin. in Math. cap. 15.
that meat which is Sanctified by Gods Word and Prayer, as touching the
material part thereof, goes into the belly, and is voyded into the draught;
but as touching the Prayer which is added according to the portion of Faith, it
is made profitable; neither is it the matter of bread, but the word spoken over
it, which profits him that does not unworthily eat thereof; and these things I
speak of the Typical and Symbolicall body. Here we see Origin
disting^isheth between the Spiritual bread, which is the real body of
Christ, and the bread Sacramental, saying, that not that body, but this bread
goes into the draught, or seege, which no sanctified heart can conceive of
Christ's body.

Now whereas Bellarmine says, Bellar. lib. 2 de Euc^ar. cap. 8.. ad tertium.
that the Accidents only are called by Origin the material part: we answer
that it was never heard that mere Accidents were called (which are Origens
words in this place) either meats or materials.

The truth is, this place of Origens touching the typical and symbolical body,
is so clear for us, that Sixtus Senensis grows jealous of it: to speak my
mind freely (says he Ego, ut libere pronun^em sen^entiam meam su^picor hunc
locum suisse a^ hereticis depravatum. Sixth. Sen. Biblioth^ Sanct. lib. 6. Annot
66.
) I suspect this place to be corrupted by Heretics.

Of Images, and Prayer to Saints.
Concerning Images, Origin replieth thus to Celsus the Philosopher; that (...).
Origin. contr. Celsum. li. 7. page 3^6.
it is not a thing possible that one should know God, and Pray to Images; and
that Christians did (...). Id. ibid. page 387.
not esteem these to be Divine Images, who used not to describe any figure of
God, who was invisible and without all bodily shape, nor could endure to
worship God with any such kind of service as this was. In like manner, when
the Gentiles demanded of the ancient Christians, Cur nullas aras habent, te^pl^
nulla, nulla nota simula^hr^? Min. Felix in Octavio. page 27.
why they had no known Images? Minutius Felix returns them for answer again:
Quod enim simulach^um Deo singam, ^um si recte existimes, sit Dei homo ipse
simulachrum. Id. ibid. page 104.
What Image shall I make to God, when man himself, if thou rightly judge, is
Gods Image? and again, Cruces c^iam n^^ colimus, n^^ optamus. Id. ibid. page
97.
we neither worship, nor wish for Crosses: these holy Images which vain men
serve, want all sense, because they are earth. Now who is there that
understands not, that it is un^it for an upright creature to be bowed down,
that he may worship the earth? which for this cause is put under our feet,
that it may be trodden upon, not worshipped by us, Ipsae imagines sacrae, quibus
vaniss^^^ homines servlunt, omni sensu c^^^ent, quoniam terra sunt: quis autem
non intelligat, nesas esse rectum animal curvari, ut ad ret t^^ram? quae
id^irco pedibus nostris ^ubjecta est, ut cal^and^ nobis, non adoranda ^it.
L^ctan^ Divinar. Iustit. li. 2. cap. 18.
wherefore there is no doubt, that there is no Religion, wheresoever there is
an Image: Quare non est dubium, quin Religio nulla sit, ubi^u^que simulachrum
est. Id. ibid. cap 19.
thus far Lactantius.

Tertullian stood not only against adoration of Images, but al^o against the
very making of them; Idolum t^m sieri qu^m coli Deus prohibet. Tertul. de
Idolatr^ c^p. 4. and 5.
as formerly Clemens Alexandrinus had done.

Concerning Saintly Invocation, Origin says, (...). Origin lib. 8. cont.
Celsum. page 432.
we must endeavor to please God alone, and labor to have him Propitious unto
us, procuring his good^will with godl^nesse, and all kind of virtue. And if
Celsus will yet have us to procure the good^will of any others, after him that
is God over all, let him consider, that as when the body is moved, the motion
of the shadow thereof does follow it; so in like manner, having God favorable
unto us, who is over all, it follows that we shall have all his friends,
both Angels, and Souls, and Spirits loving unto us. And whereas Celsus had
said of the Angels, that they belong to God, and in that respect, we are to
pray unto them, that they may be favorable to us; to this Origin answers in
this manner: (...). Id. ibid. page 406.
Away with Celsus his Council, saying, that we must pray to Angels; for we must
pray to him alone who is God over all, and we must pray to the Word of God, his
only begotten, and the first borne of all creatures, and we must entreat him,
that he as high Priest would present our Prayer (when it comes to him) unto his
God, and our God.

Objection.
Jesuit Fisher says, M. Fishers Rejoinder to D. Whites Reply.
that Origin in his writings upon Job O bea^e Job ora pro nobis miseris. Orig.
l 2. in Job
and Numbers Quis dubitat quod sanctiqueque orationibus nos ^^vent. Orig. in
cap. 31. number.
taught Invocation of Saints.

Answer.
Bellarmine says, Bellar. de Scriptor. Eccles in Origin.
that Origin was not the author of those books upon Job: for therein is
mention made of the Homousians (so the Arrians called the Orthodox believers).
Now the Arrians rose not till after Origens time.

Origin indeed upon the Canticles says, Si dix^ris sanctos pro nobis orare non
erit inconveniens. Orig. in Cant. cap 2.
it is not inconvenient to say, that the Saints pray for us; and in his Homily
upon Iosuah, he ^aith, Ego fic arbitror, quod om^es illi qui do^mie^uat ante
no^ P^tres, pugnent nub^seum, and adj^^e^t nos oratio^ib^s sui^. Origin. in
Ios. Homil 16.
I do think thus, that all those Fathers who are departed this life before
us, do assist us with their Prayers: and in another place he says, ^^m (...)
si etiam extra corpus positi sancti, agunt aliqu^^, and laborant pro nobis,
ha^^^atur hoc quoque inter ^^^ulta Dei, nec ^ha^ (...) committenda m^ st^ria.
I^. lib 2 in epist. ad Rom cap 2.
if the Saints that have left the body, and be with Christ, do any thing, and
labor for us; let this also remain among the hidden things of God, and
mysteries that are not to be committed unto writing. Now we yield that the
Saints pray for us in general; yet hence it follows not, that we should
direct our prayers to them. Besides, Origens, if, and, as I suppose, and it is
not inconvenient to say so; these are but ^aint affirmations, showing that he
speaks doubtfully, as on not fully resolved that it was so, and in conclusion
determines, si laborant pro nobis, if in particular, upon particulars, they
do labor for us, yet it is amongst Gods secrets, and a mystery not to be
committed to writing.

Object.
It appears by Saint Cyprian, Si quis nostr^m prier d^vin^ dignationis
ce^eritate pracesseri^, p^rseveret ^pud cum nustra dilectio pro fratribus and
sororibus ^pud m^^ericord^^m Patris non ce^^et oration Cypr. lib. 1. epist. 1.
vel (ut in alij^ edit.) epist. 57. ad Cornel. and de Discipl. and ha^itu. virg.
that the Faithful us^d to covenant in their life time, that whether of them
went to heaven before the other, he should pray for his surviving friend.

Answer.
Concerning Saint Cyprians conceit, that the Saints after death remembered
their old friends here, as having taken fresh and particular notice of their
several states, votes, and necessities; it follows not thence, that other
Saints unacquainted with our particular desires and exigents, do in
particular, and by their merits, intercede for the living; and though they
should make suit on our behalf, yet we have no warrant to pray to them.

To close up this point of Prayer to Saints, Tertullian, Cyprian, Gregory
Nyssen, with others, have written set Treatises de Oratione, of Prayer, and
therein they deliver nothing touching this Saintly invocation: but teach us to
regulate Aliter orare quam Christus do^uit, non ignorantia sola est, sed and
culpa. Cypr. de Orat. Dom.
all our Prayers according to that perfect pattern prescribed by our great
Master; wherein we are required to direct our Petitions unto our Father which
is in heaven: Math 6.9. Luke 11.2.

These things (says Tertullian Haec ab alio orare non poss^m quam a quo me
sci^ consecuturum, quoniam and ipse est qui solus praestat, et ego sum cui
impetrare debetur, famulus e^us, qui eum solum observo. Tertul. in Apologet.
cap. 30.
in his Apology for the Christians in his time) I may not pray for from any
other, but from him of whom I know I shall obtain them; because both it is he
who is alone able to give, and I am he unto whom it appertains to obtain that
which is requested, being his servant, qui eum solum observo, who observe him
alone.

Of Faith and Merit.
Origin says Dicit sufficere solius Fidei Iustificationem. Orig. lib. 3. in
epist. ad Romans c. 3.
that Faith only suffiseth to justification; and concerning Merit, the same
Origin says, Vix mihi suadeo, quod possit ullu^ opus esse, quod^x debito
remuneratione^ Dei depos^at; cum c^iam hoc ipsum, quod agere aliquid possumus,
vel cogitare, vel proloqui, ipsius d^no^ and largitate ^aciamus. Orig. lib. 4.
in epist. ad Romans c. 4.
I ca^ ^ardly he persuaded, that there can be any work which may require the
reward of God by way of debt, seeing this very thing it self, that we can
do, or think, or speak any thing, we do it by his gift and largess.

Objection.
Did not Origin and Tertullian hold Purgatory?

Answer.
Bellarmine indeed alleges Bellar^ lib. de purgat. cap. 4.. tertio.

that he was led with the spirit of Montanus the Heretic when he wrote that

confesses, he was one of those who approoved so much of Purgatory, that he
acknowledged no other pains after this life, but Purgatory penalties only; so
that with him Hell and Purgatory were all one.

Objection.
In Saint Cyprians time, Cyprian lib 3 ^p^. 15. Tertulli^n de Pudicit^^ cap 22.
the Martyrs entreated the Church for mitigation of penance imposed upon some
offenders; so that the satisfactions and suffering of Martyrs were communicated
to others, and thereby their indulgence or pardon was procured.

Answer.
In those times of persecution, when many weak ones fell away from the open
profession of the truth, and sacrifised to Idols, the Church sought by all
means to honor Martyrdom, and encourage Christians thereunto; so that upon
the request of imprisoned Confessors, and designed Martyrs, the Bishops were
wont to release some time the Canonical censure enjoined by the Church: but
these Martyrs did not he^eby think that they had made satisfaction for the
temporal pain of Sin. Besides, this was spoken of living Martyrs, and not of
Ma^tyrs defunct; and of releasing censures, and forgiving faults in this world
only, and not in Purgato^y.

the rest of the Apostles were even the same that Peter was, being endued with
the like fellowship of honor and power. Cyprian indeed reverenced the Sea of
Rome, yet would he have her keep within her bounds, as appears in the case
of Fortu^atus, and others; for so it was, Cyprian having censured them, and
fearing lest they should fly to Rome, and there seek favor and protection
from that Sea, and so work distraction between Rome and Carthage, makes a
decree to prevent Appeals to other places, or claims of other Bishops: and
this Synodall Epistle is sent to Pope Corn^lius, persuading him not to admit of
their complaints: Seeing that it is decreed of us all (says S. Cyprian) N^m

that it is meet and right that every man's cause be heard where the crime is
committed; and every Pastor has committed unto him a portion of the Flock (of
Christ) which he is to gov^rne, and whereof he is to give an account unto
God; and they who are under our government ought not to gad and wander, but
they should plead their cause there, where both Accusers and Witnesses may be
had; except some few desperate and naughty fellows think the authority of the
Bishops of Afric, which have already judged and condemned them to be l^sse,
meaning less than that of Cornelius, to whom they fled.

Here we find opposition made to the Sea of Rome by that Catholic Cyprianus

makes appealing to Rome, and not appealing from thence, a main^ proof of the
Popes Supremacy.

Now to close up this age, and to look a little homeward; all this time the
Christian Religion flourished quietly in Britain, till in Dioclesians days
(which made up the tenth persecution) their Churches were demolished, their
Bibles burnt, their Priests and their flock murdered: for now was Saint Alban
beheaded Math. Westmon. ad annum 303.
at the City Verulam, now called after him Saint Albanes, of whom Fortunatus
Presbyter an ancient Poet says: Albanum egregium foecunda Britannia prof^rt.
Fruitful Britain brings forth,
Alban, a Martyr of great worth.


He was the first that in Britain suffered death for Christ his sake;
whereupon he is called our Stephen, and the Proto-martyr of Britain. In like
sort his Teacher, or Instructor Amphibalus Math. Westmon. Ibid.
was cruelly Martyred at the same place, being whipped about a stake, whereat
his entrails were tied, and thus winding his bowels out of his body, was at
last stoned to death; so also was Julius and Aaron Master Speeds History lib.
6. cap. 9. sect. 19.
Martyred at Leicester; and in Lichfield so many, that the place became another
Colgatha, or field of dead corpse, for which cause the City does bear a field
charged with many Martyrs diversely tortured, they bear it for their Seal of
Arms, even unto this day, as Master Camden has recorded. Now these Martyrs
they suffered for that truth which we at this day hold; and not for Popish
Tenets, which then were not in being.

We have now Surveyed the Fathers Faith, and practice of the Church, for the
first three hundred years next after Christ; and by this particular, (as
Hercules whole body was measured by the breadth of his foot) the Reader may
proportion what were the Churches Creed, and her Agends generally and
constantly taught and practiced in these times, and I doubt not but he shall
find, that for substance of Religion they held as we do, and not as the
modern Papists do; so that in comparison of Original, and Primitive
Antiquity, Popery is but noveltie, and this has been already shown, when as
we drew the Character of the three first Centuries. I will now only give
instance in the point of Indulgences, and show, that in these best and ancient
times, there were no such Popes pardons, as afterward were marted. For in
latter times we find it recorded in the Salisbury Primer, Horae B. virginis
Mar^^ ad Sarisburtensis ^cclesiae ritum ^um Orationibus and Indulgentijs Paris.
1529.
that John the two and twentieth, for the mumbling over of some short Prayers,
granted a Pardon of no less, than a million of years. Besides, these three
Prayers be written in the Chapel of the holy Cross in Rome, who that devoutly
say them, they shall obtain ten hundred thousand years of Pardon for deadly
sin, granted by our Holy Father, John the two and twentieth Pope of Rome: and
of another Prayer to be said as one goes through a Churchyard, the same book
says, as follows: Ioannes Papa 12. concessit omnibus ^icenti^us orationem
sequentem transe^^d^ per C^emeterium tot ann^^um Indulgenti^s, quot fue^unt ibi
corpora inhumata ^ cons^itutione ipsius Coemeterij. Id. quo supra.
Pope John the twelfth granted to all that shall say the Prayer following, as
they pass by any Churchyard, as many years of Indulgences, as there have
been bodies there buried since the Consecration of the said Churchyard.

In the same book, there is power given to one little prayer beginning with O
bone Jesus, to change the pains of Hell into Purgatory, and after that again,
the pains of Purgatory, into the joys of Heaven. This Prayer is written in a
Table that hanged at Rome, in Saint Peter's Church, near to the high Altar,
there, as our holy Father the Pope is wont to say Mass; and who so that
devoutly with a contrite heart daily say this Orizon, if he be that day in the
state of eternal damnation, then his eternal pain shall be changed him into
temporal pain of Purgatory, and if he have deserved the pain of Purgatory,
it shall be forgotten and forgiven, through the infinite mercy of God. Now
sure I think that Antiquity cannot parallel such presidents as these.

THE FOVRTH CENTVRIE, From the year of Grace, 400. to 500.
PAPIST.
WHat say you to this fourth Age?

PROTESTANT.
This was a learned Age, Bucolceri Chronolog. hoc tempore fulserunt in Ecclesia
Dei clarissima lumina. ad Ann. 365.
for now there lived Optatus Bishop of Milevis in Africa, and in Asia there
lived Epiphanius Bishop of Cyprus, Cyril Bishop of Jerusalem, Macharius the
Monk, Basil the great; the Christian Demosthenes, as Erasmus calls him Dan
Tossanus in Synopsi de Legendis Patribus. cap. 3.
, Gregory Nazianzene surnamed the Divine, and Grigory Nyssen brother to Saint
Basil, these three were equal in time, dear friends, and of near alliance;
now also lived the Hammer of the Arrian Heretics Athanasius the great, Bishop
of Alexandria, great indeed for his learning, for his virtue, for his labor,
for his suffering, when almost the whole world was set against him; but above
all great for his Creed, the Athanasian Creed. He suffered much trouble for the
truth, but God upheld him, so that he dyed in peace, full of days, after he
had governed the Church of Al^xandria six and forty years: Nazianzene compared
Percuti^^tibus Alamas ^ffi^itur. Nazianzen. orat. 31. in laudem Athanasij.
him in time of adversity to the Adamant, for that no trouble could break him;
and in time of prosperity to the Lodestone, for that he allured the hearts of
men, more intractable then Iron, to embrace the Truth of God.

In Europe there lived Hilarie Bishop of Poictiers in France, and Ambrose
Bishop or Millaine; Ambrose was a man of noble parentage, under the Emperor
Valentinian he was Governor of Liguria, he was chosen from a secular judge to
be Bishop of Millaine, and was feign to be christened before he could be
consecrated, he was zealous and resolute, he sharply reproved Theodosius for
the sl^ught^r of the innocent people of Thessalonica, he was grievously
troubled by the Lady Iustina, mother to Valentinian the second, he said to his
friends that were about him at his death, P^ssid. de vita Augustini. cap. 27.
tom. 1. Non sic vixi, ut me pudeat inter vos vivere, nec mori ^imeo qu^a bonum
habemus Dominum Et Buchol^er. in Chronol. ad Ann. 398.
I have not so lived, that I am ashamed to live longer, nor yet fear I death,
because I have a good Lord.

Of the Scriptures sufficiency.
Athanasius says, (...) Athan. orat 1. cont. Gent. tom. 1. sufficient per se,
vertit Petr. Nann^us.
the holy Scriptures given by inspiration of God, are of themselves sufficient
to the discovery of truth; now if they be (as the word signifies)
allsuf^icient to instruction, then must they needs be all sufficient to all
instruction in the truth intended, and not only sufficient for this or that
point, as Bellarmine would have it L^quitur non de omnibus d^gm^^^bus, sed
sol^m ^e duobus. B^ll^r de verbo Dei non script^. li. 4. cap. 11.. Profert.
Saint Hilarie commends Vere te D. Constanti Imperator admiror, ^idem tantum
(...) lu^^ ea quae scripta sunt deside antem. Hilar. de ^rinit. lib. 2.
the Emperor Constantius, for desiring the Faith to be ordered only according
to those things that be written: the same Hilarie Su^^^^^ebat quul^ crede^tibus
Dei se^m^^ quid enim in eolem Sacramento saluris hum^n^e non contin^tu^? aut
quid sit quod reliquum est, aut obs^rii? pl^na sunt omnia ut a ple^^ and

assures us that in his days, the word of God did suffice the believers; yea,
what is there says he, concerning man's salvation, that is not contained in the
word of the Evangelist? what wants it, what obscurity is there in it? all
things there are full and perfect.

Saint Basil says, (...). Basil. (...). de side, Inter Ascetica, ^ive
exercitamenta Monach. tom. 2.
it is a manifest falling from the Faith, and an argument of arrogancy, either
to reject any point of those things that are written, or to bring in any of
those things that are not written.

Gregory Nyssen lays this for a ground, (...). Greg Nyssen. de Anima and
Resu^rect. to. 2. edit. Gr. and Lat. page 639.
which no man should contradict; that in that only the truth must be
acknowledged, wherein the seal of the Scripture testimony is to be seen.

The same Father in an oration of his, calls the Scripture, (...). Id. tom.
2. deijs qui adeunt Hierosol.
an even, straight, and inflexible Rule; neither ment^oneth he any more rules
but this on^; and adding the word ipsa to the Rule, he delareth the same to be
an adaequate, and only Rule.

Of the Scripture Canon.
The Council of Laodicea says, Quae autem opor^eat legi, and in authoritatem
recipi haec sunt; Gen^sis etc Not mentioning the Controversed Books. Con^il.
Laod. Can. 59. Caranz. in Sum. Council.
we ought to read only the books of the Old and New Testament; yea the same
Council recites only those Canonical books of Scripture which we allow, and
the Canons of this Council though a provincial Council, are confirmed by the
sixth general Council in Trullo: now if it be replied, the Laodicean Council
excludes the Apocrypha, the Carthaginian Council receives them, and both these
were confirmed in the sixth general Council, held in the Palace called Trullo,
and how can this stand together? the matter is thus reconciled; the Laodicean
speaks of the Canon of Faith, the Carthaginian of the Canon of good manners;
to both which the sixth Council subscribed in that sense, and we to it.

To proceed, Hilary tells us; In viginti duos libros, Lex Testamenti ve^^^is
deputet^r, u^ cum literarum numero conveni^ent. Hill. in Prolog. in Psalm.
explanat.
the Law of the Old Testament is contained in two and twenty books, according
to the number of the Hebrew letters; and Athanasius says the same, and as
touching the Apocryphal books, as namely, the book of Wisdom, Maccabees,
and the rest, he says; Praeter i^^os au^em ^unt ad^uc alij e^u^dem veteris
Instrumenti Libri, qui non sunt Canonici, qui Catechumenis ta^tum legantur,
Sapientia Sal^m^nis, etc. Athanas. in Synopsi.
Libri non sunt Canonici; they are read only to the Caetechumens, (or novices
in Religion) but are not Canonical.

Epiphanius after he had reckoned up the Canon of two and twenty books,
censureth the books of Wisdom and Ecclesias^icus in these words; (...)
Epipha^. in (...). de pond. and men's
they are fit and profitable, but not reckoned amongst those books which are
received by our Church; and therefore were neither laid up with Aaron, nor in
the Arc of the New Testament.

Ruffinus, in his explanation of the Creed, which is found among Saint
Cyprians works, and so attributed to him, sets down the Catalogue,
containing all those books which we admit, secluding all those that are now in
question; we must know (says he) Al^j ^^bri sunt qui ^^n sunt Canonic^, sed
E^clesiastici a maso^ib^s appellati sunt, ut Sapientia Salomonis^ and alia Sap.
quae d^citur filij Syrach, ejusdem ord^n^^ est Liber T^bi^, and Iud^th and
Maccab eorum Libri -- quae omnia legi quidem in Ecclesijs volue^unt, non t^men
pro^erri ad authoritatem ex his Fidei con^^rm^nd^m. Ru^^in. sive Cyp^^an. in
explic. Symboli. page 189 par. 1580.
that there be also other books, which are not Canonical, but are called of
our Ancestors, Ecclesiastical, as is the Wisdom of Solomon, Ecclesiasticus,
Tobias, Judith, and the books of Maccabees; all which they will indeed have to
be read in the Church, but not to be alleged for Confirmation of Faith. To
this testimony of Ruffin, Canus a Popish writer thus replieth: Ru^^inus (pa^e
Le^tor^^ ^ictum sit) ^a^rum trad^ti^n^s igno^avit Canus Loc. (...) l 2. c. 11.
although Ruffin did affirm, that the books of Maccabees were to be rejected
by the tradition of the Fathers, yet by the Readers leave, he was ignorant of
that Tradition; as if Canus a late writer, were better skilled in the Primitive
tradition than Ruffinus, or Cyprian.

Gregory Nazianzen names (...). Greg N^z. in edit. G^ae^o-lat to. 2. number 33^
all the books that we admit, save that he omitteth the book of Hester,
being misperswaded of the whole, by reason of those Apocryphal additions to it.

Now Bellarmine would shift off such testimonies as these, by saying; S^i^bat
rem non fu^sse a (...) a G^^^rali Con^il^o d^s^^^tam. Bel^^r. de verbo Dei. li.
1 cap. 10.
it was no fault in them to reject these book^s, because no general Council
in their days had decreed any thing touching them. But we ask how it came to
pass, that so many Catholic Divines after this pretended decree of their
Canon rejected these books, as others had done before; for some in every Age
rejected them.

Of Communion under both; and number of Sacraments.
Gregory Nazianzene says of his sister Gorgonia, in this manner: (...). Gr.
Nazianz. orat. 11. in laud. Gorgon.

-- ac ^icubi quidpiam signorum preciosi corporis aut sanguinla manus
condiderat. Interpret Iac. Billio. tom. 2. orat 35 edit. Lat.


if her hand had laid up any portion of the types or tokens of the precious
body, and of the blood: he says, that his sister after she had communicated,
she laid up some part of the Sacrament, of the body and blood of Christ, now as
she kept the consecrated bread in a cloth, so she might carry the wine in a
vial; howsoever this religious woman received in both kinds.

The same Nazianzen bids, (...). Greg. Nazian. orat. 40. in sanctum Baptism.
tom. 1.
reverence the Lords Table to which thou have access, the bread whereof thou
have been partaker, the cup which thou have communicated, being initiated in
the passions of Christ.

Athanasius, being accused for breaking a Chalice, writes thus; (...).

Hie enim usus est C^lici^ and p^aeter cum alius nullus; eoque solo vos
legitimo ritu propinatis populo. Athan. Apolog. 2. contra Arrianos. to. 2. p^g.
385. Petro Nannio Interpret.


What manner of Cup? or when? or where was it broken? in every house there are
many Pots, any of which if a man break, he commits not sacrilege; but if
any man willingly break the sacred Chalice, he committs sacrilege; but that
Chalice is no where, but where there is a lawful Bishop: This is the use
destined to that Chalice, none other; wherein you, according to institution,
do drink unto, and before the Laity. This was the custom in Athanasius his
days.

Saint Ambrose speaks to a great secular Prince Theodosius in this sort;
(...). Theodoret^ hist. eccles. lib 5. cap. 18. -- and Ambros. in orat. ad
Theodos.
How dare you lift up to him those hands, from which the blood yet droppeth?
will you receive with them the sacred body of our Lord? or how will you put in
your mouth his precious blood, who in the commanding fury of your wrath have
wickedly shed so much innocent blood? The same Saint Ambrose, in his Ambros. de
Sacramentis^ tom 4. and de ijs qui Mysterijs initian^^r.
Treatise that he wholly set apart for the laying forth of the Doctrine of
the Sacraments, specifyeth not any other, than either those two of ours,
Baptism, and the Lords Supper; and yet we have of his (as they are divided)
six^ books de Sacramentis, of the Sacraments. And so I come to treat of the
Sacrament Of the Eucharist.

PA.
You have produced Hilarie and Cyril of Jerusalem, on your side, whereas they
make for us in the point of the Sacrament; Saint H^larie says, nos vere verbum
carnem cibo Dominico sumimus; Hill. l. 8. de Trinitate.

PRO.
Hilaries testimony was much urged by Mr. Musket Priest, and was notably
cleared by Doctor Featly, in the second days disputation; now to the place
alleged he says, The Word truly became Flesh, truly, to wit, by Faith and
Spiritually, not with the mouth, and carnally.

Objection.
These words of Hilarie, Sub Sacramento communicandae carnis, and the like
following, nos vere sub mysterio carnem corporis sui sumimus, we truly
receive the Flesh of his body under a mystery, prove the real presence of
Christ's flesh under the forms of bread and wine.

Answer.
Saint Hilarie, by the words, [ Sub Sacramento, and sub mysterio carnem
sumimus], means nothing, but that in a mystery, or Sacramentally, we eat the
true flesh of the Son of God; sub mysterio is no more than in mysterio, that
is, mystically, under a similitude, in a similitude, or after a resemblance.

Object.
St. Hilarie says, in the book alleged [de veritate carnis and sanguinis
non est relictus ambigendi locus] of the truth of Christ's flesh and blood
there is no place left for doubting.

Answer.
Neither do we doubt of the truth of Christ's body and blood, but firmly
believe the doctrine of the true Inca^nation of Christ.

Objection.
Hilarie says [in nobis carnalibus manentem per carnem Christum habemus] we
men consisting of flesh and blood have Christ remaining in us by his flesh.

Answer.
So we have by reason of our mystical union with Christ's flesh, and not by
any corporal transubstantiation of our flesh into Christ. The same Hilarie
says [nos in eo naturaliter inessemus, ipso in nobis naturaliter permanente]
Christ is naturally in us, and we in him, but we are not in him naturally or
carnally by any transubstantiation, therefore neither is he so in us; these
terms then of Hila^ies, [permanent^m in nobis carnaliter silium] the son
remaining in us carnally, note only a greater and more real union, than
barely by consent or concord of will, such as the Arrians acknowledged only
betwixt the Father and the Son, denying an unity of nature, purposely to
avoid that text, I and the Father are one^ Hilary speaking of this near union,
calls it the mystery of a true and natural union, [ mysterium verae ac
naturalis unitatis] and so indeed it is, in respect of Christ's inseparable
union which he has with us by his incarnation, by which he is become flesh of
our ^lesh, and bone of our bone; and in respect of our mystical union with him
and his body, whereby we become members of Christ's body, and quickened by his
spirit.

Object.
Saint Cyril in his fourth Catechism says, He that in the marriage of Cana
changed water into wine, by his only will, is not he worthy that we believe
him that he has changed wine into his blood?

Answer.
S. Cyrils place maintains not Popish transubstantiation; for in this, the
shapes and accidents remain, and the material substance is corrupted; but in
our Saviors miracle in the second of Saint John, the shapes, accidents, and
form were changed, and the common material substance remained, John 2.9.

Object.
Cyril says it is not simple bread and wine, it is not (...). ibid.

Answer.
He shows his meaning to be this, namely, that the consecrated bread, is not
common, ordinary, and mere natural bread; but sanctified, elevated, and
changed to supernatural use and operation. And so I proceed.

The Elements called Antitypes after Consecration.
The Fathers of this age, treating of the Sacramental Signs, call them
Similitudes, correspondent types or figures of the body and blood of Christ;
the figure of the body and blood of the Lord Jesus, says Similitudinem
p^etiosi sanguinis bibis. Ambr. de Sacram. lib. 4. cap. 4.
Ambrose: and Nazianzene speaks (as we have heard) of his sisters laying up
some portion of the types or tokens of Christ's precious body and blood; and
again, (...). Greg. Nazian. Apolog. orat. 1. tom. 1 quomodo illud magno^um
mysteriorum Antitypum ipsi offerre a^derem?
how durst I offer unto him the type of so great a mystery; in l^ke sort Cyril
of Hierus^lem calls Cyril. Hierosol. 5. Cate^he^. Mystag.
them types and antitypes; and they call the Symboles after Consecration
[Antitypes.] Now that which is a figure, similitude, and representation of a
thing, is not properly the same.

PA.
It follows not Rhemists Annot. on Luke 22. Sect. 7 on Heb. 1. sect. 1 and
the Rejoinder to D. Whites Reply the 6. point.
the Eucharist is termed the figure of Christ's natural body, therefore it is
not substantially and properly his body. The figure of a thing may be the same
with the thing figured. Christ Jesus is a figure of his Fathers substance,
[Hebr. 1.3.] and yet is the same substantially with the Father, John 10.30.

PRO.
There is such opposition of Relatives, as that the sign and the thing
signified cannot be the same in that very respect and point, wherein they are
opposite: for the instance brought, it follows thus; the son is the
cha^acter of his Fathers substance, ergo the Son is not the Father, though of
the same substance, nor is the Father the Son: so must the opposition of
necessity hold; the Sacrament is the figure, sign, and representation of
Christ's body, ergo it is not the body of Christ, but sacramentally, and
figuratively.

In a word; you say, that Christ is a Character, and figure of his Father, and
yet of the same substance; but to have spoken home to the matter in question,
you should have said, that Christ a figure of the Fathers person, is yet the
same person that the Father; which is utterly false.

To proc^ed, Saint Ambrose says; Si ergo tanta vis est in sermon Domini, ut
inciperent esse quae non erant quanto magis operator^us est, ut sint quae
^rant, and to aliud commut^ntur. Ambr. de sacram. l 4 ca. 4.
if th^re be such v^rtue in the words of our Lord, to make those things that
were not, to begin to be; how much more powerful is his word, that they
remain the same they were, and yet be changed into another thing? he holds
the bread and wine in the Lords Supper to remain, to be the same tha^ they
were; therefore they are not changed in substance, for then they should not be
the same they were; yet he says they are changed into other, to wit, not in
substance but in quality, use, and signification; for so he says, Ante
benedictionem alta species nominatur post consecrationem corpus significatur.
Ambr. lib. de ijs qui mysterijs initian^^r.
before the blessing of the heavenly words another kind is named; after the
Consecration, the body of Christ is signified. Now if by the consecrated bread
in the Eucharist the body be signified, then is not bread essentially the body.

PA.
Saint Ambrose in the ninth chapter of such as are newly instructed in the
mysteries says; Ambr. de ijs qui myster. initiantur. cap 9.
Moses his word changed the water of Egypt into blood; if so great was the
benediction of man, what may we think of divine Consecration where the very
words of our Savior work: he says also, Quia benedictione etiam Natura ipsa
mutatur. Id. ibid.
that by benediction or consecration the nature of the Elements in the Lords
Supper is changed.

PRO.
Among the six or seven examples bro^ght by Saint Ambrose, only two are
substantial, and the rest accidental, for in the place alleged, he adds
also these examples; that Moses divided the Red Sea, that Jordan turned his
course, that the bitter waters of Mara were made sweet; in all which works of
God there was no Transubstantiation; for the waters and the Red Sea were the
same in nature and substance, as they were before; so that by these examples it
appears, that notwithstanding Saint Ambrose say, the nature is changed, yet
he meant a change in quality only, and not in substance. And such a change
there is in the Eucharist; the Elements are changed, when of common and
natural creatures, they are made sacred, and become Channels, and Instruments
of saving grace; and such a change Ambrose meant; for comparing these miracles
of the Prophets, wherein God changed the nature of things, with the change that
is wrought in the Sacrament, he says, Non minus est novas rebu^ dare, quam
mutare natural. Ambr loco citat.
that it is no less to add some new things, unto things, than to change the
nature of things, averring plainly thereby that the bread had received some new
thing, without loosing the nature of bread; and such a change is not strange,
for thus a piece of wax becoming the Kings Seal changes it is nature without
Transubstantiation.

Besides, the Fathers use the like Tenor of speech of the Sacrament of
Baptism, and yet do not hence infer any Transubstantiation: they say, Non
agnosco usum naturae, ubi est excellentia gratiae. Ambros de ijs qui mist.
(...) cap. 9.

Quid v^listi? [^q^as ^ti que] sed non solas. Id. ibid. cap. 3.


the word of Christ is most efficacious to alter the property of natural
water, and to give regenerating force and virtue to it. Saint Ambrose says,
that in Baptism man is changed, and made a new creature. Learn (says he)
Post^aquam consecratus es, (...) creatura esse coepisti. Serm^ Christi
^reaturam omnem muta^e consueverit, and mutat quando vult instituta nature.
Idem de Sacram lib. 4. c^p. 4.
how the word of Christ is accustomed to change every creature, and when he
will he alters the course of nature.

Saint Cyril says, Spirit^s Sanct^ operatione (...). ^y^il. Alexandr. (...)
Joan li. ^ cap. 4^. ^om. 1. Ge^rg. Tra^ (...).
the waters are changed into a divine nature. And Gregory Nazianzene says,
(...). Greg. N^zi^n (...) page 643 tom. 1 Paris. 1609.
that by Baptism we put on Christ, by Baptism we are changed or transmuted
into Christ. Now from hence we cannot infe^re that either the water of
Baptism, or regenerate persons are changed by Transubstantiation; the change
is not corporal in either of the Sacraments, but mystical in use and
signification.

In the Church (says (...). Macar. Egypt. Homil. 27
Macarius, Scholar to Saint Anthony) bread and wine is offered; the type of
his flesh and blood; and they which are partakers of the visible bread, do
Spiritually eat the flesh of the Lord. Now according to this Father, bread and
wine are taken, bread and wine are offered; and these be the types or tokens of
the body and blood: and that they be so called after Consecration, is likewise
acknowledged by Bellarmine. Bellar. de Euchar. li. 2. c. 15. Sed haec.


And we may farther observe that the words of Macarius are so clear for the
spiritual, and not corporal receiving; as that some were faigne to set a
Marginall gloss Offerendum esse in Ecclesi^ panem and vinum exemplar exhibens
carnem ipsius and sanguinem^ sumentesque de pane visibili
upon Macarius his text. spiritaliter carnem domini edere. Macar. homil. 27. in

Of Image Worship.
The Council of Elliberis in Granado in Spain, spiritaliter, id est, non
visibili modo, and eo quo editur alia caro^ sed spiritali and indivisibili. in
margin.
decreed Placuit, pic^uras in ecclesia esse non debere; ne quod colitur aut
adoratur in parietibus depingatur. Council. Eliber. cap. 36.
That no Pictures should or ought to be in the Church, lest that which is
worshipped or adored, should be painted on walls. Now it will not serve to say,
that the Council only forbad the painting of Images on Church-walls, where in
time of persecution, or otherwise, they might be defaced; as if they might be
set or hung in tables; for the Councels decree runs generally, saying, It is
our mind that Pictures ought not to be in the Church. Now if it forbad the very
being of them in Churches, then surely it utterly condemned their adoration.

Melchior Canus charge this ancient Council with impiety, Illa [Lex] impie a
Concilio Elibertino lata est de tollendis Imaginibus. Melch. Canus loc. theol
l. 5. c 4.
for making such a decree de tollendis Imaginibus. Saint Ambrose says, Non
vult se Deus in lapidibus coli. Ambr. in ep. 31. ad Valent. Imp. lib. 5. tom. 3.
God would not have himself worshipped in stones: Quae Ecclesia i^anes Ideas,
and vanas nescit simulachrorum figuras, sed veram novit Trinitatia substantiam.
Id. de fug^ saeculi. cap. 5. tom. 1.
the Church knows no vain Idaea's, and diverse figures of Images, but knows
the true substance of the Trinity. The fact of Epiphanius (which himself
records Epiphan. edit. Lat. in fine operum.
in his Epistle to John Bishop of Jerusalem, translated by Saint Epist.
Epiphanij ad Joan. Hierosol. in tom. secundo oper. Hieronymi.
Hierome out of Greek into Latin) is very famous in this case, namely, how
himself found a Picture in the Church of the village of Anablatha, which
(though it were out of his own Diocese) yet in an ho^y zeal he tore it, and
wrote to the Bishop of the place, beseeching him that no such Pictures might
be hanged up, as being contrary to Religion.

The words of Epiphanius are these: Inveni ibi velum pen^^n^ in sori^^s ejus^^m
eccl^si^ tinctum atque depi^tan^. and habens imaginem quasi Christi vel Sancti
cujusd^m, non enim satis memini, cu^as imago suerit; cum erge hoc vidissem, in
Ecclesia Christi contra out^rit^^e^ Scripturarum hominis pend^^e Im^ginem,
sci^^illud -- Epiphan. quo ^up^a.
I found there a veil hanging at the door of the Church dyed and painted, and
having the Image as it were of Christ or some Saint; for I do not well
remember whose Image it was: when therefore I saw this, that contrary to the
authority of the Scriptures, the Image of a man was hanged up in the Church of
Christ, I cut it, and gave counsel to the keepers of the place, that they
should rather wrap and bury some poor dead man in it: and afterward he
entreats the Bishop of Jerusalem (under whose government this Church was)
to give charge hereafter, Dein^^ps p^aecip^re in Eccl^si^ C^risti is^i^
ismo^ivel^ quae contra R^ligionem nostram veniu^t non appendi. Id. Ibid.
that such vayles as those which are repugnant to our Religion, should not be
hanged up in the Church of Christ.

I know indeed, that Jesuit Fisher would shuffle off this evidence, by saying,
that it was the picture of some profane Pagan; b^t Epiphanius himself says,
it had imaginem quasi Christi, vel Sancti cujusdam, the image as it were of
Christ, or of some Saint: surely therefore the Image went for Christ's, or for
some noted Saints, neither does he find fault with the irresemblance, but with
the Image, as such. Baronius says, ^^ono^ astarum poti^^ ^^gmentum quam
Epip^anij ge^^a^um scriptum Baron. A^^^l. tom. 4. ad ann. 392 nu. 59.
they are rather the forged words of some Image-breakers, than of Epiphanius:
Bellarmine would disproove them by sundry conjectures, which Master Rivet An^.
(...) Criti^i Sacri. lib. 3. cap. 29.
rejects, and defe^d^ the foresaid Epistle of Epiphanius, clearing it from all
the Cardinal's cavills: and surely if we observe Epiphanius his practice about
the foresaid Image, and his Doctrine of Mariam nemo adoret, we may well think
these two had both one Father.

PA.
The Idolatry forbidden in Scripture, and disliked by the Fathers, is such as
was used by Jews and Pagans; and this we Christians practice not.

PRO.
Indeed the Apostle, when he disswadeth Christians from Idolatry, propounds
the Jews fall, saying, Neither be ye Idolaters, as some of them were [1 Cor.
10. 7, 8.] The like also he adds touching another sin, Neither let us
commit fornication, as some of them did: as well then might one plead that
Jewish or Heathenish fornication were only reprehended, as Jewish or
Heathenish Idolatry, it being a foul sin, whether it be committed by Jew,
Pagan, or Christian, and more heinous in the Christian, who professes Christ,
to practice that which Gods word condemns in the Jews and Pagans for
Idolatry.

PA.
The Heathen held the Images themselves to be Gods, which is far from our
thought.

PRO.
Admit some of the simpler sort of the Heathen did so, what shall we say of
the Jewish Idolaters who erected the Golden calfe in the wilderness? can we
think that they were all so senseless, as to imagine that the calfe, which
they knew was not at all in rerum natura, and had no being at that time, when
they came out of Egypt, should yet be that God which brought them out of
Egypt. [ Exodus 32.4.] And for the Heathen people, though they (happily) thought
some divine Majesty and power was seated in the Images; yet they were scarcely
so rude as to think the Images which they adored, to be very God; for thus we
find them usually to answer in the writings of the Fathers: Deo^ inquitis per
simul achia veneramur. Arnob. contra Gent. lib. 6. sect. 10.
We worship the Gods by the Images; and, Nec Simulachru^ nec Daemonium colo,
sed per ^ffigiem corporalem ejus rei signum intu^^r, quam colere debeo. August.
in Psalm. 113. concion^ secunda.
I neither worship the Image, nor a Spirit in it, but by the bodily
portraiture, I do behold the sign of that thing which I ought to worship.

PAP.
Though the Heathen did not account the Image it self to be God; yet were
those Images set up to represent either things that had no being, or Devils, or
false-Gods, and in that respect were Idols; whereas we erect Images only to
the honor of the true God, and of his servants the Saints and Angels.

PRO.
Suppose that many of the Idolatrous Jews and Heathens Images were such as you
say they were, yet they were not all of them such: howsoever, Idolatry is
committed by yielding adoration to an Image of the true God himself, as
appears by the first Chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, where the Apostle
having said, that God showed unto them that which might be known of him; and
that the Invisible things of him, that is, his eternal power and Godhead, was
manifested unto them by the creation of the World, and the contemplation of the
creatures; he adds presently, that God was sorely displeased with them, and
therefore gave them up unto vile affections, because, They changed the Glory of
that incorruptible God, into an Image made like unto corruptible men, and to
birds, and foure-footed beasts, and creeping things: whereby it is evident,
that the Idolatry condemned in the wisest Heathen, was the adoring of the
invisible God, whom they acknowledged to be the Creator of all things, in
visible Images fashioned to the similitude of men and beast, as the admirably
learned, Bishop Usher has observed Doctor Vshers Sermon the 18. of Febr. ann.
1620.
in his Sermon preached before the Commons House of Parliament in Saint
Margarets Church at Westminster.

Of Prayer to Saints.
There wanted not some, who even in the Apostles days under the pretense of
Colloss. 2.18.
Humility, labored to bring into the Church the worshipping of Angels, which
carried with it ^oid.. verse. 23.
a show of Wisdom (as Saint Paul speaks of it;) not much unlike that of the
Papists, who teach their simple people, upon pretense of Humility, and their
own unworthiness, to prepare the way to the Son, by the servants, the
Saints and Angels; this they counseled (says Ill^ ergo hoc consul^bant utique
humilita^e utentes, di^entes universorum De^m, nec cerni nec ad cum perveniri
poss^; and opo^tere p^r Angelos divinam sibi benevolentia^ concili. re.
Theodoret in Coloss. cap. 2. to. 2. Gentiano Herveto interpret.
Theodoret) should be done, using humility, and saying, that the God of all was
invisible and inaccessible; and that it was fit men should get Gods favor by
the means of Angels. And the same Theodoret says Oratoria sancti Michaeli^.
Theod quo supra.
that they had (...), Oratories, or Chapels of Saint Michael. Now the Council
of Laodicea, to meet with this error, solemnly decreed; (...). Council.
Laodice^ can. 35 In edit. T^liana^ p. 841.
that Christians ought not to forsake the Church of God, and go and invocate
Angels, and pronounced an Anathema against any that should be found to do so,
because (say they) He has forsaken our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
and given himself to Idolatry. And Theodoret mentions the Canon of this
Council, and declares the meaning of it in these words: Hanc e^iam l^gem
sequens, Laodicena Synodus, and volens veteri illi morbo mederi, Lege cavit ne
precarentur A^gelos, and ne reli^qu^r^nt Dominum nostrum Iesum Christ^^. Theod.
in 3. cap. ad Col.
Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus,
giving thanks to God, and the Father by him. --

The Synod of Laodicea also following this Rule, and desiring to heal that old
disease, made a Law, that they should not pray, unto Angels, nor forsake our
Lord Jesus Christ: now there is the same reason of Saints, that there is of the
Angels.

PA.
Jesuit Fisher in his Rejoinder to Doctor Whites Reply, the second and third
point, says, The Council and Theodoret are thus to be understood, that Angels
are not to be honored as Gods.

PRO.
How appears it that Christians were so rude in those Ages, as to imagine
that Angels were Gods? or that sacrifices after the Pagan manner, were due to
them? It appears by Theodoret, that those whom he condemns did not think
the Angels to be Gods, but that they served them as ministering Spirits, whose
service God had used for the publishing of the Dicentes, ^uisse ^ege^ p^r eos
dat^m, id est, per Angelos Theod. in 2. c^p. Coloss.
Law.

PA.
Bellarmine says; Conciliu^ non damn^r qu^mlibe^ v^n^r^tionem Angelorum, sed
eam quae Deo prop^^^ es^. B^llar. de sanct. Beat lib. 1. c. 20. Hie^on^m^.
The Council forbad all worship of Angels, called Latreia, as being proper unto
God: but Binnius likes Mihi magis pl^cet ^xpositio Baronij, q^ia it hoc Canone
(...) ac religiosam veneratione^ (...) Deorum, eo^u^ nimirum quos Gentiles
Idololat^ae venerab^ntur, Christ^^nis interdicta^ es^e. B^^. in Synod Laodic p.
294. ^ol. 2^.
Baronius exposition better, who says, The Council only forbad the religious
worship of false and heathe^^sh Gods.

PRO.
Bellarmine does wrong in restraining the Councels speech to a special kind of
worship: for Theodoret says generally, that the Council forbad the worship of
Angels. Neither did the Council mean thereby to forbid the religious worship
of false and heathenish Gods; for Theodoret mentions the Oratories of Saint
Michael, and of such Angels as were supposed to give the Law, and therefore
were not ill Angels.

Baronius perceiving that the place in Theodoret touches the Papists to the
quick, tells us plainly, Ex his vide^s (quod necessario dicendum est)
Th^oderetum haud satis feliciter (e^us pace sit dictum) assecutum esse Paul^
verborum sensum. Baron Annal. tom. 1. ann. ^0. sect. 20.
That Theodoret, by his leave, did not well understand the meaning of Paul's
words: and that those Oratories of Saint Michael were anciently erected by
Catholics; as if Baronius a man of yesterday, at Rome could tell better what
was long since done in Asia, than Theodoret a Greek Father, and an ancient
Father and Bishop, living above twelve hundred years ago, not far from
those parts, where these things were done.

Others, to avoid the force of the canon, have corrupted the Council, making
this reading; Non oportet ad angulos cong^egationes ^acere. ^aranza in summa
Concilior.
That men should not leave the Church, to pray in angles or corners; turning
Angelos into Angulos, Angels into Angles or corners; but Veritas non quaerit
angulos, the truth will admit none of these corners; neither has the word
(...) any affinity at all with corners. To proceed, the Fathers of this age
affirm, that religious prayer is a proper worship belonging to the sacred
Trinity; and by this argument [ Romans 10.14^] conclude against the Arrians and
Macedonians, that Christ Jesus and the Holy Ghost are truly God, because
Christians believe in them, pray unto them, and they accept their petitions.

Athanasius says; (...). Athanas. orat. 4. contr. Arri^n.
No man would ^ver pray to receive any thing from the Father, and from the
Angels, or from any of the other creatures. Gregory Nyssen says: (...). Greg.
Nyssen. cont. Eunom. tom^ 2. orat. 4. page 146.
We are taught to worship and adore, that nature only which is uncreated;

and accordingly Antonius in his Melissa has set down the foresaid sentence;
but the Spanish Inquisitors have commanded Deleatur dicti^, ^^lum modo. Ind.
(...). p^^ Quirog. Madr. ann. 158^
that the word Only should be blotted out of his writings: Now the word
Only, is the only principal word, whereupon the whole sentence depends.

In like sort, where Athanasius says, that (...). A^^an. to. 1. orat. 3.
contr. Arrianos.
God only is to be worshipped, that the Creature is not to adore the
creature, that neither men, nor Angels are to be worshipped. The popish Index
(as is already observed in the Preface to this Treatise) has razed Ex
Athanasij Indi^^ d^lean^ur. Adorari soliu^ Dei est, Creatura creaturam non
adorat. Ind ^xpurg. Madr. 1612. E^ per Tu^re^^n. Genev^. 1619.
these sayings out of his Index, or table, which yet remain in the text.

Epiphanius tells us of some superstitious women that were wont to offer up a
Cake to the blessed Virgin, and this vanity he calls (...). Epiphan. in
hae^esi Collyrid. haer 79 p 1065.
the woman's Heresy, because that sex mostly used it, but he reproves them
saying; (...). Id. Ibid page 10^4.1065
Let Mary be in honor, but let the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost
be worshipped, let no man worship or adore Mary; and indeed he bends all his
force against that point of adoring; no less then in six several places,
saying; [ Mariam nemo adoret.] Now Adoration being condemned, it can not be
conceived, that adoring her, and offering to her, they prayed not also to her,
and required of her, somewhat again. All which Epiphanius reprooves.

Saint Ambrose speaking of our Advocate, or Master of Requests, saying; Q^id
enim t^m (...) C^r^stum quam Advocatum apud D^^n^ Pat^em ad^^are popul^rum?

What is so proper to Christ, as to stand by God the Father for an Advocate of

and elsewhere he says, Tu solus Domine invocandus es, thou Lord only art to
be invocated: and whereas there were some that about this time sued unto
Saints and Angels, saying; Am^ros. tom. 5. in Rom cap. 1.
We have recourse to Angels and Saints with devotion and humility, that by
their Interc^ssion God may be more favorable unto us. Saint Ambrose (or who
ev^r else was author of those Commentaries upon Saint Paul's Epistles that are
framed among his works) has well m^t with them, calling it, So e^t tam^^

ad Deum^ si^ut per ^^mites per^e^atural Rege^ Id ibid.
A miserable excuse, in that they think to go to God by these, as men go to
the King by an Of^icer: Go to (says he) Age, nu^qui^ t^m demens est aliqui^,
aut salutis suae imm^m^r, ut honorisicentiam Regis vindicet C^mit^ -- nam and
ideo ad Regem per Tribunos aut Comites itur, quia homo u^ique est Rex, and

latet, omnium enim me^ita no^it) promerend^m suffragatore non opus est, sed
mente devot^. ubicunque talis locutus suerit ei, respondebit illi. Id. ibid
is any man so mad, or so unmindfull of his salvation, as to give the Kings
honor to an Officer? for therefore do men go to the King by Tribunes or
Officers, because the King is but a man, and knows not to whom to commit the
state of the Common wealth: but to procure the favor of God, from whom nothing
is hid (for he k^oweth the works of all men) we need no spokesman but a devout
mind: for wheresoever such a one shall speak unto him, he will answer him.
This testimony is so full, that it makes me remember what I have seen
written with his own hand, in Saint Ambrose his Margent by Archbishop Hutton,
(one that by Campians testimony Matheus Huttonus, ^ui v^r nominatus in paucis.
ve^sare patr^s dicitur. Campian. Rat. 5.
was well verst in the Fathers) namely, hoc testimonium jugulat pontificios,
this evidence choakes the Papists.

Reply.
The place alleged is none of Saint Ambroses; neither was he the Author of
those Commentaries on Saint Paul's Epistles Commentaria in Epistolas S. Paull a

ann. 374.

Answer.
We are not so straightened, that we need make any great reckoning whether
they be his or no; for we have alleged other places of Saint Ambrose out of
his works, of which there is no question. And yet they are usually cited under
Saint Ambrose his name: Bellarmine in five several places alleges them,
R^bertus Cocus in censu^a Scripto^um Vet. p. 133.
and in particular this Commentary on the Romans; and the Rhemists they vouch
them too: and when any thing in these Commentaries seem to make for them, then
they cry them up and say, Bea^us Ambrosi^s in cap 3. prime ad ^imoth. inqui^;
D^mus ^ius Ec^l^si^ di^itur, cujus ^odi^ Rector e^t Damasus. Bellarm de R^m.

Beatus Ambrosius; and when they would thence prove the Pope to be the ruler
of the whole Church, then the style runs Blessed S^int Ambrose in his
Commentaries says thus, and thus: and then Saint Ambrose is the Author of
them.

Reply.
Where Saint Ambrose says, Thou Lord only art to be invocated, it is (says
Cardinal Perron) very true, of Invocation absolute, sovereign, and final.

Answer.
This is as much as we desire, says our acute and learned Bishop of
Winchester Doctor B. And^ews Answer to Cardinal Perrons Reply. Page 44.45.
Andrews; for as for their relative and subalterne Invocation, we know them
not; and it is likely the Fathers knew not of any such oblique means to help
men in their devotions: for if they had, so many, so diverse Fathers, in so
many Treatises, specially where they wrote de Oratione, of Prayer, must
somewhere have mentioned them.

Reply.
Saint Ambrose says, Ad Deum suffragatore non opus est; now suffragari is to
give ones voice. God indeed needs not any (be they Elements, Stars, Angels, or
Saints they meant) to interpose between God and men, pour l' enformer, to
inform him: but there needs some to interpose between God and men, pour les
favoriser, to procure favor on our behalf.

Rejoinder.
Although the word in Heathen Authors be used in that sense, yet in the
Churches style, Suffrages are taken for Prayers; and in their Portuises
language I find that Suffrages Suffragia de S. Antonio. Ora pro nobis Bea^^
Pa^er Antoni. Hor^ B^ M^r.
are used for Ora pro nobis: now to the point. God, as he needs not any
Referendarie to give him intelligence, nor Counsailer to give him advice; so
neither needs be any Solliciter to incline him to hear the Prayers of a
devour spirit, but the great Mediator of all, which is Christ our Savior,
says our learned Winchester. Id Ibid. page 43.

The Fathers are thus to be understood, that Angels are not to be honored as
Gods, nor by Sacrifices in the heathenish manner.

PRO.
This answer is defective; for the Fathers not only when they answer Heathens,
but when they instruct Christians, deliver the like speeches; as appears by
Chrysostom in the fifth Age. Besides, how does it appear that Christians were
so rude in those Ages, as to imagine that Angels were Gods? or that Sacrifices
after the Pagan manner, were due to them?

By this Reply of Bellarmines, the Reader (says the Right reverend and learned
Lord Primate Doctor An answer to a Ch^llenge m^de by a Jesuit in Ireland. S.

Usher) may discern the just hand of God, confounding the man's wits, that
would thus abuse his learning to the upholding of Idolatry; for had he been
his own man, he could not possibly have failed so fowly, as to r^ckon the
Angels and the Saints, and the very mother of God her self (of whom these
Fathers, specially Epiphanius, do expressly speak) in the number of those
wicked persons, whom the Gentiles did take for their Gods.

PA.
We give Latria, or worship to God; and Dulia, or service to the Saints.

PRO.
You give a higher worship to God, and a lesser to his Saints; like that wanton
Roman Dame, who thought to excuse her folly, by saying, Ioannes Rainaldus de
Idololatria. Rom Eccl. lib. 1. cap. 1. number 13. ex Cicerone in oratione pro
Caelio.
she companied with Metellus as with a Husband, and with Clodius as with a
Brother, whereas all was due to her husband only; so do these spiritual
wantons part stakes in Gods worship, whereas all religious worship is due to
God alone.

Neither will this distinction salve the sore; for the Scripture uses these
terms without any such difference: Hebrai^um verbum, Ghabad, quod (...)
redditur apud Spetuaginta, Deuteronomy. 6.13. in loco quem Christus ^itat, Mat^. 4.10
(...): reddite (...). 1 Samuel 4. vbi scriptum est in laud^m Israelitarum, (...).
for the word Latria, which you appropriate to Gods service, is applied to men,
as in this place: you shall do no servile work, the word used is Latria, [
L^vit. 23.7.] the word is (...): so contrariwise, the word Dulia, is taken in
Scripture for the proper service of God, as in this place, serving the Lord
with all Humility, the word there used is Dulia; so that this distinction is
idle, since that Religious worship and service is all one.

PA.
We do not invocate the Saints by Faith, as Authors of the benefits we crave.

PRO.
Your They pray dir^ctly, absolutely, and fin^lly to Sain^s, to give such and
such gif^s and graces themselves; and diverse instances are given in this kind
by Bishop Andrews in his Answer to Card Pe^r^n's Reply. P^g 58.59. etc.
practice shows the contrary, for you pray to the Virgin Mary in these
terms: O^fic. B. Mar. pij v. jussu edit. and the office of the Blessed Virgin
according to the ^ef^rmed Latin a^ S. Omers. 1621.
Maria matter gratiae,

means he could not win to his will, he went about to entice and prevail
with by Magical spells and conjurations; which the Damsel perceiving,
besought the Virgin Mary to succor her, being a distressed virgin.

PRO.
This goes under his name, but (happily) is none of his; for it is not likely
that Nazianzene (one of so great learning, judgment, and memory) could (as
Billius sp^akes Tam foedo errore prolapsum esse Billius in not. ad locum.
) be so grossly mistaken, to ascribe that unto Saint Cyprian Bishop of
Carthage in Afric, that (if it were at all) was done by one Cyprian the
Deacon of Antioch in Asia. But yet say it were Nazianzen's own report, it
being but a private act, out of the devout affection in a Maid, it cannot be
drawn to a rule of Faith; neither is it proposed as an example to be
followed, but only by way of bare narration what she did: the relater passes
not his own censure upon it; yea, but he taxes it not; though he did not,
yet others, and (by name) Epiphanius in the same age taxed such of that sex,
as offered Cakes, and the like presents, and oblations to the blessed Virgin.

Lastly, the story says, that despayring of all other remedies (...), she
flies to God, and then assumeth for her Patron and Protector Christ Jesus her
Spouse; and after this: (...), she besought the Virgin Mary to succor her,
being a distressed virgin. First, she flies to God; secondly, she makes
Christ her Patron; thirdly, she requesteth the Virgin Mary (in zeal rather
than upon knowledge.) And although Nazianzen (speaking only by hearesay)
reports that she supplicated (not by any Collect, or set form of devotion,
but by a short ejaculation) to the Virgin Mary; yet this was done by her in the
last place, and after she had first sought to God and Christ: Whereas, in
their Romish devotions, our Lady has their orizons first addressed to her; and
our Lord has them but as it were at second hand, the reve^sion of them.

Gregory Nyssen calls to Theodore the Martyr, saying, F^^trum tuoru^ Martyrum
^oge chorum, and (...) omnibus una depre^are. Greg Nyssen. ^^at. in S. Theodor.
gather together the troops of thy brother Martyrs, and thou with them
jointly, beseech God to stay the invasion of the Barbarous Goths.

PRO.
Nyssen spoke this in a Panegyricall oration, as an Orator, not as a Divine,
in a popular sermon of Commemoration, not in doctrinall determination.

In like sort Bellarmine objects Nazianzen in his orations calling unto
Cyprian, Basil, and Athanasius, with a tu autem e supernis nos respice,
Nazianzen. in orat. in Atha^as.
do thou favorably look upon us from an high; Whereas, this is no direct
invocation, but rather a vote, wish and desire that Basil and Athanasius might
do so and so; for it is not respice nos, but o si; or Vtinam nos respicias,
and so he speaks of Basil, and now Basil is in the heavens offering as I
think sacrifices for us, and praying for the people: he comes with an (...),
as I take it, as I am persuaded; it was but his opinion, and conjecture; being
indeed nothing but a Rhetoric^ll flourish.

The like answer may serve to that of Hierome, who concluding his Funeral
Oration upon Paula, desires her in heaven, to assist him with her prayers;
Vale o Paula, and cult^ris tu^ vl^imam ^ene^tutem orati^nibus ^uva. Hieron. in
Epitaph. Paulae.
the ^peech h^e uses is no more but a Rhetorical Apostrophe or conversion to
her. Besides, it is but (...) a wish; and not (...), a direct prayer unto her.

In the like manner ^or proof of prayer to Saints Bellarmine alleges two
Poets, Paulinus and Prudentius; now we answer him in his own words, Nihil
aliud di^o, nisi more ^^etico ^usiss P^udentium. Bellar lib 2. de Pu^gat. cap.
18.. Ad.
who when Prudenti^s was alleged against him in the point of Purgatory, he
puts it off, saying, Prudentius played the Poet, so say we, that they spoke it
in a poetical vain, as others in a strain of Rhetorike: Now in Poetry, men
take more liberty; besides, their words serve them not at will, as they do in
prose: but they must often take such to make up their verse, as were otherwise
inconvenient to be used; moreover, the heat of their invention carries them
further oftentimes, then in a temperate speech, they would be carried.

Saint Ambrose exhorts widows to pray to the Angels and Martyrs, Obsecrandi
sunt Angeli, Martyrs, speculatores vitae, actuumque nostrorum. Ambros. lib. de
Viluis.
whom he calls beholders of our lives and actions.

PRO.
Saint Ambrose was chosen from a secular Judge, to be Bishop of Millaine, and
was feign to be christened before he could be consecrated. Now this book de
Viduis, of widows was written about the beginning of his christianity and
divinity both: Bishop Andrews Answer to Ca^dinall Perron's R^ply, prooves this
out of Baronius in the l^^e o^ Saint Ambrose.
and therefore it is not strange, if in his beginning and novice ship he said
some things, for which he afterward^ corrected himself; of this sort is that
which he has in the book alleged, which shows he was a novice in
divinity, when he wrote that book de Viduis, for there he doubts, whether
the Martyrs had any sins or n^; and then says, Qui proprio sanguine, etiam
si quae habuerunt, peccata laverunt. Amb^. de Vid. ^oco citato.
That the sins they had, they did themselves wash away with their own blood:
Whereas the holy Scripture gives us no other L^ver for our sins than the
blood of Jesus Christ, Who has loved us, and washed us from our sins in his
own blood Apocal. 1.5.
. And again, Apoc. 7.14. and 1 John 1. verse. 7.
The Saints have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb. Now the blood of
Martyrs is not the blood of Christ: and therefore that speech was neither so
safely, nor properly set down. Besides, the words rea^h not home, it is only
his opinion, that the Saints and Ang^ls are our Patrons, Videmur, Quorum
vide^ur n^bis quoddam corporis pignore patrocinium v^n^icare. Ambr. loc. citato^
We seem to have their pa^ronage, and yet it is but Patrocinium quoddam, a
certain kind of guardian ship.

But what Saint Ambrose's opinion was touching this point, no man can better
tell than himself, who elsewhere says Ad Deum autem promerendum, Suff^agatore
non opus est, sed mente devota. Ambros. in Romans cap. 1. Tom. 5.
That to procure Gods favor, we need no spokesman but a devout mind: and
again, Sed tamen tu solu^ Domine invocandu^ es. Ambr. de obitu Theodosij. tom.
3.
Thou only O Lord ought to be invocated and prayed unto.

Objection.
Saint Cyril of Jerusalem says, Facimus mentionem etiam little qui ante nos
obdormierunt, ut Deus Orationibus aliorum, suscipiat preces nostras. Cyril.
Catech. 5. mystag.
That we make mention of those that sleep in the Lord before us, that by
their Intercession God would receive our prayers. Thus he in his mystagogicall
Catechismes.

Answer.
The learned Andr. Rivet. Critici sacri. lib. 3. cap. 8. and Rob. Coci censura
Patrum page 118.
do think that Cyril of Jerusalem was not Author thereof, but one John
Bishop of Jerusalem, who lived about the year 767, a great advocate of
Images; and indeed it may seem so by some idle stuff we find in them, as
namely, where it is said, (...). Cyril Catech. 4.
That the wood of the Cross did increase and multiply in such sort, that the
earth was full thereof.

But, be it Cyrils of Jerusalem, it makes not for the Romists. All he says is
this in effect; he supposes that those holy ones with God, do continually
pray unto God, which prayers he desires God would mercifully hear, and grant
unto them, for the good of his servants here on earth.

Lastly, he says mentionem facimus; and so did the ancients in their
Commemorations, mention the Godly Saints deceased, and yet without any direct
invoking of them. And so Saint Austin says: Suo loco and ordine nominatur, sed
non invocantur. Aug. lib. 22. de civit. Dei cap. 10 tom. 5.
That the Martyrs were named at the Communion Table, but yet not invocated by
the Priest. Saint Austin flatly opposes invocantur, to nominantur; nominantur,
sed non invocantur, so that they might be nominated, and mentioned, (as Cyril
speaks) and yet not at all invocated.

Objection.
Saint Hilary says, Intercessione Angelor^^^ indiget infirmitas nostra. Hilar.
in Psalm. 129.
that by reason of our infirmity, we stand in need of the intercession of
Angels, and the like he has upon the 124 Psalm. Hilar. in Psalm. 124. Nec leve
praesidium in Angeli^, qui Ecclesiam quadam custodia circumsep^^unt.


Answer.
Hilary speaks only of Angelical intercession: not a word touching
invocation or intercession of Saints. And if any intercession be intended, it
is that in general for the whole Church.

In the other place upon the 124 Psalm, Hilary speaks neither of Saints
praying for us, nor of praying to them, but says: That the Church has no
small aid in the Apostles, Prophets, and Patriarchs, or rather in the Angels
which hedge and compass the Church round about with a certain guard, the aid
therefore he means, is the example and doctrine of Circuibat cum Sacerdotibus
and populo omnium orationum loca, ante Martyrum and Apostolorum thec^^ jacebat
cilicio prostratu^, and auxilia sibi ^ida Sanctorum intercessione poscebat.
Ruffin. lib. 2. hist cap. 33.
the Saints departed, and the ministry of the Angels.

Objection.
The Emperor Theodosius went in Procession with his Clergy and Laity,
Circuibat cum Sacerdotibus and populo omnium orationum loca, ante Martyrum and
Apostolorum thec^^ jacebat cilicio prostratu^, and auxilia sibi ^ida Sanctorum
intercessione poscebat. Ruffin. lib. 2. hist cap. 33.
to the Oratories and Chapels, and lying prostrate before the Shrines and
Monuments of the Apostles and Martyrs, he required aid to himself by the
faithful intercession of the Saints.

Answer.
The Emperor did not invocate any Saint, or Saints at all; only upon that
exigent of the rebellion of Eugenius and his accomplices, he repayres to the
Shrines and Chapels of the Apostles, Martyrs, and other holy Saints; there he
made his prayers unto God in Christ, not unto them, desiring God to aid him
against his enemies, and the rather upon the prayers and intercession of the
Saints on his behalf; now invocation follows not presently upon intercession.

credit it was of, is not related. But supposing the truth of the story,
Ruffinus has the very form of the Prayer which the Emperor made, Ruffinus

and there is no mention therein of invocating either Saint or Ang^l. Socrates
says, Dei ^^plo^avit (...) S^^rat. hist. lib 6^^ p. 4.
that the Emperor implored Gods assistance, and had his desire; Theodoret

I have consulted with the Original, and there indeed I find that the Emperor
being in Saint John Baptist's Church which Theodosius himself had built,
(...). Page 102. edi^. Rob. Stephani. In Lat. editione Ruffin. l 7 cap. 24.
He called to have Saint John Baptist's assistance in the battle; he did not
directly call upon S. John Baptist, but he called upon God, that he would
appoint the Baptist for to and him.

But be it that he called upon the Baptist indeed; yet this was done in the
second place, after he had first immediately called upon God himself.

Objection.
Athanasius in his Sermon upon the Annunciation of blessed Virgin, says to the
Virgin Mary, In^lina aurem tuam [Ma^ia] in pre^es nostras^ and ne ^blivi^caris

Deipara. se^ A^nunciat.
Incline thine cares to our prayers, and forget not thy people.

Answer.
Indeed this speaks home, but it is not the true Athan^sius, but some
counterfeits bearing his name; and this is confessed by the two Arch pillars of
Popery, Bellarmine and Baronius; for howsoever Bellarmine, to make up his
number, produce B^llar. lib. 1. de Sanct. B^at^t. cap. 19.
Athan^sius for proof of Saintly invocation; yet the same B^llarmine when he
is out of the heat of his controversies, and is not tied to maintain ^he
invocation of Saints, but treats of other matters; then, in his Catalogue of
Ecclesiastical wri^ers, he is of another judgment; and says Sermo de
sanctissima D^i^a^a, non vi^^tur esse S At^anasij, sed ^l^^ujus ^oste^ioris^
qui nost sextum Co^cilium fl^ruerit. Bell^^. de Scriptor Eccles. ad ann. 304.
in Athanasio.
that this Sermon of Athanasius of the Annunciation of the blessed Virgin,
seems not to be Athanasiusses, but some later write^s, who lived after the
six^h general Council.

Baronius also is of the same judgment: B^ron. tom 1. Annal. ad ann. Ch^isti.
48.
and indeed he that shall consider and w^i^h what the true Athanasius writes,
to wit, (...). Athanas. to. 1. orat. 3. contr. Arrian.
That God only is to be worshipped: that the creature is not to fall down and
worship or supplicate the creature: nor Sanctos non a crea^o postulare, ut
auxiliator s^^. At^anas. or t. 2 con. Arrian. pet. Nannio Interp.
to make the Saints (being but creatures, and no creators) special helpers and
opitulators: he (I say) that shall duly weigh these things, will easily
conceive when he reads this Sermon of the Annunciation, that either Athanasius
was not constant to his own doctrine (which is not to be imagined, or that
this Homily alleged is none of the true Athanasiusses, it is so far
different from his other doctrine.

Objection.
Bellarmine, for proof of Saintly invocation, B^llar. de Sanct Beatit. lib. 1.
cap. 19.
alleges a place out of Eusebius; the testimony speaks thus, as there it
stands reported out of the thirteenth Book, and seventh Chapter of his
Evangelicall Preparation: Verae pietatis milites, u^ Dei amicos honoran^es, ad
monument^ quoque illorum accedimus, vot^que ipsis sacimus, tanquam viris
sanctis. quoram intercessione ad Deum non parum juvari p^ofitemur. Eusebius. lib
13 praep^rat. E^angel. cap 7.
This we daily do: we honor those heavenly Soldiers, as Gods friends, we
approach unto their Monuments, and pray unto them, as unto Holy men, by whose
intercession we profess our selves to be much holp^n.

Answer.
Eusebius speaks not of particular invocation for particular

Secondly, Eusebiu^ does not enlarge his speech to all the Saints departed, but
unto Martyrs only, whom he Augustine Augustine. ^e cur^ pr^mortuis. ca^ 8.
teaches.

3. Thirdly, the place alleged is taken out of a corrupt translation made by
Trapezuntius, and afterward followed by Ad M^numenta quoque ^^lorum acce^^mus,
votaque ipsi^ sacim^^. Eusebius. de P^aep^rat. Evangel. lib. 13 c^p. 7. Eusebius.
ope^a Io. Dadraei, Parisij^. 1581.
Dadroeus a Doctor of Paris, who set forth Eusebius. Now Eusebius has no such
thing as is pretended; his words in his own language are these: (...). Eu^^b.
(...) 13. c^. 11. ex (...) ^^^phani. Lute^. 1544.
It is our custom, to come to the Tombs and Monuments [of the Martyrs] and to
make our prayers at, or before those Shrines, or Tombs, and to honor those
blessed souls. Pl^^saith they used (...), to present themse^ves at the Martyrs
Tombs, (...), and to make their prayers, (...) at those (...) those To^bes and
Monuments; he says not (...), to these Martyrs, as Bellarmine would have it.
It is onething to pray ad memorias Martyrum, before or near the Sepulchers of
^he Martyrs, as ancie^tly they were wont to do: and another thing to say (as
our adversari^s do) that these Praye^s were made unto the Martyrs themselves:
the truth is, they were made unto God to p^aise him for the assistance given
unto the Martyrs, and to crave of God

4. F^urthly, and lastly, Eusebius in the same treatise does fully expre^se
himself touching this matter, saying, (...). ^useb ^b^d. lib. 4 c^p. 10. page
88. and 89
We are taught to worship God only, and to honor those blessed Powers that
are about him, with such honor as is fit and agreeable to their ^state and
condition: and again, (...). Id. ibid l 4. c. 21. p. (...). in edit^ To. S^eph

To God only will we give the worship due un^o his name, and him only do we
religiously worship and adore.

Saint Ephraim the Syrian (...) 18. in (...) to. 3. p. 247.

God for us miserable sinners.

Answer.
The D. Fulke in his Annot. in Rhem. Test. upon 2 Peter 1 15. Et Rob Co^^ (...)
Scr^pt. Vet. p. 118.
learned take exceptions at this Ephraim, as being a counterfeit, lately
brought to light, and not set forth in his native language, but taught to
speak in the Roman tongue: ^ut be it that it is the true Saint Ephraem, yet
he says nothing directly for praying to Saints: for it is but an Apostrophe
in general, which infe^reth no co^^lusion a^ all, no^ is it directed to any
one peculiar Saint, b^t ^o the Saints i^ gene^all. Now it is con^essed that
they pray to God Pro nobis miseris peccatoribus; and this their b^other-like
affection, and Saint-like performance, is an ^speciall part of the Communion of
Saints.

Besides, Ephraem (take him as he comm^th to our hands) delivers that which
overthrowe^h Saintly Invocatio^; for he prays to God only, without
mentio^ing any Saint at all; Nec in me quidquam bont reperio, quod in conspectu
tuo memorari poss^t, nisi hoc solum, quod praeter te, aliam ignorem. S.
Ephraem. sermon. p^g 65 tom. 1.
yea he says expressly, That he knows no other save God, to whom he should
present his prayers; and yet more fully Idem ibid. page 269. edit. Vossian^e.
saying; Tibi soli redemptori supplico, To thee only my Savior and Redeemer I
make my prayer and supplication. And thus speaks Ephraem when once he is out
of his p^osopopeiaes, and Rhetorical compellations, his pa^egy^icks, and
commendatorie orations of the Saints.

Of Justification by Faith only.
Concerning Justification by Faith only, Saint Ambrose (or some of the same
standing with Ambrose) Author Commentarioru^ in Epistola^ Pauli, aeq^alis, si^e
dubio Ambrosij fuit. Bellar. lib. 4. de Iustif. cap. 8.
is clear and plentiful throughout his Commentaries on Saint Paul's Epistles.

Sol^ fide justi^icati sunt dono Dei. Id. in 3 ad Romans Et impius per solam
fidem justificatur apud Deum. Id in 4. Romans
They are justified by faith alone, by the gift of God; yea, he farther says,
Nullum opus dici^ legis sed solam f^d^m dand^m in caus^ (...) Id in c. 10
No work of the Law, but only faith is to be given in Christ's cause. Saint
Hilarie says, Fides enim sola justificat. Hilar Comment. in Math. canon^ 8.
That which the Law could not unloose, is remitted by Christ, for faith alone
justifies. Saint Basil says, (...). Basil Homil. 22. de Humilitate. to^ 1.
That it is true and perfect rejoicing in the Lord, when a man is not puffed up
with his own righteousness, but acknowledges his want thereof, yet r^joyceth
that he is justified by faith alone in Christ.

By this that has been said, it appears, that when we say, Faith only
justifies, we have not departed from the doctrine of the ancient Fathers in
this point of Justification.

Of Merit.
Concerning Merit, Saint Ambrose says, Nam ^^de mihi tan^um meriti, cui
indulgentia pro coron^ est Amb^os. in (...) virg. ^om. 1.
Whence should I have so great merit, seeing mercy is my crown? and again,
Q^^d p^ssums dignu^ praemis^ (...) Dei^ (...) d^cretorum in homines (...)
procedit. Amb^os. in P^^m. 11^. sermon 20 to^
What can we do worthy of the heavenly rewards? the s^ff^ring^ of this time
are u^worthy for the glory t^^t is to come: therefore the form of heav^nly
Decrees does proceed with men, not according to our me^its, but according to
Gods mercy.

Basil says, (...). Basi^. in Psalm. 114. (...). 1.
Everlasting rest is laid up for them that strive lawfully in this life; not to
be rendered according to the d^bt of works, but exhibited by the grace of the
bountiful God to them that trust in him.

Macarius the Egyptian Hermit, touching the gift which Christians shall
inherit, averreth; Si qu^^ ex quo creat^s est Ala^ ad con^umm^tion^m usque
mundi cer^^^^^ (...) Satan^m, and (...) e^^lictiones, (...) it perag^^et, (...)

That this a man may rightly say, that if any one from the time wherein Adam
was created unto the very end of the world did fight against Satan, and
undergo afflictions; he should do no great matter in respect of the glory
that he shall inherit; for he^ shall reign together with Christ world without

You produced Saint Cyril of Jerusalem, as if he should witness for you,
whereas he is ours; and your Mr. Cook tell^th us Censina S^r^p^o^um Peterum.
page 117.
that Bellarmine often alleges him on our behalf.

PRO.
The learned make question whether Cyril, or John B. of Jerusalem were the
Author of those Catechismes; and surely in some part thereof there be diverse
things unworthy of that ancient and learned Cyril, who is the more to be
beloved of the Orthodoxe, as he was greatly hated of the A^rians; yet even in
these Catechismes (take them as they come to our hands) Master Rivet, a
learned, and judicious Divine, finds many testimonies And^. Ri^et Crit. (...)
l. 3 cap 9. and 10.
that make for us, and against the Papists: For instance sake, Cyril in his
Catechism, having numbered all the books of the old Testament omitteth all
those that are controverted; and says, Cyril. Hierosol. Catech. 4.
Peruse the two and twenty books, but meddle not with the Apocrypha; meditate
diligently upon those Scriptures, which the Church does confidently read, and
use no other: He says, (...). Id. Catech. 4.
That the safety and preservation of faith consists not in the eloquence of
words, but in the proof of divine Scripture. The same Cyril says, Cyril
Catechesi Mystagogica 5. (...).
Receive the body of Christ with a hallow hand, saying Amen, and after the
partaking of the body of Christ, come also to the cup of the Lord. The same
Cyril says, (...). Cyril. Catech. Mystag. 4.
that the words [my Body] were Spoken of the bread. Christ thus avoucheth and
says of the Bread, this is my Body. He resembles the consecrated oil
wherewith their foreheads were anointed, to the consecrated bread in the
Eucharist. Look ( says he, (...). Idem. Catech. Mystag. 3.
Thou do not think it to be only bare and simple oil, for even as the
consecrated bread after prayer and invocation is no more common bread, but
Christ's body; so the holy oil is no more bare and simple oil, or common, but
Charisma the gift of Grace: whence ( as Master Rivet says) Andr. Rivet.
Critici sacri. lib. 3. cap. 10.
we may thus argue as is the change in the oil, such there is in the
Eucharist; but in the oil there is no change in substance, but use, and
sanctification by grace; and therefore there is no substantial change or
conversion in the Elements of bread and wine when they become the body and
blood of Christ.

Objection.
Saint Cyril says, Cyril. Catech. Mystag. cap. 4.
Know you for a surety, that the bread which is seen of us is not bread,
though the taste find it to be bread, but the body of Christ: insomuch as
Bellarmine upon this testimony says, Bellar. lib. 2. de Euchar. cap. 13..
Quarto.
Quid clarius dici potest? What can be said more plainly?

Answer.
Cyril says; The bread which is seen of us is not bread, and the same Cyril
says (...). Cyril Catech. 3.
of the Water in Baptism, it is not simple water, let the one satisfy the
other. Cyril says of the bread, as he does of the oil; that it is no bare,
simple, or common oil; but Charisma, the type, and symboll of a spiritual
gift; and so he meant of the bread, the Consecrated bread; that it is no
ordinary or common bread, but of different use and serv^ce, and yet the^ein not
any change of substance at all. Neither does Cyril say as Bellarmine corrup^ly
tra^slateth it, or at le^st m^kes use of a corrupt tr^nslation, Sub (...) datur
(...) Eu^h^r. (...). 3 (...)
That the body of Christ is given Sub sp^cie pan^s, Under the form of bread;
but (as it ^s in the Greek) (...). Cy^^l. (...). 4
Under the type of bread; even as he says afterward, (...). Id (...). 5.
Think not that you taste bread, but the Antitype of Christ's body; so that he
calls the cons^crated bread and wine, ^ypes, and Antitypes, that is signs of
the body and bloo^ of Christ. Now where^s Cyril would not have us judge of th^s
Sacrament by our taste or sense; it i^ true; that as the Bread and Wine are
^ound and while, and sweet in taste, our bodily senses may indeed perceive
them; but as they are types, and A^titypes, that is, sign^s Of the body and
blood ^f Christ, so ^hey a^e spi^itually to be discern^d, with our
understanding only; as the Reverend and learned D^ctor Morton, Lo. Bishop of
Coventry and Lichfi^ld, and now Lord Bishop of Dur^sme, has observed B. Mo^ton
(...). Book 3. ^h^p. 4 (...) 4.
. Lastly the same Cyril says, ^
That we have r^pentance, and remission of sins, confined only to the term
of th^s pr^s^nt life: More might be alleged out of the same ^y^il, but these
may su^fice to show what he in his Ca^echismes taught his scholars, touching
the Scriptur^s s^ffic^encie, and Ca^on, Communion in both kinds, the Eucha^ist
and Purgatory.

Before I clo^e up this Centurie, I must needs speak of Constantin^ the Great,

In ^his age flourished the honor of our nation, that Christian Prince

Britains by bi^th^ Roy^ll by descent, Saints by esti^ation, and true

instances following.

He held the Scriptures sufficient for deciding matte^s of Faith, and
accordingly prescribed this rule to the Nicene Council, saying, (...).
^heodor. E^cl^s Hist li. 1. cap. 7.
Because the Apostles Books do plainly instruct us in divine matters;
therefore we ought to make our Determinations upon Questions, from words which
are so divinely inspired: he says not that the Scriptures plainly teach us
what to think of the nature and substance of God (as Bellarmine would Bellar
lib. 4. de verbo Dei cap. 11.
wrest it) but also of the holy Law, and things concerning Religion; for so do
the words sound in the original (...). ^h^od. quo supra.

the greater part of the Council obeyed the voice of Constantine. Constantine
held it not the Pop^s peculiar to summon general Coun^^lls; for he called the
Council of Nice himself (...). Theod. lib. 1. cap 7.

agreement in the Faith.

Prescribed to the Bishops such things as belonged to the good of Gods Church;

the Arrians) (...). Theod. l. 1. cap. 1^.
His sauciness shall be^ instantly curbed by the Emperors ex^cution, who is

never worshipped an Image, never served Saint nor Shrine, never knew the Mass,
Transubstantiation, nor the half Communion: he prayed not for his Fathers
soul at the performance of his Funerals, (...) de vi^a C^nstan lib. 1 ^ap. 16.
used no Requiems nor Diriges at his Exequies; he wished not any prayers to be
made after his death for his own soul; but having received Baptism newly
before his death, professed a steadfast hope that needed no such after-prayers,
saying; (...). Id ibid. l. 4. c. 63.
Now I know indeed that I am a blessed man, that God has accounted me worthy
of immortal life, and that I am now made partaker of the light of God. And
when they that stood about him wished him longer life, he answe^ed, (...). Id.
I^id. gr^^dit Rob. S^ep^^ni Lutetiae an. 1544.
That he had now attained the true life, and that none but himself did
understand of what happiness he was made partaker, and that he therefore
hastened his going to his God. Thus Constantine dyed outright a Protestan^, he
craved no after-prayers for his soul, he dreaded no Purgatory, but dyed in
full assurance of going immediately to his God. Was this Prince now a Trent
papist?

Now to proceed; the first General Council in Christianity, after the Synod
of the Apostles, was that famous first Council of Nice, consisti^g of 318.
Bishops, the greatest lights that the Christian world then had; it was called
about 325 years after Christ, against Arrius, that denied Christ to be very
God; from this Council we had o^r Nicen Creed, it was summoned not by the
th^n Bishop of Rome, but by the Emperor Constantine, Gathering them together
out of diverse Cities and Provinces, as themselves have l^f^ ^ccorded ^
: We produce the sixth Canon of this Council, against the Popes monarchical
Jurisdiction; the ^enour thereof is this: (...). Con^il. Ni^^n. 1. (...) 6 ^ag.
^8^ ex edit. Tilij Pa^^s. 1^^0.
Let ancient customs hold, that the Bishops of Alexandria should have the
government over Egypt, Lybia, and Pentapolis, because also the Bishop of Rome
has the same custom; as also let Antioch and other Provinces hold their
ancient privileges: Now these words of the Canon thus limiting and
distinguishing the several Provinces, and grounding on the custom of the
Bishop of Rome, that as he had pre-eminence of all the Bishops about him, so
Alexandria and Antioch should have alL about them, as likewise every
Metropolitan within his own Province: these words (I say) do clearly show,
that before the Nicene Council, the Pope neither had pre-eminence of all
through the world (as now he claymeth to be an universal Bishop) nor ought
to have greater pre-eminence (by their judgment) than he had before time, this
being the effect of the Canon, to wit, That the Bishop of Alexandria shall have
authority over his Diocesses, as the Bishop of Rome over his.

PA.
Bellarmine says, Sensus est, quia ita Pontifex Romanus consuevit permittere.
Bellar. lib. 2. de Pont. cap. 13.. Quarta.
the meaning of the Canon is, that the Bishop of Alexandria should have the
Provinces there mentioned, because the Bishop of Rome was accustomed to permit
it so to be.

PRO.
The words of the Canon are, Because the Church of Rome has the like custom,
here is not one word of permission. They be indeed (as learned Bishop Morton
says The Grand Imposture of the (now) Church of Rome, by the Bishop of
Coventrie and Lichfield. Chap. 8. sect. 2
) words of comparison; that the Bishop of Alexandria should enjoy his
privileges accordingly as the Bishop of Rome held ancien^ly his: as if one
should say, I will give this man a crown, because also I gave a crown to his
fellow.

Besides, Cardinal Cusanus understands the Canon as we do, in this sort;
[Quoniam parilis mos est] id est, sicut Romanus habet omnium suorum Episcoporum
potestatem; ita and Alex^ndrinus ex more habet per Aegyp^um^ etc. Card. Cusan.
concord. Cathol. l. 2. c. 12
As the Bishop of Rome had power and authority over all his Bishops, so the
Bishop of Alexandria, according to custom, should have thorowout Lybia, and
the rest.

Here by the way, the reader may observe, that though the Pope should have a
large circuit for his Diocese, yet was not this Jurisdiction given him, by the
Law of Go^, but by the custom of men. Let old cust^mes b^ k^pt s^ith the
Council: he^e was no ordinance of Christ, acknowledged, no Text of Scripture
alleged for it, as now a day^s; Tu es Petrus, and pasce oves, and tibi da^o
claves; Thou art Peter, f^ed my sheep, and unto thee will I give the Keys of
the Church. The P^p^ held it not then, as it is now pre^ended, (...) 2. de Pont
cap. 12.
Iure Divino^ by divine ordinance, but only by use and custom which may be
altered, and was upon occasion; for when Constantinople became the Imperial
City, then was the Bishop thereof equalled with Rome as appearet^ by the
Chalcedon Council.

About the year 381 the second General Council, was held at Constantinople,
against Macedomus, who denied the Divinity of the Holy Ghost; ^t consisted of
an hundred and fifty Bishops; it was called not by the Pope, but by the
Emperor Theodosius the elder. (...). Socrat lib. 5. (...). cap. 8.


This Council confirmed the foresaid sixth Canon of the Nicen, which bounded the
Bishop of Rome (as well as other Bishops) within the precincts of his own
Province. The third Canon of this Council of Constantinople speaks in this
tenor: (...). Synod. Occumen 2. can. 3. p^^ 306. edit. Tilij G^aece.
That the Bishop of Constantines City, that is, Constantinople has
P^erogatives of honor next after the Bishop of Rome, because it is new Rome.

THE FIFTH CENTVRIE, From the year of Grace, 400. to 500.
PAPIST.
WHat say you of this fifth Age?

PROTESTANT.
We are yet within the compass of the first 500 years next after Christ, and
so nearer to the time and truth of the Prim^tive Church: now for this present
Age, it may for choice of Learned men, be compared to the Golden Age, for now
flourished the Golden mouthed Chrysostom, Oh ve^ustat^m ^l^quij C^^ysostomus
id est, os am cum nommatur^ ^^^them. de Sc^^ptor. Ecclesiast.
the Well languaged Hierome and Saint Austin the very Mall and Hammer of
Heretics.

Chrysostom was (...), the most copious writer of any of the Greek Fathers
now extant; he was an eloquent Preacher, full of Rhetorical figures, and
amplifications; so that his vein and gift lay rather in the Ethique and Moral
part of divinity, In Ethicis plus exc^ll^t^ quam in Didasia(...) and
Ex^geticis^ Dan Toll^n^ in Synopsi de legendis Pa^^ibus.
working upon the affections, than in the doctrinal and exegetical part, for
information of judgment. By his liberty of speech in Pulpit, he drew the
hatred of the great ones of the (...), and of the Emperor himself, but above
all, of the Empress Eudoxia, upon his head: so that she, and Theophilus,
Patria^ke of Alexandria procu^ed his deposition and banishment, with
commandment to ^^^^ney his weak^ body with excessive Travels from place to
place, until he concluded his life, Sozo^en. lib. 8. cap. ui^. hist. Eccles.

Hierome was borne in Dalmatia, and instructed at Rome. He travailed abroad
into France, and other places, of pu^pose to increase his knowledge, at Rome
he acquainted himself with Honorable women, such as Marcella, Sophronia,
Principia, Paula, and Eustochium, to whom he expounded places of holy
Scripture, for he was admitted Presbiter; he served Damasus Bishop of Rome in
sorting his Papers; his gifts were envied at Rome, therefore he l^ft Rome, and
took his voyage toward Palestina: by the way he acquainted himself with
Epiphanius, Nazianzen, and Didymus Doctor in the School of Alexandria, and
sundry other men of note and mark. In the end he came to Judea, and made
choice of Bethlem the place of the Lords Nativity to be the place of his
death. At Bethlem, Paula a noblewoman (who accompanied Hierome, and his brother
Paulinianus from Rome) upon her own charges builded four Monasteries, whereof
her self guided one, and Hi^rome another. Hierome was (...) well skilled in
the tongues; but he wa^ a man of a Chollericke and stern disposition, more
inclinable to a solitary and Monkish li^e, then to f^llowship and society:
neither Heliodorus in the wilderness, nor Ruffinus out of the wilderness, could
keep inviolable friendship with him, he flourished about the year 390. but he

Augustine in his younger years was infected with the error of the Manichees;
his mother Monica prayed to God for his conv^rsion, and God heard her pra^ers;
for by the p^eac^ing of Ambrose, bish^p of Millaine, an^ by reading the life of
Antonius the Heremite, he was wonderf^lly moved, and began to disl^ke his
former conversation. He went into a quiet Garden accompanied with Alipius, and
there as he was with tears bewayling his former course, and desi^ing Gods
grace for working his c^nversion, he heard a voice sa^i^g unto him, Augustine.

Toll and lege, and again, Toll and lege, that is to say, Take up and read,
Take up and read: at the first hearing, he thought it to be the voice of
boys or maids speaking in their play such words one to another: but when he
looked about, and could see nobody, he knew it to be some heavenly admonition,
warning him to take up the book of holy Scripture (which he had in the Garden
with him) and read. Now the first place that fell in his hands, after the
opening of the book, was this: Romans 13. verse. 13 14
Not in gluttony and drunkenness, neither in chambering and wantonness, nor
in strife and envying^ but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and take no
thought for the flesh to fulfill the lusts of it. At the reading whereof, he
was so fully resolved to forsake the vanities of the world, and to become a
Christian, that immediately thereafter he was babtized by Saint Ambrose, with
his companion Alipius, and his son Adeodatus. He was afterward made bishop
of Hippo in Africa. He defended the truth against the Manichees, Pelagians,
Donatists, and whatsoever error else prevail^d in this age. He is to be
commended, in that he revised his own Writings, and wrote his retractations,
or r^cognitions. When he had lived 76 years, he re^^ed from his labors,
before the Vandales had taken the town of Hippo which in the time of
Augustines sickness they had besieged: and thus was he translated, and taken
away, before he saw the evil that came upon the place. Isai. 57.1.


Besides these learned Trium virs, there lived in this age Theodoret bishop of
Cyrus a town in Syria, Cyrill bishop of Alexandria, Leo the great and Gelasius
bishops of Rome, Vincentius Lirinensis a great impugner of Heresies, as also

In those things which are laid down plainly in the Scriptures, all those

these, other things necessary for Bishops and Pastors (...) I^. ibid. (...).
were delivered by tradition: but this stands not with Austines drift, for in
the Treatise alleged de Doctrine Christiana, he purposely instructs not
the people, but Christian Doctors and Teachers; so that where he says, In the
Scriptures are plainly set down all things which contain Faith, Hope, and
Charity, he means (as elsewhere Aug. de (...) Christ. lib. 1. cap. 1. and
lib. 4 ^a^. 4.
he expresses himself) all things which are necessarily to be believed, or
done, not only of the Lay people, but even of Ecclesiastickes. In like sort
the same father says; ^
Those things which seemed sufficient to the salvation of believers, were
chosen to be written.

Vincentius Lirinensis ^
says, that the Canon or Rule of Scripture is perfect, abundantly sufficent in
it self for all things, yea more than sufficient; neither is this a false
supposall, as a Jesuit pretends it to be, ^
but a grounded truth, and the Authors doctrine: Li^inensis indeed makes first
one general sufficient Rule for all things, the sacred Scriptures; Secondly
another, useful in some cases only, yet never to be used in those cases
without Scriptures, which is, the Tradition of the Universal Church, and
general consent of Fathers. The first was used by the ancient Church from the
worth that is in it self; the other is used to avoid the jarring
interpretations of perv^rse Heretike^ that many times abuse the sacred Rule and
Standard of the Scripture. Now we admit the Churches Interpretation, as
ministerial to holy Scripture, so it be conformable thereunto. And we say
with the learned Rejoinder to the Jesuit Malounes Reply: Rejoinder to the
Jesuits Reply, sect. 5. pa. 1^0.
Bring us now one Scripture expounded (according to Lirinensis his Rule Quod

Image worship in your sense, and we will receive it.

Saint Cyril says, Non omnia quae Dominus fecit co^scripta sunt, sed quae
scriben^^s tam ad mores, quam ad dogmata putarunt sufficere. Cyril. Alexand.
tom. 1. lib. 12. in Johan. cap. ult.
that All things which Christ did are not written, but so much as holy writers
judged sufficient both for good manners and Godly faith. And in another place
he says, Sufficit divina Scriptura ad faciendum eos qui in illa educati sunt
sapientes et probatissimos et sufficientissi^am habentes intelligentiam. Cyril.
tom. 1 lib. 7. cont. Julian. pa. 159.
The holy Scripture is sufficient to make them which are brought u^ in it wise,
and most approved, and furnished with most sufficient understanding.

Saint Hierome reasons Negatively from the Scriptures, saying: Vt haec quae
scripta sunt non negamus, it^ ^a quae non sunt scripta renuimus. Natum Deum
esse de virgi^e credimus, quia legimus: Mari^m nupsisse post partum non
credimus, qula non legimus. Hieron. tom. 2. advers. Helvid.
As we deny not those things that are written, so we refuse those things that
are not written; That God was borne of a Virgin we believe, because we read
it; That Mary did marry after she was delivered we believe not, because we
read it not.

Saint Chrysostom says, (...). Chrysostom. in 2. epist. ad These. tom. 4. edit.
Savilij p^g. 234.
that All those things that are in holy writ are right and clear: that,
Whatsoever is necessary, is manifest therein; yea, he calls the (...). Id.

Scripture, The most exact Balance, Square, and Rule of Divine verity.

This was the Fathers Rule of Faith of old, and the same a perfect one; but the
Papists now adays make it but a part of a Rule, Regula Fidei, non totalis, sed
partiali^ Bellar. lib. 4. de verbo non scripto. cap. 12.. Dico.
half a Rule; and piece it with Tradition.

Of the Scripture Canon.
Saint Hierome, who was well skilled in the tongues, travailed much, and saw
the choycest Monuments of Antiquity, as also the best Libraries that the
Eastern Parts could afford, and was therefore likely to meet with the best
Canon, names all the Books which we admit, and afterward adds: Hic
Prologu^ Scripturarum quasi Galeatum principium omnibus libris quos de Hebraeo
vertimus in Latinum convenire potest, ut scire valeamus qui^quid extra hos est
inter Apocrypha esse ponendum; igitur Sapientia quae ^ulgo Salomo^is
inscribitur, and Jesus ^ilij Syrach liber, and Judith, and Tubias, and Pastor
(...) sunt in Canone. Hieron. Tom. ^. prae^at. in libr. Regum.
Whatsoever is besides these, is to be put amongst the Apocrypha; and that
therefore the Book of Wisdom, of Jesus the Son of Syrach, of Judith,
Tobias, and Pastor, are not in the Canon.

The same Hierome having mentioned the Book of Wisdom, and Ecclesiasticus,
and delivered his opinion, that it is untruly called the Wisdom of Solomon,
and attributed to him, then adds: ^.
That as the Church reads Judith, Tobias, and the Maccabees, but receives
them not ^or Canonical Scriptures; so these two Books, (^amely) the Wisdom
of Sal^mon, and Jesus the Son of Syrach, does the Church read for the
edification of the people, not to confirm the authority of any doctrine in the
Church.

Objection.
The Carthaginian Council received those Books which you account (...) ^arthag
te^tium Can 47.
Apocryphal.

Answer.
They received them in Canonem Morum, not in Canonem Fidei. It is true ind^ed
that Saint Austine, and the African Bishops of his time, and some other in that
Age, finding these Books which Hierome and others rej^ct as Apocryphal, to be
joined with the other, and together read with them in the Church, seem to
account them to be Canonical; but they received them only into the
Ecclesiasticke Canon Ho^ (...) [Maccab^^^um] non Iul^i sed (...) Can^nicis
hab^t Aug. de Civit Dei. lib. ^8. cap. 36. tom 5. and de M^^abil. S.
^cripturae. li. 2. cap. 34. tom 3.
serving for Example of life, and instruction of manners: and not into any part
of the Rule of Faith, or Divine Canon, as Saint Austine speaking of the Books
of the Maccabees distinguishes, saying: Quo^um supputatio t^mp^rum, non in
Sc^ipturu sanctis, quae Cano^^cae app^lla^tu^, ^ed in alijs invenitur, in
quibus sunt M^ccabaeorum L^b. ^ Aug de C^vit. D^^. lib. 18 c. 36
This reckoning is not found in the Canonical Scriptures, but in other Books,
as in the Maccabees; plainly distinguishing between the Canonical
Scriptures, and the Books of the Maccabees: Wherein, (says he In (...)
libr^^, et si aliqui^ mi^abilium numero in^erendum i^veniatur, de ho^ tamen
null^ cur^ ^a^iga^imur, quia tintum ag^r^ pr^posui^us^ ut d^ divi^i C^^on^^
mirab^l^bus exp^sition^m t^^ge (...). August. de Mirabil. S. Scr^ptu^ae lib. 2.
cap. 34.
) There may be something found worthy to be joined with the number of those
miracles; yet hereof will we have no care, for that we intend the miracles,
Divini Canonis, which are received in the Divine Canon.

Of the book of Judith he tells us, L^br^m Iu^^th, in Canone S^^iptur^rum Iudei
non (...) dicunt^r. Aug. d. Civitat. Dei. lib. 18 c^p. ^^.
The Jews never received it into the Canon of Scriptures; and withal there he
professes, That the Canon of the ^ewes was most Authentical.

Touching the books of Wisdom, and Ecclesiasticus, he tells us, Sapientia and
Ecclesiasticus, propter eloquij nonnullam similitudinem, ut Salomonis dicatur,
obtinuit consuetudo, non autem esse ipsius dubitant doctiores. Id. ibid. lib.
17. cap. 20.
that, They were called Salomons, only for some lik^n^sse of Style, but the
Learned doubt whether they b^e his.

Lastly, the Council of Carthage, whereat Saint Austine was present,
Prescribing that no books should be read in the Church as Canonical, but such
as indeed are Canonical, leaves out the book of Maccabees, as it appears
by the Greek Edition, Synod. Carthag. apud Balsam. in editione Ioh. Tilij.
though they have shuffled them into the Latin; Caranza in summ^ Council. and
Codex Cano^^ vetus Ecclesi^ Romanae.
which argues suspicion of a forged Canon.

Now to this ancient evidence of Hierome, and Austine, the Papists make but a
poor Reply. Canus says, Hieronymus non est regula fidei -- nondu^ ears satis
erat explorata. Canus loc. Theol. li 2. ca. 11.
that Hierome is no rule of Faith; and that the matter was not then
sufficiently sified: Bellarmine says, Adm^tto Hieronymu^ in ea ^uisse
opinione, qu^a nondum generale Conciliu^ de hi^ libris aliquid statuerat.
Bellar. de ve^bo Dei li. 1. ca. 10. Respondeo.
I admit that Hierome was of that opinion, because as yet a General Council
had decreed nothing touching those books; and Saint Austin might likewise
doubt thereof; so that by Bellarmines confession, Hierome, and Austine, in this
point are ours.

Of Communion under both kinds.
Saint Chrysostom says, (...). Chrys^st. sup 2. Co^^ Homil. 18. tom. 3. edit.
Savilij page 645.
that whereas Under the Law, there was a difference between Priests and Laics
in communicating of victim^s; In the n^w it is otherwise; for one body and one
Cup is ministered to all.

Hierom says Sacerdotes qui Eucharistiae serviunt, and sanguinem Domini
populis ejus dividunt. Hieron s^p. Sophon cap 3. tom 6.
that the Pastors administered the Eucharist, and distributed the blood of our
Lord to his people; the same Hierome report^th how Exuperius Bishop of Toulouse
in France was wont to carry the Communion to persons absent. There was no man
(says he) Nihil illo d^tius qui corpus Domini can^stro vimineo, sanguin^m po
tat in vitro. Hieron Epist. ad Rusticum. tom. 1.
richer than Exuperius, who carried the Lords body in a Wicker basket, and his
blood in a Glass. It is true indeed that the Bishop sold the Church^Plate for
the relief of the poor; Avaritiam eje^i^ e t^mplo Hier ibid. -- sac^o vasa
erogavit in usum pauperum E^asm. in loc. Hiero^ymi.
so that he was driven to use Osier baskets, and Glasse-cups; but withal the
story says, he carried the consecrated bread and wine severally and apart, and
not by way of Concomitancie.

Besides that, the wine might be carried abroad in a vial, to sick persons,
without any such danger of spilling, as the I. F. Rejoinder to D. Whites Reply,
7. point.
Jesuit dreams on.

Saint Austine says, Non solum nem^ p^ohibetur, sed ad bibendum poti^s omn^s
exhortantur, qui vo^un^ ^^bere vi^^m Aug. to. 4^ qu. 57 sup Levit. Sang^^^ Abe.
sig^^^ic^t sanguine^ Ch^isti, qu^ ^niv^^sa ec^les^^ acce^t^ di^it Amen. Id.
^bid. qu. 49
All that would have life are exh^^ted to drink of the blood; and, that The
whole Church having received the Cup, answers, Amen.

Pope L^o r^proveth such as in his time refused the Cup, which is a token that
the Cup was then in use among the Laietie, his words are these: Cumque a^
tegen^am in^id^litatem s^am, n^st^is a^de^nt interesse myst^^i^^, ita in
Sac^am^nt^^^m (...) se tem^er at, ut interdu^ (...) lateant, ore i d^g^o

(...), n^tati et proditi, a S^ncto um societate, s^cer^^ta i aut^ crit^te
pellantu^ Leo ser. 4. de Quadrages.
Whereas some to hide their infidelity come sometimes to Catholic Churches,
and are present at the celebration of sacred mysteries, they so temper the
matter that with unworthy mouths they receive the Lords body, but decline to
drink the blood of our Redemption. I would therefore have your holiness take
notice, that by these signs they may be discovered, and their Sacrilegious
dissembling may be found out and descried, that being thus discovered they may
by Priestly authority he cast out of the society of the Saints.

In like sort Gelasius enjoined Communion in both kinds. We have found (says
he) Comperimu^ autem quod qui la^ ^mpta tant^^^odo corpo is sacri poti^ns, a
calice sacri cruno^is abstincant; qui proculdubi^ (quum neset qu^ superslitione
do^entur obst^ing^) aut integra sa^ramenta recipiant aut abinteg^is arce^tur:
quia divisio unius eju^demque mysterij fine grand sacrilegio non potest
perven^re. Dec^e^ 3. part. de Con^ecrat. Did. 2. cap. Comperimus autem.
That certai^e having received a po^tion of the sacred body only, abstain
from the Cup of the most holy bl^ud; which men because they are said to be
entangled with I know not what superstition, either let them receive the whole
Sacrament, or else let them be wholly ^xcluded from receiving; because there
can be no dividing of one and the same mystery without grievous Sacrilege.

Reply.
Gelasius (hap'ly) speaks of some [^ut integr^] Hoc ^^t^lli^^ de Confi^i^nte.
G^o^^a ibid.
Priests who consecrated the elements, but themselves received not in both
kinds.

Answer.
The words he uses are Recipiant, and Arceantur, which do evidently prove,
that he speaks of the people, who do not themselves receive the Sacrament,
but from the Ministers hand; as also the word Arceantur, that is, Let them not
be received, though they offer themselves.

Besides, the ancient histories speak not of any Priest that ever made scruple
of drinking of the Chalice which himself had consecrated.

Reply.
The Manichees had an opinion, Vinum non bibunt dicentes fell esse tenebrarum.
August. de Haeres. 46. Tom. 6.
that Wine was not created by God, but by some evil spirit, and that Christ
did not shed his blood on the Cross, and hereupon they abstained from the
Chalice: therefore the Church in detestation of this error, for a time
commanded Communion under both kinds; The Rejoinder to Dr. Whites Reply.
upon this occasion Gelasius made the Decree recorded by Gratian.

R^joynder.
This was not done upon occasion of the Manichee's error; for before ever they
appeared in any number, Communion in both kinds was practiced, as appears by
the Apostles, Ignatius, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Saint Cyprian.
Now Cyprian the youngest of these flourished about the year two hundred and
fifty Floruit Cyprian ann 250. Bell. de Script. eccles.
, and the Manichees rose not till about the year two hundred seventy three.
Manichaei a Manete quodam dicti sunt circ^ annum 273. Prateolus de Haeres. lib.
11.


Again, although Leo speak of the Manichee's, yet Jesuit Vasques says, Leo
non commendavit usum Calicis contra Manichaeos, sed admonuit ut dilige^tur
observarent quosdam Manich^os, qui ut se Ca^holicos simularent, ita sumebant
calicem, ut sanguinem non haurirent in altera specie. Vasquez qu. 80. art. 12.
Disp. 216. nu. 42
that He commanded not the use of the Cup because of them, but required that
those which feigned themselves Catholics, and came to the holy Communion,
receiving the bread, and taking the Cup into their hands, pretending that they
drank the wine, and yet did not, should carefully be observed. Now among a
multitude of Communicants some few might hold the Cup to their mouth, and make
show of drinking, and yet receive no wine. The Cup then was not for a time only
allowed to the Laics by Leo and Gelasius, thereby to discover who were
Manichees; but in these Popes days the Cup was usually and ordinarily given to
the Laics, and upon the refusing of the Cup (then in use among the Catholics)
the Manichees were discovered; otherwis^ how could the Pope have reproved their
practice? How could the Manichees have be^ne espied and k^owne, if they and the
Catholics had received in one kind both alike? For this is the token that Leo
would have them known by, for that They refuse to drink the blood of our
Redemption; by which words it is clear, that the Cup was off^red orderly unto
them, as unto others, but they refused it.

Now touching the place of G^lasius, the same Vasqu^z says, Quid^m
probabiliter exp^ic^nt de (...) Mani^^ae^^, q^i communicabant sub alte^^ specie
tantum: (...) licet (...) verbi(...) poss^t (...) reddit, non (...) esse (...)
ut sine grandi sacrilegio divi li ^^queat nempe intellige^e videtur ratione
suae signifi^at^^onis and institutionis. Vasquez. in 3. part. Tho^ae q^aest.
81. Disp. 216 nu. 76.
that Whereas some of his part apply the same to the Manichees, yet this
exposition agrees not with the last branch of the Canon^ for therein he
teaches That the mystery of the Eucharist is of that nature in regard of it
self, that without gri^vous sacrilege it cannot be d^vided and severed the
one part from the other, to wit, because of the institution and signification.
Admit then, that the Manichees occasioned this Decree; yet this Decree is
backed with a general ^eason which forbids all to communicate in one kind
only, under the peril of Sacrilege: so that the Popes Canon reaches not
only to the Manichee, but to all such as halve the Communion, be they
Manichees, o^ Papists, or whatsoever they be.

Of the number of Sacraments.

with others, tell us, That the Sacraments of the n^w Law flowed out of
Christ's side: now none issued thence, but the Sacrament of water, which is
Baptism, and the Sacrament of blood in the Supper.

The same Austine says, Qued^m pa^^ca pro multis cad^mque factu facillim^, and

Our Lord and his Apostles have d^liv^red unto us a few Sacraments in stead of
many, and the same in doing most easy, in signification most excellent, in
obs^rvation most rev^rend, as is the Sacrament of Baptism, and the celebration
of the body and blood of our Lord. And the same Father speaking of the same
Sacraments (which he calls, for Sacramentis ^ume^o paucissimis, observatione
facillimis signifi^atione prestantissinis, so^iet t^m novi pop^li colligavit;

withal indeed adds a si quid aliud, if any such other Sacrament be to be
found in Scripture, but himself could not find any other; for he concludes
them within the number of two, saying, H^ec sunt Eccl^siege mina Sacramenta.
Aug. de Symbolo ad Catech. tom. 9.
These be the two Sacraments of the Church.

Of the Eucharist.
Saint Chrysostom says, Sicut enim antequam sanctificetur pani^, panem
nominamus: divine autem illum sanctificante grati^, mediante Sacerdote,
liberatus est quidem ab appellatione ^anis, dig^us aut^m habitus est Dominici
corpo^is appellatione etiamsi natura panis in ipso remansit Chrysost^ ad
Caesa^ium Monach.
that Before the Bread be sanctified, we call it Bread, but when Gods grace
[after consecration] has sanctified it by the means of the Priest, it is
freed from the name of Bread, and is accounted worthy of the name of the Body
of Christ, although the nature of the Bread remain still in it.

Ch^ysostome says the nature of bread remains after consecration, they say
nothing remains but the outward forms and accidents of bread.

Reply.

says that this Epistle is not extant amongst Saint Chrysostom's Works: and
when Peter Martyr objected this place to Stephen Gardener Bishop of Winchester,
the Bishop replied, Non est hoc ^oannis Chrysostomi, sed ^oanni^ cujusdam
Constantinopolitani Pet. Mart. defensio doctrinae de Eucharistia adversus
Gardinerum. page 368.
That it was none of Chrysostomes, but another John's of Constantinople.

Rejoinder.
What though it were not then extant? diverse parcells of Chrysostom have
been lately found out, and annexed to his other Works.

Besides, the same Bishop Gardener reports, Stephen Gardin^r in his Explication
of the true Catholic faith, touching the Sacrament of the Altar. page 116.
that Peter Martyr says, that this Treatise of Chrysostom was extant in a
Manuscript, and found in the Library at Florence; and that a Copy thereof
remained in the Archbishop of Canterburies hands. Again, they that would
father t^is ^rea^^se on another, the^ must bring us anoth^r John of
Constantinople, besides Chrysostom, and tell us what time he lived; it is
usual with the Church-storie, and S^int Austine, and Jerome to call
Chrysostom John of Constantinople, or Priest of Antioch. Lastly, this Author
says nothing but what Saint Ambrose, Gelasius, and Theodoret have vouched.

For whereas the H^retike E^tyches taught that Christ his body was changed into
the substance of his Divinity after the resurrection; and that the substance of
his body remained no more the same; Pope Gelasius confuteth him by a similitu^e
and comparis^n drawn from the Sacrament, to wit, That as the substance of
Bread remains after consecration; so Christ his bodily substance remained
after the resurrection. His words are these: ^^rta Sacrame^ta quae (...) and
sanguinis Christ, d^vira r^s ^st, propter qu^d, (...) p^r ead^m divinae (...),

The Sacraments which we receive, of the body and ^loud of Christ, are a
divine thing, by means wh^r^of we are made partakers of the divine nature;
and yet the substance or nature of Bread and Wine does not cease to be. The
Papists they tell us, that after consecration the substance of bread and wine
is abolished, and the sha^e^, accidents, and quantity thereof only remain: but
this is contrary to these Fathers assertion, who say, there cease not to be
the very substance of bread and wine. Neither will it serve to say Loq^^tur de
Essen^ia and natu^a accident^um. B^ll^r. lib. 2. de Euchar. c. 27. S^d. and
Gelasiu^ idem docet quod The^do^etus. Bellar. ibid. Eadem.
that Gelasius by substance meant accidents: for if Gelasius had not taken the
word substance properly in both places, he had not concluded against the
Heretic.

; the record is still good against our adversaries, for it is confessed on all
sides, that he was an Orthodoxe Father, and very ancient.

Theodoret brings in Eranistes in the person of an Eutycl^ian Heretic, who
confounded the two natures in Christ, and (falsely) held, that The body of
Christ after his Ascension, being Glorified, was swallowed up of the Deity,
and continued no more the same humane and bodily essence, as before his
resurrection it had been; and for defense of this his Heresy, he takes his
comparison from the Eucharist and argues in this sort: (...). Theodor. Di^log.
2. cap. 24. p^g 113.
Even as the symbols or signs of the Lords body and blood, after the words of
Invocation (or Consecration) are not the same, but are changed into the Body of
Christ; even so after his Ascension was his body changed into a divine
substance.

To this Objection of the H^retikes, the Orthodoxe or Catholic (which was
Theodoret himself) replies, and retorts his own instance upon him thus: You
are caught (says he (...). Id. Ibid.
) in your own net, for as the mystical signs in the Eucharist, after
sanctification (or Consecration) do not go out of their proper nature, but
continue in their former figure, and substance, and may be seen and felt as
before: so the body of Christ after the Resurrection remains in it is former
figure, form, circumscription, and (in a word) the same substance which it had
before, although after the Resurrection it be immortal, and free from
corruption. In which passage we see the Heretic held, that Bread is changed
after consecration into the substance of Christ's body, and so do our
adversaries; the Orthodoxe or Catholic taught, that Bread after consecration
remains in substance the same, and so do we teach. Theodoret indeed (and so
do we) acknowledged that Christ's body after his Ascension was changed from a
corruptible, to an immortal and glorious body, but yet not changed in
substance; it still remained the same in substance; even as the Elements in the
Sacrament remain the same in substance, Neque enim signa mysti^a post
sanctification^m r^c^^u^t a sua natural manent ^nim in priore su^s^anti^, et
figur^, et fo^m^ and videri et tangi poss^n^, sicut and p^ius. Theodor. tom 2.
Dial. 2. Inconfusus. Gentiano Herveto Interpret.
that they Were before consecration, and may be seen and fealt, though they be
changed in use, from common to consecrated bread and wine.

Now if the Elements of Bread and Wine (according to this Orthodoxe Father)
remain in their former substance, shape, and species, then is not the whole
substance of bread and wine changed into the whole substance of the body and
blood of Christ; and where is then your Transubstantiation.

Answer.
B^llarmine answers this place by distinguishing the word (...), substantia,
saying Non loq^itur de sub^st^ntia quae dist^nguitur c^^tra (...); sed de
essentia and natura Accidentium, quae ipse perpetuo symbo^a appell^t. Bellar.
li. 2. de Euchar. c. 27.. Sed.
; When Theodoret says, that the substance of the Elements remaynes, and is not
changed, he speaks not of substance, as it is opposed to accidents, but of
the ^ssence and nature of accidents, which he always understands by Symbols.

Reply.
Theodoret in this very Dialogue exactly distinguishes between Substance and
Accidents; and shows that by (...) he means not Accidents, but Substance
properly so taken, saying; (...) Theodor. Dial. 2. ca^ 22. p. 105.
Therefore we call a body substance, and health and sickness an accident; by
which passage it is evident against Bellarmine, that Theodoret takes not (...)
for the es^ence, specially of accidents, but for substance prope^ly so called,
as it is opposed to Accidents. Besides, if Theodoret had thought (as the
Papists hold) that the substance of bread and wine cease, and is changed into
the very body and blood of Chirst; and that the accidents thereof only
remain, as namely the whiteness, roundnesse, taste, or the like; then could
not this Father have drawn or r^torted an Argument from the Sacrament, to
pro^ve that the substance of Christ's body remained after his ascension; for
then (as the learned on ou^ side have well observed) Bi^hop W^^te^ Reply to

the Heretic upon the doctrine of Transubstantiation, might have inferred
this erroneous opinion, about the humane nature of Christ, to wit, that as in
the Eucharist there is only the outward shape and form of bread, and not the
real substance: even so in Christ, there was the shape and form of flesh but
not the very nature. The same Theodoret says, (...). Th^od. (...) c^p 8. p. 34.
that our Savior honored the visible symbols with the name of his body and
blood; not changing the nature, but adding grace to nature. The same Th^odoret
says, (...). Id. Ib^d.
that our Savior gave the sign the name of his body. What can a man say more
express? then that in th^se words, This is my hody, our Savior has given to
the sign, that is to say, to the bread, the name of his body.

Answer.
You stand much upon Theodoret, but Gregory Valence Theodoretus de alijs
quibusda^ erro^ibus in Concilio Ephesino notatu^ fuit, etiamsi postea resipuit.
Greg. de Valentia lib. de Transub. cap. 7. sect. 11. page 390. volum. de reb.
fidei controvers.
tells you that Theodoret was taxed of error by the Council of Ephesus,
although he afterward revoked his error.

Reply.
You should have shown that the Council taxed him with error in this point
of the Sacrament; or that he retracted this opinion as erroneous, and then you
had said somewhat.

It is true indeed, that at first he was not so firm in his faith, being too
much addicted to Theodorus Bishop of Mopsvestia, and to Nestorius, so that he
wrote against the twelve Chap^ers which Cyril composed against the Nestorians;
but afterward he revoked his error, and accu^sed Nestorius, Mariam virgine^
quae peperit Dominum nostrum Iesum Chris^um, non (...) dicendam, sed (...)
[dixit Nest^rius] Danaeus in Aug. de Haeres. cap. 91. ex Evagrio.
and whosoever should not confess the blessed Virgin to be the mother of God,
whereupon the Council of Chalcedon received him into their Communion. D.
Crakentho^pe of the fifth general Council. cap. 9. nu. 9.


Besides, in the Dialogues alleged, Theodoret has notably opposed the Grand
Heretic Eutyches, and therein showed himself very Orthodoxe.

I proceed to Saint Austine, the Oracle of the Latin Fathers; whose judg^ment
touching the Eucharist has been in part declared in the first Centurie. He
held that those words, This is my Body were to be taken in a figurative sense;
his rule is, that whenever the Sign (as the Bread) being called Chris^'s
body, has the name of The thing signified, the speech is always figurative,
Ex hac autem similitudine plerumque e^iam ipsa^um r^rum nomina accipiunt,
quarum Sacramenta sunt, sicut ergo secundum qu^^dam modum Sacrame^tum Co^po^is
Christi ^orpus Christi est. Augustine tom. 2 Ep^st. 23 ad Bonifa.
for Sacraments be signs which often do take the names of those things, which
they do signify and repr^sent, Therefore do they carry the names of the
things themselves. Thus Baptism the sign of Christ's burial, is called
Christ's burial; now as Vt Baptismus dicitur sepulchrum, si^ hoc est corpus
meum. Aug. con. Faust. lib. 20 cap. 21.
Baptism is called Christ's Burial, so is the Sacrament of the Body of Christ,
called his Body; and again, Non enim Dominu^ d^bitavit dicere, hoc est corpus
me^m^ cum sig^^^n ^aret co^poris sui. August. to 6 contr. Adimant. c. 12.
Christ doubted not to say, This is my Body, when he gave a sign of his body.
The same Father upon occasion of Christ's speech, Except you eat the flesh of
the Son of man, [Ioh. 6.53.] gives us this general rule; Q^^^quid in s^rmone
divino neque ad morum honestatem, neque ad si^^i veritatem proprie ref^^ri
pot^^t, siguratum esse cognos^^^. Aug. lib. 3. de doct^^^. Christ. c. 10^ tom 3.
That whenso^ver we find in Scripture any speech of commanding some heinous
act, or forbidding some laudable thing, there to hold the spe^ch to be
figurative, even as this of eating the flesh of Christ. Now of this Sacrament
does not Christ say, Take, eat, This is my Body? Saint Austines words are
these: Si preceptiva locutio ^lagitium aut facinus videtur ^ubere, figurita
est^ ut [N^si manduc^veritis ^arnem meam] sacinus videtur jubere. Id. Ibid. c.
16.
If the Scripture seem to command any vile or ill fact, the speech is
figurative; Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood,
ye have no life in you; facinus vel flagitium videtur jubere, Christ seems
to command a wicked and sinful act; figura est ergo; It is therefore a
figurative speech, Figura ell ergo, pr^ecipiens passioni Domini esse
communicandum^ et ^uaviter a^que utiliter rec^^dendum in memori^^ quod pro
nobl^ caro ^jus ^rucis^xa and vulnerata sit. Id. Ibid.
Commanding us to partake of the passion of Christ, and sweetly and profitably
keep in memory that his flesh was crucified for us. Now for the manner of our
feeding on Christ's body, the same Father tells us, Q^omodo in c^^um (...)
mittam, ut ibi s^dent^m t^neam^ s^dem (...), and (...) August. sup. (...) 50
tom. ^^
that It is not corporal and sensual, but spiritual, credendo by believing:
How shall I send up my hand into heaven, to take hold on Christ fitting there?
Send thy Faith (says he) and thou have hold of him. Again, (...). 25.
Why preparest thou thy teeth and thy belly? Believe, and thou have eaten; and
again, (...) enim (...). Id. Ib^d. (...). 20^
For this is to eat the living bread, to believe in him; he that believes in
him, eats.

Objection.
You rely much upon Saint Augustine, but he makes for us, as may appear by
that place where he says, (...) illud corp^^ in manibus (...) Aug. to^ ^. in
Psalm 33. Con^^ 1. tom. 8.
that Christ at his Supper carried himself in his own hands.

Answer.
Our learned Doctor, Bishop Morton has notably cleared Bi^hop Mor^on of ^he
M^sse, Book 4. ch^p. ^. s^ct. 8.
this place. Saint Augustine expounding the 3^. Psalm, and falling upon a
wrong translation of that place in Samuel 1.21.13. And David feigned himself
mad in their hands, reads thus, He carried himself in his own hands. Now
this cannot (says he) be meant of David, or any other man literally; they are
meant then of Christ, when he said of the Eucharist, This is my body. Now these
words, Et ferebatur in manibus suis, are neither in the Original Hebrew text,
nor in your vulgar Translation, for there it is^ and collabebatur inter manus
eorum, David playing the mad man, slipped, or fell into the hands of others; they
that transcribed the Septuagint mistaking (...), his hands, his own hands, for
their hands occasioned this interpr^tation. Now Saint Austine interprets
himself, and answers his Quomodo ferebatur? with a Quodammodo, an Et ipse se
portab^^ Quoda^modo. Aug. in Psalm. 33. conc. 2.
Adverbe of likeness and similitude, saying that After a certain manner
Christ carried himself in his own hands, and thus he qualifies his fo^mer
speech; so that it cannot be understood of Christ's Corporal carrying of his
body properly in his own hands; but Quodammodo, after a so^t: and thus Saint
Austine says, Sicut secundum quendam modum Sacramentum Corporis, corpus
Christi est; ^ta Sa^ramentum sidei Fides est. Aug. epist. 23. ad Bonifac.
Secu^dum quendam modum, this Sacrament after a sort is the body of Christ, not
literally, but as Baptism (the Sacrament of Faith) is called faith, to wit,
figuratively and im^roperly.

Objection.
You alleged Saint Chrysostom against Transubstantion, but he makes for it,
saying, Qu^madmodum si cera igni adhibi^a illi assimilatur, nihil substantiae
remanet, nihil superfluit: sic and hic pu^a mysteria consumi corporis
substantia. Chrysostom tom. 3. Homil. de Euchar. in Encoenijs.
Do thou see bread? do thou see wine? do these things go to the draught
as other meats do? not so, think not so^ for as when wax is put to the
fire, nothing of the substance remains, nothing redoundeth; so here also
t^inke thou the mysteries consumed with the substance of the body of Christ.

Answer.
This place (as Bishop Bilson says) Bish. Bilson of Christian Subjection, the
fourth part, page 658.659. etc.
makes not for you; for you say the substance is abolished, but the accidents
of bread and wine remain: but when you put wax in^o the fire, nothing,
neither show, nor substance, nor accidents remain; and yet if you consult the
Schools, they will tell you the accidents only perish, the matter does not.

Neither does Chrysostom say, that the mysteries are consumed by the body of
Christ^ but he says, So think when thou come to the mysteries; that is,
think not on the elements, but lift up the eyes of thy mind above them, as if
they were consumed: and this he spoke to stir up the Communicants, rather to
mark in this Sacrament the wonderful power and effects of Gods spirit and
grace, than the condition, and natural digestion of the bread and wine. And it
is clear that this was his meaning: for in the very next words following he
says Number vides panem? number vinum? Ne putetis corpus accipere ab homine, sed ex
ipso Seraphin forcipe ign^m. Chrysostom. de Euchar. in Encoenijs. (...).
; Wherefore approaching (to the Lords Table) do not think that you receive
the divine body at the hands of a man, but that you take a fiery coal from a
Seraphim, or Angel, with a pair of tongs. By this strain of rhetoric
Chrysostom (as his manner is) persuades the people to come to the Lords Table
with no less reverence, than if they were to receive a fiery coal (as Esaias
did in his vision) from one of the glorious Seraphims. Chrysostom had no
intent that the bread was transubstantiated, no more than that the Priest was
changed into an Angel, or his hand into a pair of tongs, or the body of Christ
into a coal of fire; and he uses the same amplification in both the
speeches, the same phrase [thinke you] and at the same time, and to the same
people: so that if one be (as certainly it is) a strain of rhetoric, why
not the other also? Sixtus Senensis gives a good rule for interpretation of the
Fathers speeches, specially in this argument; Non sunt Conclonatorum verba
semper eo rigore ac^^p^end^, multa enim Declamatore^ per hyperbolen enunciant
Hoc interdum Chrysostom^ co^^ingit. Sixth. Senens. Biblioth. lib. 6. anno^ 152.
The sayings of Preachers, are not to be urged in that rigor of their words;
for after the manner of Orators, they use to speak many times hyperbolically,
and in excess. And he instanceth in Chrysostom, as well he might, for he
is full of them, even there where he speaks of the Sacraments, he says,
Dentes carni suo infe^ Chrysostom. tom. 3. Homil. 45. in Io^n.
That our teeth are fixed in the flesh of Christ; that (...) Lingu^ cruentatur
hoc admirabill sanguine. Chrysostom. tom. 2. Homil. 83. in Ma^h.
our tongues are dyed red with his blood; and again, Ille non te baptizat,
(...). ^d Homil. 50. in Math.
That it is not the Minister, but God that baptizeth thee, and holds thy
head. Now these and the like sayings must be favorably construed, as being
improper speeches, rhetorical strains, purposely uttered to move affections,
stir up devotion, and bring the Sacrament out of contempt, that so the
Communican^s eyes may not be finally fixed on the outward elements of bread
and wine, being in themselves but transitory and corruptible creatures; but to
have their hearts elevated and lift up by faith to behold the very body of
Christ, which is represented in these mysteries. Otherwise, the Fathers come
down to a lower key, when they come to speak to the point, yea or no: and
accordingly Saint Chrysostom, when once he is out of his Rhetorical vein,
and speaks positively and doctrinally, says, Quando hoc mys^e^ium trad^dit,
vinum ^radid^t. Chrysostom Homil. 82. in Math.
When our Lord gave the Sacrament, he gave wine; and again, (...). -- (...).
Ch^ys. in Hebr^^ 10. Hom. 17. to^ 4. page 523. edit. Savilij.
Do we not offer every day? We offer indeed, but by keeping a memory of his
death; and he puts in a kind of caution, or correction, lest any should
mistake him; We offer (says he) the same Sacrifice, or rather the
remembrance thereof. And such a Commemorative and Eucharisticall sacrifice we
acknowledge.

Object.
Saint Cyril of Alexandria, uses the word corporally, saying; Corporaliter
enim s^lius per bened^ctorem mysticam nobis, ut ^oma unitu^; Spi^itualiter
autem ut Deus. Cyrill. in Joan. lib. 11. cap 27 tom. 1.
that by the mystical benediction, the Son of God is united to us
corporally, as man, and spiritually, as God.

Answer.
Hereby is meant a full perfect spiritual conjunction with the sanctified
Communicants, excluding all manner of Imagination, or fantasy; and not a
gross, and fleshly being of Christ's body in our bodies, according to the
appearance of the letter; otherwise, this inconvenience would follow, that our
bodies must be in like manner corporally in Christ's body; for Cyril as he
says, Christ is corporally in us, so he says, Communicatione corporis et
sanguinis Christi, ipse in nobis est, and nos in ipso. Id. ibid. l. 10. c. 13.
wear corporally in Christ; by corporally then he means, that near, and
indissoluble union, in the same sense that the Apostle uses it, saying, In him
dwel^eth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, Coll. 2.9. bod^ly, that is
indissolubly.

Besides, Christ is likewise joined corporally to us by the Sacrament of
Baptism, and yet therein there is no Transubstantiation.

Of Image Worship.
Saint Hierome says; Nos unam veneram^r Imaginem quae est Imago invisibilis et
omnipote^tis Dei. Hi^ron to. 50. li. 40. in Ezech c. 16.
We worship one Image which is the Image of the invisible and omnipotent God.
Saint Austine says, N^lla imago e^us coli debet, nisi illa quae hoc est qu^d
ipse, nec ipsa pro illo sed cum illo. Aug ep 119. ad Ianuar. cap 11.
No Image of God ought to be worshipped, but that which is the same thing that
he is, meaning Christ Jesus, [ Col. 1.15. Hebr. 1.3.] nor yet that for him, but
with him. And as for the representing of God in the similitude of a man, he
resolves that it is Utterly unlawful Tale simulac^^um Deo nefas est
Christiano in templo collocare. Idem tom. 3. de Fide and Symbolo cap 7.
to erect any such Image to God in a Christian Church. He condemns the use of
Images, even when they are not adored for themselves, but made instruments to
worship God, saying, Sic omnino ^rrare meruerunt, qui Christum and Apostolos
ejus, non in sanctis codicibus. sed i^ pictis pari^tibus quaesierunt. Id. to.
4. de Consens. Evang. lib. 1 c. 10.
Thus have they deserved to err which sought Christ and his Apostles in
painted Images, and not in written books. The same Austine writing of the
manners of the Catholic Church, directly severeth the case of some men, who
were wont to kneel superstitiously in Churh yards before the tombs of
Martyrs, and the painted histories of their sufferings; these private men's
cases he severeth from the common cause, and approved practice of the Catholic
Church, saying, Nolite consectari turbas imperitorum, qu^ vel in ips^ ver^
Religione superstit^osi sunt. Novi multos esse sepulchrorum and picturarum
adoratores: n^nc vos illud admoneo, ut aliquando Ecclesi^^ Catholicae
maledicere desi^atu, vi^uperando m^res hominum, quos and ipsa co^dem^at^ and
quo^ quoti^ie tanq^am malos ^ilios corrigere st^det. Id. to. 1. de mor. Eccles.
Cathol. cap. 34.
Do not bring in the company of rude m^n, which in the true religion it self
are superstitious. I know many that are worshippers of Graves and pictures. Now
this I advise that you cease to speak evil of the Catholic Church by
upbraiding it with the manners of those men, whom she her self condemns, and
seeks every day to correct as naughty children, so that in Saint Austines
times, (as is already no^ed) See in the second Centurie S. Austins testimony
on the 113. Psalm.
Images, and Image Worship were not used by any general warranted practice; if
some misinformed men used it, this could not in Saint Austines opinion, make
it a Church duty, necessary and Catholic, or draw it to be a general custom.

Bellarmine answers, Dico Augustinum scripsisie cum librum in primordio
conversion^ su^ ad sidem Cath^licam; tamen postea meli^s instructu^ excusavit
[eos ritu^] ab Idololatri^^^ Bell^ li. de Imag. cap. 16.. Dico.
that Saint Austine wrote this in the beginning of his Conversion to
Christianity, and that upon better information he changed his mind; but he
tells us not in what part of his Retractations this is to be found.

Diverse other shifts besides are used herein: and some fly to the distinction
of an Idol and an Image, but that will not se^ve; for the word (...) is often
translated Simulachrum, a likeness or simili^^de; and as every Idol is an
Image of some thing, so every Image worshipped turns Idol; there may be some
ods in the language, but none in the thing it self.

Bellarmine minceth Bellarm. de Imaginib. cap. 23. and 25.
the matter, and would have the Image worshipped, not prope^ly, and because of
it self, but reductively, inasmuch as it does express the Sampler: Others
Thom^s 3. part. qu. 25. art. ^.
hold that the Image is to be worshipped in it self, and with the s^m^
wo^ship that the person is, which is represented; so that the Crucifixe is to
be reverenced with the self same hon^ur that Christ Jesus is. And as for the
vulgar people, they go bluntly to it with down^right adoration Cassander
says, Mani^e^tius ^st, quam ut multis verb^^ ^xpl^c^ri debeat -- ita ut ^l
summ^ adoratione^ quae ^el ^ Pag^n^^ suis f^nu^^c^^ is ^xhib^i ^on^ucuit, nil ^
nostris reliqui ^^ctum esse vid^ atur. Call^^d^^ Consult. de Imagine.
It is more manifest, than that it can be denied, that the worship of Images
and Idols has too much prevailed, and the sup^rstitious humor of people has
been so cockered^ that nothing has been omitted among us, either of the
highest adoration and vanity of Painims, in worshipping and adoring Images.
Polydore also says, Sunt exim be^e mul^i ^u^iores, qui Imag^nes ^ola^t non ut
sig^^, s^^ pe^i^^e qu ^si ipsae ^easam ali qu^m habeant ^t ijs magis fi^^^ q^am
C^^isto, vel alijs Devis q^^^^ d^ca^ae sunt P l^d. Vng. de Inv^nt. li. 6 c^p.
13.
People are grown to such madness, that there are many rude and stupid
persons, which adore Images of wood, stone, marble, and brass, or paint^d in
windows, not as signs, but as though they had sense; and they repose more
trust in them, than in Christ or the Saints, to which they are dedicated.
Ludovicus Vives says, M ^^i ^^^^stiani in re bo^^ ple^unque pe^^ant, quo^
Divos D^^^^que ^on a iter venerantur q^^ Deum. Nec video in m^ltis q^^d fit
dis^^imen i^ (...) ^o^um opinionem de Sanctis, and il quod G^n^il^s p^t^hant de
suis D^^^. (...). Vives Schol^n Au^ustin. de Civit. D^^. l. 8. cap. 27.
Sai^ts are esteemed and worshipped by many, as were the Gods among the
Gentiles.

Objection.
The honor or dishonor done to the Image redoundeth to the person
represented, or p^ototype, as appears by our being uncovered, and using
reverence in the Kings Chamber of presence, and before his Chair of estate,
when his person is absent; in like sort, the honor, and worship due to the
Image, redoundeth to Christ and his Saints: now if an Image be capable of
contempt and reproach, it is also capable of honor and worship.

Answer.
The Rule [ The dishonor done to the Image redoundeth to the person] is true,
specially in civil affairs, when the Party would be honored by the Image:
and thus was Theodosius grieved with them of Antioch, Theodoret lib. 5 ^istor.
cap. 19.
for casting down his wives Statue. It may also redound to the person by
accident, that is, when a man does a thing with a purpose to dishonor him; as
Julian did, Sozomen (...). lib. 5. cap. 20.
when he pulled down the Image of Christ, and set up his own.

Besides, these contraries are not paria; for it suffiseth, to the dishonouring
of God, that there be an evil affection or intention: but a good intention is
not sufficient to the honoring of God, except the means, as well as the
meaning be prescribed of God.

Lastly (as learned Bishop White says Bishop Whites Reply to Jesuit Fishers
Answer, point 1. page 228.
) this Similitude halteth: for the Kings Chair of State, and his image, when
they are honored or dishonored, are conjoined with his person, by civil
ordinance and relation: but the artificial Image of Christ and his Cross are
not conjoined with Christ, by divine ordination, or by relation grounded on
Christ's Word, but by an imaginary act of the superstitious worshipper; also
civil and religious worship, are of diverse beginnings, and forms, and every
thing that is possible, lawful, and commendable in the one, is not so in the
other.

Objection.
Adoration is performed to Images, as being done outwardly, relatively, and
transitorily unto the Image; inwardly, affectuously, absolutely, and finally
unto Christ.

Ans^er.
If you adore Images outwardly, relatively, and transitorily, then (as the same
Bishop says Id. ibid page 246.
) you make Images a partial object of adoration: but God himself who says, I
will not give my glory to another (to wit, in whole or in part) neither my
praise to graven Images ( Esaias 42.8.) has excluded ^mages from copartnership
with himself in adoration,

Of Prayer to Saints.
Concerning Prayer to Saints, Saint Hierome, or whosoever Recte quoque

else was the Author of those Commentaries on the Proverbs, says Nullum
invocare, id est, in nos orando vocare nisi Deum debemus. Hieron. tom. 7. in
Proverb. cap. 2.
: We ought to invocate, that is, by Prayer to call into us none but God.

And in another place, Quicquid dixero, quia ille non audit, mutu^^ videtur.
Id. to. 1. ad Heliodor. Epitaph. Nepotiani.
Whatsoever I shall utter seems dumb, because he (Nepotian) being defunct,
hears me not. Theodoret upon the 2. and 3. Chapter to the Colossians
expressly says (and that by the authority of the Council of Laodicea) that
Angels are not to be prayed unto: and if not Angels, not Martyrs.

Saint Austi^e in his book which he wrote of true religion, says; Non sit
nobis Religio cultus hominum mortuorum. Aug. tom. 1. de vera Relig. cap. 55.
The worshipping of men that are dead should be no part of our religion.
Papists invocate Saints in the Liturgy of their Mass, which the Ancients did
not. Saint Austine says expressly, that Martyrs were named at the Communion
Table, but not invocated: his words are these, Ad quod sacrificium, sicut
homines Dei, qui mundum in eju^ confessione vi^^r^nt suo loco et ordine
n^minantu^, non tamen a Sa^erdote qui sacri^icat, i^^o^ antur. August. li. 22.
de ^ivit. Dei. c. 10. to. 5.
At which Sacrifice the Martyrs are named in their place and order, as men of
God, which have overcome the world in the confession of him; but yet
notwithstanding, they are not invocated by the Priest which sacrifiseth.

Answer.
This place is thus answered: Non tamen a sacerdote qui sacri^icat, invocantur;
Deo quippe, non ipsis sacrificat. ^ac. Pa^^el. Litu^g. secul. 5. tom. 1. Non
invocantur ut Dij. L^^. Coquaeus. -- Card Perron.
The Priest does not invocate Saints by direct Prayer. Besides, the Sac^ifice
is directed to God the Father alone, and that may be the reason why the Saints
are not invocated.

Reply.
Saint Austine excludes all invocation of Saints, both direct and indirect, in
the administra^ion of the Eucharist. Neither will th^se distinctions help
them; for though the invoc^tion of them be not a direct, absolute, and
sov^raigne invocation, yet if it be an indirect, relative, or ^^bal^erne
invocation, an invocation it is: (and such a one is the invocation at the Altar
in the Mass: for thus it is, M^nuale Ec^esi^ Sali^b^^^^^is. In Canone Mi^iae
Libera nos Domine ab omnibus malis, etc. interced^nte pro nobis beata virgin,
etc. beatis Apostolis, etc. cum omnibus Sanctis.) and so what shall become of
Saint Augustine's non invocantur, who knew none of these distinctions of the
Cardin^ll's, which in that Age, and many Ages after were not heard of, Bi^h^p
A^d^ewes Answer to Ca^di^^l perron's Reply. page 3^ 38.
says our learned Bishop of Winchester.

Neither can the Cardi^all allege any reason, why if the Saints may be prayed
unto, they may not be so, as well by the Priest as by the people; as well at
M^sse, as at Mattines; as well in the body of the Church, as at the Altar?

A^ for their new distinction, of Sacrificall and unsacrificall Invocation, and
their conceit, that the Sacrifice is Offered unto God the Father alone, it is
(says the same Lea^n^d Bishop) B^^l^. And^ewes ibid.
refuted by the Canon it self of the Mass: the concl^sion whereof, M^nuale
Eccle^. Sali^bar. ibid.
is Placeat tibi sancta T^i^i^as obs^q^ium servitut^s meae, etc. So that that
the Sacrifice is offer^d ^o the whole Trinity. Besides there are diverse
Coll^ct^ more^ directed unto Christ himself, and ^^l of them said, Dum
assistitur Altari.

Now in case that any upon consideration of their own^ unworthin^sse, and Gods
dreadful Majesty, should se^k^ to Go^ b^ mediation of others; Saint
C^rysostom^ of all the F^^he^s is most plentiful in refuting this course of
Int^^cession by others. When thou have need to sue unto men (says he) (...).
(...) Sermon. 7. de (...) tom. 6. Edit. S^vil p^g ^02.
thou art forced first to deal wit^ door keepers, an^ Po^ters, and to entreat
Parasites and Flatt^rers, and to go a long way about. But with God there is no
such matter; he is entreated without a^ Intercesson: it suffices only that
thou cry in thine heart and bring tears with thee; and entering in straightway
thou may draw him unto thee.

And for example hereof, he sets before us the woman of Canaan, She entreated
not James, (says he) (...) Idem in dimissione Chana^^ae tom. 5. Edit. Savil.
p. 190.
she beseeches not John, neither does she come to Pe^er, but brake through the
whole company of them, saying, I have no need of a M^d^atour, but taking
repentance with me for a spoakesman, I come to the fountain it self. For this
cause ^id he d^scend, for this cause did he take flesh, that I might have the
boldness to speak unto him: I have no need of a mediator, have thou mercy
upon me. And whereas some repose such co^fide^ce in the intercession of the
Saints, that they look to receive greater benefits by them, than by their own
p^ayers, he brings in again the w^man of Canaan, and wi^heth us to observe,
(...). Id^m Se^m. in Philip. v. 18. c 1 de profectu Evang. tom. 5. Edi^. Savil
p^g 417.
How when others entreated, he put her back: but when she her self cried out,
pr^ying for the gift, he yielded. Yea, he says farther; that, (...). Id^m in
Acta Apost. c. 16. Homil. 36.
God then does most, when we do not use the entreatie of others: for as a kind
friend then blames he us m^st, as not daring to trust his Love, when we
entreat others to pray unto him for us: thus use we to do with those that
se^ke to us: then we gratify them most, when they come unto us by themselves
and not by others.

speeches Homily wise, Haec (...). dicuntur, non (...). Nobil. Fla^in. not ^^

as in the Pulpit, not Dogmatically, as delivering his judgment.

Reply.
As if a man might not deliver his judgment in the Pulpit; for albeit in
figures and phrases, and manner of handling, there is some d^ff^rence, between
a Preacher before the people, and a R^ade^ before the learned; yet no learned
Go^ly man, such as Chrysostom was, will so advisedly, so vehemently, and often
times as he did, utter any thing in the Pulpit, before the weaker, the truth
whereof he is not able to justify in the Schools before the best learned.

Neither we^e they whom Chrysostom taxed so very laz^e, but rather such as
took more pains than needed; and (as he says) went a long way about, by
se^king to their patrons, mediators, and favorites; whereas he shows them a
nearer may, to wit, to go immediately to the Master of Requests, Christ Jesus.

Objection.
You have produced diverse Fathers against Saintly invocation, and much pressed
Saint Chrysostom's testimony, whereas he makes for us; for Chrysost^me says
Sanctis suppli^^t^^us a^cedit, ut pro se apud Deum interced^nt. Chrysostom.
Homil. 66. ^d popu. Antio^hen.
that the Emperor laying aside all princely state, stood humbly praying unto
the Saints, to be intercessours for him unto God.

Answer.
Bellarmine indeed alleges Bell^r lib. 1. de Sanct. Beatit. cap. 19.
Chrysostom's sixty sixth Homily Ad populum Antiochenum^ and yet the same
Bellarmine, upon better advise, when he is out of the heat of his polemick
controversies, and comes to a pacifick Treatise of the Writings of the Fathers;
then he tells us, ^x Homi^ijs ad pop An^io^he^ viginti and una tant^^m
^eperiri (...) in antiqu^s (...) Bellar. li. de Script. ^c^les. ^d an. 398.
that Chrysostom made but one and twenty Homilies to the people of Antioch,
and that no more are to be found in the ancient Libraries.

And yet posito, sed non concesso, admit that these words were Ch^ysostome's
indeed, yet they reach not home; for they speak only what the Emperor did de
facto^ not d^ jure: it is only a relation, what he did out of his private
devotion, it is no approbation of the thing done. Now what some one or two
shall do, carried away with their own devout affection, is not straight way a
rule of the Church.

Besides, though the Saints interceded for us, yet it will not hence follow,
that we are to invocate them, having no warrant from God so to do: now in
such a high point of his worship, we must keep us to his command Deu^er.
^2.32.
, and that must guide ou^ devoti^n.

The other places of Chryso^tome alleged by B^llarmine speak of the Saints
living, and not of the Saints deceased.

Lastly, Chrysostom (as has been observed in the point of the E^cha^ist)
speak^s oftentimes rather out of his rhetorick^, than out of his divinity.
Sixtus Senensis delivers this observation concerning the Fathers, and he
names Chrysostom, Non sunt Concionatorum verba semper eo rig^re accipienda;
multa enim D^clamato^es per Hyperbolen enunciant Hoc inte^dum Chrysostomo
^ontingit. Sixth. Senens. Biblio. lib. 6. annot. 152.
That in their sermons we may not take their words strict^y, and in rigor,
because they many times break out into declamations, and declare and repeat
matters, by Hyperboles, and other figurative speeches. In a word, whatsoever
Chrysostom report of others, himself (as we have heard) was all for our
immediate address of our Prayers unto God.

Objection.
Bellarmine says, Theodoretus in Historia Sanctorum patrum, singulas vitas ita
concludit; ego autem huic narrationi finem imponens, rogo and quaeso ut per
horum intercessionem divinum consequar auxilium. Bellar. li. 1 de Sanct. Beat.
c. 19.
that Theodoret shuts up the story of the Father^ lives in these terms: My
suit and request is, that by the Prayers and intercession of the Saints, I may
find divine assistance.

And the same Bellarmine says, Multa it^m habet de Invocatione Sanctorum lib.
8. ad Graecos. Bellar. quo sup^a.
that Theodoret in his book of the Greeks has much touching Prayer to Saints.

Answer.
Theodoret says only, Rogo and quaeso, I beseech and entreat, not th^s, nor
that Sa^nt, but God alone: to this end and purp^se, that by their intercession
and prayers, I may have assi^^ance.

Now to the book de curandis Graecorum affectibus questioned, whether i^ be
Rob. Coci Censur^ Patrum. page 195.
Theodoret's, or no; we oppose that which is Theodoret's out of question; upon
the second and third Chapters to the Colossians, where he exp^essely says
(and that by the au^hority of the Council of Laodicea) Angels are not to be
prayed to, and if not Angels, then not Saints and Ma^tyrs.

Objection.
Saint Austine says, Injuri^ est en^^ pro (...) 17. de ve^b. Apost li.
It is injury to pray for a Martyr, by whose prayers we on the other side
ought to be recommended.

Answer.
This place is not to the pu^pose, for he says only that the Saints pray for
us, which thing we have never denied. We do out of Godly conside^ations
presume, that albeit they know not the necessity of particular men, yet they
pray for the Church in general. But that we should for this cause invocate
them, or yield them any religious service, S. Austine does not avouch.

The other testimonies alleged by Bella^mine, out of Saint Austine, are all
for Martyrs, and not for Saints; now in Saint Aust^nes opinion, the Martyrs had
an esp^ciall privilege above other Saints.

Besides they might well have spared the alleging of Saint Austine, Theodoret
Chrysostom, Prudentius, Saint Ambrose, Origin, Irenaeus, and othe^s, in proof
of Sai^tly invocation; ina^much as these with diverse others, are by their great
Author Sixt^s Senens. Bibl. San^t. lib. 6. Annot 345. (...) of this ^pinion.
Sixtus Senensis reckoned up amongst them that held the Saints departed did not

Victor Bishop of Vtica, is an Historian; and such are Narratores, relaters of
other men's Acts, not Expositores, of their own opinions; narrations have no
more weight or worth, then have those Authors from whence they proceed.

But Vic^or in this place laying aside the person of an Historian, takes up the
carriage of a Panegyrist merely, as appears by his expostulating with Saint
Peter, and chiding him, which was not really and indeed, but only
Rhetorically, and Figuratively, saying, Why art thou Blessed Saint Peter
silent? Why do not thou above all the rest take care of the Sheep and Lambs
committed unto thee: Now if this were a strain of Rhetoric, why also is not
that his compellation of the Saints Triumphant to assist the Church Millitant,

Fulgentius (a man of worth in his time) would thus part stakes be^wixt Christ
Jesus and the Virgin Mary, in that great work of our Redemption? Surely, this
is some coun^erfeit going under the name of Fulgentius. And so I find, that

The Fathers in the Chalcedon Council said, Flavianus Martyr pro nobis oret.
Council. Chalced. act. 11.
Let the Martyr Flavianus pray for us.

Answer.
Flavianus, a Catholic Bishop was murdered for an Heretic by the Ephesin
Latrocinie, and Dioscarus his Faction; the worthy Council of Chalcedon loosed
him after his death, and honored him as a Saint and Martyr: insomuch that upon
the mention of his name, the Fathers there assembled made this joint
acclamation, Flavianus lives after his death: Let the Martyr pray for us. Now
this was votum, non invocatio, a wish, and no direct invocation. Or if they
will read it, Martyr pro nobis orat, the Martyr prays for us, to wit, in
geneall, we do not deny it, nor does it help their cause.

By this we see what to think of the thirty Fathers Greek and Latin, mustered
up by Bellarmine for proof of Saintly invocation; they may (as learned
Winchester observes) 1. Vere Patres, sed non vere citantur.

2. Vere citantur, sed sidei suspect^e.

be put into three ranks; some of them being indeed true Fathers, but not
truly alleged: others truly alleged, but they be not homines legales,
good men and true Fathers, but counterfeits, bearing their names: others be
true Fathers, and truly alleged, but they speak not ad rem, to the point in
question.

To come to particulars; there be seven of the thirty, who lived after the
first five hundred years, Post-nat^.

G^egory the first, Gregory of Turon, Bid, Anselme, Bernard, Damascen,
Theophylact.


so that they are later, and Post-nati unto Primitive antiquity, being out of
the verge of the limited time, and out of the compass of the Churches purity;
Damascen living about the year seven hundred and thirty, and Theophylact
surviving William the Conqueror, some of them also be partial, as speaking to
the point when it got some footing in the Church.

There be others to the number of eight, Suspect^e Fidei.

Ign^tius, Cornelius Papa, Athanas. de S. Deipara, Ephraem de laud Mariae,
Nazianzen upon Cyprian, Cyril's Catechism, Chrisos^ome's 66. Homily ad popul.
A^tioch, Tulgen. de laud B. Mari^.


who have put on the visour of antiquity, and would seem ancient, but are
justly suspected to be rank counte^feits; and men of yesterday in comparison.

Two or three of the Greek Fathers are wrong cited, by a false writ, and a
corrupt translation.

There be seven other of the witn^sses, Non vere citati.

^asil in ^rat in 40. Martyr. Eus^bius de praep. Evang.


who speak not positively as Divines, but like Poets, Panegyrists, and
Orators, with Figures, Apostr^phe's, and Prosopopeiae's in a Poetical vein,
and Rhetorical streine; Rhetoricantur Paties.

Nazian^ere, Hie^ome. S. Maxi^us, Nyssen.


of this rank is Nazianzen's Respice de caelo; Hierome's Vale ^ Paula;
Maximus, his Itaque o splendida virgo; Nyssen, his comp^llation to Theodore the
Martyr, Coge chorum Martyrum; Saint Victor, Victor, Paulinus, Prudenti^s.
his adestote Angeli, and Paulinus and Prudent^us with their Poetry.

The other six tha^ remain^ upon record, speak not to the point: Patres ve^^
citati, sed nihil ad rem.
they t^ll us indeed of the Saints inte^ceding for us, to wit, in gen^rall; but
this inferre^h not our invocation of them.

They tell us also of some private men's opinion, and the pract^ce of so^^e few;
but this does not warrant it to have been the doctrine and practice of the
Church.

Of Ius^ification by Faith.
Al^hough Faith only justify, yet is not Faith alone, or solitary in the
person justified; even as the eye though it only see, yet it is not alone in
the body, but joined with the rest of the members; in like sort, Faith and
Charity where they are not both jointly together, there (as Leo says) Vbi non
simul fuerint, simul d^sunt. Leo S^rm. 7. de Qu^d^^ges.
they are both wanting.

Saint Augustine says, Sola Fides Christi mund^t August. in Psalm. ^^ tom. 8.
-- praecogn^tis, quod non fuerant credituri in Fide, qu^ (...) a p^catorum
obligattone liberari.
That Faith only purifieth the ^eart.

Saint Chysostome often uses the self same Chrysostom in cap. 4. ad R^m. tom. 4
and de side and l^g^ nature. tom. 3.
form of spe^ch, to wit, that Faith only justifies.

Saint Augustine says, Ipse ergo p^^^atum ut (...) in ipso; (...) non suum,

He is sin, and we are justice; not our own, but Gods; not in our selves,
but in him; as he is sin, not his own, but ours; not in himself, but in us:
so are we made the ju^tice of God in him, as he is sin in us; to wit, by
Imputation.

In the way o^ Faith, they are reckoned for no sinners (and therefore are
^eputed Just) who have not their sins imputed to them.

This f^ee remissi^n of sins he elsewhere notably describes, saying, Si texit
(...) Deus, n^luit adv^^t^re; si noluit ^dve^^e^e, (...) animadverte^e, (...)
punt^e, noluit (...), malu^t ignoscere Id^ s^p^^ Psalm. 31.
If God has covered our sins, he will not obs^rve them, he will not think
upon them, to punish them, he will ^ot take knowledge, but rat^er pardon t^em.

It i^ cle^re also out of Saint Austine, that there is such impe^fect on in our
works, as tha^ they cannot justify. All our Righteousness (says he) I^sa
(...) n^stra (...) ^it^, ut (...) remissione^o st^t (...) per^e^^ (...)
virtutu^^ Id tom 5 de civit. Dei. li. 19. cap. 27.
stands rather in the remission of our sins, than in any perfection of
justice; and again, V^e et^am laudabil^ vitae hominum, si r^mot^ misericordi^
discutia^ eam Id. tom. 1. confess. lib. 9. cap 13.
Woe be to the commendablest life we lead (says he) if thou Lord setting thy
mercy aside, shoul^st ^xamine it; but this is our comfort, God deals
graciously with us, accepting our willing desires, in sted of the work done,
as Saint Paul says, 2 Cor. 8.12. and accordingly Saint Austine says, Omnia
mandata (...) deputantur, quando qu^^q^id non fit ignos^^tu^. Id. to. 1.
Retract. lib. 1. cap 19.
All the commandments of God are then esteemed to be done, when as that is
forgiven, whatsoever is not done.

Of Merit.
Concerning Merits, or the dignity of good works equal to the Reward, Saint
Paul is against it, saying; Ro^. 8.18.
That the suff^rings (Martyrdomes) of this present time are not worthy to be
compared to the glory that shall b^e revealed in us; and both Hierome ^ieron
super Ephesians. 2. tom. 9.
and Chrysostom C^rysost. oper. imperfect in Math Homil 53.
allege this place against Merit. Leo says, N^que enim de quali(...) um
^perum (...) Leo ^erm ^ de Assump. (...) Id. sermon ^ de Pass. Dom.
The measure of celestial gifts depends not upon the quality of works. Saint
Au^tine says, No^ pro merito quidem (...) ^itam ae^ern^m sed ta^tum pro grat^^
(...) ^oan. tract. 3. tom. 9
Thou shall not receive eternal life for thy merit, but only for grace. And
they speak reason; for he that would merit or deserve any thing at another
man's hand, must of himself (...) Hil^r de T^init lib. 11.
by his own power, do something, that the other had no former claim unto:
now our good works, inasmuch as they are good, are God^ fr^e gifts. We are
not sufficient to think any thing that is good. 2 Cor. 3.5. It is God that
works in us both the will and the deed Philip. 2.1. And Man stands bound to
God, either in strict terms of law, or by way of gratitude, as his creature,
servant, and son, to do him the uttermost of his service.

My good deeds (says Austin) (...). Aug. (...). lib 10. cap. 4. ^om 1.
are thy ordinances, and thy gifts; my evil ones^ are my sins, and thy
judgments. Theodoret says, (...) and (...) non mer^^dem sed glor^am vocavit
(...) quae expectantur. Theod. in Romans 8. tom 2 Gentiano Herveto interpret.
The Crowns do excel the Fights, the rewards are not to be compar^d with the
labors; for the labor is small and the gain great that is hoped for; and
therefore the Apostle called those things that are looked for, not wages, but
glory (Romans 8.18.) not wages, but grace (Romans 6.23.) The same Theodoret says,
Temporalibus labo^^^us ^terna i^ aequilibrio ^on respondent. Id. ^n Romans 6.
verse. ul^.
That things eternal do not answer tempor^ll labors in equal poyze.

Saint Hierome says, Si nostra considerem^s merita desperandum est. Hieron.
lib 17 ^n Isai. cap. 64. to. 5.

Nullum opus dignum Dei justitia reperietur. Idem lib. 6. in Esai. cap. 13.


If we consider our own merits, we must despair: And again, When the day of
judgment or death shall come, all hands shall fail, because no work shall
be found worthy of the justice of God.

Saint Chrysostom speaks very pathetically, Chrysostom. tom. 5. de Compunct. Cord.
ad Stelech. post ^ed^ in Lat. editione.

(...). Chrysostom. de Compunct. Cord. ad Stelechum. tom. 6. edit. Savil. page
157.


Etsi millies moriamur, Although (says he) we die a thousand deaths,
although we did perform all virtuous actions, yet should we come short by
far of rendering any thing worthy of those honors which are conferred upon us
by God.

Indeed the Lord rewards good works, but this is out of his bounty, free
favor, and grace, and not as of desert. Romans 4.4.

In giving the Crown of Immortality as our reward, God crowns not our
merits, but his own gifts; and, when God crowns our merits (that is, good
deeds) he crowns nothing else but his own gifts, says Qu^d ergo praemium
^mmorlit it is poste^ (...), coronat dona sua, non merita tu^. August. in Joan.
tract. 3. tom. 9.

Cun Deus coronat (...), ni^il aliud (...) quam. M^nera sua Id. epist. 105.
tom. 2.


Saint Augustine. So that God indeed is become our debtour, not by our
deserving^ but by his own gracious promise.

God is faithful, who has made himself our debtour, (says Austin) Fidelis
Deus qui se postrum debitorem fecit; ^on aliquid a nobis accipiendo, sed tanta
nobis promitendo quicquid promisit, indigmis promisit. Id tom. 3. in Psalm. 100.
not by receiving any thing from us, but by promising so great things to us:
whatsoever he promised, he promised to them that were unworthy. In a word,
though he give heaven propter promissum, for his promise sake, and because he
will be as good as his word, yet it is not propter commissum, for any
performance of ours.

This was the doctrine of old, but the Rhemists have taken out a new lesson,
saying Rhemists Annot. upon Hebr. 6. sect. 4.
That good works are meritorious, and the very cause of salvation; so far,
that God should be unjust, if he rendered not heaven for the same.

Now by this that has been alleged, the Reader may perceive, that besides
diverse other worthies of these times, S. Augustine the honor of this Age,
agrees with us in diverse weighty points of religion, as also in the matter of
Gods free grace and justification, insomuch as Sixtus Senensis says, D.
Augustinus dum toto spiritus ac verbo^u^ ardore pro defensione Divinae gratiae
pugnat advers. Pe^agianos, liberum arbitriu^ cum (...) divinae gratiae
ex^oll^ntes, in altera^ quasi ^oveam delabi vid^tur minusque interdum tribuere
qua^ par sit liber^ hominis volu^tati Sixth Senens. in Bibl. Sancta lib. 5. in
prae^at.
Whilst Saint Austin does contend earnestly against the Pelagians, for the
defense of divine grace, he does seem to fall into another pit, and sometimes
attributes too little to Free Will.

And Stapleton says, Vtcunque in hac disputatione modum fortasse excesser^t
Augustinus Stapleton. de Iustificat. lib. 2. cap. ult.
that Austin (happily) in his disputation against the Pelagians, went beyond all
go^d measure.

PA.
Saint Austin prayed for the dead, to wit, for his mother Monica, desiring God
not to enter into judgment with her.

PRO.
What though he did so? the Examples of Christians (which sometimes slip into
superstition) are no rule for to ord^r our life, or devotion thereby.

Besides, if he prayed for eternal rest, and remission of sins to his
deceased mother, this was not for that he doubted she enjoyed them not, or
that he feared she endured any Purgatory pains; but he sued for the
continuation, accomplishment, and manifestation thereof at the general
resurrection. Yea, even then when he prayed so, he says, Et credo jam
feceris, quod te rogo. Aug. Confess. lib. 9. cap. 13. tom. 1.
he believes that the Lord had granted his request, to wit, that his mother
was out of pain, and that God had forgiven her her sins: Which argues, that
it was rather a wish, than a Prayer, proceeding more out of affection to her,
than any necessity to help her by his Prayers, who was then (as he persuaded
himself) in a blessed estate: so that howsoever Saint Austin at first made a
kind of prayer for his mother, yet a little after (as it were repressing
himself) he says, he believes that she is in a blessed state.

The Letters of Charles the great unto our Off a King of Mercia, are yet
extant; wherein he wishes, Deprecantes ut pro ^^ interaedi jubea^i^, nullam
habentes dubitationem, beatam illius anima^ in requ^e esse; sed u^ fidem and
delectionem nostram ostendamus in amicum charissimum. Carol. Magnus apud
Guliel. Malmesbu. d^ gest. Reg. Anglor. L 1. c. 4.
That intercessions should be made for Pope Adrian then lately deceased; not
having any doubt at all (says he) but that his blessed soul is at rest, but
that we may show our faithfulness and love to our most dear friend.

In a word, Saint Austin's prayer was not (as Popish prayers now a days are
made) with reference to Purgatory; and therefore it makes nothing against us.

PAP.
Did not Saint Austine hold Purgatory?

PRO.
That some such thing should be after this life, it is not (says he) Tale
aliq^id etiam post h^n^ vitam (...), incredibile non est (...) ut ^^m ita sit
(...), ^t aut taveniri aut la^cre. Aug. in En^hi^id. cap. ^^ tom. 3.
incred^ble, and whether it be so it may be i^quired, and either be found, or
remain hidden. In another place he leaves it uncertain, Siv^ ib^ tan^um,

16. tom. 4.
Whether only in this life men suffer, or whether there follow some such
temporal judgments after this life, so that Saint Austine says, it is not
incredible, and it may be disputed whether it be so, and perhaps it is so:
words of doubting, and not of asleveration, but in other places he gives such
reasons as overthrow it. Tertium penitus ignorantus, im^^ nec esse in
Scriptures Sanctis invenimus. Aug. Hypog. l. 5. to 7
The Catholic Faith (says he) resting upon divine authority, believes the
first place, the kingdom of heaven, and the second hell, a third we are
wholly ignorant of; yea we shall find in the Scriptures that it is not.
Neither speaks he only of places eternal that are to continue for ever;
besides, he there purposely disputes against Limbus Pucrorum, and rejects all
temporary places, not acknowledging any other third place, and elsewhere he
says, Nec est ullus ulli medius locus, ut p^ss^t esse nisi cum D^^bolo qui non
(...) cum ^hri^to. Aug de (...) mer^^ and ^^miss. ^. 1. c. 28. Habent gaudium
(...) and m^l^ to m^ntum Id. in Joan. ^ract 49. tom. 9.
There is no middle place, he must needs be with the devil, that is not
with Christ; and again, In (...) e^um quemque (...), in hoc cum com^rehendet
mundi nov^ssimus d^es Id epist. ^0.
Where every man's own last day finds him, therein the world's last day w^ll
hold him. Thus far Saint Austine according to the Scriptures, which
acknowledges but two sorts of people, Children of the kingdom, and children of
the wicked; faithful and unfaithful, M^th. 13.38. And accordingly two places
after this life, Heaven and Hell, Luke 16.23. Mark. 16.16. Neither does the
Scripture any where mention any temporary fire after this life; the fire it
speaks of, is everlasting and unquenchable, M^t. 18 8^ and 3.12.
and so does Austine take it; Non da^o quod non (...); ignem (...) 8. Aug. in
Psalm. 80
and as for that fi^e which Saint Paul mentions, 1 Cor 3.15.
It is not a Purgatory, but a Probatorie fire.

PA.
Master Brerely has set forth Saint Austines Religion, agreeble to ours.

PRO.
The Learned on our side have confuted him; See Saint Austins Sums by M^
Cromp^on.
and have prooved out of Saint Austines undoubted writings, that he agreed with
the Church of England in the maine points of Faith and Doctrine.

And so I come from Fathers, to Councels, and first to the sixth African
Council, held at Carthage, and another at Milevis; both which denied Appeals
to Rome. Now the case was this; Apiarius a Priest of Africa, was for his
scandalous life excommunicated Ap^a^ium, loci is^ius Episcopus, quampiam ob
causam a c^^tu ^idelium exclusit, ^und^mque Synodus exauctoravit, q^em Sozimus
Papa ad se conjugtentem, causamque ibi probant^m absolvit, and cum literis ad
Synodum ^em^ssum recipi imperavit. Binnius in Council African sextum tom. 3
council O^cum. 8. act. 6. p. 867. edit. Colon. 1606.
by Urban his Dioc^san, and by an African Synod: Apiarius thus censured, fled
to Pope Zozimus, who restored him to his place, and absolved him, and this he
did, pretending that some Canon of the Nicen Council had established Appeals
from other places to Rome: the Bishops of Africa, not yielding too hasty
credit to this allegation, debated the matter with Pope Zozimus and his
successors, Boniface and Celestine for the space of four or five years
together, at length, In Co^cilijs verioribus qu^e accip^u^tur Nic^^na^a S.
Cyril. Alexan. Ecclsiae et ^ venerabili Attico Consta^tinopol. Antistite miss^^
-- in quibus tale aliquid non potuimus r^p^^^re. Binn. in Conc. Charth. 6. c.

-- in nullo Codice Graeco ea potu^mus inv^ni^e. Id. Ibid. cap. 101 page 64^
col. 2.
when the true and authentical copies of the Nicen Council were searched by
Cyril Patriarch of Alexandria, and Atticus Bishop of Constantinople, and that
neither in the Greek nor Latin copies, this Canon touching Appeals to Rome
could be found; then the African Bishops told the Pope that he should not
meddle with the causes of men in their Province, nor receive any such to
Communion as they had excommunicated. For the Council of Nice, (say they)
Decreta Nic^^na prudentiss^me justiss^m^que p^oviderunt, quaecu^que negotia in
suis locis, ubi o^ta sunt, ^inienda. Id. Ibid. ca. 105. page 646.
Did consider wisely and uprightly that all matters ought to be determined in
the places in which they began. Chiefly since it is lawful for any, if he like
not the sentence of his Judges, to appeal to the Synods of his own province,
yea, or farther also to a general Synod: to wit, of the Dioces By [Vnive^sall]
is meant a Synod of the Diocese and not of the whole World. Conc. Constan^inop.

who will imagine that God would inspire the trial of right into one man, and
deny it to a great number of Bishops assembled in a Synod: and so going
forward with proof, that the Pope ought not to judge their causes, either at
Rome himself, or by his Legates sent from Rome; they touched his attempt in
modest sort, but at the quick, Condemning it of pride, and smoakie
stateliness of the world.

Reply.
It may be (says Master Brerely) Pro^ Apology, tract. 1. sect. 7 subd. 2.
that the Arrian Heretics had corrupted the Nicen Council, and therefore this
Canon which the Pope alleged could not be found there.

Answer.
Had this pr^t^nded Canon made ought against Christ's Divin^tie, we might have
suspected the Arrians to have corrupted it, if they could; but this concerned
the Pop^s ju^isd^ction in matter of Appeal, and trench'd not upon the Ar^ians
tenet.

Reply.
Perhaps, the Pope when he alleged the Nicen Council, meant the Sardican
Council, Bellar li 2 de R^m. (...). 25 and (...) quo supra.
wherein it was decreed, That they in Af^icke might appeal to Rome.

Answer.
The African Fathers say, In null^ in^enimus p^trum Synodo. Con^. Carthag. cap.
^05.
They could not meet with this pr^tend^d Canon in any Synodall of the Fathers,
and therefore neither in the Nice^ nor Sardican Council, nor any other that
could bind the whole Church. Besides, Saint Austin who was a principal actour
in these African Counsels, and subscribed to them Subs^ripserunt Ali^i^^
Au^ust^^us et ^aeteri Epi^copi 217. Council. Ca^thagin. ca 101.
, he was not ignorant of the Catholic Sardican Council; for as Binius
observes, Hoc concilium O^cume (...) ab A^gustino epist 162. plenarium

S Austin in his 162 Epistle calls it a plenary or full Council of the whole
Church; neither indeed could S. Austin be ignorant thereof, inasmch as he rea^
diligently the acts and decrees of every Council, and search^d all Registries,
by reason of the many conflicts he had with Heretics, says Baronius Omnia
^portuit Concilia (...) Baron. ad an. 347 (...). 74.
. Neither could the Afric^n Bishops b^e possibly ignorant of this Sardican
Council, inasmuch as some thirty six of them were present at it, (...) 2 p^g.

was yet within their memory, being held (...) 3^7. B^ron ^od. ann^ nu^ 1. (...)

little above fourscore years before this African Council: neither could they
be ignorant of the Decrees of that Council, inasmuch as they were wont to
bring a Copy of such Decrees as were agreed upon in general Counsels, as
themselves say, Conc. Carth. 6. ca. ^.
that Caecillianus brought with him the Decrees enacted at Nice, at which he
was present. Now if they knew this Sardican Council, and the Decrees thereof,
and yet knew no such Decree therein for Appealing from Afric to Rome, it
follows that the Pop^s preten^ed Canon for Appeals was no Canon of the holy
Sardican Council, and is therefore justly suspected to be forged by some of
the Popes Factours, who would gladly have brought all the G^iest to his Mill,
and the maine Suits of Christendom unto his Court and Consistory.

Reply.
Bellarmine says, Bellar. lib. 2^ de Romans Pont. cap. 24.
that the Decree forbad only the Priests, and inferior sort of the Clergy
to appeal to Rome, but not the Bishops.

Answer.
This is an idle allegation; for the African Bishops provided for the
conveniencie of their Priests and Clergy, to hinder them from vexatious
cou^se^, and wastfull expenses in the point of Appeal, by saving them from
unnecessary travailes beyond the Sea; and therefore they intended much more,
that they themselves should b^e freed.

Besides, the Decree runs generally, and forbids all sorts of Apellants, from
Afric to Rome, as well Bishops as others: the tenor of the decree is this:
Quod si ab eis (id ^st Epis^opis vi^ini) provo^a^dum put^verint, non provocent
nisi ad Africana Con^^^ia, and ad Primates pro^inci^rum s^^rum, a^ t^ansmarina
autem qui put^verit appelland^^, ^ nullo (...) ^^ricam in Communione (...).
Con^il. (...) page (...) pa. 6^3.


It was thought good, that Priests, Deacons or other inferior Clerks, if in
their causes they complain of the judgments of their Bishops, and if they
Appeal from them, they shall not Appeal but to the African Councels, or to
the Primates of their Povinces; but if any shall think that he ought to
Ap^peale beyond the Sea (meaning to Rome) let him not be received any longer
into the Communion of the Church of Afric.

Binnius tells us, In hoc concilio, non jus appeland^ ad Sedem Apostolicam sed
tantum modu^ p^osequend^ appellationis per Legatos a Latere, controve^sum
^uis^e, a^t Binnius in Con^. C^rch^g. 6. ^om. 1. page 619.
that the question was not about the right of Appealing to the Sea of Rome, but
de modo, touching the manner of the Popes admitting Appeals, of prosecuting
and deciding complaints by his Legates, a latere; but the decree forbids
Appeals from Afric to Rome, and condemns not only the manner, but the
matter it self.

Objection.
You say Saint Austine opposed the Pope; but he was in good savor with
Bonifacio (...) Bellar. (...) Pont cap. 25. (...) Augustinus.
Zozimus, Boniface, and Celestine.

Answer.
Saint Austine kept good terms with the Bishops of Rome, Augustini ^pist. 90.
ad Boni^ac Papam.
and he had reason for it; because they were great Patriarchs, and he had
occasion to use their help and countenance, for quelling the Pelagian
Heretics and others; and yet notwithstanding when their factors began to
usurp jurisdiction over other Churches, then he might stand for the right of
his African Churches, and give his vote freely in the Council.

And thus we have found opposition made to the Sea of Rome by a whole national
Council, in the weighty point of Appeals; for so Bellarmine makes appealing to
Rome, and not Appealing from thence, a maine proof of the Popes supremacy.
Appellatio est certissunum Argumentum prin^^p^tus Bell. li 2. de Rom Po^t. cap.

Now to proceed, about the year four hundred thirty and one, was the third
general Council held at Ephesus, against the Nestorian heresy which divided
Christ into two persons; it was summoned, not by the Pope but by the Emperor
Theodosius the younger, At his beck, and by his command. (...)^ authorit^tate
ac nutu Theolos^^ cogeb^tur. E^agr. hist. lib. 1 cap. 3.


In the year four hundred fifty and one, the fourth general Council was
held at Chalcedon, against Eutyches, (who in opposition to Nestorius)
confounded the natures of Christ, making of two distinct natures, his humane
and divine, but one nature; whereas Nestorius rent is ^under his person, making
two of one; this Council was called not by the Pope, Sacerdotes Chal^edon^m
venerunt ^uxta nostra prae^epta. Council. Chale. apud B^n. tom. 2. act. 3. page
84.
but by the Emperors Edict: it was first called at Nice and then recalled from
thence, and removed to Chalcedon, wholly by the disposing of the Emperor; yea,
Leo Bishop of Rome, wrote to the Emperor instantly beseeching him, to call it
in Italy: all the Priests (says he) Omnes mansuetud^ne^ vestram cum gemitibus
and lac^rimis supplicant Sacerdotes g^neral^m Synodum jubeatis intra Italiam
celebrari. Leo Epist. 23.
do beseech your clemency with sighs and tears, that you would command a
general Council to be celebrated in Italy. But their request was denied; it
was held at Chalcedon for the ease of the Bishops of Asia: Leo could not have
it where he would, but where and when the Emperor appointed; and Leo was glad
to send his deputies thither.

Reply.
The Emperors summoned Councels, but by the Popes consent. Dico nullum
Concilium generale Catholicum ^ solo Imperatore indictum, id est, sine consensu
and authoritate Rom^ni Ponti^icis. Bell. lib. 1^ de Council. cap. 13. Ad h^c.


Answer.
It is true indeed, that the Popes consent was to these a^cient Counsels, but
no otherwise than as the consent of other chief Bishops; they consented
because they could not choose, because they resolved to be obedient, but they
could not appoint either place, or time.

To proceed; This famous Council of Chalcedon renewed and ratifyed the Canon
of the second General Council held at Constantinople^ and accordingly
(following their example) gave the Bishop of Constantinople equal privileges
with the Bishop of Rome. The tenor of their decree runs thus, (...). Synod
Chalced. act. 16 can 28. pa. 350. in editione ^ilij.
Our fathers have very rightly given the pre-eminence to the Sea of ancient
Rome, because the City was the seat of the Empire; and we moved with the same
reasons have transferred the same pre-eminence to the s^at of New Rome ( that
is to say Constantinople) thinking it reason that the City honored with the
Empire, and with the presence of the Senate, and enjoying the same privileges
as Ancient Rome, being the seat of the Empire, did; and being after it the next
should in matters Ecclesiastical have equal advancement.

Here we see the reason which the Council gives why Rome had the first place,
was not because it was so ordained by Gods law, jure divino Supponi^, quod
Romana seeds tunc primatu^ habere me^uerit, cum Romani or^is imperio potire^tur
atque adeo non divino, sed huma^o jure caput Eccle^inum effecta suerit. Not.
Binn^j in Conc. Chal. act. 15 p^g. 180. tom. 2.
, or in Saint Peter's right; but by the consent and constitutions of men, because
Rome was sometime the imperial seat; and the seat being thence translated to
Constantinople, upon the same reason Constantinople was made equal with Rome.

Reply.
The Popes Legates protested against this A Leg^t^ Ponti^icis ^^^l^matum est.
B^lla^m. lib. 2 de Rom Pon^. cap. 18. (...).
Ca^on you allege.

Answer.

Bell. li 2 de ^oncil. c 11 At (...) lib. ^ tit. 17. de Reg. Iu^^s 160.
That is accounted the act of all, which is publicly done by the greater part,
by the most voices; otherwise there would be no judgment given, because some
perverse ones would still dissent. Now all the Council, save only the Popes
Legates, consented upon the Canon; and they were to be ruled by ^he major part
of the Counsels votes: neither do we find that anciently the Pope had a
negative or casting voice in Councels; and therefore the Chalcedon Council
notwithstanding the Legates opposition, professes, Haec omnes dicimus, haec
om^ibus placent. Con^^l. C^alced. apud Bin. act. 16. page 137. tom. 2.
Hae^ omnes dicimus, this is all our vote, and Tota Synodus, Et ^ota Synodus

Why bu^ the Popes Legat^s approoved it not, Contra^ic^io nos^ra (...). Ibid.

they contradicted it. True, in this particular they dissented. But because
they as al other Bps, even Pope Leo himself, consented un^o that general
Maxim, That the judgment of the greater part shall stand for the judgment of
the whole Councell^ in that general both the Legates of Leo, and Leo himself,
did implicit, and virtually consent to that very Canon, from which actually
and explicit they did then dissent. For which cause, the most prudent Judges
truly said, Tota Synodus, the who^e Council has approved this Canon; either
explicit or implicit, either expressly or virtually approved it. Yea the
whole Council professed the same, and that even in the Synodall relation of
their Acts to Pope Leo, saying: We have confirmed the Canon of the second
Council for the honor of the Sea of Constantinople; declaring evidently that
Act of approving that Canon to be the Act of the whole Synod, although they
knew the Pope and his Legates contradicted it, as my learned kinsman Doctor
Crakanthorpe has well observed. Doctor Crakanthorp of the fifth general
Council. chap 18. sect. 29.


In a word, what though the Popes Legates were absent at the making of this
Act, because they would not be present, and when they were present disclaimed
it? the major part of the Synodall voices carried it; and so the Decree passed,
and was afterward confirmed by the sixth General Council.

Reply.
The Canon which equalleth the Patriarch of Constantinople to the Bishop of
Rome makes not against us, since it was not confirmed by the Pope, who only
confirmed such Leo scribit, se Concilium illud app^obasse solum quantum ad

Canons as concerned matters of Faith. Now Counsels are not of force till the
Pope ratify them. Conciliorum Iudicium tum demum firmum est cum accesserit
Romani Pontificis confirmatio. Id. ibid. lib. 4. cap. 1.. Sed.


Answer.
By this reason you will make the Popes supremacy no Article of Faith; And
what though Leo opposed the Canon, yet as Cardinal Cusanus says, Sed ita usus
obtinuit longo tempore. Cusan. conco^d. Cathol. li. 1. ca. 16.
Use and custom carried it against the Pope.

Besides, a Council may be approved, though the Pope approve it not; and so was
the second general Council called against the Macedonian Heretics and others;
it was held by the Catholic Church a lawful general Council, though none of
the Popes before Gregory's time approved it, for Gregory speaking of the
Canons of that Council, says, Et Canones quidem Constantinopolitani Concilij
Eudoxianos damnant; sed quis fuerit eorum author Eud^xius, minime dicunt.
Romana autem ecclesia ^osdem Canones vel gesta Synodi illius hactenus non
habet, nec accipit; in hoc autem eandem Synodum accepit, quod est per eam
contra Macedonium definitum. Greg. Epist. l. 6 indict. 15. epist. 31.
Eosdem Canones, vel gesta Synodi illius, hactenus non habet, nec accipit, the
Roman Church neither has, nor approves those Canons or Acts; so that the
Roman Church, until Gregory's time, neither approved the Canons nor Acts of
that second general Council. And that is it, which Gregory intends, saying,
hastenus non habet nec accipit, not meaning that till the year wherein he writ
that Epis^le; for himself before professed, Et (...) Synod^s (...) Id ^p l^b 2
^^dict. 1^. (...).
to embrace that second Council a^ one of the four Evangelists: but until
Gregory's time, hactenus, until this age, wherein I live, was the second
Council, the Canons or Acts thereof, not ha^ nor approved by the Roman Church;
and yet all this time, it was held an approved Synod; as the same D.
Crakanthorpe has observed. Dr. (...) of (...) 18. (...) 2^.


Question.
Had not the Bishop of Rome the priority?

Answer.
He ha^ a priority of Order, Honor, or Place before others; but not of
Jurisdiction over and above others; but even as Ambassadors take place one of
another, yet have no dominion one over another.

Question.
Was not Rome highly esteemed of old?

Answer.
Old Rome was highly esteemed. First, because the^e the Apostles taught, and
Rome professed the true Faith, and diverse of her Bishops were Martyrs.

Secondly, because Rome was sometime the chief seat of the Empire, and so the
chief City had a chief Bishop.

Thirdly, because the Eastern or Greek Church was often at odds, the
dissension; therefore such as were distressed had their recou^se for Council
and help, to the Patriarch of the West, the Bishop of Rome, an^ this made him
much r^spected; and her bishops with^ll being Godly men, and in good favor
with the Empe^ou^s, they often times ^elieved such as were distressed: thus
Iul^us bishop of Rome helped the banished Athanasius: for these, and the like
respects the Fathers sp^ke reve^ently of Rome, as she was in diebus illis, in
their time. But what is this to Rome in her corrup^ es^ate? whil^s the Pope
challenges to himself infalibility of judgment, and not content with the
primacie which his ancestors held, this Roman Dio^rephes se^kes pre-eminence,
affecting not only an Hierarchy in the Church, but a Monarchy over the whole
Church, as if Saint Peter (whose successor he pretends to be) had h^ld the
Apostolic chair, as it we^e in Fee, for him and his Successors for ever, and
the other eleven had held thei^s for term of life only.

And now to look hom^wa^ds to our Britain: in this Age we find our
au^cestors, besides their common enemies the Scots, Picts, and Saxons, troubled
with another more secret, but as dangerous, to wi^, the Pelagian heresy,
wherewith Pelagius (a Roman Monk, borne in Little Britain) with his Disciple
Celestius, began to infect these Northern parts. But after they, and their
heresies were condemned in the Councels of Carthage and Mela, Pope Celestine
sent Palladius into Scotland, as also our neighbors the French bishops (at the
request of the Catholic English) s^nt Sanctio. Germanus in Britanniam ven^^
and pelagia^am hae^^si^ p^o^^iga^it M^th. Westmon. ad ann. 446.
Germanus bishop of A^xerre, and Lupus bishop of Troys in Champeigne, into
England, to beat down Pelagianisme, which they happily suppressed.

Now also there was a Provincial Council Master Speeds History. lib. 6. cap.
9.
held in Britain, for the reforming of Religion, and repairing of the ruined
Churches, which the Pagan marriage of Vortiger had decayed, to the great gri^fe
of the people. A plain token that their zeal continued ev^n unto those day^s:
for so it was, whiles Vortiger a British Prince married with the fair but
Infidel Rowena, Hengists daughter, this Saxon match had almost undone both
Church and State, whilst (as Beda Histor. Anglor. lib. 1. cap. 15.
Bid complains) Priest's were slain standing at the Altar, and bishops with
their flocks we^e murdered; till at length, they assembled a Council to repair
those decays which this marriage had made.

Now to close up this Age, the Reader may observe that we have surveyed the
first four General Councels, which Gregory the Great Greg. ep l. 2. ind^ct
11 ep. 10. Savino ^ubdi^^o^o. and lib 1. Epistola^. indict. 9. epist 24.
pro^essed that he ^mbraced as the four Gospels: and indeed they were called
against those four Arch-heretickes that pestered the Church: the first was
h^ld at Nice, against Arrius a Pri^st of Al^xandria, who held that Christ was
neither God, nor eternal, but an excellent creature, created before all
creatures. The second at Constantinople, against Macedonius, who held, that
Christ was not of the same essence; not (...), consubstantiall, and of the same
substance, with the Father, but only (...) like to him; and that the Holy
Ghost was not God, but Gods Minister, and a creature not eternal. The third at
Eph^su^ against Nestorius, who held, that Christ had two several persons, but
not two wills; Cum Ecclesia distra^eretur. and pars Mariam (...), Hominiparam,
pars (...) D^iparam nominand^m a^^irmarent, Nestorius, voc^m (...), qu^ Maria
appell^retur, ^xcogitavit. Evage. Histor. Ecclesiast. lib. 1 cap. 7.
and that the Virgin Mary was not to be called (...), the mother of God, but
(...), the Mother of Christ. The fourth at Chalcedon, where Dioscorus, and
Eutyches were condemned. This Eutyches (confuting Nestorius) fell into other
heresies, and confounded the two natures of Christ, making him (after his
union) to have but the divine nature only.

Besides, the Reader may farther observe, that upon the survey of these first
four General Counsels (so much esteemed by S. Gregory) it is found, that
they confined the bishop of Rome to his bounds, with other Patriarchs; and they
equalled other Patriarchall Seas to the Roman: so that hereby is discovered
the vanity of Campian's flourish, saying, Concilia generalia mea sunt; primum,
ultimum m^^ia. ^amp. Rat. 4.
General Counsels are all ours, the first, and the last, and the middle. For
we embrace such General Counsels as were held in those golden Ages, within
the first six hund^ed years, or thereabouts.

The middle rank, beginning at the second Nicene, unto the Council of
Florence, held in the Ages of the mingled and confused Church, they are neither
wholly theirs, nor ours.

The two last, the one at Lateran, the other at Tr^nt, these (being held by the
dross of the Church) are theirs.

AN APPENDIX to the fi^th CENTVRIE.
Of the Fathers Authority.
PAPIST.
YOu have produced the Fathers for these five or six hundred years, as if
they had been of your Faith; whereas you dissent from them, B^lla^^ de notis
Eccles. c^p. 9.
and refuse their trial: but we honor them, and appeal to the joint consent
of An^iquity.

PROTESTANT.
Where we se^me to vary from them, it is eith^r in things humane, arbitrarie
and indifferent, or in matters not fully discussed by the ancient, or in points
which were not delivered by joint consent of the ancient, or in things which
are reproved by plain demonstration of holy Scripture, and wherein the Fathers
permit liberty of dissenting, and the Papists themselves usually take it.
Neither would Saint Austine Neminem velim sic amplec^i mea omnia, ut me
sequatur, nisi in eis quibus me non errare perspexerit. Aug de persever. Sanct.

(the fai^est flower of Antiquity) have his Reader follow him farther than he
follows the Truth, not denying but that as in his manners, so in his writings
many things might justly be Multa ^sse in opusculis meis quae ^ossunt justo
judicio culpari. Id. de orig. anim^ cap. 1. tom. 7.

Neither do we refuse the trial of the Fathers, truly alleged, and rightly
understood, witness the challenge made by Bishop Jewel Master Iew^ls Sermon
at Paul's Cross.
, and seconded by Doctor Whitaker W^itak^r in (...) Rat. 5 Camp.
, and Doctor Featly; yea, Doctor Whitaker T^ti ad nostras parts pervolant. Id.
ibid.
(as Scultetus observes) Patres in maximis judicijs toti sunt nostri, in
le^ioribus varij, in paucissimis ac minutissimis vestri. Scultetus in Medullae
Patr. part 2. c. 15. p. 140.
was confident, That the Fathers, although in some matters they be variable,
and partly theirs, partly ours, yet in the material points they be wholly
ours, and theirs in matters of lesser moment, and some few Tenets. Likewise,
that great light of Oxford Doctor Reinolds, in his Conference with Master Heart,
solemnly protested, Conference with Heart. chap. 8. divis. 6.
that in his opinion not one of all the Fathers was a Papist; for (says he)
The very being and essence of a Papist consists in the opinion of the Popes
supremacy; but the Popes supremacy was not allowed by any of the Fathers, as
he there proves against Heart: not one then of all the Fathers was a Papist.

PA.
May we not ground our Faith upon the Fathers Testimonies?

PRO.
We reverence the ancient Fathers, but still with reservation of the respect
we owe to that Ancient of days, Daniel 7.6. their father and ours, who taught
young Elihu, Job. 32.6. to reprove his Ancients, even holy Job amongst them,
Job 33.12. him alone do we acknowledge for the father of our Faith, on whom
we may safely ground in things that are to be believed. For every Article of
Christian Faith must be grounded on divine revelation Audi dicit Dominus, non
dicit aut Ambrosius, aut Augustinus, sed dicit Dom^nus. August. Epist. 48 tom.
2.
; but all opinions of the Fathers are not divine revelations, neither do the
Fathers challenge to themselves infallibility of judgment. S^int Austine
says, (...) Au^ust. Epist. 19.
This reverence and honor have I learnt to give to those Books of Scripture
only, which are called Canonical, that I most firmly believe none of their
Authors could any whit err in writing: But others I so read, that with how
great sanctity and learning soever they do excel, I therefore think not any
thing to be true, because they s^ thought it; but because they were able to
persuade me, either by those Canonical Authors, or by some prob^ble reason,
that it did not swerve from truth.

Neither do our Adversaries yield inf^llibil^ty of judgment t^ the Fathers;
Baronius says, (...) 34.
The Church does not always, and in all things follow the Fathers
interpretation of Scripture. Bellarmine says (...) c. 12. R^^p^nd^o.
Their writings are no rules of Faith, neither have they authority to bind.
Canus tells us, Reliqui ve^o scriptores inferiores and human^ sunt deficiuntque
interdum, ac monstrum quandoque pariunt. Canus loc. Theol. l. 7. c. 3. nu. 7.
That the ancient Fathers sometime err, and against the ordinary course of
nature bring forth a monster. And it may be some of the well-gifted modern
Doctors may see as far as some of the ancient. Friar Stella, though it be
far from him to condemn the common exposition given by the ancient holy
Doctors, Yet I know full well (says he Been tamen scimus Pygmeos Gigantum
humeri^ impo^itos, plusquam ipsos Gigantes videre. Stella ^narr^t. in Luc. cap.
10. p. 15. to. 2. super illa verba, Consiteor ^ibi Pater.
that Pygmeis being put upon Giants shoulders, do see farther than the Giants
themselves. Neither do we speak this, as if we refused the trial of
Fathers, but partly to bring the matter to a shorter issue, and partly to give
the word of God (the foundation Ephesians. 2.20.
on which we build our faith) it is due; for we do usuall^ produce the Fathers
testimonies, thereby to show our consent with the ancient Church.

PA.
Will you charge the Fathers with error?

PRO.
The Fathers being but men have erred through oversight and affection.

Saint Cyprian, and a whole Council with him ^rred in the point of
Rebaptization, Cyprian in epist. 73. ad Iubian. tom. 1.
whiles through too much hatred of Heretics, they condemned the Baptism of
Heretics as unlawful, and would have them baptized anew.

Origin, Misericordi^r suit O^igines, qui and ipsum Diabolum, atque Angel^s
ejus post graviora pro Meriti^ and diuturniora supplicia, ex illi^ cruciatibus
eruendos, atque sociandos S. Angelis cr^didit. Aug. de Civit Dei lib. 21. cap.
17. tom. 5. and ibid. c. 24. Origin in his book (...), held this opinion.
through too much compassion of the wicked, thought that the Devils themselves
should be saved at length.

Tertullian through spite of the Roman Clergy, revolted to the Montanists,
Hoc etiam Paracletus commendavit. Tertul. de Anima. cap. ult.
and was taken up with their idle Prophecies and revelations.

Diverse of the Fathers were tainted with the error of the Chiliasts, or
Millenaries, Sixth. Senens. Biblioth. lib. 5. annot. 233.
mistaken herein in that they thought that Christians after the Resurrection
should reign a thousand years with Christ upon the earth, and there should
marry wives, beget children, eat, drink, and live in corporal delights;
which error, though flatly repugnant to the Scriptures, (which say Matt^. 22
30. and 1. thessal. 4.17.
that in the Resurrection, they neither marry, nor are given in marriag^, but
are as the Angels in heaven) they fell into; part^y by conf^unding the first,
and second Resurrection, Revel. 20.5. and par^ly, by taking that carnally,
which was mystically meant in the Revelations, Revel. 21.10. and 22.2.

Besides, the Fathers in the exposition of Scripture, do of^entimes differ
each from other, as Sixtus Senensis has observed in his Bibliotheca. lib. 5.

PA.
Though particular Fathers do err in some things; yet the body of them is
^ound; now we are bound to B^lla Pl^ 4. super forma Iuram.
interpret the Scripture according to the joint consent of the Fathers.

PRO.
You have forfeited your bond, for in the division of the ten co^^andements (to
conceal your Idolatry touching Image worship forbidden in the second) you go
against the stream of antiquity, the learned Jews, the Fathers Greek and
Latin, for though Saint Austin, August. quest. 71. in Exo^. tom 4.
in respect of the mystery of the blessed Trinity, placed three commandments
in the first table, and seven in the later, yet there be a dozen of the
Ancients that divide them as we do; namely, the Hebrews, as Philo Philo
Iud^eus in libro de Decalogo.
, and Iosespus show Joseph Antiquit. Iudaic. lib. 3.
; and amongst the Grecians, Gregory Nazianzene Greg. N^zianzen. in Carm. ^5.

, they be of the same mind; where is now your submission to the joint consent
of the Fathers?

In like sort, you hold (...) Trid. (...) 5. (...) orig. and (...) 6. de

that the blessed Virgin was free from all spot of Original sinne^ and yet the
Scripture says, That in Adam all have sinned, Romans 5.12. and your own man
Melchior Canus produces seventeene Fathers to the contrary: Sancti omnes qui
in ejus rei m^moriam inciderunt uno (...) asseverarunt, Betam virginem in
peccato originali concepta^. Mel. Canus loc. Theol. l 7. c. 1.
Sancti omnes, all the holy Fathers, that have mentioned this matter, (uno ore)
with one consent affirm, the blessed Virgin to have been conceived in
Original sin. And yet these be the men that crake of the unanimous consent
of Fathers, that the Fathers are as sure to them, Patr^s tam sunt nostri quam
Gregorius decimus tertius. Camp. rat. 5
as Gregory the thirteenth is a loving Father to his children of the Church.
The truth is, whatsoever they say of the Fathers to dazel the peoples eyes
withal they use them as Merchants do their Counters, sometimes standing for
pence, sometime for pounds, even as they be next and readiest at hand, to make
up their accounts; neither are they farther entertained, then they favor the
keys and authority of the Church, says Duraeus Neque enim Patres censentur,

that if the Fathers teach otherwise than the Church, (namely the Roman Church)
then they be not Fathers, but step-fathers: not Doctors, but Seducers.
Cornelius Mus the Bishop of Bitonto says, Ego^ ut ingenue fatear plus vni

That in points of Faith, he gives more cre^it to the Pope, than to a thousand
Austines, Hieromes, Gregory's; and yet these be the men that cry up the
Fathe^s. Now if the Fathers make so much for them, or they of the Fathers; how
is it that they corrupt the writings of the true Fathers, and devise such
sleights to elude their testimonies? how is it that they are driven to fly to
the bastard treatises of false Fathers going under the name of Abdias, Linus,
Clemens, S. Denis, and the like Knights of the Post, brought in to depose on
their behalf; though others of their own side have cashiered them as
counterfeits? See Doctor James of the Bastardy of fal^e Fathers; and Doctor
Reinolds Conf^rence with Heart Ch^p 8. Divis. 2.
for instance sake; amongst the Popes decretall Epistles, the first of Clemens
written (as is pretended) to James the brother of the Lord, is vouched by
Bellarmine, Bellar. de Rom Pont. lib 2. cap 14.
for proof of the Popes Supremacy; as also by the Rhemists, Rhem. Annot. in
Pet. 1.15.
to prove that Peter promised Saint Clement, that after his departure he would
not cease to pray for him and his flock; now this Clement is pretended to be
the same that lived in the Ap^stles times, and is mentioned by Saint P^al. 4 3
Paul, but it is discovered for a coun^erfeit; for in this Epistle it is said,
that Peter prayed Clemens to write (after his death) this Epistle to James the
brother of the Lord, to comfort him, and Clemens did so; whereas James was dead
long before Peter, Eus^b. hist lib. 2 c. 23. Joseph. antiq. Iud. lib. 20 cap. 8.

Qui tamen [S. Iacobus] octo ante Petrum annos Martyrio vitam sinierat. Cusan.

about an eight years at least, now what a senseless thing is this to write
letters to a dead man, specially knowing him to be dead: and hereupon Cardinal
Cusanus has cast off this Epistle as counterfeit: In deed Turrian the Jesuit
striveth to defend Ostendamusque verissima esse, quae B. Petrum docuisse
Clemens dicit. Fr. Turrian. defens. Canon. and epist. Decretal. lib. 4. cap. 4.
page 306.
this Epistle, but yet he cannot show by what carryer Clement did send the
letters to Saint James. And yet must these be vouched under the reverent names
of Saints Abdias, Saint Linus, Saint Clement, Saint Denis; being not much
unlike (as one in Budaeus compares Quales sunt quae aedi^^^ sacri^ mutulares
statuae pilis aut columnis imponuntur -- patere ^os nihilo utiliores statuis
lapideis esse. Budaeus de Ass. lib. 5 page 277.
some grave pontifician Fathers) to antiques in Churches, which bow and crouch
under vaults and pillars, and seem to bear up the Church, as sometime the
Pope thought he saw the Church of Saint John Latterane totter, and ready to
fall, had not Saint Dominick upheld it with his shoulder The life of Saint
Dominicke.
, whereas these do not bear up the Church, but are borne out by the Church,
and are indeed but puppets.

PA.
Master Wadesworth says, He found the Catholics had far greater and
better armies of evident witnesses than the Protestants.

PRO.
Master Bedel answers Master Wadesworth, Bede^s Letters to Wads^worth page
109. 110
that had it pleased God to have opened his eyes, as he did Elisha's servants,
he might have seen, that there were more on our side than against us. Besides
(as Master Bedel says) the Roman Doctors may bring in whole armies of
witnesses on their side, when they change the question, and prove what no body
denies; as when the question is, whether the Pope have a monarchy over all
Christians, an uncontrollable jurisdiction, and infallibility of judgment,
Bellarm. de Romans Pont. lib. 2 cap 15 and 16. answe^ed by D. Field. lib. 5 cap.
35.36.
Bellarmine alleges a number of Fathers, Greek and Latin, to prove only
that Saint Peter had a primacie of honor and authority, which is far short
of that supremacy which the Popes now claim, and which is the question.

So also to prove the verity of Christ's body and blood in the Lords Supper,
Bellar. de E^char. li. 2. toto.
Bellarmine spends the whole book in citing the Fathers of several Ages. To
what purpose? when the question is not of the truth of the presence, but of the
manner, whether it be to the teeth or belly (which he in a manner denies) or
to the soul and faith of the receiver.

So also Bell^r. de Purgat. lib. 1. cap. 6.
Bellarmine for the proof of Purgatory alleges a number of Fathers (as
Ambrose, Hilarie, Origin, Basil, Lactantius, Jerome) but far from the purpose
of the question, and quite beside their meaning: for they spoke of the fire at
the end of the world (as Sixtus Senensis says Sixth. Senens. Biblio^ lib. 5.
Annot. 171.
) and Bellarmine cites them for the fire of Purgatory before the end.

In like sort, for proof of Saintly invocation, Bellarmine musters up thirty
Fathers, of the Greek and Latin Church Bellar. l. 1. de Sanct. Beat. cap. 19.
; now here is an army of ancients able to fright some untrained soldiers; but
it is but like the army that troubled the Burgundians, Voyans grande qua^tite
de lances debout, si leur sembloit; -- ils trouuerent que s'estoient ^^a^s
chardons. Philip. de Comminees Cronique du Roy loys vnziesme Chapit. xix.
Who lying near to Paris, and looking for the battle, supposed great
Thistles to have been Lances held upright: or like those soldiers mentioned
by Plutarch in the life of Agesilaus, who bombasted, and embossed out their
coats with great quarters, to make them seem big and terrible to the enemy;
but after they were overthrown, and slain in the field, Agesilaus caused them
to be stripped, and bid his soldiers behold their slender and weerish bodies, of
which they stood so much in fear, whiles they looked so big upon their
enemies: the like may be said of Bellarmine's forces, they keep a great
quarter, but when they come to join issue for it, they are soon defeated. For
of the Fathers alleged by Bellarmine, th^re be (as is already shown in the
fifth Age) seven of the thirty, which be no Fathers, but post-nati, punies to
primitive Antiquity.

Eight of them be justly suspected not to be men of that credit, as that
their depositions may be taken.

Two or three of them are wrong cited by a writ of error, being either
ignorantly, or wilfully mis-translated.

Seven others of them speak like Poets, Orators, Panegyrists, not
dogmatically, but figuratively, with rhetorical compellations, expressing
their votes, and desires.

The other six that remain, they speak of Intercession in general, not of
Invocation in pa^ticular, of some few p^oples private practice, but not of the
Chu^ches Office, Agend, or Doctrine generally taught, practiced, and
established.

Besides (as Master Moulin says) M. Moulins waters of Siloe, or Con^utation of
Purgato^^^, Chap. 7. page 324.
among so many Authors as might fill a house, it is an easy matter to find
somewhat to wrest to a man's own advantage, and never to be perceived, because
few men have these books, and of them that have them, few do read them, and
of those that read them, fewest of all do understand them.

But that we may the better conceive the meaning of the testimonies and
allegations of the Fathers, let us observe such cautions as the learned M. And.
Rivet tract. de Pat^um auto^it. c. 11.

Bi^hop M^untague his Treatise of the Invocation of Saints. page 155.

Doctor F^atlyes Disput. with M. M^sk^t page 100


have set down for our help herein.

The Fathers writings be either Dogmaticall, Polemicall, or Popular. Cau^ion.


Caution.
In their Dogmaticall, and Doctrinall, wherein they set down positive Divinity,
they are usually very circumspect: in their Polemickes, and Agonistickes,
earnest and resolute: in their Homilies, and popular discourse, free and plain.

Caution.
In their con^roversall writings, it falls out sometimes, that through heat of
disputation, whiles they oppose one error, they sl^p in^o the opposite; like
one that laboring to make a crooked thing straight, bends it the quite
contrary way: thus Hierome wh^les he affronts such a^ impugn'd virginity,
himself quarrels at lawful Matrimony; otherwise the Fathers in their
Polemiques, whiles they keep themselves close to the question in hand, their
tenets are ever most sound, and direct.

In their Homilies, Caution.
and exhortations to the people, they st^ive to move affections, so that they
run forth into figu^es of Rhetoric, and keep not themselves close to points
of doctrine.

Of this kind of speech, Sixtus Senensis gives a good Rule, to wit, Non sunt
Concionatorum verba semper eo rigore accipienda, multa enim Declamatores per
Hyperbolen ^nunciant, ho^ interdum Chrysostomo contingit. Sixth. S^nens.
Biblioth. lib. 6 Annot. 152.
that Their sayings are not to be urged in the rigor, because that Orator like
they speak Hyperbolically and in excess; and he gives instance in Chysostome,
as well he might; for in the point of the Sacrament, he used such Rhetorical
strains, as has been noted in the fifth Centurie: and Hierome says of
himself, Rhetoricati sumus, ^t in morem De^lamatorum, pau^ulum Ins^mus.
Hieron. advers. Helvid.
I have played the Orator, in manner of a declamation, to wit, by way of
amplification, and exaggeration.

Saint Hierome observes, Ant^quam in Alexad^a quasi Daemonium meridianu Arius
(...) innocenter quaedam and minus cause loquuti sunt. Hieron. in Apolog. 2.
advers. Russinum. page 220.
That before that Southern Devil Arius arose at Alexandria, Caution.
the ancients spoke certain things in simplicity, and not so warily: Saint
Austine makes the like observation touching Pelagius; how that the Fathers,
ante mota certamina Pelagiana, extended the power of Free Will above measure,
having then no cause to fear, there being no Pelagius then risen up in the
world, an enemy of grace, and advancer of nature. Until the Pelagians began
to wrangle, the Fathers (says Saint Austine, Tali qu^stione nullus pul^abatur;
vobis [pelagianis] nondum litigantibus securius loque^atur I^annes
[Chrysostomus.] August. lib. 1. cont. ^u^i^n. c. 6. tom. 7.
and he gives instance in Saint Chrysostom) took less h^ed to their
speeches, to wit, in the point of Original sin, and free will, but after
that the Pelagian heresy arose, it made us, says the same Austine, S^d non
erat ^x^^^tus hanc haeresin [(...)] -- multo vigila^ (...) diligentio e^que
re^^ d^t nos [Pelagius] (...) li 3. de doctr. Christ. c. 33. tom. 3.
Multo vigilantiores, diligentioresque, much more diligent, and vigilant in
scanning of this point. In like sort, the Doctors that lived in the middle
ages, what time Popery was not yet grown to his height, they spoke not so
warily in the point of justification and grace, yet they left not the truth of
God without a witness, 1 Timothy 6.12.

C^u^ion.
We must not take up such customs as were sometim^s used, in the Church, and
make presidents of them, as if they had been warranted by the Church, and the
Fa^hers then living; for the Fathers, being taken up wi^h weightier matters,
winked at other faults, and were driven to bear with what they could not
redress. Saint Austine complains of the superstition of certain Christians,
that in Church yards did kneel before the Tombs of the Martyrs, and before
the painted Histories of their sufferings. Novi multo^ ^sse (...) pulchro^um
and pict narum ad^rato^es. Aug. de morib. ec^les. cap 34. tom. 1. Qui aut^m se
in memorijs Martyrum inebr^ant, quomod^ a nobis approbari possunt? sed ^liud
est quod decemus, aliud quod susti^em^s Idem c^ntra Faustum M^nich^ lib. 20.
cap. 21. t^m. 6.
I know many (says he) who worship Sepulchers and Pictures, I know many who
drink most excessively over the dead. The good Bishops saw these malladies in
their flocks, and desired to reform them, but they feared lest the rude people
should hinder their r^formation, so that they were constrained to tolerate
these and the like abuses; insomuch that the same Austine speaking of them
says, Quod a^tem instituitur pre^er con^uetudinem, ut quasi observatio Sacra
menti sit^ approbare non p^ss^m, etiamsi multa hu^u modi propter nonnulla^um
v^l (...), vel turbulentarum personarum (...) devi^andi libe^^^is impr^bare non
audeo. Aug. Epist. 119. d Ianuar.
Approbare non possum, I can no way allow them, and yet liberius improbare non
audeo, I dare not freely reprove them: and why? lest thereby I either offend
some good men, or provoke some turbulent spirits.

And the same Father speaking of such as drank, drunk over the Sepulchers of
the dead, withal he adds: S^d ^liud est quod dos^m^s, aliud quod sustinemas;
aliud quo^ praecipere (...) and (...). Au^. contra Faustum Mani^^. li 20 ca. 21.
It is one thing that we teach, another that we tolerate; it is one thing that
which we are commanded to teach, another thing we are commanded to correct, and
which we are constrained to bear withal, until that it be amended.

Neither indeed is it to be marvailed, if the learned among them, and such as
were lately come from the Philosophers Schools into Christian Colleges, and a
people newly crept out of Paganism; I say it is not to be marvailed, if they
retained something of their form^r Tenets and customs; but these are no
presidents for us who have now better learned Christ Jesus.

Cau^ion.
For farther caution, we may make use of that rule which Bellarmine lays
down; and it is this: We must (says Oportet ex verbis ape^ti^ S Patrum
expone^e ea^ quae videntur obscura et dubia in alijs Patribus. Bellarm. lib. 2.
de Euchar. cap. 37.. Ex.
he) confer the Fathers one with another, and the same Father often times in
diverse Treatises with himself; and by those things that are clearly set
down in one place, or one Father, expound those things that seem more obscure
and doubtful in another.

Now we accept of this rule, and thereby defeat diverse of our Adversaries
allegations; for example: Those words of Saint Ambrose Quia benedictione etiam
Natura ipsa mutatur. Ambros. de ijs qui myster. initiantur cap. 9.
are much pressed, Benedictione natura mutatur, By benediction or consecration
the nature of the elements in the Lords supper is changed; and yet Saint Cyrill
Spiritus sancti operatione ad divinam aqua reformantur naturam. Cyril. Alexand.
sup. Joan. lib. 2. cap. 42. tom. 1. Georg. Trapezontio Interpret.
says as much of Baptism; namely, That the Waters are changed into a divine
nature.

They will not hence infer a Transubstantiation in Baptism; why will they
then from the like words in Saint Ambrose infer a Transubstantiation in the
Lords Supper?

Those words of Gregory Nyssen (...). Greg. Nyssen. Orat. Catechet. cap. 37.
pa. 536.
are much pressed, namely; Panem in corpus Christi (...); Bread to be changed
into Christ's Body. Now let Nyssen expound Nyssen, who in the words immediately
going before says, Corpus Christi ad divinam dignitatem (...), that Christ's
body is changed or turned into a divine excellency; and yet this is done
without any Transubstansiation at all.

In like sort, that of Theophylact is much urged, Bellar. lib. 2. de Euchar. c.
34. Sed -- adducit testimonium Theophylacti^a c^p. 26 Math. and in cap. 6 Joan.
dicentis panem transmutari in carnem Domini.
who says of the Bread, That it is trans-elementated into the body of Christ,
he uses the word (...): Now Theophylact may expound Theophylact, who in the
very same place says, (...). Theophyl. in Joan. cap. 6. verse. 54. page 654.
Nos in Christum (...), that we also are trans-elementated into Christ; that a
Christian is in a manner trans-elementated into Christ: Now they will not say,
that we are transubstantiated into Christ; therefore neither does Theophylact
by the word Trans-elementation used of the Bread and Wine, understand any
substantial, but only a Sacramental change. The like is shown in the
testimonies objected out of Hilarie in the fourth age, and Cyrill of Alexandria
in the fifth, answered by themselves.

Caution.
We are to make a dfference of the Fathers age, and w^itings, as also of their
gifts; Saint Austin wrote more soundly than Origin, though Origin were his
Ancient; for Origin turned almost all into Allegories; yet as with Wines, so in
Writings, usually the elder the better, and the Water near the Springhead
runs clear and sweet; so it was with the Fathers that wrote during the first
five hundred years next after Christ: others, that wrote after the first six
hundred years, such as Damascen, Anselme, and the like, they were post-nati to
primitive antiquity, and out of the verge of the Churches purity, as also some
of them partial, for so was Damascen a party in that Image quarrel in the
Eastern Church; and therefore in that case his testimony is to be barred.

Besides, for the answering of allegations out of the Fathers, we must sever
the bastard treatises, from the true and undoubted writings of the Fathers: for
example, Dionysius Hierarchy is a counterfeit; Clements constitutions are
suspected, and Cyprian de Coena domini, is not Doctor James, of the Bast^rdie
of Fathers. p^rt. ^. p. 12.
Cyprians; as is already shown in the third Centurie.

Object.
If these be counterfeits, how is it that your selves produce diverse
testimonies out of them; as also out of the Commentaries of Saint Hierome, and
Saint Ambrose, upon Saint Paul's, Epistles, which yet your selves do not hold
them to be Saint Hieromes and Saint Ambroses Rob. C^ci Consura Pa^^um. p. 133.
and 143. And. ^ivet Critici sacri. lib. 4. c. 5. de Hieronymi exegeticis. Id.
lib. 3 c. 18. de ^^bijs and suppositijs to^i 4. and 5. Ambrosian.
?

Answer.
It is not to be marvelled, if some of our learned Protestants (admitting the
books were written by them whose names they do bear) do thence produce
testimonies against you: for it is a rule in Law, Tynd^rus Tract. de Testibu^.
Testem quem quis inducit pro se, tenetur recipere contre se, you have produced
them for your own benefit, and therefore in reason you cannot disallow of them
now, though it be to your great hinderance, you first produced these witnesses,
and now that they are in the face of the Court, you must give us leave to
examine them upon cross Interrogatories.

To close up this point; the Fathers are more to be credited, when they
conclude a thing de fide, dogmatic (...) didactic (...), doctrinally,
positively, purposely, by way of setting forth a matter of faith; than when
they write Agonistic (...), Master Harding. 1^. Artic. division 10.
that is to say by way of contention and disputation, or obiter, touching a
point only upon the by, and as it may serve and suite with the point they have
in hand, without farther respect thereunto. They are more to be credited when
they speak Categoric (...), assertive, with asseveration; than speaking only
Historic (...), and ex opinione aliorum, relating only the opinion of others,
or what was done, and not delivering their own judgment; they are more to be
esteemed when they speak as Divines in a professed discourse, than when they
speak as Orators, Poets, Panegyrifts, and in a popular Demegorica, non sunt
Lit is Decretoria. D. Andrews Resp. ad Card. Bellarm. Apolog. cap. 1. pa. 42.
discourse.

In a word, we must observe, what they write out of their private opinion, and
what they deliver as the judgment of the Church: when any of them go alone,
it is not so safe following them; but where we have their unanimous and joint
consent in any material point, we may more securely rely upon them; and this
was one of King James his directions for Students in Divinity King James his
Cygnea Cantio, or Direction^ for Students in Divini^^^, published by D. Featly.
: and I find the same rule in Vincentius Lirinensis; to wit, Quicquid non unus,
aut duo tantum, sed omnes pariter uno eodemque co^sensu, aperte, frequenter,
persevera^ter, tenuisse, scripsisse, docuisse, cognoverit, id sibi quoque
intelligat abs^ue ulla dubitatione ^^ed^ndum. Vincent. Lirin. cont. Haeres. c
4. etc. 39.
That we may rely upon that, not which one or two of the Fathers, but either
all (or most of them) have taught, and that manifestly, frequently and
constantly.

PA.
Although in some things the Fathers make for you, yet in the point of Merit,
prayer for the dead, and prayer to Saints they are against you; Bellar. de Not
Ec^les. lib. 4 cap. 9. Item.
they used the word Merit, and held as we do.

PRO.
The Ancients used the word Merit (and so also they used the terms,
Indulgences, Satisfaction, Sacrifice, and Penance) but quite in another sense
then the later Romanists do: the Fathers who use it, took up the word as they
found it in ordinary use and custom with men in those times, not for to
deserve, which in our language implies Merit of condignity, but to incur, to
attain, impetrate, obtain and procure, without any relation at all to the
dignity, either of the person or the work; thus Saint Bernard concerning
children promoted to the Prelacie, says; L^^tiores interim quod virgas
evas^r^nt, q^am quod meruerint principatum. Be^n. Epist. 22.
They were more glad they had escaped the rod, than that they had merited (that
is, obtained) the pr^ferment. Saint Augustine says, P^o action gratia^um
flammas meruimus odio^um. Aug. lib 3. con^^a Lit. (...). c. 6. tom. 7.
that he and his fellows for their good doings, at the hands of the
D^natists, In steed of thanks merited (that is, incurred) the flames of
hatred: on the other side the same Father affirms, Pro p^rse^utionibus ^t
bla^phemys vas electionis me^uit n^min^ri. Id. de pr^d^st. e^ great. c. 16.
That Saint Paul for his persecutions and blasphemies merited (that is, found
grace) to be named a vessel of election. Saint Gregory has a strain
concerning the sin of Adam, which is sung in the Church of Rome, at the
blessing of the Taper; (...) Cerei (...) O ^alix (...) quae (...) ac ta^tum
meruit (...) Ma^^^le E^^les. Sarisbur. ^^g. 30
O happy sin that merited (that is, Found the favor) to have such and so
great a Redeemer. In like sort by merits they did ordinarily signify works,
as appears by that of Saint Bernard, saying, N^que enim (...), ut p^^pt^r ^a
vita ^eterna deb^^tur (...) jure. Merita o^nia (...) D^i ^unt. Be^n sermon. 1. in
Ann^n^i B. Mariae.
The merits of men are not such, that for them eternal life should be due of
right; for all merits are Gods gifts.

Neither did the ancient Church hold merit of Condignitie, but resolved
according to that of Leo; N^que (...) de quali^^^^ (...) dono^um Leo S^^m. 12.
de (...). Dom.
The measure of celestial gifts depends not upon the quality of works; they
were not of the Rhemists opinion, Rhemists Annot. upon H^br. 6. sect. 4.
That good works are meritorious, and the very cause of salvation; so far
that God should be unjust, if he rendered not heaven for the same. They were not
so far Iesuited as with Vasquez Vasquez in primam secundae qu. 114.
to hold, that Opera bona justorum ex seipsis, absque ullo pacto and
accep^atione digna esse remuneratione vitae aet^rnae, and equalem valorem
co^dignitatis habere ad consequendam aeternam gloriam. Vasquez Comment. in
prima^. secund. q^. 114. disp. 214. cap. 5. in initio^
The good works of just persons are of themselves, without any covenant and
acceptance, worthy of the reward of eternal life, and have an equal value of
condignitie to the obtaining of eternal glory.

PA.
You cannot deny, but that prayer for the dead is ancient.

PRO.
The manner now used is not ancient, for they that of old prayed for the dead,
had not any reference to Purgatory, as Popish prayers are now adays made.

It is true indeed, that anciently they used Commemorations of the defunct;
neither mislike we their manner of naming the deceased at the holy table; in
this sort, they used a Commemoration Missa Chrysostomi, in Biblioth. Patr.
graeco-lat. Par. 1624.

-- and inprimis sanctissimae Virginis. ordo Liturgiae B. Ioann Chrysostomi ex
versione Leonis Tusci apud Cassand^ in Liturgiae. ca. ^.


of the Patriarks, Prophets, Apostles, Evangelists, Martyrs, and Confessors,
yea of Mary the mother of our Lord, to whom it cannot be conceived, that by
prayer they did wish their deliverance out of Purgatory, since no man ever
thought t^em to be there; but if they wished any thing, it was the deliverance
from the power of death, which as yet tyrannized over one part of them; the
hastening of their resur^ection, as also a joyful public acquitall of them in
that great day wherein they shall stand to be judged before the judge of the
quick and dead, that so having fully escaped from all the consequences of sin
(the last enemy being then destroyed 1 Cor. 15.26.54.
and death swallowed up in victory) they might obtain a perfect consummation
and bliss, both in body and soul, according to the form of our Churches At
the burial of the dead.
Liturgy.

In the Commemoration of the faithful departed, retained as yet in the Roman
missall, there is used this Orizon: R^quiem aeternam dona ei^ Domine, and lux
perpetua luceat eis. Agenda Mortuorum, in Antiphonario Gregorij. apud Pamel.
to. 2. p. 175.
O Lord grant unto them eternal rest, and let everlasting light shine unto
them: and again, Hanc igitur oblationem, quam tibi pro commemoratione animarum
in p^ce dormientium suppliciter immolamus quaesumus Domine, benignus accip^as.
Pamel. Liturg. page 610 tom. 2.
This oblation, which we humbly offer unto thee for the Commemoration of the
souls that sleep in peace, we beseech thee O Lord, receive graciously; and
it is usual in the Ambrosian, and Gregorian Office, and in the Roman missall,
to put in their Memento, the names of such as sleep in the sleep of Peace,
and omnium pausantium, and to entreat for the spirits of those that are at
rest: Mem^nt^ Domine eorum qui dormiunt in somno pa^^s. A^brosiana Missa, in
orat pro defunctis. Pamel. Liturg. page 303. to. 1 and Canon Missae, in Officio
Gregor. apud. Pamel. page 182. to. 2.
Remember, O Lord, thy servants, and hand maids, which have gone before us
with the Ensign of Faith, and sleep in the sleep of Peace; now by
Pausantium, Pro Spiritibus pausantium Ambrosij, Augustini, Fulgentij, Isidori.
Missa Mozarabe. Muzarabes di^ebantur mixti Arabibus. In Liturg. Pamel. page 642
[Et Pausantium] quo nomine intelligi puto, Confessores qui in Domino, and
sanct^ pace quies^unt. Id. Ibid. page 645.
Pamelius understands, such as sleep and rest in the Lord. Where we may
observe, that the souls unto which Everlasting bliss was wished for, were yet
acknowledged to rest in Peace, and consequently not to be disquieted with any
Purgatory torment. So that the thing which the Church anciently aimed at in
her supplications for the dead, was not to ease or release the souls out of
Purgatory, but that the whole man (not the soul separated only) might find
mercy of the Lord in that day, as sometime Saint Paul prayed for Onesiphorus,
2 Timothy 1.18.
even whiles Onesiphorus was yet alive. Besides, they desired a joyful
Resurrection, as appears by several passages, and Liturgies; by the Egyptian
Liturgy attributed to Cyril Bishop of Alexandria, where we find this Orizon:
Resuscita corpora eorum in die quem constituisti secundum promissiones (...)
veras et mendacij expertes. Cyr. Litur. ex Arab. in Lat. conversa. page 62.
Raise up their bodies in the day which thou have appointed, according to thy
promises which are true and cannot lie. And that of Saint Ambrose, for Gratian
and Valentinian the Emperors: Te qu^eso, sum Deus, ut charissimes ^uvenes
matura resurrectione suscipes, et resuscites; ut immaturum hu^^ vitae isti^s
cursum matura resurrectione com^enses. Ambros. de obitu Valentin.
I do beseech thee most high God, that thou would raise up again those
dear young men with a speedy resurrection; that thou may recompense this
untimely course of this present life with a timely resurrection.

As also in Grimoldus his Sacramentarie; Omnipotens s^m^iterne Deus, coll^ca^e
digna^e corpus et animam and spiritum samuli tui N. in sinibus Abrahae Isaac
and Jacob, ut ^um dies agnitionis tue venerit inter sanct^s et electos tuos eum
ie^uscita^i praecip^as. G^^moldi Sacramentor. lib. in to. 2. Liturg. Pamelij
page 456.
Almighty and everlasting God, vouchsafe to place the body and the soul, and
the spirit of thy servant N. in the bosoms of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; that
when the day of thine acknowledgement shall come, thou may command them to be
raised up among thy Saints and thine Elect. The like is found in the Agend of
the dead, -- Vt in Resurrectionis gloria inter Sanctos tuos resus^^tari
mercantur. Agenda mortuorum, in Antiphonario Gregorij in Pamelij Liturgi^. to.
2. p. 175
already mentioned.

PA.
Invocation of Saints was anciently used.

PRO.
I answer, that though in respect of later times, Prayer to Saints and some
other of our adversaries Tenets may seem ancient, and gray headed; yet in
respect of the first three or four hundred years next after Christ, they are
not of that ancient standing: now the true trial of antiquity is to be taken
from the first and purest ag^s; for as Tertullian tells us, Id verius quod
prius, id prius quod and ab initio, ab initio quod ab Apostolis. Tertul.
advers. Marcion. lib. 4. cap. 5. Id esse verum quodcunque primum, id esse
adult^rum quodcunque posterius. Id. advers. Praxeam. cap. 2. Id Dominicum and
verum quod prius traditum; extraneum and falsum quod posterius immissum. Id. de
praescrip. advers. Haeret. cap. 31.
That is most true, which is most ancient, that most ancient which was from the
beginning, that from the beginning which from the Apostles, so that which at
first was delivered to the Saints, is truest; and the good seed was first
sown, and after that came the tares.

Besides, what though some points in Popery were of a thousand yeare^
standing? it is not time that can make a lie to be truth; antiquity without
truth is but antiquitas erroris, an ancient error; and there is no
p^aescrip^ion of time can hold plea against God and his truth.

Neither yet can you prescribe for diverse Tenet^^ Scotus that was termed the
Subtle Doctor, tells us, Vau^ tamen addit Scotus, quod minime proband^ est,
ante Lateranense Concilium non fuisse dogma fidei Transubstantiationem.
Bellarm. lib. 3. de Euchar. cap. 23. Vnum.
that before the Council of Lateran (which was not till the year 1215)
Transubstantiation was not believed as a point of Faith. This did Bellarmine
observe as a thing remarkable in Scotus, although he does not approve the same.

Cassander says, Satis compertum est universalem Christi Ecclesiam in hunc
usque diem; occidentalem vero s^u Romanam mill omplius a Christo annis, in
sol^mni praesertim et ordinaria hujus Sacramenti dispensatione utramque panis
and vin^ speciem omnibus Ecclesiae Christi membris exhibu^sse; id quod ex
innumeri^ veterum Scripto^um, t^m Graecorum, quam Laticeru^ testimonijs
manifestum est. Cassand. Art. 22. Consult. de ut^aque specie.
It is sufficiently manifest, that the Universal Church of Christ until this
day, and the Western or Roman Church, for more then a thousand years aft^r
Christ, did exhibit the Sacrament in both kinds to all the members of Christ's
Church, at least in public, as it is most evident by innumerable testimonies,
both of Greek and Latin Fathers. So that the barring of the Lay People of the
Cup, came not into the Church by any public decree, till the Council of
Constance, which was held in the year 1414, some two hundred years ago.

Fisher Bishop of Rochester says, De quo tamen [purgatorio] apud pris^os illos
nulla, vel quam rarissima fiebat mentio; sed et Graecis ad hunc usque diem non
est creditum. Ro^^ens. ar^. 18^ contra Lutherum.
that of Purgatory there is very little or no mention amongst the ancient; and
that the Grecians do not believe it to this day.

In like sort, their Latin service, which Pope Vitalian brought in, Papa
Vitaltanus, omnia in Christianoru^ t^mpl^s per suos sacrificos in latino
sermon fieri jussit. Wolf. Lection. m^mor^bil. pa 74. ad an^ 6^6.
is not of Primitive antiquity, for it was not generally put upon the Church
until the year 666. which is the number of the name of the beast mentioned in
the Apocalypse, Revel. 13.18. and found out by Irenaeus Sed and Lateinos nomen
sexcentorum sex^ginta sex numerum [habet] and valde verisimile est, Latinienim
sunt qui nunc regnant. Iren l. 5. advers. Haer. cap. 25. edit. Gallasij cap.
30. edit Fevard.
to arise out of the numerall letters of the word Lateinos; now this name (...)
well suites with the Pope whose Faith and Church is the Romish or Latin Church,
and his public Service in Latin, and his translation of Scripture in Latin.

Now touching prayer to Saints; It is true, that such as had lapsed, and fallen
in time of persecution, were wont to implore the prayers of Ma^tyrs and
Confessors imprisoned for the Cyprian l. 3. ^p. 15 Tertull. de pudiciti^. c.
22.
Gospel; that by their interceding for them, they might procure some ease or
relaxation of such canonical censures as were enjoined them by the Church, and
Cyprian was of opinion, that the Saints aft^r death, remembered their old
friends here, as having taken fresh and particular notice of their several
states, votes, and necessities; and hence grew that compact betwixt Cyprian and
Cornelius, that whether of them went to heaven before the other, he should pray
for his surviving Si quis nostr^m prior divinae dignationis celeritate
praecesserit, perseveret a^ud cum nostra dilectio pro fratribus and sororibus
apud misericordiam patris non cesset oration. Cypr. l. ^. cap 1. vel ( ut in
alijs edit.) ep. 57. ad Cornel. and de Discipl. and habitu virg.
friend. Now this soliciting of Martyrs before their deaths, brought in the
next Age a custom to call upon them after their deaths: yet so as they did not
directly invote them. For so it was; for the better preservation of the memory
of Saints and Martyrs, they had their Commemoration days, and were wont to
meet at the Tombs and Monuments of Martyrs, where they kept their anniversary,
and yearly solemnities, and made speeches in their praise and commendations;
and in these their orations they spoke to the deceased, as if they had been
living, and present there, but these were only strains of rhetoric,
Figures, and Apostrophee's, rather Declamationes rhetorum, flowers of
rhetoric, than Definitiones Theologorum, decisions of Divines. In this kind
Gregory Nazianzene says, (...). Greg. Nazian. orat 3. in Julian.
Hear, O thou soul of great Con^^antius, (if thou have any understanding of
these things) and as many souls of the Kings before him as loved Christ. The
like he has in his funeral oration which he made upon his Sister Gorgonia,
where he speaks thus unto her: (...). Id. orat. undecima in Gorgon.
If thou have any care of the things done by us, and holy souls receive this
honor from God, that they have any feeling of such things as these; receive
this oration of ours, in stead of many, and before many funeral obsequies. He
speaks doubtfully and faintly, If thou have any sense or apprehension hereof;
and, if you be affected with these things; it seems he thought that the
defunct had not ordinarily notice of things done on earth, neither will it
serve to say as Bellarmine does, Si, non est dubitantis, sed affirmantis, ut
^um dicit Apostolus ad Philemonem, Si habes me so^ium, suscipe illum. Bellarm.
de Sanct. Beat. li. 1. cap. 20. ad locum Nazianzeni dico.
that Si, is not dubitantis, but affirmantis, not a term of doubting, but of
asseveration, as that of Saint Paul, If thou count me therefore a partner,
receive him as my self. For there is no man, but if he read these places
unpartially, Hear, if there be any sense, and, Hear, if God grant it as a
privilege to souls deceased to have sense of these things, but he will
conceive that Si is not put for, For; or quoniam, or as a note of affirming,
but as a note of doubt, at least in the parties that spoke it.

Hitherto the Saints were rather Vocati, called unto, as comprecants, to join
their prayers with the living, than Invocati, Directly called upon, or prayed
unto; yet in process of time the prayers made to God to hear the
Intercessions of the Saints, were changed into prayers, to the Saints, to hear
our intercessions themselves: For we deny not but that among the ancient
writers, there are some places found which speak of the Intercession of the
Saints; there are also wishes found that were made by living men, that the
Saints would pray for them; but this is not the difference betwixt us, whether
the Saints pray for us, but whether we must pray unto, and call upon them? for
we grant, that the Saints in heaven do pray for Saints on earth in general,
Et tamen ge^^raliter orantibus pro indigenti^ supplicantium. Aug. de ^ura pro
mortuis c. 16. to. 4.
according to the nature of communion of Saints; but their intercession for us
in general, will not infer our invocation of them in particular.

There are also in ancient Writers p^rticular examples to be found of some,
that ou^ of their own private devotion have called upon Saints; but thi^
cannot raise up a tenet in Religion to bind the Church, either for doctrine or
practice; for what one or two shall do, carried away with their own devout
affection, having zeal (hap'ly) not according to knowledge, is not straight
way a Ru^e of the Church, nor one of the Churches Agends. The thing we stand
upon is this; that there were not any Collects, nor set forms, nor any di^ect
Invocation of Saints put into the Common-service, and public Liturgy of the
Western Church until the days of Gregory the Great, or there abouts, six
hundred years after Christ; so that their Saint-invocation is not so ancient
as they would bear the world in hand.

In a word, there is much difference between the ancients, and modern Romists
herein; for in the compellations which the ancients used, they pleaded only
Christ's merits, making the Saints (high in Gods favor) competitioners to the
throne of grace with the Saints living on earth: but not content herewith, the
Schools afterward held meritorious Invocation of Saints, wherein the Saints
own merits were brought in, and pleaded. We pray unto the Saints (says the
Master of the Sentences) Oramus ergo ut intercedant pro nobis, id est, ut
merita eorum nobis suffragentur. Petr. Lombard. l. 4. did. 45. lit. G.
That they may intercede for us, that is to say, That their merits may help
us; and Biel speaks to the same effect. Sanctos invocamus, ut medi^tores,
quorum meritis et intuitu nobis Deus conferat, quae ex nostris accipere minus
sumus digni. Biel. in Can. Missae lect. 30.

dedit, I trust we have got the day in the two last, justly styled the learned
Ages. The Reader is not now (in the close of the first 600 years) to expect so
full and frequent Testimonies as formerly: such as we find we produce, Acts

Of the Scriptures Sufficiency and Canon.
Iustus Orgelitanus compares the Scriptures to David's Tower wherein hang a
thousand shields, and all the targets of the strong men; In S. Scriptura omnis
fortium armatura reperitur, ex qua vel contra Diabolum, vel ministros eju^
fortitur repugnatur. Just. Orgelit. in cap. 4. Cantic.
it being furnished with all sorts of armor, to encounter Satan, and his
Instruments withal.

Saint Bede records of the successors of Colum-kille the great Saint of
Ireland, That they Tantum ea quae in Propheti^is, Evangelicis et Apostolicis
literis discere poterant, observantes. Beda lib. 3. Hist. cap. 4.
observed only those works of piety and chastity, which they could learn in
the prophetical, evangelicall, and apostolical writings; and these they
esteemed as their chief riches, according to that of Columban. in Mono^lich.
and in Epist. ad Hun^ld.
Columbanus: Sint tibi divitiae divinae dogmata legis.


Iunilius an African Bishop, treating of the Canonica^l books, and having said
that some account Tobie with others Canonical, he puts the question, and then
resolves it: Why are not these books inserted amongst the Canonical
Scriptures, and he names amongst other Tobie, Esdra, Judith, and the second of
the Maccabees? Because (says he) Quare hi libri inter Canonic^s S. non
c^^runt? Quoniam apud Haebraeos quoque super h^c diff^renti^ recipiebantur,
sicut Hieron. caeterique testantur. Iunil. African. de part. divinae legis lib

The Jews did make a difference of them, as Saint Hierome, and others witness.

Of Communion under both kinds, and number of Sacraments.
Hinemar in the life of Rhemigius Archbishop of Rhemes (who converted King
Clovis of France to the Christian faith) Cassandri Liturg. ca. 31. Pamelij
Liturgi^. page 618. tom. 1.
reports that the Archbishop gave a Chalice for the peoples use, with this
Motto; Hauriat hinc populus vitam de sanguine sacro
Injecto, aeternus quem fudit vulnere Christus.
Rhemigius domino reddit sua vota sacerdos.
Rhemigius Priest, that gave this cup,
Prays that in it the people sup;
And still draw life from flowing blood
Out of Christ's side, as of a flood.
He says not, Hauriat hinc Clerus, but populus; not, Let the Priest, but let
the people drink of this ministerial Cup, as Cassander calls it.

The Divines of this Age (as others of former times) Duo tantum Sacramenta
Theologi hujus sextae aetatis agnoscunt. Illyric. Catalog. test. verit. li. 6.
acknowledged only two Sacraments, Baptism, and the Lords Supper.

Of the Eucharist.
Fulgentius speaking of the Eucharist, says; In isto sacrificio gratiarum
actio a^que commemoratio est carnis Christi, quam pro nobis obtulit. Augustine
de fide ad Petr. Diacon. cap. 19.
In this sacrifice there is a thankesgiving and remembrance of the flesh which
he offered, and the blood which Christ shed for us; and S^crificium panis and
vini Ecclesia Catholica per universum orbem terrae offerre non cessat. Id. ibid.
this sacrifice of bread and wine was offered throughout the whole Catholic
Church.

Here Fulgentius mentions a Sacrifice not proper and propitiatory for the
quick and dead, but Eucharisticall, and Commemorative, of praise and
thankesgiving, a lively memorial, and representation of the Sacrifice offered
on the Cross.

The words alleged are found amongst S. Austines works; but Bellarmine
Tribuitur a multis Fulgentio. Be^tramus hunc librum sub nomine Fulgentij
citavit. Bell. de Scriptor. Eccles. sect. 5. in Augustino.
says; Many father them on Fulgentius, and that Bertram cites these words
under his name, and so indeed I find it: howsoever, were it Austin, Bertram de
Corp. and sang^ Dom. ^udiamus quid B. Fulgentius in libello de Fide dicat.
or Fulgentius, the Master, or the Scholar; so they taught, and so we
learned, both from them and others, namely Offerunt quidem S^^erdotes nostri,
sed ad recordatione^ mortis ejus. Primas. in Heb. cap 10.
Primasius, Offerimus quidem, sed recordationem sacientes mortis ejus. Ambros.

Ambrose, and Eandem hostiam offerimus, (...), vel potius recordationem ipsius.
Chrysostom. in Hebr. 10. Homil. 17.
Chrysostom, who by way of correction say, We offer the same sacrifice, or
rather the remembrance thereof. Besides, the same Fulgentius says, Filium Dei
unicum per fidem recipient. Fulg. de Incarn^ and great. ca. 26.
They receive the only Son of God.

Of Images, and Prayer to Saints.
Fulgentius says, In primo Decalogi mandato, sicut unius Dei cultur^
servitusque manifestissime praecipitur; ita omni Creaturae adoratio ac servitus
a fidelibus exhibenda vehementissime prohibetur. Fulgent. ad Donatum.
That as in the first Precept, the worship of one God is manifestly commanded;
so the faithful are utterly forbidden to yield the service of Adoration to any
creature.

Dracontius in his book of the Creation, says; Dracont. Poetic. Hexameron. in
Bibl. Patr. to. 8. edit. 2. Par. 1589.
It is Gods pleasure, Esse nihil prorsus se praeter ubique rogandum. That
nothing beside himself should every where be prayed unto.

Of Faith and Merit.
Primasius says, that Non ex operibus, sed sol^ ^ide per gratiam, vitam habere
te nosti Primas. in cap. 2. ad Galat.
We are freely justified by faith only, and not by works.

Fulgentius says, Sola ^ides eripit Jesus Christi. Fulgent. de Incar. and great.
cap. 16.
From this our original corruption, not any power of nature, or letter of the
Law, but faith only in Jesus Christ does free us.

Now this saving faith, though it never go alone, yet may there be some gift
of God, which it alone is able to reach unto, Columban. in Monostych. page 62.
as Columbanus also implies in that verse: Sola fides fidei done ditabitur
almo.


Concerning Merit, Fulgentius says; Grati^ autem eti^n ipsa ide^ non injust^
dici^ur, quia con sol^m Deus (...) suis dona sua reddit; se^ quia tantum etiam
ibi (...) d^vinae retributionis exuberat^ ut incomp^rabilite atque
in^ff^bilitet omne meritum, quamvis bonae et ex Deo d^tae, humanae vo^u^tatis
atque uperationis (...). edat. Fulg. ^d Monim. lib. 1. cap 10.
Our glorificacation is not unjustly called grace, not only because God does
bestow his own gifts upon his own gifts; but also because the grace of Gods
reward does so much there abound, as that it exceeds incomparably and
unspeakably all the merit of the will, and work of man, though good, and given
from God: and N^ll^t^nus (...) salubriter (...) ^emus, tam in no, (...) nostro
ope^e tanqu^m nostrum nobis aliq^^d ve^dica^e. Id. ^bid.
That this is wholesome doctrine, to challenge nothing to our selves in any
good we do.

And Iustus Orgelitanus says, Et ide^ quicquid justi in bonis op^ribus
^^uc^^ficat, totum est referendum ad Christum. Just. Orgelit. in cap. 2. Canti^.
We must thank the Stock Christ Jesus, if any good fruit grow on our
branches.

Cassiodore says, That Qu^^i^m vocatio Domini omne meritum praecedit; nec in
venit dignum sed fa^it: id^o c^^m gratuita, alioqa^n justa diceretur.
C^ssiodor. in Psalm. 5.
Gods vocation goes before our merit, not ^inding us worthy, but accepting us
for such.

The Council of Orange has notably decreed against the Semi-pelagians. There
are many good things (says the Council) Multa in homine bo^^ sunt, que (...)
^acit (...), nulla v^ro (...) homo bona quae non Deus praestet ut (...) homo.
Council. Ara^sic^^. ^. Cano. 20. C^r^nz^ in summa Council.
done in man, which man does not; but man does no good things, which God does
not make man to do. Hoc ^ti^m salubrit^r pro^item^r and credimu^, quod in omni

25. Ca^an^a ibid.
This also do we wholsomely profess and believe, that in every good work
we do not begin, and are helped afterward by the mercy of God; but he first

the love of him: which place Binnius has Council. tom. 2. page 392. Edit.

corrupted, reading for nullis, multis; many good works going before: surely
this was none of his good works to corrupt the Council.

Now also was held the fif^h General Council at Constantinople, Anno 553.
(...). Evagr. Eccles. Histor. li. 4. ca. 11.
Called by the Emperor Justinian, and not by the Pope.

This Council confirmed the decrees of the former; and withal (according to
the former Canons) decreed, Can. 35.
That the Sea of Constantinople should have equal dignity with the Sea of old
Rome. Unto these foreign testimonies, we may join some of our own, namely,
the Britains about the year five hundred ninety six, what time as Gregory
the Great sent Austin the Monk into England.

PAP.
It was our Gregory, and his Austin that first converted your Island.

PRO.
It was converted long before Austins coming, even in the first Age of the
Church, as is already shown. Besides, at his coming, there were in Britain
Septem Britonum Episcopi, et plures viri doctis^imi. Beda hist. Angl. lib. 2.
cap. 2.
seven Bishops, with other learned men, professing and teaching the Christian
faith; and above two thousand Monks in the Monastery of Bangor, Qui omnes
[Monachi] labor maruum su^ um vivebant. Galfrid. Monumetens. Hist. Reg.
Britan. lib. 11. cap. 12.
All living with the labor of their hands. Yea, Geffrey of Monmouth speaking
of Cornwaile, and the Western parts, says; In part autem Brit^num adhuc
vige^at Christianitas, quae a tempore El^utherij Papae habita, nu^quam inter
eos defecerat. Id. quo supra. and Math. Westmon. ad anu. 596.
In a part of the Britains, Christianity yet flourished, the which being
received in the days of Eleutherius ( in the year 179.) Never failed amongst
them; so that Austin was not our first Converter.

PA.
You say the Britains held the Christian faith; how then differed they from
our Austin?

PRO.
They differed both in Ceremonies, and Substantial doctrine; namely, in not
acknowledging the Popes Supremacy, which is now a grand Article of the Roman
Faith: for whereas Austine came with a kind of Legantine power from the Pope,
and for the execution of this Commission (not unknown to the Ilanders) used
both prayers and Fertur minita^s praedixisse. Beda hist. li. 2. c. 2. and Math.
Westmonast. ad ann. 603.
threats, to move them to conformity with the Roman Church, at least for their
manner of baptizing, and keeping of Easter; but they told him plainly, that At
illi nihil horum se facturos, neque illum pro Archiep. habitu^os esse
respond^^ant. Id. ibid.
They would not yield to any of his motions, nor acknowledge him for their Arch
bishop: yea, Dinoc ^orum Abbas, mi^o modo liberalibus artibus cr^ditus diversis
argumenta^ionibus ipsos ei nullam subjectione^ d^be^e respondit. Galfii. quo
^upra.
Dinooch the Abbot of Bangor, a learned man, made it appear^ by diverse
arguments, when Austine required the Bishops to be subject unto him, that they
ought him no subjection; yea, they farther added, Cum Archi^pis^opum suum
hab^rent ^ui deh^rent et v^ll^^t (...), externo ve^o Episcopo se mi^^me
subjectos ^ore. Antiquir. Britan. in Augustino. page 46.
That they had an Archbishop of their own, him they ought and would obey, but
they would not be subject to any foreign Bishop. For such an one (belike)
they held the Pope to be.

Neither can it be truly alleged that they refused his jurisdiction, not his
religion; forbid says, Cu^ctis qu^ di^ebant, (...) lab rabant. Beda quo
supra.
That they withstood him in all that ever he said: now surely he said somewhat
else besides his Arch-bishopricke, and his Pall; or else he had been a very
ambitious man. Besides, in the days of Laurentius, Austines successor, Bishop
Daganus denied all Communion, Nam Daganus Episcopus ad nos veniens, non solum
^ihum sumere nobis^um, sed nec in eodem hospitio voluit. Bed^ lib. 2. Histor.
cap. 4.
And refused to eat bread in the same Inn, wherein the Romish Prelates
lodged; belike then they differed in matters of weight.

PA.
Wherein stood the difference, what do you hence infer, whether were you not
beholden to our Austine?

PRO.
The Romans kept their Easter, in memory of Christ's Resurrection, upon the
first Sunday after the full Moon of March, the Britanes kept theirs in memory
of Christ's Passion, upon the fourteenth day of the Moon of March, on what day
of the week soever it fell; this they did after the example of the Eastern
Churches in Asia, grounded on a tradition received from Saint John; whereby it
seems, the British Church rather followed the custom of the East Church in
Asia, planted by Saint John, and his disciples, than the Roman; which yet had
they been of the Romish jurisdiction, they would (in all likelihood) have
followed; now since they followed the Eastern custom, it is probable, that
our first conversion to Christianity, came from the Converted Jews, or
Grecians, and not from the Romans; and that Britain was not under their
jurisdiction. But whencesoever our Conversion were, we bless God for it.

Now concerning Austine, and the Britains; we acknowledge to Gods glory, that
howsoever the superfluity of Ceremonies which Austine brought in, might well
have been spared; yet Austine, and his Assistants, Iustus, John, and Melitus,
converted many to the Faith. Neither can we excuse the Britains, for Nec suam
praedicationem inimicis suis impendere [volebant.] Gal^rid. quo supra.
refusing to join with Austine in the conversion of the Pagan Saxons; yet
withal we must needs say, they had just reason to refuse to put their necks
under his yoke: and surely if Austine had not had a proud spirit, he would
only have requested their help for the work of the Lord, and not have sought
dominion over them: which makes it very probable, that his obtruding the Popes
jurisdiction over the Britains, occasioned that lamentable slaughter of the
Britains. For when as Austine solicited the Britains to obey the Sea of Rome,
Antiquit. Britan. cap. 18. out of Amand. Xierxiens. a Friar Minor collecteth
thus; Mo^a est discordia propter ^orum inobedientiam ad Augustinu^. -- Saxones
conversi volebant Britones Augustino subdere.
and they denied it; then did Ethelbert a Saxon Prince, lately converted by
Austine, stir up Edelfred the Wild, (the Pagan King of Northumberland)
against the Britains; whereupon the Infidel Saxon Soldiers, made a most
lamentable slaughter of the Britains, assembled at Westchester; and that not
only on the Soldiers prepared to fight, but on the Monks of Bangor assembled
for prayer; of whom they slew twelve hundred, together with Dinooch their
Abbot; all which (as Ieffery Monmouth says) Et sic mill ducenti eorum in ipsa
die, Martyri^ decorati, regni caelestis adepti sunt sedem. Gal^rid. Mon. lib.
11. cap. 13.
being that day honored with Martyrdom, obtained a seat in the Kingdom of
Heaven. And this was the woeful issue of their stickling for jurisdiction over
other Churches.

PA.
Baronius Britanni schismatis rei. Baron. tom. 8. ad ann. 604. nu. 65.
calls the Britains Schismatics, for not yielding to the Pope.

PRO.
The Britain Church had anciently a Cantuariens. Episcopus alterius Orbis
Patriarcha dicius est. Berterius in Diatriba. 2. cap. 4.
Patriarch or Primate of her own like other Provinces; to him the other
Bishops of his Church were subject, and not to the Roman.

PA.
The Nic^n Council condemned the Quartadecimans ( and in them your Britains)
for Heretics, Three Conv^rsions of England, p^^t. 1. ch^p. 3. nu. 13. and ^4.
says Parsons.

PRO.
To his testimony, we oppose the Judgment of a Friar minorite who expressly
Amand Xierxiens apud Antiquit. Britan. in Augustino page 48. Britones ^uerunt
Catholici.
calls them Catholics. Besides, had that famous Council of Sardice, held
our British Bishops for Heretics, they had never admitted them to give
sentence in that Council, as they did: Britanniarum Episcopi se ad magnum
Sardicum Conci^^um co^tul^^unt. Athanas. Apolog 2. to. 2.
for by name, Restitutus Bishop of London, Athanas. ibid. page 407.
subscribed thereunto; and was likewise p^esent at the Synod of Arles in
France, as Parsons Three C^ntrove^s. part. 1. chap 9. nu. 7.
reports out of Athanasius.

Again, those who kept Easter on the fourteenth day precisely, were of two
sorts.

Some as Polycrates, and other Bishops in Asia, kept it so, merely in
imitation of Ipsum est quod B. Evangelista Ioannes cum omnibus quibus praerat
ecclesijs, celeb^asse legitur. Beda hist. li 3. ca. 25.
Saint John the Evangelist; as an ancient, but yet an indifferent, and mutable
rite or tradition; and these were condemned for Heretics, and such were our
Britains.

Others kept the fourteenth day, even eo nomine, and by virtue of the Mosaicall
law; holding a necessity of observing that peremptory day, as appointed by
Moses^ now this was the means to bring Iudaisme, which quite abolisheth
Christ, and evacuateth the whole Gospel; like those who amongst the Galathians
urged Circumcision, to whom Galat. 5.2^
Saint Paul professes, that Christ should profit them nothing. And this was it
was condemned in the Quarta-decimans: but of this the Britains were clear.

They should indeed have conformed themselves to the Councels decree; yet
because that decree was not a decree of Faith (no farther then it condemned the
Necessity of observing the fourteenth day, and therein condemned the
Quarta^decimans) but a decree of Order, discipline, and uniformity in the
Church; when it was once known, and evident, that any particular Church
condemned the necessity of that fourteenth day; the Church by a connivencie
permitted, and did not censure the bare observing of that day.

The same Council. Nicen. Can. 20.
Council decreed, that on every Lords day, from Easter to Whits^ntide, none
should pray kneeling, but standing; wherein the Church (notwithstanding the
decree) uses the like connivence, not strictly binding every particular Church
to do so; so long as there is unity, and agreement in the doctrines of Faith;
the Church uses not to be rigorous with particular Churches, which are her
children, for the variety and difference in outward rites, though commanded by
her self, as my learned kinsman Dr. Crakanthorp of the Popes temporal
Monarchy. Chap. 12.
Doctor Crakanthorpe, has well observed.

PA.
This odds about keeping Easter was but of small weight.

PRO.
It was so, if we consider our Christian Galat. 4.9.
liberty in the observation of times; yet was it held a matter of that
consequence, that Pope Victor Omnes Ecclesiae Asiae a Victore excommunicatae
fuerint. Bellar. de verbo Dei. lib. 3. cap. 6.
Excommunicated all the Churches of Asia, which differed from him in the
observation thereof.

PA.
What conclude you from your Britains Faith?

PRO.
Upon the Premises, it follows; that seeing the doctrine of the Popes
Supremacy over all Churches, was no part of the Britains Faith when Austine
came; therefore neither was it any part of their Faith in Eleutherius days, no
nor in the Apostles time neither; since as Matthew of Westminster says, A ^ide
Christi nunquam recesserant Britannorum reliqu^ae Matthew. Westmon. ad an. 586.
The Britains Faith never failed.

Again, seeing the Britains Faith, ( Convers. part. 1. chap. 9. nu. 3.
as Parsons truly affirms) was then; to wit, at Austines coming, the same
which the Romans, and all Catholic Churches embraced: it further follows,
that the Popes Supremacy, was no material part of the Roman Faith, or of any
Catholics, either in Pope Eleutherius time, or in the Apostles days; for had
it been so, the Britains (who changed not their Faith, but kept still the
substantial grounds thereof) would likewise have held the Popes Supremacy;
yea, doubtless, those Catholic Bishops of Britain, had they but known and
believed (as now it is given out) the Pope to be Iure divine, by divine right,
and Gods appointment the Monarch of the whole Church, they would have yielded
obedience to Austine, and in him to the Pope; but they opposed it as being
urged by those of the Romish faction; so that it was not then, (as now it is
made) one of the chief heads of the Romish Faith: for now a days, men are
made to believe that out of the Communion of the Roman Church, nothing but
hell can be looked for: and subjection to the Bishop of Rome, as to the visible
Head of the Universal Church, V^i^as cum Capite R^m^no (...) s^mper ^uit nota
(...) ^atholicae. Bell. li. 3 de (...). milit. cap. 2. and 5. -- et ^xtravagant
Commun. dema^orit. and ^bed. Cap. unam Sanct. Sub^sse R^m. Pontifici omni
^umanae creatur^ desinimus omnino esse de necessitate solutis.
Is required as a matter necessary to salvation. But this was no part, nor
Article of the ancient Britains Creed, and therefore they withstood it; and if
it were no Article of Faith them, surely it is none now a days.

To close up this point: hereby is overthrown the maine Article of the Roman
Creed. For, if (as the Papists ^ulla pij. 4. pro soim^ Iuramenti professions
fid^i. Dat. Romans an. 1564.
say and swear) there be no salvation out of the Roman Communion, then is the
case like to go hard with the one thousand two hundred British Monks of
Bangor, styled Saints and Martyrs, that died out of the Roman Communion, and
yet within the Communion of Saints. But this Grand Imposture of the [now]
Roman Church, is notably discovered by the learned and zealous Bishop of
Coventrie and Lichfield, Bishop Morton, (...) L. Bishop of Durham.
Doctor Morton, now Lord Bishop of Durham.

My conclusion shall be this: out of the holy Catholic Church of the Creed,
there is no salvation; but out of the fellowship of the Roman Church there
has been, and is salvation, as appears in the case of these our British
Martyrs, therefore the present Roman Church is not (as it is pretended) the
Catholic Church of the old Creed, but a particular of the new Trent Creed.

Proceed to name your men.

PROTESTANT.
I name Gregory the great, whom Bellarmine usually Bellar. de Scriptor. eccles.
sect. 7. et li. 2. de Euchar. cap. 22.
places in this seventh Age, for that he lived unto the year 605, what time
(as Trithemius says) Trithem. de Script. Eccles.
he dyed: Now also lived his Scholar Isidore Bishop of Sivil in Spain,
usually Trithem. ibid. -- et in praefat. Etymolog. edit Venet. ann. 1583.
termed Isidore the younger. Now also by Bellarmine's account (though others
make him much ancienter) lived Hesychius Bishop of Jerusalem, with other
Worthies, as namely the Britains of Wales, as also Saint Aidan, and Finan, now
also was held the sixth General Council.

PA.
I challenge Saint Gregory, he is ours.

PRO.
Gregory indeed lived in a troublesome time, whiles the Goths and Vandals
overranne Italy, and Rome was besieged by the Lombards. There was then also
great decay in knowledge, and scarcity of able men to furnish the Church
withal; and few in Italy (as Baronius says Vt ^aud in promptu esset, qui
utriusque linguae peritus esset. Baron. Annal. tom. 8. ann. 593 nu. 62.
) that were skilled both in Greek and Latin. Yea Gregory himself Nam no^ nec
Gr^ecum (...) Greg tom. 2. ^p. lib. 9. epist. 69.
pro^esseth that he was ignorant of the Greek tongue; yet was he st^led the
great, and yet not so great, as godly and modest. It is commonly said of him,
That he was the last of the good Bishops of Rome, and the first of the bad
ones; Primus Papa et Pontificij Cho^i pre^ult^r, and ultim^^ Epis^opus Romanus.
And R^ve^. Critic. s^cri li 4. cap. 29.
That he was the first Pope, and leader of the Pontifician companies, and the
last Bishop of Rome. He was supe^stitious in diverse things, he lived in a
declining age, and as in time, so in some truths came short of his
predecessors; yet, he taught not as your Trent Papists do, but joined with us
in diverse weighty points of Religion. ^^. Panke^ Collectane^ out of S. Gregory.


Of the Scriptures sufficiency, and Canon.
Gregory held the Scriptures sufficiency, saying, In ho^ volumine cun^^^ q^e
aedis^cant s^ripta continentur. Greg. in Ezechiel. li. 1. Hom. 9. tom. 2.
Whatsoever serves for edification, is contained in the volume of the
Scriptures; Flu^nta pl^nissim^, quia de quibuscunque s^rupul^ in scriptu^is
consilium quaeritur ^ine minoratione ad plenum invenitur. Id in Cant. cap. 5.
wherein are all resolutions of doubts fully and plentifully to be found; they
being like a full Spring, that cannot be drawn dry.

He approved the vulgar use of the Scriptures, Greg lib 4. Ep. 40. ad Theod.
(...) to. 2.
exhorting a Layman to study them; because (says he) Scriptura Epistola Dei
ad Creaturam suam. Id. li. 4. ep. 40 Et p^r ^am Deus loquitur omne quod vult.
Id. moral. lib. 16. cap 17. tom. 1.
they be as it were Gods Letter or Epistle to his Creature, wherein he
reveals his whole mind to him.

And lest any complain of the difficulty of the Scriptures, he compares them
to a Scriptura qu^si flu^ius est planus and altus, in quo and Agnu^ ambulet,
and (...) epist. ad L^and. cap. 4. Praet^^. in Job to. 1.
River, wherein there are as well shallow Foords for Lambs to wade in, as
depths for the Elephant to swim in. And Isidore says, that Vtrisque manet
communis, et parvulis, et perfectis. Isidor. de sum. bono lib. 1. cap. 18.
the Scripture is common to petty Scholars, and to Proficients. And whereas
Heretics use to allege Scripture for themselves; Gregory says, Greg.
Moral. lib. 8. cap. 8.
they may be confuted by Scripture it self, even as Goliath was slain with
his own sword.

Gregory held the books of Maccabees Apocryphal; We do not amiss (says Ex
libri^ lic^t non C^nonic^s (Machabe^r^m testi^^nium pr^feramus Id. moral. li 19
ca. 17.
he) if we produce a testimony out of the book of Maccabees, though not
Canonical, yet published for the i^struction of the Church. And Occham
accordingly reports Gregory's judgment, saying, Secundum Gregorium in
moralibus liber ^udit^, T^hia, et Macabeo^u^, Ecclesiasticus, atque liber
Sapientiae non sunt recipiendi ad confirmandum aliqui^ in side. Occam. Dialog.
part. 3. tract. 1. lib. 3 c. 16.
The book of Judith, Tobias, the Maccabees, Ecclesiasticus, and Wisdom, are
not to be received for the confirmation of any doctrine of Faith. Isidore
says, In his Apocryphis etsi invenitur aliqua veritas, tamen propter multa
fals^, rulla est in e^s canonica authoritas. Isidor. Etymolog. lib 6. cap. 2.
In these Apocryphal although there be some truth to be found, yet by reason
of the many errors therein, they are not of Canonical auth^rity.

Of Communion under both kinds; and number of Sacraments.
Saint Gregory in his Dialogues (if they be his) In nav^ corpus et s^nguinem
Redemptoris acceperunt. Greg. Dialog lib. 3. cap. 36 tom. 2.
tells us of some that were going to Sea (some whereof happily were Laymen)
carried with them the consecrat^d body and blood of the Lord in the Ship, and
there received it.

And again, Ejus ibi corpus sumitur, cujus caro in po^uii salutem parti^ur;
ejus sangu^ non ^am in manus infidelium, sed ad fidelium ora perfunditur. Id.
Dial. li. 1.4. ca. 58.
His body is there rec^ived, his flesh is there divided for the peoples
salvation; his blood is not now powered out upon the hands of Infidels, but into
the mouth of the Faithful. He speaks expressly of the Faithful, and of the
people.

And in his Homily touching the Passover he says, Quid sit sa^gu^ Agni, non
jam audiendo, sed bi^endo didicistis; qui sanguis super utrumque pos^em
poni^ur, quando non solum Ore Corporis, sedetiam Ore Cordis ha^^itur. Id. in
Sab. Paschae Homil. 22. tom. 2.
What is meant by the blood of Christ, you have now learned, not by hearing of
it, but by drinking of it; which blood is then put on both posts, when it is
drawn in both by the mouth of the body, and of the heart. Herein Gregory
resembles the partaking of Christ's blood in the Eucharist, to the blood of the
Paschall Lamb in the twelfth of Exodus, stricken upon both po^ts of the door:
thereby noting the mouth and the heart, each whereof after their manner receive
Christ: for with the mouth and corporally we receive the wine, which is the
Sacrament of his blood; and with our heart, and by faith we receive the thing
Sacramental, the blood it self.

Besides, he speaks expressly of drinking, and the terms he uses,
hauritur and perfunditur, That Christ's blood is shed, and taken as a draught,
demonstrate, that he speaks not of partaking Christ's blood, as it is joined to
his body, and enclosed in his veins, but as severed from it; as my worthy and
learned friend Doctor Featly has The Grand Sacrilege, sect. 7.
observed.

Isidore says, Vt charita^e omnes reconcil^at^ inv^cem digne sacramento
corpori^ et sanguinus Christi consocientur. Isidor. de Divin. Offi^. lib. 1.
cap. 15.
The fourth prayer is brought in for the kiss of Peace, that all b^ing
reconciled by charity, may join in the worthy participation of Christ's body
and blood. Omnes, all; the people as well as the Priests.

Isidore says, Sunt autem Sacramenta ^aptismus et chrisma, corpus and sang^is
Ch^ist^. Isid. Origin sive Etymolog. lib 6. cap. 19.
These be the Sacraments, to wit, Baptism and Chrysme, and the body and blood
of Christ. Now with Baptism he joins Chrysme, because their manner was to
anoint those who were baptized.

Of the Eucharist.
Isidore says, Sed panis, quia confirmat corpus, ideo corpus Christi nun
^upatur; vtaum autem quia sanguinem operatur in c^rne, ideo ad sanguinem
Christi re^ertur -- haec autem duo sunt visibilia sanctificata tamen per S S.
in Sacramentum divini corporis transeunt. Isidor. de Offic. Ecclesiast. lib. 1.
cap. 18.
Bread because it strengthens the body, is therefore called Christ's body; and
wine, because it works blood in the flesh, it has therefore relation to the
blood of Christ: but these two being sanctified by the Holy Ghost, are changed
into a Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ. He says, Christ called bread
his body, to wit, Sacramentally, a sign, a Sacrament of his body, and not
Substantially: he says, Bread is changed into a Sacrament of Christ's body,
which notes a Sacramental Conversion, and not Substantial: he says, Bread
strengthens man's body, bread Substantially, and not Accidentally, so that it
is not the roundnesse, or figure of bread that strengthens man's body, nor the
color of wine that is turned into blood.

Hesychius says, Comedimus a^^em nunc cibum, sumentes ^jus memoriam pass^onis.
Helych. in Levit. lib. 1. c. 2.
We eat this food by receiving the memory of his Passion: not of his Glory,
but of his Passion: the same Author says, Mysterium di^itur, quod simul panis
and (...) est. Id. Ibid. lib. 2. cap. 8.
Our mystery is both bread and flesh, to wit, bread in substance, and indeed;
and Christ's body, not in substance, but in a mystery.

Of Images, and Prayer to Saints.
Gregory allowed only an Greg. Epist. 109. ad Se^en. ep lib. 7 tom 2.
Historical use of Images; otherwise he speaks positively, that Adorare ve^o
Imagines, omnibus modis d^vita. Id. l. 9. ep. 9.
The worshipping of Images, is by all means to be avoided: and though he
misliked the breaking of them, yet he commended those that forbad the adoration
of them: yea he commands the people to In ad^ratione solius T^initat^ humiliter
prost^^nantur. Id. ibid.
Kneel and bow down to the omnipotent Trinity only: and therefore not too,
or before an Image. And Cassander says, Non ut adore^tur, sed ut imperiti
picturis i^spiciendis, ^aud aliter ac literis legendis, rerum gestarum
admoncre^tur, et ad pietatem incitarentur. Cassand. Consult. 21.
that Gregory therein declared the judgment of the Roman Church, to wit,
that Images are kept not to be adored, and worshipped; but that the ignorant by
beholding those Pictures, might as by written records, be put in mind of what
has been formerly done, and be thereupon stirred up to Piety.

Concerning Prayer, as we find in Gregory very rarely any prayer to Saints;
so unto the Virgin Mary not any one. Which we may conceive he would not have
omitted, if he had believed, as diverse Papists maintain: That she is a
Savioresse, a Mediatresse: An non aperte s^ribit Gabr. Riel [in Can. li. ^.]
patrem caelestem dimidium Regni sui dedisse B. Virgini Caelorum Reginae, idque
in Esther significatum ^uisse. Cassand. de Offic. boni vi^i and Consult. Art.
21.
That as Assuerus offered half of his kingdom to Queen Esther; so Christ
reserving the kingdom of Justice to himself, has granted the other moitie,
the kingdom of mercy to his mother.

PA.
Was not Invocation of Saints used in the Church Service in Saint Gregory's
days.

PRO.
Be it so, that some such devotions were used in his time, yet in the ancient
Missals, there is no such form to be found. In them indeed the Saints names in
their Anniversarie solemnities, and Holidays, were remembered, and put into
their Memento, but they were not prayed unto, men prayed only to God, that he
would give them grace to follow their examples, and make them partakers of that
happiness which those blessed ones already enjoyed; and at that time, when
this alteration began, and that the Gregorian form took place, the Invocation
was not brought into the Liturgy, and public prayers of the Church in Direct
form, but men prayed still unto God only, though desiring him the rather to
respect them, for that not only their brethren on earth, but they also that
are in heaven, cease not to pray for them: neither is there any other form of
prayer found in the missall, but in the Sequences and Litanies only, Doctor
Field, of the Church, lib. 3. cap. 20.
says Learned Doctor Field. Gregory indeeed O^d navi^ Missale and Gradua^e,
and Antiphonarium. (...) de Vorag^ sermon. ^1 de Greg. 1. Gregor. subjunxit
postulationes, di^sque nostros in tu^ pace disponas. Cassand. Liturg. c. 21.
Pamel. Liturg page 656. tom. 1.
added some things to the Canon; the Alle-lujah, the Kyrie Ele^son, Lord have
mercy upon us: the Orizon, Di^sque nostros in pace disponas, Give peace in our
times O Lord, together with other Collects. But I do not find either in
Cassander or Pamelius their Liturgies, that Gregory brought in any direct
form of Prayer to Saints. Afterward^, Trith^m^ de script. Eccles.
Nocherus the Abbot, who lived about the yea^e eight hundred and fifty, Abbas
Nocherus de S. Gallo Sequentias pro^neumis composuit. Cassand. Liturg cap 21.
composed the Sequences, and so when the ancient Missalls were abandoned, it is
no marvel if Invocation of Saints stepped up in their place.

Lastly, the form and manner of Saintly Invocation used about the year 600,
in Saint Gregory's days, differs extremely from that which was used by
Papals in later times, as may appear by these instances following. The Hymn
of Thomas Becket runs thus in the H^r^e B. Mariae ad usum Sarum.
Salisbury Primer: Tu per Thomae sanguinem,
Quem pro te impendit;
Fac nos Christ scandere,
Quo Thomas ascendit.
By the blood of Thomas,
Which for thee he did spend;
Make us thither O Christ to climb,
Whither Thomas did ascend.


To the blessed Virgin they Offic B. Mariae pi^ v. ^ussu edit And the Office of
the B. Virgin, according to the reformed Latin at Saint Omers. 1621.
pray: Maria matter gratiae,
Matter misericordiae;
Tu nos ab host protege,
Et hora mortis suscipe.
Mary, mother of heavens grace,
Mother, where mercy has chief place.
From cruel Foe, our souls defend,
And them receive, when life shall end.


The Cross is likewise devoutly saluted in this Breviar. Romans Sabbat. infra.
Hebd^m. 4. Quadrages.
manner. O Crux ave spes unica,
Hoc passionis tempore;
Auge pijs justitiam,
Reisque dona veniam.
All Hail O Cross, our only hope,
In this time of the passion:
Increase thou justice to the godly,
And give to sinners pardon.


Of Faith and Merits.
Hesychius says, Gratia vero ex misericordia, atque compassione praebetur, and
fide comprehenditur sol^, non ex operibus. Hesych. in Levit. li. 4 cap. 14.
The grace of God is given only of mercy and favor, and is embraced and
received by only Faith.

Gregory held not justification by inherent righteousness; for speaking even
of the second justification, he teaches, that we are justified before God,
freely by grace: Iustus igitur Advocatus nos^er, justos nos de^endet in (...);
qui^ nosm^tipsos ^ognos^^mus and ac^^samus in justos. Greg. tom. 2 in Ezech ad
finem.
Our just advocate (says he) will in judgment defend us for just, if so be
we know and accuse our selves to be unrighteous and unjust.

He confesses, Omnis humana justitia injustitia esse convincitur, si districte
judi^etur. Id. lib. 9. Mor. cap. 14.
That all our righteousness is manifestly proved to be unrighteousness, if
once it be strictly examined according to justice. He accounts a man's best
actions imperfect, Ipsa nostra per^ectio culp^ non ^a^et, nisi han^ severus
Iud^ae in subtili lan^e examinis misericordit^r ponsite^. Id. Moral. lib. 5. c.
8^ and l. 29 c^ 9.
and unable to abide the Judges trial, unless he weigh them by the scale of
his mercy.

Isidore says, Cathari propter munditiam it^ se nominarunt; gloriantes enim de
suis meritis negant p^eniton^ibus veniam peccatorum Isidor. li. 8. orig. five
E^^molog. cap. 5.
it was noted a property in the Catherists, or ancient Puritans, to glory of
their merits.

Gregory held not Merit of Condignitie, but appealed to the court of M^cie,
saying, Ad vitam non ex meriti^, sed ex veni^ convales^o. Gregor Mor. lib. 9.
cap. 14. Et de sola misericordia tua praesumens impetrare quod non de meritis
meis spero. Id. in Psalm. 1. Poenitent^ tom. 2.
I grow on to eternal life, not by the merit of my works, but by the pardon of
my sins, presuming to obtain that by the only mercy of God, which I dare
not hope for by my own deserts; and hereof, as also of the imperf^ction of our
works, he gives a good reason, saying, Mala nostra pu^a mala (...), ^^na vero
quae nos habere credimus pura bona esse nequaquam possunt. Id. Mor. lib. 35.
cap. ult.
that the evil that is in us is simply evil; but the good that we think we
have, it is not absolutely pure, and simply good: Quamlibe^ rectis operibus
insud^mus, veram munditiam nequaquam apprehendimus, sed imitamur. Id. Mor. lib.
9. c. 28.
So that how much soever we travail in good works, we never attain to true
purity, but only imitate it.

And this may suffice to show what religion Saint Gregory professed; other
testimonies may be seen in Master Panks Collectanea out of Saint Gregory, and
Saint Bernard, showing that in most fundamental points they are ours.

PA.
Gregory De quibusdam levibus culpis esse ante judicium purgatorius ignis,
credendus est. Greg. tom 2. Dial. lib. 4 cap. 39.
held a Purgatory for some smaller faults.

PRO.
He held not your Purgatory; his was only for venial and light faults; yours
is for such as have not Propter satisfactionem pro Mortalibus remissis non
plen^egrave; expletam. Bellar. de purg^t. l. 1. c. 3. Hinc.
fully satisfied for the temporal punishment due to their mortal sins.
Again, his differs from yours in situation, for you place yours in some
quarter bordering on hell: but Gregory Id. ibid. lib 4 cap. 40. and 55.
tells us of certain souls that for their punishment, were confined to
Bathes, and such other places here on earth.

Besides, Gregory in his Dialogues, whence you would prove your Purgatory,
tells many strange tales; as, of one Stephen a Priest, Dial. l. 3. c. 20.
who had the Devil so serviceable to him, as to draw off his hose: of Dial. l.
1. c. 8.
Boniface that wanting money, procured diverse crowns of our Lady, and such
like stuff: insomuch that your Canus says, Gregorius in Dialogis quaedam
miracula scribit vulgo ^ac^ata and credita, quae hujus presertim saeculi
Aristarchi esse censebunt. Can. loc. Theol. lib. 11. cap. 6.
Gregory in his Dialogues has published such miracles, commonly received and
believed, which the censurers of this Age will think to be doubtful and
uncertain.

Besides, Gregory had his Purgatory, and Soul masses from visions, Dial. l
4. c. 55.
and feigned apparitions of Ghosts, Deuteronomy. 18. v. 11, 12.
which the Scripture holds unwarrantable.

And yet Gregory upon occasion of that place of Ecclesiastes, Eccles. 11.3.
If the tree fall toward the South, or the North, where it falls there it
shall be, makes another inference; namely this: In die mortis suae justus ad
Austrum cadit peccator ad Aq^^lonem; qui^ et justus per ^ervorem spiritu^ ad
gaudi^ ducit^^; and peccator cu^ Apostata Angelo in frigido suo cord
reprobatur. Greg. Mor. lib. 12. cap. 3.
The just one in the day of his death falls Southward, and the sinner
Northward; for the just by the warmth of the spirit, is carried into bliss,
but the sinner with the revolting Angel, in his benumbed heart, is reprobated
and cast away. And Olympiodor. in ca. 11 Ecclesiast.
Olympiodore who lived about the year 500, makes the very same inference; and
Gregory elsewhere to the same purpose says, Cum humani casus tempore, ^ive
sanslus, ^ive malignus spiritus egredientem animam claus^ra carnis, acceperit,
in aeternum secum sine ulla permutatione retinebit, ut nec ^xaltat^ ad
supplicium pr^rua^, nec mersa aeternis supplicijs, ultra ad remedium ereptionis
ascendat. Greg. moral. lib. 8. cap. 13.
that at the time of a man's dissolution, either the good or evil spirit
rec^ives the soul as it comes out of the cloister of the body; and there
without any change at all, for ever retains it: that being on^e exalted, it
can never come to be punished: and being pl^nged into eternal pain, can never
thence be delivered.

Now if (according to these testimonies) after death there be no deliverance;
but that the soul for ever remains in that degree and order wherein death
takes it: if there be no change after this life (such as the Papists imagine
theirs to be from the pains of Purgatory, to the joys of heaven) surely then
there can be no Purgatory, nothing but heaven or hell, whither they that come
abide for ever. Now let us see what Gregory held touching the Supremacy.

PA.
Gregory maintained his Supremacy, did he not?

PRO.
Whatsoever he did, Stapleton strives to uphold it, by corrupting a place in
Gregory, who speaking of Saint Peter and other Apostles, says, Q^id aliud
quam s^^gularium sunt plebium c^pita? and tame^ sub uno capite omnes membra
sunt Ecclesiae. Greg. lib. 4. Epist. 38.
that they were all members of the Church, under one Head, meaning Christ; as
his own words make it clear. Now Stapleton, to make the Pope Head of the
Church, cites the words thus: Singularium plebium capita, sub uno Capite
Petro. Stapleton. princip. Doctrinal. lib. 6. cap. 7.
They are all members of the Church, under one head Peter, shuffling in the
name Peter: but for Saint Gregory, he knew not your modern papal
Supremacy, and when the Sea of Constantinople challenged the style of
Universal Bish^p, he opposed it.

PA.
He might dislike it in another, and yet claim it himself.

PRO.
He disclaimed it in any whosoever. Now so it was, John Bishop of
Constantinople, seeing the Emperors seat, translated thither, and other
Provinces governed by Lievtenants, as also Rome besieged by the Lumbards,
thought this a fit season for the advancement of his chair, that the Imperial
City should also have the high^st chair in the Church; as the Emperor counted
himself Lord of the World, so he would be styled (...) Greg^. lib 4. ^p. 3^.
Oecumenicall, or Universal Patriarch in the Church.

Now when John affected this Title, Gregory complained not, that he wronged
his See, by usurping that style, as if it had belonged to the Pope; but he
mislikes the transc^^dent power claymed by that style, and he calls it (...)
Id. lib 4 ep. 32. (...) Id. lib. 4. ep. 36.
A style of noveltie, and prophannesse, such as never any godly man, nor any of
his predecessors ever used: Absit^ (...) Christianoru^ nomen (...) Blasphemiae.
Id. li 4 ep. 32.
A name of Bl^sphemie, Contra E^^ngelicam sent^a^am B. petrum Ca^^numque
statuta. Id. lib. 4. ep 34.
A thing contrary to the Churches Canons, to Saint Peter, and to the holy
Gospels.

Yea, he pronounces any one that should presume to challenge the for^said
title, To be the Ego si^entur di^^, quisqu^ ^e u^^versa, em Sacerdot^m (...),
vel vo^ari des^^e^at in ^latione su^ (...) quia (...) praepacit. I^. lib 6.
epist. 30.
very for^runner of Antichrist, because herein he lifts himself above his
brethren.

PA.
Gregory forbore this Title in humility, Ill^d recusavit, ad ^acili^s
com^rimend^m super^ia^ Episcopi Constantin^p. B^ll de ^ont. lib. 2 c. ult.
Re^pondeo.
thereby to repress John's insolency.

PRO.
This is, as if a King should renounce his Royal Title, to the end that a
Rebel challenging it, might disclaim it.

Gregory indeed was an humble man, and (as one says of him) Mi^^s capi^b^t
sola^^ax m^ibus divitijs, and (...) quam ^remita quid^^ ex Feel (...). Joan.
(...) ule^us in Festo omn^um S. Ser. 2.
When he was in his Iollitie, and Pontificalibus, he was not so much delighted
therewith, as an Hermit was with his Cat, that he used to play withal in his
Cell.

Gregory indeed Vt ^t ^umilitatem (...) in mente, et tamen (...) d^gnitatem
(...) i^ ^ono^e. Greg. l^b. 4. e^ist. 36.
professes to be humble in mind, but still so, as to preserve the honor of
his place. Gregory would lose nothing of his freehold I warrant you.

PA.
Gregory found fault with this Title, in the sense that John desired so to be
universal and sole Bishop: and the rest to be his Vt alij non sint Episcopi,
sed Vicarij. Bell. de Pont. li. 2. cap. ult.
Vicars or Deputies.

PRO.
It is not likely the Bishop of Constantinople (though he were a proud man)
would keep all others from being bishops; that is, that they should neither
ordain Priests, nor excommunicate, nor absolve, nor sit in Counsel, but
himself alone do all. Besides if John had sought this, surely the Greek
Bishops who consented to John's title of being their universal Patriarcke (in
respect of Order, though not of Jurisdiction;) would never have yielded to have
made themselves only Vicars to that one bishop, and so deprive themselves of
al Episcopal Jurisdiction. Yea the same bishops, though they submitted
themselves to the bishop of Constantinople, and approved his Title, yet
notwithstanding they exercised their ancient Jurisdiction over their several
Sees; they were not degraded by John, or his Successor Cyriacus, both which
affected that Title.

The true and undoubted meaning then of Gregory, (as his words Vt et nulli
subesse, ^t solus omnibus praeesse videretur. Gregor. lib. 4. epist. 38.
import) was this; namely, that Gregory (by impugning the Title of Universal
bishop) would have no Bishop so principal, as to make all others, as members
subject to his Head-ship: and is not the charge of bishops at this day under
the Papacy, for the most part Ti^ular, they being wholly at the Popes beck.

PA.
Was the Title of Universal Bishop so odious.

PRO.
It was, in that sense which Gregory taxed in the bishop: oth^rwise, neither
he, nor we mislike such Vnive^sall bishops, as with Saint Paul, 2. Corinthians.
11.28.
Have the care of all Churches, and in this respect godly bishops when they
meet in Councels, and in their own Diocesses; whiles by their wholesome
advice, admonition, or reproof; by their writing, or teaching; they instruct
others in the truth, prevent Schism, and stop the mouth of Heresy; may be
called Bishops of the Universal Church. Thus was (...) 2 p^g. 419.
Athanasius called a Bishop of the Catholic Church, not as it precisely
signifies Vniv^rsall, but rightly believing, or holding the Catholic Faith.

PA.
What conclude you out of all this?

PRO.
That which makes strongly against the Papacy. For now a dai^s, this Style of
Universal Bishop (which Gregory held to b^e the Harbinger of Antichrist) is
brought in as a maine proof of the Popes Supremacy. (...) 2 de (...) 31.


Neither could Gregory restrain his Successors from bearing this Title: for
Boniface the third, who next save one succeeded Gregory (...) Plat. in
Boni^^^. 3.
Obtained of Phocas the Emperor, not without great contention, that the Sea of
Rome should be called the head of all Churches, being the same place of
pre-eminence in ^ffect which John in Gregory's time so much affected.

Now by this the Reader may perceive, and that from the tongue and pen of one
of their best Popes, that were since his time; that in Gregory's judgment, his
successors that enjoy this swelling Title, and transcendent power are proved
to be Antichristian Bishops.

Lastly, the Reader may observe, who it was that gave the Pope this
jurisdiction; it was even that usurper Phocas, (...) W^^^monast. ad An. 6^^.
who murdered his master Maurice the Emper^ur, and then conf^rred this
profane Title on Pope Boniface; a fit Chapleine for such a Pa^ron.

Hitherto we have treated of Saint Gregory's Faith, and visited the College
of Bangor, the Foundation whereof is ascribed to King Lucius, from whose time
unto the entrance of Austine the Monk 438. years were ^xpired; In all which
space the Christian Faith was both taught, and embraced in this Island,
notwithstanding the continual persecutions of the Romans, Huns, Picts, and

labors the Gospel was repla^ted amongst the Inhabitants of those vast
Moun^taines; and farther spread it self into these Northern parts, what time
as Edwin and Oswald Kings of Northumbe^land sent for Saint Aidan and Finan into
Scotland to convert their Subjects to the Bed^ Hist. lib. 3. ca. 3.
Faith.

PA.
What were this Aidan and Finan?

PRO.
They were the worthy instruments which the Lord raised up for the good of our
country, for by the ministry of Beda lib. 3. Hist. cap. 3. and 6.
Aidan was the kingdom of Northumberland recovered from Paganism: (whereunto
belonged then, beside the shire of Northumberland, and the lands beyond it unto
Edenborrough, Frith, Cumberland also and Westmoreland, Lancashire, Yorkshire,
and the Bishopric of Durham:) And by the means of Id. ibi^. cap. 21^ 22, 24
Finan, not only the kingdom of the East Saxons (which contained Essex,
Middlesex, and half of Hertfordshire) regained, but also the large kingdom of
Mercia, with the shires comprehended under it, was first converted unto
Christianity; so that these two for their extraordinary holiness, Id. ibid.
cap. 3, 4, 5^ 17, 26.
and painfulness in preaching the Gospel were ^xceedingly reverenced by all
that knew them; Aidan especially, Vade ab omnibus eti^am his qui de Pascha

Who although he could not keep Easter (says Bid) contrary to the manner of
them which sent him, yet he was careful diligently to perform the works of
Faith, Godlin^sse and Love, after the manner used by all holy men; whereupon
he was worthily beloved of all, even of them also who thought otherwise of
Easter than he did, and was reverenced not only of the meaner rank, but of
the Bishops themselves, Honorius of Canterbury, and Felix of the East Angles.

says, that Basilius Bishop of Gortyna, the Metropolis of Creete, (which was
then under the Archbishop of Rome and the Bishop of Ravenna, were there to
represent the Roma^e Church.

The truth is, your Romanists cannot endure t^is G^eeke Council, because it
sets the Patriarch of Constantinople, cheek by joule with the Roman Bishop.

In a word, if some Canons of this Council be justly excepted against, this
mak^s not against us; for we warrant not all that goes u^d^r tha^ Councels

Scholar Alcuinus, counted one of the Founders of the Universitie of Paris,
and Schoolmasters to Charles the Great; by whom, or his procurement were
written those Libri Carolini, King Charles his books, opposing the second
Nicen Synod which stood for Image worship. Now also lived Antonie the Monk,
and Damascen, one that laid the foundation of Schoole-divinitie among the
Greeks, as Peter Lombard afterward did among the Latins: he was indeed a
Patron of Image Worship, yet in some other things he was Orthodoxe, and in
those we comply with him. Now also was held a famous Council at Constantinople
in the East, and another at Frankford in the West, both of them opposing the
second Nicen Synod.

Now also lived Adelbert of France, Samson of Scotland, and Claudius Clemens of
the same nation, Bishop of Auxer^e in France: Adelb^r^^s, and Clemen^, and
Sampson^ ^t complures alij ^ B^ni^ac^o dissenserunt, quod re^iqut^rum

and his followers in Northumberland, where also Saint Cuthbert had his
education.

You will lose your claim, for though he were tainted with superstition, and

of Religion, he was an Adversary to your Trent Faith.

Bid was a Priest, he lived in the Monastery of Saint Peter and Saint Paul at
Weere-mouth near Durham: A great Clerk, and writer of the English Story.

Of the Scriptures Sufficiency and Canon.
Damascen says; (...). Damascen. de Orthodox. fide. lib 1 cap. 1.
Whatsoever is delivered unto us in the Law, and the Prophets, by the Apostles
and Evangelists; that we receive, acknowledge and reverence: and besid^s these
we require nothing else. The same Damascen numbers all those books, and those
only as Canonical, that we do; and adds, That (...). Id. ibid. lib. 4.
cap. 18.
the Books of Wisdom and Jesus the Son of Syrach are good Books, and
contain good Lessons; but that they are not numbered in this account, neither
were laid up in the Arc.

And our Alcuinus, Abbot of Saint Martins at Tours in France, writing against
Elipantus bishop of Toledo, tells him that he urged authori^ies out of the book
of Jesus the son of Syrach: but (says he Quem librum ^. Hi^ron^ atque

Of Images, and Prayer to Saints.
Concerning Images, venerable Bede (as we find him cited by Gerson Vnde Bed^,
(...) omnino prohibentur s^eri ad ^un^ v^^elicet sin^m, ut a^orentur, and
colantur. Beda, tes^e Ioan^e Ge^s^^ p^r^. 2. compen. Theolog. de primo praecepto
the Chancellor of Paris) says, That Images are not simply forbidden to be
made, but they are utterly forbidden to be made to this end, to be worshipped
and adored.

Charles the Great ( Nil si non ^abentur d^^ogant^ ^i^, si h^bentur,
pr^erogant: ^um tamen a^dicat^e quandam in^auta^ levitat^ afferant, a l^^at^e
vero ^ulpa^ inurant (...). M. lib. ^. advers. S^nod. (...) C^ssand^om
Cons^l^^ar^^^ 2^. de cultu Sanct.
as Cassander says) has pithily and wittily stated this question of Images;
that it is no prejudice to want t^em, nor privilege to have them; that such as
utterly reject them, may be taxed with ^icklenesse, and they that worship them,
branded with folly.

In this Age there arose great contention in the Church, touching the matter of
Images; the Greek Emp^rou^s, Leo Isaurus, Constantine, Nic^phorus, Stauratius,
Leo Armenus, Michael Balbus, Theophilus, and others their ^uc^essours, opposi^g
them in the East; and on the other side, Gregory the second, and third, Paul
the first, Stephen the fourth, Adrian the first, and other Popes of Rome as
stiffly upholding them in the West.

In a Council of 338 Bishops Council. Constant (...) mag habitum est. (...) 754.
Bin. Conc. to. 3. page 2^^.
held at Constantinople Anno 754, they were solemnly condemned; for they
banished all other Images, and determined, That there was one only Image
appointed by Christ, to wit, the blessed bread and wine in the Eucharist, which
represent to us the body and blood of Christ: there was decreed under
Constantine, nicknamed C^pronymus; Qui imagin^m ^^^u^ ^uerit parare aut
ad^^are, aut in Eccl^si^, aut in p^ivat^ domo con^i^^uere, si Episcopus fuerit
depen^t^r decretum extat in (...). Conc. 2. ^pud Bin. Act 6. p^g. 377.
That none should privately in houses, or publicly in Churches, procure,
keep, or worship any Image, upon pain of deposition. Zonaras says, (...).
Zonar. h^st. to. 3 p. 88 Basil. 155^.
That in the hearing of all the people, they openly forbad the worship of
Images, calling all such as adored them, Idolaters: and speaking of the
Emperor Leo Armenus, he says, (...). Id. Ibid. p 105.
He was mightily bent against them, insomuch as he decreed utterly to abandon
them. Thus did those Ezekiah's of Greece, being strongly opposed by the Papal
fo^ces.

Now so it was, afterward in another Co^n^el of 350 bishop (...). Ni^^n. 2.
h^bit. est an. 787. B^n. in not. in i^. C^n^il.
held at Nice in the year 787. Images were set on foot again, and this
Council was cal^ed and swayed under that Doctresse Irene the Empress, (...)

By whose Council and procurement, the Peers whom she had corrupted, shut up
her son Constantine the Emperor in the palace where he was borne, and there
they put out his eyes so that he died of hearts grief. Thus they put out the
eyes of him that saw, and set up Images that have Eyes and see not: and all
this was done (says the story) that her son being deposed, she might (...),

But this dec^ee of the Nicen Synod, repealed by that at Frankford, was not
half so bad as that which followed, when Aquinas set up School, and taught,

That the Crucifixe, an^ Image of Christ must be adored with the same honor

Fathers happily stood but for veneration, Bishop Bilson of S^bjection 4 p^rt.

or outward reverence of Images, in passing by them, or s^anding before them,
as friends use to salute or embrace one another. Howsoever, the Nicen d^^r^e
was r^j^cted as repu^nant to the doctrine of G^ds Church, by the P^inc^s and
bish^ps of England fi^^, about the year 792. And by Charles the Great
afte^w^rd; and by the b^sh^ps of Italy, France, and Germany, which by his
appointment were gathered together in the Frankford Counce^ in the year 794.

Rog^r Hovede^ says, ^
^harl^s the French King sent a Synod^ll i^to Britain, directed unto him from
Constantinople, in the which book many things (out alas) inconvenient, an^
^epugnant to right faith, were found, especially it was con^^^med a most by the
unanimous consent of all the Eastern Doctors, ^o l^sse than three hundred or
more, that Images ought to ^e worshipped, which thing the Church of God does
altogether d^test: against which Synodall b^oke, Albinus wrote an Epistle
m^rveilouslie con^irmed by authority of divine Scripture, and ca^ried the same
to the French King, together with the fore. s^^d book, in the name of our
Bishops and Princes.

the Pope confirmed the Frankford C^uncell in one part, and canc^lled it in
another; to wit, in that point, touching adoration of Images, whereunto the
Popes Legates never consented.

PRO.
This b^wrayes the Popes partial d^aling, to make the Counc^l only to serve
his own turn. But what if it wa^ted ^is approbation? the thi^d Canon of the
Chalced^n Counc^l, that gave the Sea of Constantinople the precedence b^f^re
other Patriarchs, as the n^xt after the Bishop of Rome, was opposed by Pope
Leo's L^gat^s; and yet the Canon was decreed and pass^d, and the Council is
held for General, howsoever the P^pes Legates Co^tradictio nostra his gesti^

contradicted it. For they were to be ruled by the mayor part of the Councels
votes; neither do we find that anciently the Pope had a negative or casting
voice in Councels. And therefore the Chalcedon Council, notwithstanding the
Popes opposition professes; (...) ^mnes dicimus, (...) om^ib^s placent. Ibid.

Very well, for as Saint Austine says, (...) August. de (...) Dona^ist. l 2 c

Even full and plenarie Councels themselves, may be amended by the later.
Neither does he mean it in matter of fact, but in point of doctrine; for
Austine there speaks of Re^aptization; and ^m^ndari, is as much as e mendis
purgari, to be rectified, wherein it erred; and not only to be Explaned.

Would Charles who loved Pope Adrian so dearly, Number credibile est Carolum in

write against him so sharply? or the Sea of Rome ( which by the hands of Leo
the third crowned Charles Emperor of the West) endure that Charles should
condemn Images?

PRO.
Charles might love the Sea of Rome, and yet express his judgment in the
point of Images; neither do we doubt, but that Charles and Pipin would have
condemned the Popes proceedings therein more expressly, but they could not
meddle with the point of state, without quarrelling the Pope in a matter of the
Church: so that as Saint Austine says of the old Romans, C^eteras cupiditates
hujus unius ingenti ^upiditate presserunt. August. de Civit. Dei. lib. 5. c^p.
1^.
That they bare down many desires, for the excessive desire they had of one
thing, to wit, Sovereignty and Dominion; so the bishops of Rome, desirous to
keep their new purchases of Lumbardie, and Ravenna, which Charles and Pipin
had procured them, thought it not fit to contend with their new and potent
favorites. For so it was, when the Emperor Leo the third, desirous to abolish
Image worship, (which then was creeping in) had caused them to be defaced, and
thereupon did punish some who withstood it; Leonem 3. Imperat.
Constantinopolit. imperio simul and communione sidelium pr^v^t. Platina in

rebelled against their Emperor resiant at Constantinople, and part of the
country that rebelled was Conquered by the King of Lumbardie; and Rome, and
the Roman Dukedom fell unto the Pope; now was the Emperor driven out of
Italy, and every one ca^cht what he could; the Lumbards were the strong^st
party, and with them the Pope falls at odds about the dividing of the spoil;
and finding them too hard for him; as before he had used the strength of the
Lumbards, to suppress the Emperor; so now he calls in Pipin, Marshall of the
Palace, or Constable of France, and ^^a^les his son surnamed the Great, and by
their power he suppressed the Lumbards: this service did Pipin and his son to
the Sea of Rome; in requital whereof Chilp^ricke being a weak Prince was
deposed; Pipin, and the Barons and the people of France, are absolved from
their Oath of Allegiance, and by Pope Zacharies favor, Pipin, son to Carolus
Martellus, is crowned King of the F^a^ks, and Charles the Great, son to
Pipin, is crowned Emperor of the West, by Pope Leo the third, who s^cceeded
Adrian. Then came the Pope, and Charlemaigne to the partage of the Empire,
leaving a poor pit^ance for the Emperor of Greece. And this was the issue of
the fierce contentions about Images, The Popes pulling down Emperors, and
setting up Images: and indeed these babies and puppits served the Popes to
stalk with^ll, but other foul was shot at, to wit, Jurisdiction, and a
temporal Monarchy: and indeed about this time the Pope grew great, so that it
was Gods gracious dealing with his Church, that he found such opposition as he
did; the Eastern Emperor not daring, and the Western in regard of late
courtesies received from the Pope, being (happily) not willing openly to affront
him. And thus much of Images, come we now to speak a word or two of Prayer to
Saints.

Concerning Prayer, Bid in his Commentary on the Proverbes (rightly (...)
^ucque Commen^^^i ^ in pro^^b t^buuntur Bid, ^o^ Hiero^^^^.. Bell. de scrip.
ecles. sect. 4.
ascribed to Bid, and not to Saint Hierome) says; Nullu^ invocare, ^d est, in

We ought to invocate, that is, by prayer to call into us, none but God.

Antonius in his Melissa, or mellifluous Sermon, says, that, ^
We are taught to worship and adore that nature only which is uncreated: but
the Spanish Inquisitors have clipped off a piece of his tongue, ^ Index. Expa^g
(...) Q^^^g. M^d (...) (...) 1584

Only, is the only principal word that shows us the Authors drift, and the
word which Gregory Nyssen (from whom he borrwed this speech) (...) (...)
N^s^^^ cont. (...) (...) 4 tom. ^ edit. (...)
used in the Original.

Of Faith and Merits.
Bid held that we are justified by the merits of Christ imputed to us:
Eju^mors, nostra vita; ejus damnatio, nostra justificatio. Beda in Psalm. 87.
tom. 8.
Christ's condemnation is our Justification, his death is our life. He
disclaimed Justification by inherent Righteousness; for speaking of a
regenerate man, he says, Per justitiam factorum nullus salvabitur, sed per
solam justitiam fidei. Id. in Psalm. 77.
That no man shall be saved by the righteousness of works, but only by the
righteousness of Faith: and therefore Iustruit videlicet ut nemo vel
libertatem arbitrij, vel merita sua sufficere sibi ad beatitudinem credat; sed
sola gratia De^ se salvari posse intelligat. Id in Psalm. 31.
No man should believe, that either his freedom of will, or his merits are
sufficient to bring him unto bliss; but understand that he can be saved by the
grace of God only. And elsewhere he says, In suturo been remuneretur, and hoc
non ex merito, sed ex grati^ sola. Id. in Psalm. 23.
That in the life to come we shall be well rewarded, and that not by merits,
but by grace only; and he has a sweet prayer, that Vt miserearis secund^m
mesericordi^m ^uam, id est, te condignam, non secundum iro^^, me condignam. Id.
in Psalm. 24.
the Lord would take compassion of him, and that after the worth and
condignitie of his mercies, and not after the condignitie of wrath which
himself had deserved.

His Scholar Alcuinus maintained the same truth, as appears by these passages
following.

I could ( says Sordidare me potui, sed emundare nequeo, ^isi tu Domine Jesus
sancti sanguinis tui aspersione mundum me facias. Alcuin. in Psalm. 50.
Alcuinus) defile my self with sin, but I cannot cleanse my self; it is my
Saviors blood that must purge me: and again, Ad me unum cum respicio, nihil
al^ud in me nisi peccatum invenio; tota liberatio mea, tua est justitia. Dei
miseratione in nomine salvatoris, non nostris meritis vivisicati sum^^. Id.
Ibid.
Whiles I look on my self, I find nothing in me but sin; thy
righteousness must deliver me; it is thy mercy, not my merits that saves me.
And elsewhere, he says very sweetly, Ille solus liberare potest de peccato,
qui venit sine peccato, and factus est sacrificium pro peccato. Id. lib. 4 in
Joan. cap. 8.
He only can free me from sin, who came without sin, and was made a
sacrifice for sin. And thus by Gods providence, was the weighty point of
Justification preserved found in these latter and declining times.

hundred and ^inetie according to Bellarmine lived the Monk Ambrosius Ausbertus.

About the year 880^ lived Remigius Antisiodorensis claruit ann. 880. Trith^m.
Remigius borne at Aux^rre in France, and sometimes called Rhemensis (happily)
because he taught at Rhemes: there was another Remigius Archbishop of Rhemes,
who lived in the sixth Age, and converted King Clovis of France to the
Christian Faith; but this Saint Remigius (for ought we know) wrote nothing.

Claudius Scotus already mentioned, was one of the Irish Nation by birth, a
famous Divine, and accounted one of the C^audius Cl^mens ^ce^us, (...) Abbatis
in funda^l^ Academia Parisiensi C^ll^ga Possevir. in Appara^ (...).
Founders of the University of Paris: this Claudius Clemens Presbiter, Iac
Vsserius Armach. Archi^p. vete^. Epist. Hibernicorum ^^ll^g in praefat. and
epist. 19.
was of latter standing, and inferior in place to that other Claudius Scotus
bishop of Auxer^e, a great opposite to Boniface Archbishop of Me^ts. This
latter Claudius wrote on the Gospels and Epistles, and is often alleged by the
Reverend, and learned Lord Primate, Doctor Usher.

Of the Scriptures sufficiency, and Canon.
Claudius Scotus says, Propterta errant quia s^ripturas nesciunt, et quia
scriptura^ ignorant, consequenter nesciunt virtutem De^, hoc est, Christum.
Claud. in Math. li. 3. cited by D. Usher, of the ancient Irish Relig. page 2.
That men therefore err, because they know not the Scriptures; and because
they are ignorant thereof, they consequently know not Christ, who is the power
and wisdom of God. He also brings in that known Canon of Saint Herome, Hoc
quia de Scripturis non habet auctoritatem, ^a^em facilitate contemni^u^, qu^
probatur. Id. ibid.
This, because it has not authority from the Scriptures, is with the same
facility contemned, wherewith it is avowed.

Nicephorus Patriarch of Constantinople, gives us to understand, (...) Nic^ph.

That the Books of the old Testament were twenty and two. And treating of the
Apocriphall Books, he mentions in particular, the Books of Maccabees,
Wisdom, Ester, Judith, Susanna, Tobie.

Of Communion under both kinds; and number of Sacraments.
Paschasius upon our Saviors words, Drink ye all of this, says, Bibite ex
hoc omnes tam minist^i qu^m reliqu^ cred^ntes Pasch. de Corp. and Sang. Dom.
cap. 1^. page 18^. tom 4. Bibl. Patr. Par. 1575.
Drink ye all of this, as well Ministers, as the rest of the Faithful.
Rabanus says, M^luit D^m^nus Co^poris and Sanguinis sui Sacramenta fideiium
ore percipi. Raban. lib. 1. de Insti^ut. Cleric. cap. 31. page 49. ^d^t. Colon.

That the Lord would have the Sacrament of his Body and blo^d to be received by
the mouth of the Faithful.

Haymo says, Calix appellatur commu^i^atio, quasi par^^^ipatio quia omnes
commu^icant ex illo, partemque sumunt ^x sanguine D^mini, quem contin^t in se.
H^mo in 1 Cor. cap. 10 page 124. Edit. 1534.
The Cup is called the Communion, because all communicate of it, and do take
part of the blood of the Lord which it contains in it. He says, all did
communicate; so that the People as well as the Priests were admitted to the
Cup. And Rhemig in 1. cor. ^ap. 10. v. 16. in part 3. to. 5^1^ Bibl. v. Pat^
page ^8^
Rhemigius has the very same words with Haymo; as indeed his Commentaries on
Saint Paul's Epistles are in a manner all taken out of Haymo, as Doctor Rivet
has Andr. Rivet. (...). sacri lib 4. cap. 27.
observed. It is the report of our Ancestors (says Relatio majorum est^ ita
primi^ temporibus missus ^ier^ solitas, si^ut ipse Dominus noste^ praecepit,
commemoratione passion^^ ejus ad^ibita, ^os corp^^^ D^mini^o communicasse (...)
sanguini quos ratio permitt^bat. Valafrid. Strabo de reb. ^c^les. c. 22. in
Bibl. p^tr. Par. 158^
Walafridus Strabo) that in the Primitive times, they were wont according to
Christ's Institution, to Communicate and partake of the Body and Blood of our
Lord, even as many as were prepared and thought fit. Regino in Chron. ad an.
8^9. Communione^ co^poris ^t sanguinis Domin^ de manu Pontif^^^^ sumpsit. Lib.
2. page ^0. Fr. 1583.
Regino describes the manner of Pope Adrians delivering the Communion to King
Lotharius and his followers in both kinds; The King (says he) takes the Body
and Blood of our Lord at the hands of the Pope, and so did the Kings Fallowers.

Paschasius says, Sunt aut^m Sacramenta Christi in Ecclesi^, Baptismus and
Chrisma. ^orpus quoque Domini et sangu^^ Pas^h^l. de Corp. and sang. Dom. cap.

These be the Sacrament^ of Christ in the Church, Baptism and Chrysme, and
the Body and Blood of Christ: and Rab. de sacr. Euch. Col. 1551. ex Bib^ Cuthb.

Rabanus has the self same words: Now with Baptism they join Chrysme,
because they used to anoint such as were baptized; for otherwise Ecce duo ista
sacramenta quid efficient. Id. ibid. cap. 23.
Rabanus speaks precisely of two, saying; What do these two Sacraments
effect? and then he answers; That by the one we are borne anew in Christ, and
by the other Christ abides in us.

Of the Eucharist.
Rabanus says, Quia panis corporis ^or confirmat, ideo ille congru^nter co^pus
Christi nun^upatur; et quia vi^um sanguinem operatur in carne, ideo refertur ad
sanguine^ Raban. de Instit. Cleric. li. 1. ca. 31.
Bread because it strengthens the body, is therefore called the Body: and Wine
because it makes blood, is therefore referred to Christ's blood.

Haymo Haimo in pass. secu^d. Marc. Fer. 3 palm.
says the same with Rabanus; Rabanus farther says, Aliud est Sa^ramentum,
aliud vi^ sacramenti; sacramentum in alimentum (...) gitur, virtute socr^menti
aeternae vitae dignitas adipiscitur. Raban. de Instit. Cleric. lib. 1. ca 3.
That the Sacrament in one thing, and the power thereof another; the Sacrament
is turned into the nourishment of the body; by the virtue of the Sacrament we
attain ^ternall life: He says, the Sacrament (which is the Bread) is turned
into our bodily nourishment; n^w sp^cies, shows, and accidents can not
nourish: but these latter words of Rabanus Rabani libro, hanc (...) quasi
spuriam (...). P^aetat. ad Ma^h. Westmon.
are raz^d ^ut; whereas the Monk of Malmesbury witnesses that Rabanus wrote
accordingly as is alleged, and this razure is observed by the publisher of
Matthew of Westminsters History. Haymo calls the Eucharist, A Sa^ramentum
muner^s aet^rai quod n^bis Domi^^^ nass^rus i^ mem^riam su^ d^misit tenendum.
Haimo in 1 Cor. cap. 1.
Memorial of that Gift or Legacy, which Christ dimised unto us at his Death.

Rabanus says, Q^od ^^inde Ap^sto^i imitati (...), and (...) and nunc per
totum terrarum ^^bem generali^^^ tota cus^odit ^cclesia. R^b^n de Inst^t.
Cl^^^^. lib. 1. c^p. 32.
that Christ at first instituted the Sacrament of his Body and Blood, with
blessing and thanksgiving; and delivered it to his Apostles, and they to their
Successors, to do accordingly; and that now the whole Church throughout the
world observes this manner.

Christianus Druthmarus reporting our Saviors Act at his last Supper, says, ^
Christ changed the bread into his body, and the wine into his blood
Spiritually: he speaks not of any change of substances. Walafridus Strabo
says, ^
That Christ delivered to his Disciples the Sacraments of his body and blood,
in panis and vini substantia, in the substance ^f bread and Wine.

When Carolus Calvus the Emperor, desired to compose some diffe^ences about
the Sacrament then on ^oot; he r^quired Bertram, a learned man of that Age, t^
deliver h^s j^dgement in that point, (...) Colon. Ann^ 1551 p^g 18^.
Whether the body and blood of Christ which in the Church is received by the
mouth o^ t^^ faithful, be celebrated in a mystery, or in the truth; an^ whether
it be the same body which was borne of Mary? Whereunto h^ returns this answer;
Panis ille (...) figu^ate Christi corpus and sang^^^ (...). Ibid. p^g. 183.
That the bread and the wine, a^e t^^ body and blood of Christ figuratively;
that Et h^c ^orpus pign^s est and spec^es, illud vero ipsa veritas. Ibid. (...).
This body is the pledge, and the ^igure, the other the very natural body;
Nam secund^m ^^^turarum substantiam quod ^uerunt ante conse^ra^ionem, ho^ and

That for the substance of the Creatures, that which they were before
consecration, the same are they also afterward. ^omini^um corpus (...) sanguis

That they are called the Lords body and blood, because they take the name of

That there is a great difference betwixt the mystery of the blood and body of
Christ, which is taken now by the faithful in the Church, and that which was
borne of the Virgin Mary. All which he proves at large by Scriptures and
Fathers.

Your wisdom most excellent Prince, may perceive (says he A^imad^ ertat

) that I have proved by the testimonies of holy Scriptures and Fathers, that
the bread which is called Christ's body, and the Cup that is called his blood,
is a figure, because it is a mystery.

PA.
I except against Bertram, his book is forbid to be read, but by such as are ^
licenced, or purpose to con^ute him.

PRO.
Bertram ^
wrote of the body and blood of Christ, as Trithemius says; and by your
Belgicke or L^w Country Index, Bertram is styled ^
Catholic. Now this Index was published by the King of Spaines commandment,
and the Duke of Alva, and first printed at Antwerp, in the year 1571, and
often since reprinted. Now so it is, howsoever he be accounted a Catholic
Priest, and much commended by Trithemius, yet are this Catholics writings
forbid to be read, as appears by several Indices; the one set forth by the ^
Deputies of the Trent Council; and another printed at Parts, ^
under Clement the eight.

Now these Inquisitors dealt too roughly, and therefore the divines of Doway,
perceiving that the ^orbidding of the book, kept not men from reading it, but
rather o^casioned them to seek after it; thought i^ better policy, that
Bertram should be suffered to go abroad, but with his keeper, to wit, some
popish gloss to wait on him.

Seeing therefore ( Quum igitur in Catholic^^ veteribus al^ot plu^rimo^ ^^^amus
error^s and ex^enuemus, ex^u^^mu^ excog^tato commento pers^^^ n^g^^^^ (...)
com^^d^^ ijs (...) cum oppo^untu^ (...) disp^^ationibus ^ut in ^onflictionibus

B. ut liber ^ertrami tolera^i emendatus queat. and ^udicium Vniversitatis
Du^c^nsis Ibidem.
say they) we bear with many errors in other old Catholic writers, and
extenuate them, excuse them, by inventing some device, oftentimes deny them,
and ^aine some commodious sense for them when they are objected in disputation
with our adversaries: we do not see why Bertram may not deserve the same
equity, and diligent revisall; les^ the Her^ticks cry out, that we burn and
forbid such antiquity as makes for them; and accordingly they have dealt wi^h
Bertram; for by their Recognition, Legendum invisibiliter pro visibiliter, ^t
[s^cundum creaturarum substantiam] explicandum est secundum externa^ species
sacramenti Ind. expu^g. B^lg^^. page ^7.
We must read Invisibiliter, in stead of Visibiliter; and these words, [ The
Substance of the Creatures] must be expounded to signify outward shows, or
Accidents.

But this will not serve the turn; for Bertram speaking of the consec^ated
b^ead and wine, says, that for the substance of the creatures, they remain
the same after consecration, that they were before. Now if they do so, then is
not the substance of b^ead and wine changed into the substance of the flesh and
blood of Christ, as the Trent Council would have it. Council. Tr^d. Sess. 2.
Can. 13.
Nor will it serve to say, that by the substance of the Creatures is meant the
outward accidents, as the whiteness of the bread, the color of the wine, or
the like: for Bertram speaks properly, that the consecrated bread and wine,
remain the same in substance. And it were an improper speech to attribute the
word Substance, to Accidents, as to say the substance of the color, or
redness of the wine, or the like.

PA.
Master Brerely suspects Protest. Apol. Tract. ^. chap. 2. sect. 7.
that this book was lately set forth by O^colampadius under Bertrams name.

PRO.
This suspicion is cleared by the ancient Manuscript copies of Bertram extant,
before Occolampadius was borne; one whereof that great Scholar, Causabon, saw
in the Library of Master James Gilot, a Burgess of Paris, as he D. Vss^rius
de Christian. Eccles. succ^ssione. cap. 2. sect. 18.
witnessed to the Reverend and learned Primate, Doctor Usher.

And yet besides these M^nuscripts, Bertram taught the same doctrine in other
books also, to wit, De Nativitate Christi, and de Anima, which are to be seen
in the Libraries of the Cathedral Church of Sarisburie, and Bennet College in
Cambridge, as the same D. Vss^r. in Gotteschal^^, seu p^aedest. Cont^overs.

Bishop Usher observes.

Was Bertram a learned man, and of a good li^e?

Martyr of their Church.

Now are we come to our famous countryman Scotus, much what of Bertrams
standing, and both of them in favor with Charles; unto whom as Bertram
Dedicated his Treatise of the Sacrament; so also Ioannes Scotus wrote of the
same argument, and to the same effect that Bertram had done. Bellarmine says,
Is primus in Ecclesi^ la^in^ de (...) ^u^i e s^ri^ere capit Bellar. de S^cram
Eu. har. lib. 1. cap 1.. Secundus.
That Scotus was the first who in the Latin Church wrote doubt^fully of the
real presence. It is indeed their fault that we have not his Book, yet may
we presume that he wrote positively; neither do we any where find, that his
book of the Sacrament was condemned before the days of Lanfrancke, Tantum
Lan^ia^^^ ait, ^^^tum in (...) ^^^sell^nsi ^^m (...) damna^um ^et (...)
^xillius s^riptis opinionis (...) ^eminari^ (...) Cl^d. de Sa^nctes ib^d (...).
2. p. 54.
who was the first that leavened the Church of England with this corrupt
doctrine of the carnal presence; so that all this while, to wit, from the
year 876, to 1050, he passed for a good Catholic.

PA.
Was Scotus a man of that note?

He was (as Possevine says I^m. Scotus. dis^ipulus olim ^ede, et collega

after that he came into England, and was public Reader in Oxford, by the
favor of King Alfred, he retired himself into Malmsbury Abbey, and was there
by his own Scholars stabbed to death with Penknives: and this was done (says

Of Images, and Prayer to Saints.
Jonas Bishop of Orleance, who wrote against Claudius bishop of Turin in the
defense of Images, holds that Quae picturae xon ad adorandum, sed solummod^
(test B. Greg.) ad (...) nes^i^ntium mentes in (...) sunt antiquit^^ ^ieri
permissae. Jonas Aureli^n. de cultu Imag. lib. 1 in Biblioth. Patr. tom. 4.
pa^. 692. edit Par.
The Images of Saint^, and Stories of divine things may b^e painted in the
Church, not to be worshipped, but to be an o^nament, and to bring into the
minds of simple people, things done and past. But to adore the Creature, or to
give it any part of divine honor, we count it (says he Creaturum vero
ado^rari, e^que aliquid divinae servitutis impe^di, nesas ^u^imus; hujusque
sceleris patratorem detestandum (...) anathem^tiz^ndum^ liber^ v^ce
pro^l^mamus. Id. ibid. p^g 699
) a vile wickedness, detesting the do^r thereof, as worthy to be accursed: It
is fl^t impiete ( Adorare alium praeter Pat^em, et Filium, et S. ^. impi^tatis
est ^rimen. Ib^d. page 701.
says the same Jonas out of Origin) to adore any save the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost. Agobardus, bishop of Lions says, Sed nullas antiquorum
Catholicorum unquam c^s colendas vel adorand^s serte existimavit. Agoba^d^
opera. Par. 1605 pa. 253.
That the Ancients, they had the pictures of the Saints, but it was for
history sake, and not for adoration; and that none of the ancient Catholics
happily thought that Images are to be worshipped, or adored.

And Rec^e nimiru^ ob ejusmodi evacuandam superstitionem ab orthodoxis patribus
definitum est; pictura^ in ecclesi^ ^i^ri non deb^re; ne quod colitur et
adoratur, in parietibus d^ pingatur. Id. ibid. pa. 254
the Orthodoxe Fathers for avoiding of superstition, did carefully provide that
no pictures should be set up in Churches, lest that which is worshipped should
be painted on the walls.

Rhemigius says, Quia non sunt ado^a^da simulachra, nec etiam Angelus
adorandus ^st. Rhemig. in Psalm. 96.
That neither Images nor Angels are to be adored; and Quid non sint Deo debitis
^ultibus et honoribus colend^, quae ab illu vel nobis facta sunt. Vala^rid.
Strabo de ^eb. ecclesiast. cap 8.
Walasfridus Strabo, would not have divine honor given to ought that is made
by us, or any other Creature.

Now what say the Papists to these Testimonies? Baronius yields us Walafridus
Strabo, Jonas bishop of Or^leance, Hincmarus, Archbishop of Rhemes, and says ^
That they fo^sooke the received opinion of the Church; and yet they were ever
held sound Catholics.

Bellarmine says, (...) est, (...) Agobardus, et r^liqui (...). Bell. (...)
Eccl^s. s^^t. 9. verbo Jonas.
That Jonas was overtaken with Agobard his error, and other bishops of France
in that Age, and therefore puts in a Caveat, that Jonas must be read warily.
So that by their own confession the learned, and famousest men of this Age
stand for us in this point; and this makes them seek to suppress such
testimonies as are given of them. Papirius Massonus set forth this book of
Agobards, and delivers the argument thereof to be this: Grae^o^um errores de
Im^ginibus et picturis mani^e^tissime d^tege^s ^egat (...) ad^rari d^b^re; quam
sente^tiam om^es Cat^^li^i p^obamus G^egorijque M testimonium d^ ^llis se qui
mur. Pap^^. M^sson. in (...) ^p p. 7.
Detecting most manifestly the errors of the Greci^ns touching images and
pictures: he (to wit, bishop Agobard) denies that they ought to be worshipped:
which opinion all we Catholics do allow and follow the testimony of Gregory
the great concerning them. Now this passage the Spanish Inquisitors, in their
expurgatorie Index, Expungantur omnia (...) sub hoc (...) (de Imaginibu^)
continentur. and. l^br expu^^at. de (...) Sena^u^ general. I^q^isit Hi^p (...)

to. 9. part. 1. edit. Colon. an. 1618. pa 551.
performed by the Divines of Collen, in their late corrupt Edition of the great
Bibliothek of the ancien^ Fathers.

To close up this point; Charles the Great was seconded by his Son Lewis the
Godly; for by his appointment, the Doctors of France Syn^d Parisiens. de
Imaginib sub Ludovi^o ^io.
assembled at Paris, in the year 842, and there condemned the adoration of
Images.

It is not strange (says N^n autem mi^un si (...)
Ambrose Ansber^us) that our prayers and tears are not offered up unto God by
us, but by our High Priest, since that Saint Paul exhorts us, to offer up the
Sacrifi^e of Praise unto God. Haymo upon those words of Isay, (...) enim Pater
noster, Thou O Lord art our Father. [ Isay. 6^. ver. 16.] ^aith, Ha^m^ in cap.
63. (...).
Et recte solum invocamus ac d^p ecamur te, And we do right, only to invocate
thee, and to make our supplication to thee.

Of Faith and Merit.
Claudius Scotus says, (...) Vsh^r, of the (...) Religion.
that Faith alone saves us, because by the works of the Law no man shall be
justified; yet he adds withal this caution, No^ quod legis opera conte^^enda
sunt, et absque eis simplex fides appetenda, sed ipsa opera ^ide Christi
adornentur. Id. in Gal. 3.
Not as if the works of the Law should be contemned, and without them a simple
faith, (so he calls that solitary faith, which is a simple faith indeed)
should be desired; but that the works themselves should be adorned with the
Faith of Christ. Rhemigius says, Re vera isti soli bea^^^ qui per gratiam
justificantur, non ex meritis. ^^mig in Psalm. 32.
That in truth, those only are happy, who are freely justified of grace, and
not of merit. Haymo says, [Et salvamur] (...) gratia non nosiris me^^tis, quae
quide^ merita sunt nu^la. Haimo in Esai. ca. 63.
We are saved by Gods grace, and not our own merits; for we have no merits at
all.

Ambros. Ansbertus expounding that place, Revel. 19. 7 makes this inference. In
eo autem damus illi gloriam, quo nullis praecedentibus ^onorum actuu^ meritis,
sed sola nos ^ju^ misericordia, ad t^ntam dignitatem pervenisse sateamur. Ambr.
A^sbert. in Apocalyp. lib. 8. cap. 19. Et pr^ventente gra^t^ salvamur, et
subsequente justificamur. Id ib. l. 10. c. 22.
In this do we give glory to him, when we do confess, that by no precedent
merits of our good deeds, but by his mercy only, we have attained unto so
great a dignity. And Ne dicerent, Pat^es nostri suo merito pla^uerunt, ideo
tant^ sunt a Domino consecuti; intu^it non meriti^ datu^, sed qui^ ita sit Deo
placitum, cuj^s est gratuitum omne quod praestat. Raban. in Ie^em. lib. 18. cap
2.
Rabanus in his commentaries upon the Lamentations of Jeremy; least they
should say, our Fathers were accepted for their Merit, and therefore they
obtained such great things at the hands of the Lord; he adjoyneth, that it was
not given to their Merits, but because it so pleased God, whose free gift is
whatsoever he bestows.

I will close up this Age only with producing an Evidence drawn about the
year 860, namely, a learned Epistle which Huldericke Bishop of Ausburg, in
Germany, wrote to Pope Nicolas in defense of Priests Marriage. From this holy
discretion ( Non parum quippe ^b h^c sa^cta discre^ione deviasti cum Cle^i^os

Cleargymen, whom thou ought only to advise to abstinence from marriage,
compelled unto it by a certain imperious violence: for is not this justly in
the judgment of all Wise men to be accounted violence, when as against the
Evangelicall institution, and the charge of the Holy Ghost, any man is
constrained to the execution of private Decrees? The Lord in the old Law
appointed marriage to his Priest, which he is never read afterward to have
forbidden.

THE TENTH CENTVRIE, From the year of Grace, 900. to 1000.
PAPIST.
WE are now drawing on to the thousandth year, what say you to this tenth Age?

PROTESTANT.
By the fall of the Roman Empi^e, Learning was now decayed, and the public
Service no longer to be understood, by reason of the change of the vulgar
Tongues. Wernerus a Carthusian Monk Sanctitas Papas dimifit, et ad Imperato^es

There was no Age so unlearned, so unluckie. And Baronius complains saying
Quae tunc facies Ecclesi^ Romanae. Baron. to. 10. Annal. ann. 912.. 8.
What was then the face of the Roman Church? when potent and base Whores bare
all the sway at Rome? at whose lust, Sees were changed, Bishoprics bestowed,
and their Lovers thrust into Saint Peter's Chair? Insomuch as Baronius is glad
to prepare his Reader with a Prae^ari aliquid necessarium duximus, ne quid

Preface, before he would have him venture upon the Annals of this Age, Lest a
weak man seeing (in the Story of those times) the abomination of Desolation
sitting in the Temple, should be offended, and not rather wonder, that there
followed not immediately the Desolation of the Temple. And he had reason to
Preface as much, considering the corruption that grew in this Thousandth year,
wherein Revelat. 20.3.
Satan was let loose. For at thi^ time they of Rome forbad others to mar^y, and
in the mean whiles themselves slept in an unlawful bed: They also devised a
carnal Presence of Christ in the Sacrament, so that (as the noble Morney
M^steri^ of iniqui^ie the 37. p^o^^^^sion. p. ^08.
says) The less that they believed God in h^aven, the more careful were they
to affirm him to be in the Bread, in the Priests hands, in his words, in his
nods; and that by these means when it pleased them, they could make him
appear upon earth. Thus dishonesty accompanied infidelity; and no marvel
since (as Ockam M^limores ex oe^a^t i^t (...) Dial. (...), c^p. 26.
says) A lewd life (oftentimes) blind^th the understanding. But le^ us see
whether in this Monkish Age, during this mist in Egypt, we can discover any
light in the Land of Goshen

In this Age lived the Monk Radulphus Flaviace^sis, Stephanus Edvensis Bishop,
Smaragdus Smaragdus Abbas Monasterij S. Michaelis scripsit in Psalterium
^pistolas, Evangeli^. Trithem. de scriptor. eccles.
Abbot of Saint Michaels in Germany, and Aelfricke Abbot of Malmesburie, about
the year, 975.

Of the Scriptures suf^iciencie, and Canon.
Flaviacensis compares the Scripture to a well-furnished Table, or Ordinary.
It is (says he) Sacra scriptura mensa nobis est, and spiritalis refectio, ad
consolati^nem nobis data contra iniraicos. Rad. Flav. in L^vit. li. 17. cap. 5.
our spiritual refection, and Cordial given to us against the heart-qualmes
of our enemies. The same Author speaking of Books pertainning to sacred
History Nam Tobias, ^udith, ^t Macab^or^m, quamvis ad instructionem Ecclesie
legantur; perfectam tamen non habe^t authoritatem. Id. in p^ae^at. in lib. 14.
Levit. page 203.
says; The Books of Tobit, Judith, and of the Machabees, though they be read
^or the Churches instruction, yet they have not any perfect Authority.

In like sort Aelfricke Abbot of Malmesburie, in his Saxon Treaty of the old
Testament, tell us; Ael^rick of the Old Testament. page 17, 22, 23.
There are two Books more placed with Salomons works, as if he had made them,
which for likeness of Style, and profitable use; have gone for his, but Jesus
the son of Syrach composed them: one is called Liber Sapientiae, the Book of
Wisdom, and the other, Ecclesiasticus, very large Books, and read in the
Church of long custom, for much good instruction: amongst these Books the
Church has accustomed to place two other tending to the glory of God, and
entitled Maccabaeorum: I have turned them into English, and so read them you
may (if you please) for your own instruction. Now by this Saxon Treatise,
written by Aelfricus Abbas, about the time of King Edgar, (seven hundred years
ago) it appears what was the Canon of holy Scripture here then received, and
that the Church of England had it so long ago in her Mother tongue.

Of Communion under both, and number of Sacraments.
Stephanus Edvensis says Quotidie nobis haec dona praestantur, quando corpus
et sanguis in Altari sumuntur. Steph. Edvens. de Sacram. Altaris. ca. ^7. in
Biblioth. Patr. Paris. 1589. edi^. 2. per Margarin de la Bigne. to. 6. p. 587
These gif^s or benefits ^re daily performed unto us, when the Body and Blood
of Christ is taken at the Altar.

Aelfricke mentions but two Sacraments, of Baptism, and the Lords Supper; the
same which Gods people had under the Law; who though they had many Rites and
Ceremonies, yet (in proper sense) but two Sacraments; his words are these;
Aelfricks Sermon on E^ster day, page 24. editionis Joan. Da^^. Load.
The Apostle Paul says [1 Cor. chap. 10. verse. 1, 2, 3, 4.] That the
Israelites did eat the same ghostly meat, and drink the same ghostly drink;
because that heavenly meat that fed them forty years, and that water which
from the Stone did flow, had signification of Christ's Body, and his Blood, that
now be offered daily in Gods Church. So that as a good Author says, Seculum
de^imum d^^ tantum ag^^^vit Sacram^nta. Joan a Munste, ^n Vor^lage nobilis
discurspropos. 3.
This Age acknowledged only two Sacraments.

Of the Eucharist.
Our English Abbot Aelfricke in his Saxon Homily, which was appointed publicly
to be read to the people in England, on Easter day, before they received the
Communion, has these words; Ael^^ick i^ die S. Pas^^^. A Se^mon on ^ ast^r
d^y. page 23.
All our For^fathers they did eat the same Ghostly meat, and drank the same
Ghostly drink; they drank truly of the stone that followed them, and that
stone was Christ; neither was that stone then from which the water ran bodyly
Christ, but it signified Christ. The same Abbot says, Id. ib^d. page 12.
Men have often searched, and do yet often search (so that it seems that this
was then in question, and so before Berengarius time) how bread that is
gathered of Corn, may be turned to Christ's body, or how wine that is press^d
out of many grapes, is turned through one blessing to the Lords Blood: and the
resolution returned is this: Id. ibid. p^^ 12, 13, 14.
Now say we to such m^n; that some things be spoken of Christ by
signification, some thing by thing certain: true thing and certain is that
Christ was borne of a Maid: He is said Bread by signification, and a Lamb,
and a Lion; He is called Bread, because he is our life, he is said to be a
Lamb for his Innocence. But Christ is not so notwithstanding after true
nature, neither Bread, nor a Lamb. Why is then the holy Housell called Christ's
Body, or his Blood, if it be not truly that it is called? Without they be
seen bread and wine both in figure and taste; and they ^ee truly after their
hallowing, Christ's body and blood, through Ghostly mystery.

And again, Ibid. page 1^. and 18.
Much is betwixt the body Christ suffered in, and the body that is hallowed to
Housel: the body truly that Christ suffered in was borne of the flesh of Mary,
with blood and with bone; and his Ghostly body which we call the Housel, is
gathered of many Corns, without blood and bone; and therefore nothing is to
be understood therein bodily, but all is Ghostly to be understood. Here we
see, the body of Christ borne of the blessed Virgin, the body of flesh, is
plainly distinguished from the consecrated substance of bread, or the Body
Sacramental, which the Homilist calls Ghostly.

And again, Ibid. page 20.
This Mystery i^ a pledge and a figure; Christ's body is truth it self; the
pledge we do keep Mistically, until we be come to the truth it self, and
then is this pledge ended. Truly it is Christ's body and blood not Bodily but
Ghostly; and ye should not search how it is done, but hold it in your belief
that it is so done.

The like matter also was delivered to the Clergy by the Bishops at their
Synods, out of two other writings of the same A^lfricks Sermon^, joined with
the Saxon Homily, printed at London by John Day, and reprinted Ann. 1623.
Aelfricke; in the one whereof directed to Wulfsine Bishop of Shy^burne, we
read thus: Page 45.
That holy Housel is Christ's body, not Bodily, but Ghostly; not the body which
he suffered in, and so forth.

In the other witten to Wulf^tane Archbishop of York, thus: Page 51.
That lively bread is not bodily so, nor the selfsame body that Christ
suffered in; nor that holy wine is the Saviors blood which was shed for us in
bodily thing, but in Ghostly understanding; both be truly the bread his body,
and the wine also his blood, as was the heavenly bread which we call Manna:
which words are to be seen mangled Non sit tamen hoc sacrificium corpus ejus
in quo p^ssus est pronobis; neque sanguis ejus quem pro nobi^ effu^^t, sed
spirit^aliter corpus ejus efficitur et s^ngu^^ sicut Manna.
and razed in a Manuscript, in Bennets College in Cambridge, as our learned
Antiquarie of Oxford, has well observed D. ^ames of the corruption of the
Fathers. part. 2. page 55.
. And we may conceive it to be done by some Papist, for that it plainly
confutes the doctrine of Transubstantiation; the best is, the evidence is
restored out of another Copy.

PA.
Here is much a do with an old Record, which your selves will not (happily)
justify in every point.

PRO.
The Record is both ancient and authenticke; but to be free from error, is the
privilege of holy writ: your selves stand not to all which the Fathers, even
of the first Age wrote. Why then should we make good all that was delivered in
this later, and ignorant Age, so much cumbred with Monkery? There are indeed in
this Homily some suspicious words; as where it speaks of the Mass to be
profitable to the quick and dead, of the mixture of water with wine; and a
report of two vain miracles, which notwithstanding, seem to have been
infarced; for that they stand in their pl^ce unaptly, and witho^t purpose, and
the matter witho^t them, both before and after, does hang in it self tog^th^r
most orde^ly: besides, these mistakes they are but touched by the way, and a^e
different from the whole scope of the Author.

Thus was Priest and people taught to believe in the Church of England, above
six hund^ed years ago; for this Sermon was written in the old Saxon tongue
before the Conqu^st, and appointed in the reign of the Saxons to be spoken to
the people at Easter before they should rec^ive the Communion. Neither was
Aelfricke the first Author of this Homily, but the Translatour the^eof out of
Latin into the old English, or Saxon tongue; the Homily it self was ex^ant
before his time, and the resolution thereof is the same with that of Ber^^am,
and in many places directly translated out of him; so that the doctrine is both
ancient and Orthodoxe; whereas that of Transubstantiation was not publicly
taught in the Church of England, till Lanfranck and others, a thousand years
after Christ, came with an Italian trick, and expounded Species and forma
panis, for the qualities and accidents of bread without subject or substance;
But from the b^ginning it was not so.

Of Images, and Prayer to Saints.
Concerning Images, The French and German Churches ^an a middle course, neither
rudely breaking them, nor supe^s^itiously adoring them; and this opinion they
stoutly maintained, and for some ages after continued most constant therein, as
C^ss^^der ^
s^ith; and he says true, as appears by the pr^ctise of the French in the
ninth, and the Almaines in the tw^lfth Age.

The Abbat Smaragdus says; that ^
Christ only makes Inte^ces^ion in heaven for us, performing that with the
Father, which he p^titioned of the Father; being both our Mediator to prefer
our Petitions, and our Creator to grant our r^qu^sts. In li^e sort, Radulphus
Flaviacensis calls the Angel of the covenant Christ Jesus, Angelus is^e non
nisi Ponti^ex ille summu^ missus s^ilice^ a ^atre ad homines, et ab hominibus
ad Patrem remissus, ut hominum caussas ^pud Patr^m peroret, Mediat^r Dei,
hominumque. R^d Fl^vi^^, in Levit. lib. 2. cap. 24.
The Master of Requests to prefer our suits in the court of Heaven, and to
mediate betwixt God and men. Now if he by his Fathers Patent, be Master of
Requests; surely we may not without Commission and warrantie out of Gods word,
constitute others, either Saints, or Angels, Mediators of our Prayers.

Of Faith and Works.
It is of necessity, that bel^evers should be saved only by the faith of
Christ Necesse est sold fide Chris^i salva^^ ^redentes^ Smaragd. in G^lat. cap.
3. in Catal. Test. verit. l^ 11.
; says Smaragdus the Abbot. Who is it that can do all that God has
commanded? we are not come to that blessedness or merit, to yield him
obedience in all things Non ejus beatudinis sumus ^ut m^riti, ut i^ universis
illi obtemperemus. Fl^viac. in L^vi^i^. lib. 20. cap 1.
, says Flaviacensis: For as Alij bon^ fa^iunt non be^^, quia si^e side pla^ere
D^^ non p^ssunt. Id. ibid l^ 15. (...) ^.
he says, One may do bonum, and not been; one without grace may do a Moral
act, as give Alms; the act Morally good, ex genere and objecto, but not good
ex fine and circumstantijs, in case it be given out of vain glory, or ^he like.

PA.
You taxed this Age for imposing single life on the Clergy, this was no
Innovation.

PRO.
In this Age there arose great contention about Priests marriage: At length
about the year 975. the matter was referred to the Roode of Grace, which as
the Literae do^ent, Dominic^m imaginem express locutam, Clericos, co^umque
fautores, con^udisse. Gu^. Malmes. de gest. Ang^^ li. 2. cap. 9. and Polychron.
lib. 6. cap. 12. pa. 240.
Annalists, and Legendaries say) returned this answer: God forbid it should be
so, God forbid it should be so, you have judged well once (said the Roode) and
to change that again is not good. Now this Oracle made for Saint Dunstan,
Absit ut hoc siat^ absit hoc ut fiat; judicastis been m^t^retis non b^ne. No^^
L^genda Angliae. de ^. Dunstano page 94.
and against the Priests, who said this was but a subtle trick of the Monks,
in placing behind the wall a man of their own, who through ^ T^unke uttered
those words in the mouth of the Roode; the matter therefore came again to
s^anning, the Prelates and the States met at Cl^ve, or Calne, ut Mal^^sbur. vel
T^^ne. ut Hen^. Huntingd.
Cleve in Wiltshire; where after hot and sharp Disputation on either side, a
heavy mischance fell out: for whether through the weakness of the
Foundation, or the overpresse of weight, or both, Sola^ium totum repen^^ ^um
^xibus and ^ra^ibu^ dissiluit et co^^idit; omnibus ad terram ^lisis, solus
Dunstanus stans super un^m trabem quae superstes er^t, ^vasit pr^be. Gu^l
M^lms. quo sup^a.
The upper L^ft, where the Council sat, fell down, and many of the People
were hurt, and some slain outright. But Dunstan the Monks Prolocutor remained
unhurt; For the Post whereon his Chair stood, remained safe. By this fall,
fell the cause of the Secular Priests, and they of Dunstans side thought these
rotten joysts foundation enough whreon to build their Prohibition of Marriage.
But Henry Archdeacon of Huntington interprets this casualtie more probably, To
Signum scilicet Dei ex^elsi fu^t, quod proditione^ et inter^ectione Regis su^,
ab amo^e Dei, ^asuri essent, et a diversis gentibus ^ign^ contrit^^e
conterendi. Henr. Huntingd. Hist. lib. 5. page 357.
be a sign from God, that by their Treason and murder of their King (who was
slain the year after) they should fall from Gods favor, and be crushed by
other Nations, as in the event it prooved. And thus did Dunstan by his feigned
Miracles seduce King Edgar to drive out the Secular Priests; wh^re yet Dunstan
(happily) thought not to thrust married men out of the Clergy, but to thrust
married Clergy men out of Cathedral Churches, because they ^equired a daily
attendance, as the Learned bishop Doctor The honor of the m^rried Clergy.
lib. 3. sect ^0.
Hall has observed.

Howsoever it fell out, it is worth the observing, that the Clergy pleaded
Praescription for themselves; for so their own Monk of Malmesbury has
recorded their plea; they alleged says he; Di^entes, ingen^ esse et
miserabl^e ded^^us, ut nov^^ advena veteres ^olonos migr^re compelle^et: hoc
nec Deo gratum puta^^, qui veterem habitatione^ concessisses, ne^ alicu^ pr^^o

That it was a great sh^me, that these upstart Monks should thrust o^t the
ancient possessors of those places; that this was neither pleasing to God, who
gave them that long continued habitation, nor yet to any good man, who might
justly fear the same hard m^asure which was offered to them. Matthew of
Westminster speaking of Pope Gregory the seventh, says; that Sacerdotes

He r^moved married Priests from their function: a new example, and as many
thought, inconsiderately prejudicial^, against the judgment of the holy
Fathers; And Henry of Huntington says, Ans^lmus A^chiep. Concilium an^

Archbishop Anselme held a Synod at London, wherein he forbad wives to the
Priests of England, before not forbidden. Was not this now an Innovation?

Besides, Acts and Monuments Vol. 1. Book 3. page 150^ ad ann. 941.
we find that in King Edmunds reign, a West Saxon Prince, (before the days of
Edgar or Dun^tan) bishop Osulphus with Athelme and Vlricke Laics, thrust out
the Monks of Evesham, and placed Canons (married Priests) in their room.

And afte^wards, when not only the meaner sort, but the Nobles and great ones
^ided; even then also, P^oceribus succlamantibus prae^udioiu^, quod Clerici

Alferus a Mercian Duke, favoring the cause of married Priests, cast out the
Monks, and restored again the ancient revenewes to the Clerks; and it seems
they were the ancient owners, and others but incommers; inasmuch as diverse
Cathedral Churches originally were founded in married Cleargy-men, and
afterward translated from them to Monks; as appears by that which the Monks
of Worcester wrote Charta R. Edgari de Oswaldeslaw extat inter epist. veterum
Hibernic. apud D. lac. Vsserium.
under their Oswald Archbishop of York: Per me fundatus
Fuit ex Clericis Monachatus.
That is, By me were Monks first founded out of Cle^ks. So that the Monks were
not the first possessors, but came in by such as Dunstan; who wrought with that
good King Edgar, by dreams, visions, and miracles, mostly tending to Monkery;
as namely, that, Nova Legenda Angliae de S Dunstano pa. 90. and Polychron. lib.
6. cap. 13. page 241.
When the Devil in the likeness of a fair woman, tempted Dunstan to l^st, he
caught him by the nose with an hot pair of tongs, and made him roar out for
mercy: that, Legend ibid p 94. and Polychron. loc. citato.
Having hallowed a Church, and seeing that it pointed not full East and West,
he set his shoulder to it, and by and by, it looked directly Eastward^ That

Dunstans harp, hanging upon the wall, played by (...) self, the tune of the
Anthem, Gaudent in coelis animae Sanctorum.

By the means of this Dunstan, and his Cousins Athelwold, and Oswald, King
Edgar was set on work for the building of religious houses; wherein he
surpas^ed Charles the Great, for whereas he Polychron. li. 5 cap. 26. page 220.
built as many as there be letters in the Alphabet, or A. B. C. King Edgar as
(app^ares by the Chart^r of the foundation of Worcester Church Carta Regis

) he built almost as many as there be Sundays in the year. I have made (says
he) 47 Monasteries, and I intend if God grant life, to make them up fifty,
which seems to be the number that Dunstan set him for his penance.

THE ELEVENTH CENTVRIE, From the year of Grace, 1000. to 1100.
PAPIST.
YOu said of the last Age, that Satan was let loose; was he bound in this?

PROTESTANT.
He that brake loose in the former, tyrann^zed in this: for now those two

Hildebrand, who forbad marriage, and deposed Kings from their l^wfull thrones;
so that for his doctrine the Churches did ring of him for an Antichrist. In
their Sermons ( (...) Annal. (...) li. ^ p^g. ^73.
says Aventine, bo^n about the year 1466) they declared him to be Antich^ist,
that under the title of Christ, he played the part of Antichrist: 2 (...) 2 4.
That he sits in Babylon in the Temple of God, and is advanced above all that
is called God; as if he were God, he glorifieth, that he cannot err.

Suavis hom^ sacerdotes qu^ uxores habent ^^gitim^s sacr^si^os esse pe^negat;
interim tam^n ^^^^tatores, adult^ros, incest^os^s a^is admovet. Aventin.
This fine man denies those Priests which have lawful wives, to be Priests at
all; in the mean time he admits to the Altar, Whoremongers, Adulterers,
Incestuous persons: and afterward Everard Bishop of Saltzburg in Germany, in
an assembly at Regenspurge spoke thus of the Pope.

Hildebrandus -- p^lmus specie religionis Antichristi Imperij fundamenta ^ecit:
perditus homo ille (que^a Antichristum vocare sol^nt) in ^ujus front
contumeliae nomen scriptum est, Deus sum, err^re non possum, in templo Dei
sedet, long lateque dominatur. Id. lib. 7 page 684.
Hildebrand under color of Religion, laid the foundation of Antichrist's
kingdom: thus does that child of perdition, (whom they use to call Antichrist)
in whose forehead is written the name of blasphemy, [Revel. 13.2.] I am God, I
cannot err, he sits in the Temple of God, and bears rule far and near.

Now began the Croisier staff to beat down Crowns and Scepters, when
Hildebrand deposed the Emperor, Henry the fourth; and yet this fact of his was
opposed and condemned by diverse worthy Councels, Bishops and Historians, both
in France and Germany; and the like Papal Usurpations, Appeals, and
Investitures were also resisted in England. Hubert your Legate ( Fidelitatem
facere nolui ^^^^volo: qu^a nec ego prom^si, nec antecessores m^^s
ante^esso^i^us tuis id (...) comperio D. Vsserius de eccles. success. c. 7.

says William the Conqueror in his letter to Gregory the seventh) came unto
me, warning me from your Holiness, that I should do fealty to you, and your
successors; as for fealty, I neither would do it to you, neither will I;
because I neither promised it my self, nor do I find that my predecessors
have done that to your predecessors. When Anselme an Italian, was chosen
Archbishop of Canterbury, he craved leave of king William the second to go to
Rome, to receive his Pall of Pope Urban, wherewith the King greatly offended,
answered, Rex allegavit, quod n^llus Archi^^. v^l Episcopus Regni su^, Cu^ia
Romanae vel Papae subess^t; praecipu^ cum ipse omnes l^b^rtates haberet in
regno suo, quas Imperator vendic^bat in Imperio. Math. P^ris. Hist. an. 1094.
and Holinshead. Hist. ann. 1099. page 24.
That no Archbishop, nor bishop in his realm, was subject to the Court of Rome,
or the Pope; and that he had that liberty in his realm, that the Emperor had
in his Empire.

Anselme therefore was accused of high treason; and being still desirous to go
to Rome, the King told him, That if he would promise, and swear, neither to
go nor Appeal to Rome for any affairs whatsoever; he should then well and
peaceably enjoy his Bishopric: if not, that it should be free for him to
pass the Seas, but never to return; as the Monk of Saint Albans Nec p^o
quovis negotio Romanae ^edi^ au^ien^iam Appell^tu^u^. Id. ibid.
reports the matter.

Now also there arose great contention about the carnal presence of Christ in
the Sacrament, under Pope Victor, and Nicholas the second, Hildebrand being the
brand that kindled it, making Berengarius subscribe to their Tenet; That all
the faithful in the Sacrament do really tear with their teeth the body of
Christ; which position nevertheless in these days is with them accounted
heretical. And to say the truth, they really tear the body of Christ, who by
their ambition do miserably tear in pieces the Church of Christ.

Mother, the Church: and when the^ brought him in presence among them, Pope
Urban said, Includamus hunc in orb nostro, quasi alterius orbis papam, Let us

Now also lived Oecumenius, Radulphus Ardens, and Berengarius. And now let us
see, what these good men, and ^^ue Cathol^cke witnesses can say to the matter
in qu^stion.

Of the Scriptures su^ficiencie, and Canon.
Sa^nt Paul says of the Scriptures, that 1 Ti^. 3.15, 10, 1^.
They are able to make us wise unto salvation, that the man of God may be
pe^fited, thoroughly furnished unto all good works. That the man of God (says
O^cumenius Occum. (...).
) may be not only partaker, after a vulgar manner of every good work, but
perfect and complete by the doctrine of the Scrip^u^e. And Anselme in his
Commentary upon this place says, Quae literae p^ssunt te insl^uere id est,
su^fi^ien^er ^oc^am r^dd^^^ ad eternam salutem conseque^da^. A^s^lm. t^m. 2.
p^g. 121.
They are able to make thee sufficiently learned, to obtain eternal salvation.

Petrus Cluniacensis, Abbot of Clugin, abutting on these times (for he was
says S. Be^na^di aequalis fuit. B^lla^m. de Script. (...).
Bellarmine, of the same standing with Saint Bernard, who was borne in this
Age, ^ut flourished about the year 1130) after the recital of the canonical
books says, that R^stant p^s^ h^^ (...) c^^i^os S. S^ripture lib^os s^x non

There are besides the Authentical books, ^ixe others not to be rejected, as
namely, Judith, Tobias, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, and the two books of
Maccabees, which though they attain not t^ the high dignity of the former,
yet they are received of the Church, as containing necessary and profitable
doctrine.

Of Communion under both; and number of Sacraments.
Theophylact sharply reproves those, who delighted in drinking alone, and
quaffing by themselves, saying to such, (...). Theophyl. in 1. Co^. cap 11. v.
25. M. S. in A^chivis Biblioth. Bodle^anae Oxon.
How do thou take thy cup alone, considering that the dreadful Chalice is
alike delivered unto all. The Normans ( Normanni mane Domini^i co^poris ^t
sanguinis mu^imine saginati -- Mat. P^ris. in ^araldo.
says Matthew Paris) the morning before they fought with Harald, strengthened
themselves with the body and blood of Christ. Hildebert B. of Man's, ^^lates and
approves that Canon of the Council of Brachara, which condemns the delivering
of the bread sopt in the wine to the Laity, for the whole Communion. It is the
manner (says Hildebert Consuetudinis est^ Eucha^istiam nulli n^si intinctam
da^^ quod n^c ex Dominica Institutione, nec ^x sanctionibus authent^^is
reperitur assumptum. Hildebeit. Cenoman. Epist. 64. in Biblioth. Patr. to. 12.
page 338. Col^ Agri^. 1618.
) in your monasteries to give the Sacramental bread to none, but dipped in the
wine, which custom we find is not taken either from the Lords institution, nor
out of authencall constitutions. Now they that misliked the receiving of the
bread dipped in wine, how would they have been pleased with a dry feast? for of
the two, it is better to receive the bread dipped in wine, than the bread and no
wine at all. Fulbertus shows us the way of Christian Religion, Is to believe
the Trinity, and verity of the Deity, and to know the cause of his Baptism,
and in whom Terti on est, nosse in quo duo v^t^ S^cramenta, ^l^^st Dominici

(duo vitae Sacramenta) the two Sacraments of our life are contained. Anselme
mentions Conanu^^a faerunt ^mnibus ^udaeis Sa^^^men^a, sed non communis gra^^a:
it^ et nunc Baptismus (...) omnibus ^o^^unis est, ^^d non virtus Baptismi.
Commune nobis om^ibus est ^^crament^m corpo^is and sangu^uis Domini, sed non
co^muri^ v^^tus Sacramen^^. Anselm. in 1. Cor. ^^p o. to 2. p. 170.
but two Sacraments common to us under the Gosp^l, as the other were to the
Jews under the law; they two, and we two, two, and no more.

Of the Eucharist.
In the year 1608, there were published at Paris certain works of Fulbertus
Que tam a^res^tand^^ ^e (...) temporis qu^m a^ G^ll^rum his^^riam pe^tine^t.
pertaining as well to the refuting of the heresies of this time (for so says
the Inscription) as to the clearing of the history of the French. Among these
things that appertain to the confutatio^ ^f the heresies of this time, there is
one specially, fol. 168. laid down in these words, Nis^ manda^averitis in^uit
^arn^m fili^ ^^minis, (...) sanguinem biber^^i^, non ^abebi^^s vitam in vobis^
^a^m^s vel slagitium ^ide^ur ^^bere; sigu^a ergo (...).
Unless (says Christ) ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his
blood, ye shall not have life in you; he seems to command an outrage or
wickedness; It is therefore a figure, will the Heretic say, requiring us only
to communicate with the Lords passion and sweetly and profitably to lay up in
our memory, that his flesh was crucified and wounded for us. He that put in
these words ( Dicet Haereticus) thought he had notably met with the Heretics
of this time; but was not aware, that thereby he made S. Austin an Heretic for
company; for the words alleged, are S. Austins de doctrina Christiana. lib.
3. cap. 16. Which some belike having put the publisher in mind of, he was glad
to put this among his Errata; Nota (...) 1618. to ^^ page 4^.
and to confess that these two words [ Dicet Haereticus] were not to be found
in the Manuscript copy which he had from P^tavius; bu^ tells us not what we
are to think of him, that for the countenancing of the Popish cause, ventured
so shamefully to abuse S. Austin, as both the learned Archbishop of Armagh,
Doctor (...) 15.16.
Usher, and Master (...) Lords Supp^r. (...)
Moulin have observed.

PA.
Here is much a do about a mistake of two words, (...) 6.
says our I^suit Maloune.

PRO.
There has been much a do ere this about one word, the word Deipara; whether
the blessed Virgin Ma^y were to be called the mother of God, or no; great
difference raised in the Church touching the Sacrament, and all about three
prepositions, Trans, Con, and Sub; and the greatest stir that ever was in
Gods Church, was about one letter; (it was but one little Iota) whilst the
Arrians ^eld Christ to be (...) of the like substance with the Father, but
denied him to be (...), Consubstantiall, of the same substance with the
Father. Besides, was it a matter of nothing to corrupt the ancient writers,
Austin, or Fulbertus, or both? or could this Dicet Haereticus, in probability
be the mistake of the Printer? and not rather purposely done by such as could
not brook the truth of that doctrine which Fulbert delivered out of S.
Austine. But the same Fulbert elsewhere, in a higher strain, tells us of a
Spiritual, yet real receiving of Christ, saying, Exere palatum fidei, dilata
fauces sp^i, vis^^r^ charitatis extend, et sum panem vitae, interioris
hominis alimentum. Fulb^^^. Episc. in Bibl^oth. S. Pat. Paris. 1589. ^o. 3.
col. 640. in Epist. ad Adeodat.
Hold ready the mouth of thy Faith, open the jaws of hope, str^tch out the
bowels of love, and take the bread of life, which is the nourishment of the
inward man.

Objection.
Theophylact says, (...). Theop^ylact in Joan. cap. 6 v. 54 page 654. Qui
manducat me vivit propter me, dum quodammodo miscetur mihi, e^ transelementatur
in me. Theophylact. ibid.
He that eats me, shall live by me; forasmuch as after a sort, he is mingled
with me, and trans-elementated into me, or changed into me.

Answer.
Theophylact is not of that credit, as being but a late writer, above a
thousand years after Christ, and therefore far short of Primitive
antiq^itie, living as Bellarmine says in his catalogue of Ecclesia^ticke
writers, about the year 1071. Besides, transelementaion proves not
transubstantiation; for in transubstantiation, the matter is destroyed, and the
quantity and accidents remain; and in trans-elementation, the matter
remains, and the essential accidental forms are altered.

Objection.
Yea but Bellarmine Theophylactu^ di^it panem transmuta^i in carnem Domini.
Theophyl. i^ cap. 26. Math. and in cap 6. Joan Bellar. li. 2. de Euchar. cap.
34. Sed.
alleges Theophylact saying, of the Bread, that it is trans-elementated into
the body of Christ, and he uses the word, (...).

Answer.
Theophylact can best tell us his own meaning^ now the same Theophylact, who
said that bread was trans-elemen^ated into Christ's body, says also, nos in
Christum (...), that we also are trans-eleme^^ated into Christ; that a
Christian and faithful Communicant is in a manner t^ans-elementated i^to
Christ; for so his words are, (...)^ id. in cap. 6. Joan. N^w they will not say
that we are transubstantiated into Christ; therefore neither does Theophylact
by the word Trans-elementation, used of the bread and wine understand any
substantial, but only a Sacramental change, in respect of the use and
effect. And so I proceed. At this time also Berenger Archdeacon of Angiers in
France, resisted the corporal presence.

PA.
I challenge Berenger.

PRO.
You cannot justly except against him, either for his life or his learning^ In
these times ( Fuisse in pretio hac tempestate constat et Odi ^onem Abb^t.
C^uniac and B^rengarium Turonens vi^os s^nct^^^te and doctri^a in^igne^ Plat in

says Platina) Odo Abbot of Clunie, and Berenger of Tours, were of great
account, for their excellent learning, and holiness of life. Sigebert Abbot of
G^mbloux says, Liberalium artium, et a^^lius (...) p^ritia (...) Sig^be^t.
Gembl^^^ de ^llustr. ^ccles. S^^ptor cap. 155.
that Berenger was well skilled in the Liberal arts, and an excellent
Logician; Hildebert Bishop of Man's, and afterward Archbishop of Tou^s, was his
Scholar, and honored his deceased master with this Epitaph G^l^ Malms^ur. de
(...). ^ngl. lib. 3. p^g. 113 and 114.

He was a man, was blessed on every part,
The earth has his body, the heavens his heart,
My wish shall be, that at my end,
My soul may rest with this my friend.


PA.
What though he opposed the real presence; this was but one Doctors opinion,
which himself br^ached without any former Catholic precedent?

PRO.
That is not so; for his countryman Bertram, who was a Monk of Corbey Abbey
in France, opposed the same long before him: and Duval a Doctor of Sorbone
says, Duvalius ^it Amalarium una cum Ioanne Scoto fuisse Berengarij
p^aecursores. Andr. Duvalius in notis ad Flor. in Psalm. 80. test D Jacob.
Vsserio in Gotteschalco. cap 8.
that Amalarius and Ioannes Scotus were Berengers forerunners. The truth is,
he neither wanted forerunners, nor followers, and favorers. Sigeberts
Chronicle speaking of Berengers Tenet, faith, That there was much disputation,
and by many, both by word and writing, against him, and for him. Where the
learned bishop Usher observes, Jacob. Vsser. de Christian. eccles. suc^essione
ca. 7. nu. 26.
that the words, Et pro eo, and for him, specially favoring Berengers cause,
are left out in some Edition^; Vnde contra eum multum a multis et verbis and
scriptis dispuratum est. Sigebert. Gemblac^ Chron. ad an. 1051. Par. 1583.
but they are to be found in other authenticke copies: Vnde contra ^um, and
pro ^o, multum a multis, et verbis et scriptis disputatum est. Sigebe^t. Chron.
a Miraeo edit. Antu^rp. ann. 1608. and apud Surium to. 2. vit. Sanctor. April.
22. Colon. 1521.
and we may by the way observe, that this point of carnal presence, or the
Sacrament Sub Spectebus, (for so they term it) was but a disputable point, pro
and contra; and no matter of Faith in Berengers days. Indeed this doctrine was
borne down by the Popes power, so that diverse durst not make open profession
thereof, yet privately they employed both their tongues and pens in defense
thereof; and some even in a Roman Council, (purposely called against Berenger)
stood in Defense of his figurative sense of the Sacramental words, as appears
by the Quid^m ve^o coecitate nimia et longa perculsi, ^iguram tantum,
substantiale illud corpus esse conabantur as^ruere Concilior. tom 3. edit. a
Binnio. p^^t 2 p. 1286.
Acts of the same Council. In a word, Matthew of Westminster says, Berenga^ius
Turon^ns. in haeret^^^ p^olapsus pravitatem omnes Gallos, Ital^s, et Anglos,
suis ^am pene cor^uperat pravitatibus. M^th. Westmon. ad a^^. 1087.
that Berenger had almost drawn all France, Italy, and England to his
opinion: so that the Berengarians did not lu^ke in any obscure nooke, or corner
of the world, but spread themselves into the famousest parts of Europe.

PA.
Father Parsons says, Parsons in his three Conv^rs. p^rt. 1. chap. 10. nu. 21.
that Berenger Recanted; so that you cannot account him one of your side.

PRO.
Indeed Berenger was called, and appeared before diverse Councels, was
questioned, and cens^red by f^u^e several ^eo 9 Victor. 2. Nicol 2. Gr^gor. ^.
Popes; and there was a form of Recantation tendered to him, the tenor whereof
is this, ^go Be^^nganus -- p^osi^^^r me ^^n^r^, pan^m and vinum quae in Alta^^
ponuntur, p^st Conse^ration^m non s^l^^m Sa^ram^ntum s^d^^^^m ^^rum ^^rp^s, and

Sa^^rd^tum, trac^ari, ^ia^g^, and sid^lium dertibus atte^i. Gratian. d^
Conse^rat. D^^^. 2. ca. Ego B^r^ng^^.
as Gratian has registered it in his Decrees, Dec^et Gratiani Greg. 13. jussu
edit. Par. 1585.
aft^rwards published and confirmed by Pope Gregory the thirt^enth: I
Berengarius do firmly profess that I hold, that the body of Christ is in
this Sacrament, not only as a Sacram^nt, but even in truth is s^nsibly handled
with the Priests hands, and broken and torn with the teeth of the faithful.
Now this was such a form of an Oath, as that your own Gloss says of it,
Nist sine intell^ga^ ^^roa Berengarij in majo^^^m in^ides ^aeresin quam ipse
hab^it, and ideo omnia ^e^eras ad species i^sas, G^o^^^ apud Gr^tian. D^c^e^. 3
part. de Conse. D^^t ^. ca. Ego B^reng.
that Unless it be warily understood, on^ may fall into a greater heresy than
Bereng^r did. And yet this co^poral eating of Christ's flesh, with the
Capernaits in Saints Iobus sixth Chapter^ and this tearing his body with the
Communicants teeth, must be understood literally; inasmuch as the words were
purposely set down for a formal Recantation: and Bellarmine confesses, that
Nu^^e ^unt exac^iores formul^ loquendi, in (...), quam ^ae (...) ^^^nturij qui
(...) a^jurant. Bellar. li. (...) nag. c^. 21. (...).
There are no forms of speech more exact and proper in phrase, concerning the
matter of Faith, than such as are us^d by them that abjure heresy. Again,
what though B^renger upon the Clergies importunity, through humane frailty,
were constrained, For fear of death (as an Historian says B^r^^ga^us ipse
prae(...) mortis lib^os a (...) ignem proj^^it. ^^pyr. M^ss^n. An^al. ^ 235.236.

(...) Sco^^ liber d^ (...) est (...) Con^il. ve^c^l^^^se apud ^innium ^o. 3.


) to subscribe^ and to burn^ both his own book, and Scotus his treatise of
the Eucharist, which had led him into that opinion? yet he might still be of
the same judgment he was on before. And though he Recanted, yet he^ein he did
no more than Saint Pet^r (whose successor the Pope pretends himself to be) in
denying his Mast^r; no more, than Queen Mary, who being terrified with her
Fa^hers displeasu^e, wrote him a letter with her own^ hand, in which for ever
she renounceth the Pop^s authority here in England. And though he was driven
for the time to retract, yet upon his coming home, he returned to his former
Ten^t; and as one says who lived about the same time, Ad vomi^^^ (...) no^
(...). Nam in (...). ^ert. Constantiens. Presb. ad ann. 1083. in Append. ad
Herman. Chron. p. 352.
Nec tamen post^a dimisit, after that he never changed his opinion. In a word,
though Berenger himself were somewhat wavering, yet were his Scholars
constant; insomuch that Malmsburiensis a bitter enemy of theirs, says, that
Be^engarius plane qua^vi^ ipse sententia^ correxerit; omnes tamen, quos ex
totis terris depravaverat, convertere nequivit. Malmesbur. de gest. Anglor.
lib. 3. page 114.
Though Berenger retracted, yet they could never reclaim all those, whom he in
diverse countries had drawn away. And no marvel, since they leaned not on
the weak reed of man's authority, but on Gods word which abides for ever.

Of Images, and Prayer to Saints.
Anselmus Laudunensis in his Interlineall Gloss on the Bible, Anselm. Laudun.
u^riusque Testamenti scriptura^ glosa Interlineali et Marginali ex Patrum
scriptis explanavit. Tri^hem. de Scriptor. Eccles.
Composed out of the Fathers writings, Glossa Inter^in. in Deuteronomy. cap. 4.
expounds that text of Deuteronomy, Formam non vidistis, ye saw no manner of
similitude, [ Deuteronomy. 4.15.] in this sort; Ne scilicet volens imitari sculpendo
faceres Idolum tibi, lest that willing to resemble that similitude by engraving
thou should set up an Idol to thy self. In the former times, Respondeo
magna^ quidem esse qua^tione^; utr^m, vel quatenus, vel quomode ea qu^e circ^
nos aguntur noverint spiritus mortuoru^. Aug. in Psa. 108. ^n^^rat. 1
it was a great question, Whether at all, or how far, or after what manner
the Spirits of the dead did know the things that concerned us here; and
cons^quently whether they pray for us only Et tam^n generaliter orantibus pro
indigenti^ supplican^tum A^gust. de c^^a pro most. cap. 16.
in general; and for the particulars, God answers us according to our
several necessities, where, when, and after what manner he pleases. Anselmus
Laudunensis Interlineall Gloss upon that text; Abraham is ignorant of us, and
Irael knows us not; ( Esaias. 63.16.) note^h that Augustine says, that
Augustinus dicit; qui^ mortui nesciunt, eti^ sancti quid agant vivi, etiam
eorum silij. Glossa Interlin. in Es^iae. 63.
The dead, though Saints in heaven, do not know what the living do, no not
though they be their own children, of whom in all probability they have a
more special care. And indeed Saint Austine in his book Of the care for the
dead, makes this inference upon that place of Scripture; that Si tanti
Patriarchae quid erga populum ex his pro^r^atu^ ageretur, ignorav^runt; quomodo
mortu^ vivoru^ ^^bus atque actibus cognos^^ndis adjuvandisque misc^ntur. Au^.
ibid. c. 13.
If so great Patriarks, as was Abraham knew not what befell the people that
came of them; it was no way likely that the dead do entermeddle with the
affairs of the living, either to know them, or to further them; and
Theophylact gives some reason hereof, sayi^g, (...). Theophyl. in 1. ^p. ad
Th^ss cap. 3. M S^ Cir. in Arc^ivis Biblieth. (...) O^on.
Therefore it may be said, that the Saints, both those that lived before, and
sin^^ Christ's time, do not know all things, and that this is done, that
neither the Saints themselves should be too highly conceited, nor others
esteem them above that which is meet. And whereas the Romanists repose such
confid^nce in the interc^ssion of Saints, that they look to receive far
greater benefit by them, than by their own prayers; Theophylact (tracing Saint
Se^ the ^i^th Age, Of prayer to Saints.
Chrysostom in this very point,) me^ts with this their conc^it; Obs^rve (says
he (...). Theophyl in Math. cap 15.
) that although the Saints do pray for us, as the Apostles did still for her,
(to wit, the woman of Canaan,) yet we praying for our selves do prevail much
more.

I will close up this point with the testimony of one of our kings of England,
William the second. It appears by writers, says Holinshead. Hist. ad ann
1100. page 27.
Holinshead out of Eadmerus) that he doubted in many points of the religion
then in credit; for he sticked not to protest openly that he believed no Saint
could pro^it any man in the Lords sight; and therefore neither would he, nor
any that was wise (as he affirmed) make intercession, either to Peter, or any
other for help.

Of Faith and Merit.
Theophylact says, (...) Theophyl. in 3. c. ep ad Gal. M S. in Bibl^och Bo^l
Oxon.
The Scripture, that is, God himself who gave the Law, has foreordained,
that we are justified not by the Law, but by Faith; and again (...). Id ibid.
the Apostle having shown how that the Law accurseth, but Faith blesses, he
now shows; that Faith only justifies, and not the Law. And Anselme says,
C^rt^ ^ola fide Abrah^m ^^rtur Deo plac^^sse. Ans^lm^ de excellentia B. V^^.
Mar. c. 3 p. 241. -- (...) sol^ ^ide, et grati^ accip^^^^ remissionem
peccato^um Id in 1 Cor. cap. 1. to. 2. page 121.
Truly by Faith only was Abraham said to have pleased God, and this was
imputed to him for righteousness. Radulphus Ardens says, and that from the
Testimony of Saint Augustine, Test^ enim Augustin^, ^olam gratiam suam cororat
in nobi^ Deus Radulph Ar^ens Do^ini^^ 18 post (...). Homil. 1.
that God crowns only his own grace in us; and the same Radulphus, as I
find him alleged by D^ctor Usher in his learned Answer to the Jesuits
Challenge in Ireland, in the point of Merit, (for I could not elsewhere meet
with him) says, Nihil enim aliud quam grat^^ (...) ^oronat i^ no^is D^us; q^i
si v^ll^t in (...) agere district^, non ^u^ti^icaretur in consp^ctu (...)
Apos^^lus qui plu^ ^mnibus l^b ra^it di^it; ^xistimo quo^ n^n u^t ^^digne pa^si
(...) que revelabitur in nobis; (...) R^d A^dens Domi^^^. in S^ptu^ge^. Ho^ 2.
God crowns nothing else in us but his own grace, who if he should d^ale
strictly wi^h us, no man living should be justified in his sight; whereupon the
Apostle who labored more than all, s^ith, I reckon that the sufferings of this
time are not worthy to be comp^red with the glory which shall be re^^^aled in
us: therefore this agreement is nothing else but G^ds voluntary promise. In
like sort, Occumentus a Greek Scholiast, says, (...). Oecumen. in Romans 8.18.
We cannot suffer or bring in any thing worthy of the reward that shall be;
and our Anselme Archbishop of Canterbury more fully, saying, Si homo mill
annis servir^t Deo, etiam ^erv^n^^ssime; non meritur ex condigno, dimidiam diem
^ss^ in regno coe^o^um Anselm^ de mensurat. C^ucis. page 188. Colon. 1612.
If a man should serve God a thousand years, and that most fervently, he
should not deserve of Condignitie, to be half a day in the kingdom of heaven.
Besides it it evident that this doctrine of free grace was the received
doctrine of the Church, both abroad, and here in England shortly after the
Conquest; and for diverse ages after taught and believed both of Priest and
people: for there was a certain form of Instruction, appointed to be given
unto men upon their deathbeds, to prepare them thereunto, and to lead them
unto Christ. It was put into question and Answer, was commonly to be had in
their Libraries, and thought (for so says Cardinal Hosius expressly Sed ^t
Anselmus Archiep. Cantuar. Inter^ogationes quasdam praescripsisse dicitur
infirmis in extr^mis cons^^^u^is. Hosi^s in Confessione Pe^icoviensi. cap. 73.
) to be made by Anselme Archbish^p of Canterbury. Amongst the questions
propounded to the sicke-man, this was one, ^^edis te ^on poss^ nisi per mortem
^hristi serva^i? respon^et infi^mus^ eti^m tum illi dic^tur age ergo d^m
superest in te anima in ^ac sola mort^ fiduciam (...) constitue, in null^ (...)

obtendo in^er me, ^t mala merita mea, ips^^sque m^ritum offero pro me^^to, quod
ego debuiss^m hab^re n^c habeo. Id. ibid.
Do^st thou believe that thou can not be saved, but by the death of Christ?
whereunto he when he has made answer affi^matively, he is presently directed
to make use thereof in this manner: Go to therefore, as long as thy soul
remains in thee; place thy whole confidence in this death only; have
confidence in no other thing; commit thy self wholly to this death, with this
alone cover thy self wholly. If he say unto thee that thou have deserved
damnation^ say, Lord I set the death of our Lord Jesus Christ, betwixt m^ and
my bad merits; and I offer his merit in s^eed of the merit which I ought to
have, but yet have not. Here was a Cordial for a sick-soule in extr^mis, more
sovereign than their extreme unction, or Holy-water-sprinkle; than any
Ind^lgences, Re^^kques, or Images, yet their quesy stomachs cannot now digest
this Catholicon: but have called S. Anselms visitation i^to the Spanish
inquisition; and there by their expurgatorie Index, set out by Cardinal
Quiroga, have commanded these Interrogatories to b^ blotted out: Ex libro qui
ins^^ibitur Ordo Baptizand^ cum modo visita^di impr^sso Vene^ijs anno 1575; e
^olio 34. pau^o post m^dium; Deleant^^ illa verba: Credis quod D. noster jesus
Christus pro nost^a salute mortuus sit^ et quod ^x p^oprijs meri^is, vel al^o
modo null possit salvari, nisi merito p^ss^onis ejus? Ind. Expurgat. per
Quirog. Mad^it. 1584.
Do thou believe to come to glory, not by thine own merits, but by the
v^rtue and merit of the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ? and, Do thou
believe that our Lord Jesus Christ did dye for our salvation; and that none can
be saved by his own merits, or by any other means, but by the merit of his
passion? whereby we may observe (says our learned and laborious Bishop Bishop

point (which is the very foundation of all our Comfort) have most shamefully
departed from the Faith of their forefathers.

THE TWELFTH CENTVRIE, from the year one thousand one hundred, to one thousand
two hundred.
PAPIST.
YOu said that Satan was loosed in the former ages, was he bound in this?

PROTESTANT.
In this age he was mainely curbed by the professors commonly called Waldenses.
There was also in England in the time of Henry the first, (for his knowledge
surnamed Beau-clerke, or fine scholar) great contention touching investitures,
or the collation of Bishoprics. When Thurstan elect Archbishop of York,
received his consecration from the Pope, Turstanus a Papa consecratur, quod ut
Regi Anglorum innotuit, omnem ci locum su^e dominationi^ interdixit. Math.
Paris. ad an. 1119. in Histor. majore.
the King understanding thereof, forbad him to come within his Kingdoms.

This contention between the Crown and the Mitre was ho^ly pursued between
King Henry the second, and Thomas Becket Archbishop of Canterbury; it was
partly occasioned Huic controversiae praestitit ^ccasionem Philip. de Broc.
Cano^^cu^ Bedford, qui tractus in causam propter Homici^ium, in R^gis

by one Philip de Broc Canon of Bedford, who being questioned for a murder, he
used some reproachful speeches to the Kings Justices, for which he was
censured: and I find, that in these days (as the Monk of N^wborrough who
then lived, says ^ Iu^icibus intim^tum ^st, quod multa contra disciplinam
publicam, scilic^^ furt^, rapinae, homicidia a Clericis s^epius committerentur,
ad quos scilicet Laicae non posset Iurisdictionis vigor extendi. Gul Nubrigens.
^ib. 2. Cap. 16. p. 137.
) the abuses of Church men were grown to a great height, insomuch as the
Judges complained in the Kings presence, that there were many robberies and
rapes, and murders, to the number of an hundred committed within the Realm,
by Ecclesiastical persons (upon presumption of exemption from the censure of
the laws.)

Herewith the King was so highly displeased, that he required that Justice
should be ministered alike unto all sine delectu, says Novoburgensis Rege,
ma^efactore^^ si^e d^l^ctu exterminari jub^^ti. Gul. Nov^burg. quo supra.
, and Roger Hoveden says, Rex v^lebat Presbiteros, and alios ecclesie R^^^^res

ad an. 1164.
the Kings pleasure was that such of the Clergy as were taken in any murder,
robbery, or felony, should be tried and adjudged in his temporal Courts, as
Laymen were; but the Archbishop would have the Clergy (so off^nding) tried
only in the spiritual Courts, and by men of their own coat; who, if they
were convict, should at first only be deprived of their benefices, but if they
should again be guilty of the like, they should be adjudged at the Kings
pleasure.

But the King stood upon his Leges Avitae, his Grandfathers laws and customs;
which were indeed the ancient laws of this realm, not first enacted by the
Conqueror, but only confirmed by him, and received from his predecessors,
Edgar the peaceable, and Alfred the learned Prince, and accordingly the King in
a great assembly at Clarendon, Ap^d Clarend^^ facta est Recognitio
consuetudinum and libertatum antecess^^um s^orum, Regis Hen^ici ^vi sui. Math.
Paris. ad an 1164.
confirmed the foresaid laws of his Grandfather, and enacted: that none should
appeal to the Sea of Rome, for any cause whatsoever, without the Kings License.

That it should not be lawful for any Archbishop or Bishop to depart the
Realm, and repair to the Pope, upon his summons, without the Kings license.

That Clerks criminous, should be tried before secular Judges.

By this we find two maine branches, of Papal Jurisdiction, Bellarm. de Romano
Pontifice lib. 2. cap. 21.
to wit, Appeals, and the exemption of Clergy men from being tried in causes
criminal, before Christian Magistrates, strongly opposed by the King, and the
State.

Now also the Schoolmen began to arise, of whom Peter Lombard, Master of the

, he has heard of his Masters, James Faber of Estaples, and Iodocus
Clichtoveus, above a thousand times, that this Lumbard had troubled the pure
fountain of Divinity, with muddy questions, and whole rivers of opinions: and
this (says he) experience does sufficiently teach us, if we be not wilfully
blind. And yet some of their distinctions, being purged from barbarism, and
clearly applied to the point in question, may be of good use: especially, when
as according to the proverb, we can eat the Dates, and cast out their stones,
and herein Zanchius and Iunius were excellent. It is reported A qu^bus^^am

that Lumbard, Gratian, and Comestor, (three pillars of Popery, Gratian for
the Cannon law, Comestor for the history of the Church, and Lumbard for
Schoole-divinity) were three bastards, borne of one woman, who in her
sickness coming to confession could not be drawn to be sorry for this her
incontinuencie, but thought she had done well in bearing those great lights of
the Church; whereunto her confessor replied, that, that was not hers, but Gods
gift they proved such great scholar; however, she was to be sorry for her
fault, and be heartily sorry for this, that she could not sorrow and lament as
she should. One of these brothers was called Comestor Cog^omento Comestor, quod

Now what opinion was held of the Papacy, may be seen by the testimonies of
such of their own, as were famous in this age. Johannes Sarisburiensis, had a
conference with Pope Adrian the fourth, called Nicholas Breake-speare, an
English man, which himself has l^ft us in writing. I remember (says he Si^^t
^nim diceb^tur ^ (...) Roma^^ Ecc^^si^, (...) M. 15. (...) Colon. 1622.
) I went unto Apulia to visit Pope Adrian the fourth, who admitted me into
great familiarity, and inquired of me, what opinion men had of him, and of the
Roman Church; I plainly laid open unto him the evil words I had heard in
d^vers Provinces, for thus it is said; The Church of Rome, which is mother of
all Churches, behaveth her self toward others, not as a mother, but as a
stepdame: The Pope (says he) laughed at it, and thanked me for my liberty of
speech. The same John of Sarisbury says (...) p. 4^4.
, that they wholly apply themselves unto wickedness, that they may seem
Concilium vanitatis, a Council of vanity, the wicked Synagogue of the
Gentiles, ecclesia malignantium, the Church of the envious, and evil doers.
Peter of Bloyes, describes unto us, in the person of an Official, the fashion

and from the midst of Babylon, and leave the mystery of this most damnable
stewardship.

Richard the first, King of England, and Philip the second of France, being on
their voyage to Jerusalem, and coming into Sicilie, and there hearing of Abbot
Ioachim (who was thought to have the gift of Prophe^ie) they desired to know of
him what success they should have in this their expedition: the Abbot (says
Paulus Aemilius) I^u^os eos, sed par^^ profectures respondit -- nimis verus
vates Ioachimus extitit. Paul. A^myl. in Philip. 2. lib. 6. p. 175.
answered, they should not then recover it: and therein he proved too true a
Prophet: besides this they heard him expound the vision of Saint John in the
Apocalypse, touching the Churches afflictions, and Antichrist who (as he said
Explicans (Ioachim) haec verba Apocalyp. unus illorum nondum venit, scilicet
Antichristus, de isto Antichristo dicit idem Ioachim; quod jam na^us ^st in

) was then borne, and in the City of Rome, and should be advanced in the Sea
Apostolic, of whom the Apostle said, He should extol himself above all
that is called God: and that the seven Crowns, were the Kings of the earth,
that obeyed him; but in the end, the Lord should consume him with the spirit of
his mouth.

I know indeed that Parsons says, Three conversions of England. part. 1.

the Trinity. Extravag. de Trinit. But others Martin Luther.
have made his just Apology and cleared him from that imputation. Besides, all
is not Gospel that is set down in the Popes Decretalls, or Extravagants, no
not in their own account. With this of the Prophet Ioachim, agrees that of
the Prophetess Saint Hildegard, foretelling the utter extinguishing of
Religion amongst them of the Romish order. The Roman Empire (says this
Prophecy Hildegardis Prophetia exta^ apud Albert. Staden sem post ann. 1149. a
page 169. ad 178. as is witnessed by Doctor Crakanthorpe in his treatise of the
Popes tempo^all Monarchy.
) shall decay, and those Princes who did cleave unto it, shall separate
themselves from it, and be no longer subject to it: this Empire (in the West)
thus decaying without hope of repayring, the Miter of the Apostolic honor
shall also perish, Tunc Insula Apostolici honoris dividetur, quia nulla religio

because neither Princes, nor other shall find ullam religionem, any religion
in the Apostolic order, that is, in the Popes; therefore they shall take away
the honor of the Pope; who shall scarc^ ^^ve Rome and a few bordering places,
under his Miter. All worldly Princes, (says the same Nun The prophecy of
Hildegard the Nun.

Now also lived Peter Bruis, and his disciple Henry a monk of Toulouse: who

burned. Papirius Massonius deriveth the pedigree of the Waldenses from these
two: he says further that they preached against transubstantiation, or the
carnal presence: the adoration of the cross, as also against praying for the
dead, and other tenets of the Roman Church: Saint Bernard says, (...)
bapti^amus infantes, quod ^^^mus ^^^ mortuis, quod sanc^^^um (...) (...)
Bernard. in Cant ^^^m. 6^.
they denied purgatory, and invocation of Saints: and the same Bernard more
credulous than reason required, reproves them, that like the Manichees they
condemned the use of matrimony, and of flesh, and denied also baptism to
infants: but especially Bern. epist. 24^.
against Henry he objecteth the keeping of a Concubine, and playing at dice,

It is great pity that their own books are made away, so that we are
constrained to pick out their life and doctrine from the writings of their
professed adversaries, whose report may justly be suspected: for even in like
manner we read in Tertullian, (...) and (...) Apologet. c^p. 7
that monstrous opinions and crimes were imputed to the first Christians. And
yet Bernard in the mean time says (...) sunt ^abitas ^^ (...), qui boni
videri, non esse; ^^li non videre, sed esse volunt. Bern. in Cant. sermon. 66.
they are sheep in habit, and these are they that would seem good, and yet
are not; wicked, and yet would not seem so. It must needs be then, that their
outward conversation was good: it is also confessed Non modo patientes sed and
(...), ut videbatur duceren^r ^d mortem. id. ibid.
, that their disciples went cheerfully to the fire, and constantly suffered al
extreamities for the doctrine of their faith; now how could this agree with a
dissolute life and doctrine?

Petrus Cluniacensis (a bitter adversary of theirs) having charged Petr.
Clumacens. lib. 1. epist. 1. and 2.
them with diverse errors, seems to have perceived that he had done them
wrong, for he adds these words: Sed quia eum ita sentire vel praedicare
nondum mihi plene fides facta est, disser^ r^spensionem; quousque and horum
qu^e d^cuntur indubi^m habeam certitudinem. id. epist. 1.
But because I am not yet fully assured that they think and preach so, I will
defer my answer until I have undoubted certainty of that they say. They
were favored both of Clergy and Laietie, and followed with such multitudes,
that the Temples (says Bernard Basilicae sine plebibus, pleb^s sine Sacerdote,
Sacerdotes sine debita reverentia sunt. Bern. in ep. 240.
) remained without people, the people without Priests, and Priests without due
reverence; yea Saint Bernard himself was glad to write to Hildefonsus Earl of
Saint Giles, Bernardi Epistola 24^. ad Hildefons. Commit. S. Aegidij.
(in whose territories they preached) to desire the Earl that he would no
longer protect them: Fef^llisse priores, errare posteros. id. ibid.
the argument brought against these professors, was the same with that which is
used at this day: Have our Fathers then erred so long a time? are so many men
deceived? have these only the truth? And so I come to speak of the Waldenses.

PAP.
What say you to these Waldenses? were they men of a good life, and sound
doctrine? had they any visible congregations? had they any lawful ordination
and succession? were they of any long standing, and continuance? and if they
had; can you show that they agreed with you in point of faith and Religion?

PROT.
The Waldenses began to show themselves about the year 1160, says Gretser the
Jesuit, Circa annum Domini 1160 ortus ^st Petrus Waldus. Jacob. Gr^tser.
Prolegom. in script. edit. contr. Waldenses.
their adversaries gave them sundry names; sometimes from the place of their
aboade they were called, Pauperes de Lugduno, poor men of Lions a City in
France; sometime Albigenses from the City and Country of Albi; and usually
Waldenses, of their principal teacher, Petrus Waldus.

This Waldus was a rich Merchant, and Citizen of Lions in France, who seeing
one fall down dead in the street, made so good use of this spectacle of man's
frailety, as that he forthwith began to repent, and change his former course of
life; giving alms to the poor: and betaking him to the study of the
Scripture, he profited so well therein; that he translated diverse parts
thereof out of Latin into the French tongue, and taught Cun. a^^em esset
aliquantuluns ^^tera^^s, Novi Testame^ts t^xtum docuit cos vulgariter.
Rain^rius contr. H^r^t. cap. 5.
the same in the Mother tongue, to the people that frequently resorted to him.

This doing displeased the Romish Prelates, who were like the dog under the
manger, that can neither himself eat the hay, nor yet will let the horse eat
it; so that they raised persecution against Waldus and his followers; and this
persecution was the occasion to spread their doctrine farther abroad, not
only over France, but almost over all the parts of Europe.

Now what the Waldenses were, let one of their Inquisitours speak: Rainerius
(whose book Gretser the Jesuit lately set out among other writers against the
Waldenses) says; I^ter omnes has sectas, qu^e (...) sunt, vel sucrunt, ^on est
pernitiosior ecclesi^ quam ^co^^starum: and hoc (...) de causis, p^ima est qui^
e^t Di^tur^ior, aliqui e^^^m dicunt, quod d^^auit a ^^mpore Syluestri; aliqui a

Amongst all Sects, which are or have formerly been, none is more pernicious
to the Church than that of the Leonists. First, because it continued longer
than any other, for some say it has lasted ever since Pope Silvester; others
say, ever since the Apostles. Secondly, because no Sect is more general all
than this, for there is scarce any Country, in which it is not found. Thirdly,
whereas other Sects deter men with their horrible blasphemies, this Sect of
the Leonists, makes a great show of godliness, because they live righteously
before men, and b^leeve all things rightly touching ^od, and concerning all
other Articles of the Creed: only they blaspheme the Roman Church and Clergy,
in which thing the Laity is forward to give credit unto them.

Parsons the Jesuit, Pars^ns three Conve^sions part 2. chap. 10, 26, 27, and

howsoever in some points they agreed with the Protestants, yet they mainely
differed from them in other; so that they cannot both belong to one and the
same Church?

Answer.
Indeed many have borne false witness against them, but their witness do not

I know this is objected by Parsons and others; and yet Reinerius who was one
of their Inquisitors, said of them (as is already alleged) that they made a
great show of Godliness and lived righteously before men, and believed all
things rightly touching God, and concerning all other Articles of the Creed.
Again, Casti sunt Leonistae; the Leonist's live chastely: and again, Quae
libet natura turpia devitant: They avoid whatsoever is naturally dishonest.

Claudius Seisselius Archbishop of Turin, a man in great credit under Jews the
twelfth, King of France; although he had written a book expressly against the
Waldenses, yet he thus far cleereth them saying; No^nihil etiam ad Valdensium
con^ir^andam tolerandamque sectam consert, quod praeter haec (quae contra fidem
r^ligionemque nostram assumu^t, in reliquis ^erme puriorem quam caeteri
Christiani vitam agunt; non enim ni^i coacti iurant, ^aroque nomen Dei in vanum
pros^runt, promissaque sua bon^fide imp^ent Claud. Seissel advers. sectam
Valdens. page 9.
that it makes much for the confirmation and toleration of that prof^ssion,
that (setting aside differences in point of Faith) in other things they welnigh
lead a more godly life than other Christians; for they swear not unless they
he constrained, they seldom take the name of the Lord in vain, and they are
very careful to keep their promise. When some of the Cardinals, and Prelates
accused the remainders of the Waldenses in Merindol and Cabriers, that they
were Heretics, sorcerers, and incestuous persons, and thereupon moved that
good King Lewis the twelfth to root them out: the Waldenses having notice
hereof, sent their Deputies to his Majesty to declare unto him their
innocence; whereupon the Prelates were instant upon the King, not to give such
Heretics any access or audience: T^m Rex; ^tiamsi, inquit, (...) Turc^m aut
d^abolum bell^m suscipiendum esset, eoc tamen p^ius a^dire vell^m Wese^be^ij
oration de ^aldens. page 418. ^xtat in Ioach. Ca^^r^^ij History narratione de
Frat^^^^ ort^odexo^^m ecclesijs in Bohemi^ etc.
but the King answered, that if he were to make war against the Turk, he
would first of all hear him: whereupon the King sent master Adam Fume his
Master of Requests, and one Doctor Parvi his confessor, to search and inquire
both into their life and religion: the Commissioners accordingly visited those
places, and upon their return related to the King what they had found, namely:
that (...) ad Regem re^erunt, ill^ i^ locis homines baptizari. Articulos fidei
and Decalogum doceri. Dominicos d^^ religiose coli, Dei ver bum exponi,
venes^i^ and s^upra apud ^os rulla esse. Hic au^itis Rex (...) ^^urando addito:
me, inquit, and caetero populo me^ Cat^olico m^^^ores (...) viri sunt. (...).
in orat. de Valdens. ap^d Ioach. Camerar. page 419.
Infants were baptized, the Articles of faith were taught, the Lords Prayer,
the ten Commandments, the Lords day observed, the Word of God Preached, and no
show of wickedness or fornication to be perceived amongst them, C^terum se in
ipsorum templis, neque Imagines, n^que or^^m^nt^ (...) ulla (...). ibid.
only they found not any Images in their Churches, nor any ornaments belonging
to the Mass.

The King hearing this report of the Commissioners, said (and he bound it with
an oath) that they were better men than he, or his people; better than
himself, and the rest of his subjects.

And thus we have cleared the Waldenses from Parsons his first imputation: a
foul slander indeed, but yet such as we find Tertulli^n in Apologet. cap. 7.
and (...) his wi^ked Or^^ion in Minutius Felix hi^ Octavius.
was cast upon the ancient Christians, as well as upon them: and most unjustly
and untruely upon both of them.

Object.
The 2 and 3 Articles objected.
They held, that it was not lawful for Christians to swear at all, for any
cause whatsoever, because it is written, Do not swear, Matthew 5. James 5.
They held also that the magistrate ought not to condemn any to death, because
it is written, Judge not, Matthew chap. 7. Luke chap. 6. Parsons, loco citato.

Answer.
Claudius Seissel (as before is alleged) says indeed that they do not
swear unless they be constrained; belike then being lawfully called they
refuse not to swear in Judgment: in trivial matters they would not swear
rashly, according whereunto they alleged our Saviors precept; besides, they
affirm, In their book entitled, the Spiritual Almanacke, in the third
C^mment. cited by the History of the W^ldens^s, book 1. chap 4.
that there are lawful oaths, tending to the honor of God, and their
Neighbors good, and they allege that place in the sixth to the Hebrews, 16.
that an oath for confirmation to them is an end of all strife.

The other cavil arose upon their complaining, that the magistrates delivered
them to death, without any other knowledge of the cause, than the bare report
of their Inquisitors, Priests, and Friars, who were parties, and their
professed enemies, otherwise the Waldensian doctrine was, In their book
entitled, the Light of the treasure of faith fol. 214. cited ibid.
that they were not to suffer the Malefactor to live.

Object.
They hold that the Apostles Creed is to be contemned, Parsons quo supra.

Answer.
This is an idle cavil; for Reinerius has already told us, that they believe
all the Articles contained in the Creed: besides, in their books they have
very good and Catholic expositions of the Creed. Do these men then slight the
Creed? They do not indeed hold the Creed to be a prayer, no more do they
that of the Angels Hail to Mary they hold it to be a salutation, and no direct
invocation, as Claudius Seissel says Salutationem Angelicam ad Dei genitricem
fidelibus frequent^ndam ^on c^nse^t, quasi i^a orationis forma^ non habeat, sed
salutationis^ Claud. Seissel. c. Sectam. Vald. page 54.
it follows not hence, because they hold not the Creed, nor the Angelical
Salutation to be any direct prayer, that therefore they neglect the Creed. The
other allegation is as idle, for their own writers Reyner, and others record
diverse other of their prayers, as for grace before meat, this: He that blessed
the five Barley loaves, and two Fishes, in the Desert to his Disciples, bless
this table unto us; and after meat, thus: God which has given us corporal
food, give us also spiritual life.

Object.
They held, that the power of consecrating the body of Christ, and of hearing
confessions was left by Christ, not only to priests, but also to laymen if
they be just. Parsons ibid.

Answer.
The first part of this Article they held not: but rather the contrary, that
neither Priests nor Laikes could consecrate the body of Christ: for Reinerius
says; Reinerius in Su^^a de Catharis and Leonistis.
They do not believe the Sacrament to be the true body and blood of Christ,
but the bread consecrated is called in a certain figure the body of Christ, as
it is said, the Rock was Christ, and the like. For the second, they said
truly, and we hold, that we are to confess our faults one to another, James
5, 16. yea though they be Lay People, so they be godly and discreet, and able
to counsel and comfort us: but especially to the discreet and learned
Minister of Gods Word, to receive from him Ghostly comfort, counsel, and upon
our hearty repentance, absolution.

Object.
They held, that no Priests must have any living at all, but must live on
alms: and that no Bishops or other dignity is to be admitted in the Clergy,
but that all must be equal. Parsons ibid.

Answer.
That their Ministers may not lawfully take and enjoy livings, or that it was
sin so to do; they taught not, but were sorry So they profess in their
Answer: Ad literam Augustini Olmucensis, Anno 1508. et pleni^s in scripto edito
1572.
they had not sufficient stayed livings for them, whereby they might have more
time to their studies, and greater opportunity to instruct them with necessary
doctrine and knowledge^ but they were not ashamed of their Ministers that were
content to work with their hands to get their living, as the Apostles had done
before them.

So that if they spoke ought that looked that way, it was only pro hic and
nunc, as their case then stood: they were now both pastors and people thrust
out of their own Country, and goods, and glad to live upon others benevolence
and collections, which happily made them call them, The poor men of Lions.

Howsoever, they were so far from liking the course of the begging Friars, or
vowing of voluntary poverty, as that they held the order of begging Friers^ to
be the Devils invention Mendicantium Religionem malos D^^mones invenisse.
Aeneas Silvius Histor. Bohem. Cap. 35.
; and Monkish vows to be vain, as occasioning foul and fearful lusts

in Jurisdiction, for they allowed Deacons, Presbyters, and Bishops, as Guido

It is possible that the Waldenses might have had this fancy, but not
probable, for only Guido Carmelita says it: but Aeneas Sylvius, a far more
diligent man, and of better jud^ement, mentions it not: neither Antoninus nor
Bernard of Lutzenburg, (though they all pro^essedly reckon up their errors) but
rather they say the contrary: that the Waldenses held, that the Priest might
consecrate in every place, and time, and minister to them that desire it: and

the Sacramental words only.

, that the Albingenses held with the Manichees, that there were two prime
beginnings, or Authors of things, that is; one good God, the Creator of good:
and one bad, that is, the Devil, the creator of evil; and that they denied the
resurrection, and thought there was no Hell.

Answer.
Friar Reyner their inquisitour says, they believed all the Articles contained
in the Creed. And for the other imputation, he that shall but read the
confession of their faith tendered to Ladislaus King of Hungary, and extant in
Orthinus Gratius Confessio Fratrum Waldensium ad Vladi^^aum Hungariae Regem
^issa^ extat in Fa^^iculo re^um exp^tend and ^ugiend p. 85.
, will easily clear them thereof. This cavil is thought to be grounded upon
that assertion of the Waldenses, that the Pope had no authority over the Kings
and Princes of the earth, who depend immediately upon God alone; and from hence
they took occasion to call them Manichees, as appointing two prime or cheef
originalls and Jurisdictions: and it may seem to be taken out of the
extravagants of Pope Boniface the eight, who subjecting the authority of
Emperors, Quicunq^e h^i^ potesta^^ resistit, Dei ordinationi r^^ist^t, ni^i
duo (^uut Manicheus) ^i^git esse principi^. De Maj^rit. and obed. Ca^^ Vnam
Sanctam.
says of his own, Whosoever resists this power, resists the ordinance of God,
unless with the Manichee he devise du^ principia, two prime originalls of
things. Now against this imputation, the Waldenses profess, In the book of the
Treasure of Faith, the second Article ^^ted by the History of the Waldeuses,
book 1. chap. 4. p. 19.
that they believe that the holy Trinity has created all things visible and
invisible, and that he is Lord of things celestial, terrestrial, and
infernal, as it is said it Saint John, All things were made by him, and
without him nothing is made.

Besides it might be that the Manichees, some of them living amongst the
Waldenses, such as spited the Waldenses, by one common term nicknamed them
and called them Manich^e^s and Catharists: as sometimes the Donatists, and
called Or^^s est conflictus de C^tho^ici nomine and Donatist^rum and
C^^ili^^ist^rum. Augustine. Bru^^cul. Collation. cum Donatist. cap. 4. Tom. 7.
the Christians and Catholics Caecilianists. By this that has been said it
appears, that there is not any such odds between the Waldenses and us, as
Parsons and Prateolus have given out; but that for substance of Religion they
agree with us; and accordingly Orthuinus Gratius says Non multum alicub^

of the confession of the Waldensian faith presented to the King of Hungary,
that in some points it little differs from that which is delivered by others
(he means our Protestant pro^essours) so as they may see me to have received
it from them; and Le Sieur la Popeli nere in his history of France speaks more
fully, namely Doctrinam suam, o^ c^ qua^ body Protestants ample^^untur parum

; that the Waldenses and Albigenses, about the year 1100 and the succeeding
times, spread their doctrine (parum differentem) little differing from that
which the Protestants now embrace.

Object.
It seems you stick close to the Waldenses, and yet your Jewel casts them
off, saying; Jewels Apology. cap. 7 (...). 3.
they are none of ours?

Answer.
The passage in B. Jewel is this; B. Jewel ibid.
Master Harding says that Hus, Hierome of Prage, Wickleffe, Almarick,
Abailard, the Apostolikes, Petrobrussians, Berengarians, Waldenses,
Albingenses, Image-breakes, and such like, ever found fault with the Church in
their time.

Whereunto B. Jewel replyeth in these terms: of Abailard, and Almarick, and
certain other your strange names, if they have taught any thing contrary to
the truth of God, we have no skill, they are none of ours; of John Hus, Hierome
of Prague, and Berengarus: and other like virtuous learned men, we have no
cause to be ashamed: their doctrine stands still, and increases daily,
because it is of God.

And elsewhere he says, (...). ^ap. 2. Divis. 1
As for John Wickleffe, John Husse, Valdo, and the rest, for ought we know, and
I believe setting malice aside, for ought you know, they were godly men; their
greatest heresy was this: that they complained of the dissolute lives of the
Clergy, of worshipping of Images, of the tyrannical pride of the Pope, of
Pardons, pilgrimages, and purgatory, and that they wished a reformation of the
Church: we succeed not them, nor bear their names; we succeed him whose word
we profess. By this it appears what Bishop Jewel thought of Wald^ and
others: and if he had cast off the Waldenses as none of ours, it might be
imputed to this, that he beheld them as their persecutors painted them out with
spots of Manicheisme, and other vile errors.

PAP.
If the Waldenses were free from such errors as Parsons, and others have taxed
them withal: how came it to pass that such gross opinions were fathered on
them?

PROT.
You say well, they be fathered on them, even as sometime a light housewife
lays her burden at an honest man's door: but themselves never begat such
strange opinions; for the Waldenses in their confessions say Harum
^riminatio^^^ quibus crebro culpamu^, nihil consci^ sumus. Fasci^ rerum
expetend. et fugiend. p. 85^
, That they were nothing at all guilty of those things that were laid to their
charge.

That worthy Historian Thuanus reckons up their opinions, and then adds His
praecipuis ^^ c^rtis e^rum doctrinae capitibus ^li^ officta de Conjug^^,
resurrectione, animae fl^t^ post mortem, and de cibis. Thuan. Hist. sui
temporis. Ad an. 1550. l. 6. page 513
; To these certain and chief heads of their doctrine (alia afficta) others
others were fained and devised, concerning marriage, Resurrection, the state of
souls after death, and of meats.

Bernard de Girard, Lord of Haillan, says; Et bien qui^'s ^ussent des
mauvaises opinions, ^i est^a qu^ else ne suscit^r^^t pastant la haine du P^pe,

Girard. l^ Histoire de France so^bs Philippe 2. Liver 10 p. 511.
Although they had some ill opinions, yet they did not so much stir up the
hatred of the Pope and great Princes against them, as their freedom in speech
which they used in blaming and reproving the vices, dissolute manners, life,
and actions, of Princes, Ecclesiastical persons, and the Pope himself: this
was the chief thing which drew the hatred of all upon them, this caused many
wicked opinions to be devised, and fathered on them, from which they were very
free and guiltless.

PAP.
You say diverse opinions were fained of them, what then were their own Tenets?

PROT.
What they taught in particular may be gathered by that which the Hussites in
Bohemia, their ^chollers held, for as A^neas Sylvius, afterward Pope
records, the Hussites embraced the opinions of the Waldenses: now their
opinions are thus, set down by An^as Sylvius Romanum Praesulem r^liquis (...)

They held, other Bishops to be equal with the Bishop of Rome.

That prayers for the dead and Purgatory, were devised by the Priests, for
their own gain.

That the Images of God and Saints, were to be defaced.

That Confirmation and extreme unction were no Sacraments.

That it is in vain to pray to the Saints in heaven, since they cannot help
us.

That Auricular confession was a trifling thing.

That it was not meritorious to keep the set fasts of the Church, and that
such a set number of Canonical hours in praying were vain.

That Oil and Chrisme was not to be used in Baptism.

These with diverse other were the Tenets of the Waldenses.

PAP.
Suppose the Waldenses had fully agreed with you in matter of Religion^ yet
Waldo was a Layman Bret^lye^ Apol. tract. 2. chap. 2. sect. 3.
, and so wanted calling, and could not confere it on others.

PROT.
Why might not a Layman by private exhortation, Ruffinus Ecc^es. Hist l. 1.
^^p. 9.
persuade others to the Christian faith? We find in the Church-story, that a
Tyrian Philosopher arriving in India, was slain by the Barbarians with all his
company, except two children which were gone out of the ship, and were learning
their lessons under a tree; these children were brought up by the King, and
advanced by him, the one to be his Steward, and the other called Frumentius,
became his Secretary. Afterward, the King dying, and leaving his son in in
his nonage, Frumentius a^^isted the Queen in the government of the Kingdom:
whiles Frumentius was in authority, he enquired among the Roman Merchants for
Christians, he showed the Christians all favor, and procured them assemblies
for prayer, and the service of God. When the King came to age, they delivered
him the Kingdom, and Frumentius went to Alexandria to Athanasius, and told him
what was done, desiring him to send some worthy Bishop to those multitudes of
Christians: Athanasius thinking Frumentius a fit person, ordained him Bishop,
and sent him into India, to convert more souls. Hereby we see, that this
Lay-secretary was the first means of converting the Barbarians: and why might
not Waldus of France, do the like?

Besides, though Waldus himself were a Layman, yet the Waldenses might have
Bishops, and Pastors. Matthew Paris says Albingenses constituerunt sibi
Antipapam in finibus Bulgar. Cro^tiae and Dalmati^e, nomine Bartholomaeum; in
quibus partibus error i^^e ^deo inval^it, ut etiam Episcopos, and alios multos
regionum illarum ad suam adduxerint pravitatem.

-- ipse creat Episc^p^s, and Ecclesias perfide ordi^are co^tendi^. Math. Paris
Histor. ad ^n. 1223.


, the Albingenses were so powerful in the parts of Bulgaria, Croatia, and
Dalmatia, that they also drew Bishops, besides many others of those regions, to
their parties; yea the Popes Legate that was sent in commission against the
Albigenses, complains that they had a Bishop of their own, called Bartholmew,
who cons^crated Churches, and ordained Bishops and Ministers.

What then? God has chosen the foolish and weak things of the World, to
confound the wise, 1 Cor. 1.27. And we read in the Church history of a
Philosopher, that could not be overcome by any Arguments, but troubled the
council of Nice, and yet was converted by a simple Bishop. Ruffin. eccles.
Hist. li. 1. cap. 3.

Again, it is untrue that Waldus was utterly unlearned: for Reiner the
Inquisitour says C^^ esset aliquantulum literatus, Novi Testam^nti text^
docuit ^os vulga^iter. Re^er. c. Haeret. cap. 5.
; that Waldus being tollerably learned, taught those that resorted to him, the

that they had above forty schools, and diverse Churches; all within one
diocese; so that they had the ordinary means of knowledge. Yea they were of
that ability that they had diverse conferences and disputations with the
Romists, and one famous one at Mount-royall in France, where they encountered
Saint Dominick and others, and maintained these positions; Iac. Vs^er. de

that the Church of Rome was not the holy Church, nor spouse of Christ, but
Babylon the mother of abomination: that the Mass was not ordained by Christ
nor his Apostles, but was an Invention of men. This disputation held for diverse
days, and the Waldenses had the better, had not Saint Dominicks sword proved
sharper than his sillogisme, cutting off more men than arguments; for now (as
Platina says) Non ^^im disceptationi^us verborum tantum, verum etiam ar^^is

the matter was not carried by force of argument, but by force of arms,

PAP.
Though you show us the Waldensians agreement with you, their calling,
succession and ordination; yet you are never a whit the nearer, because their
number might be few, and them few scattered and dispersed, so that they had
not any visible congregations.

PROT.
Concerning the Waldenses, and the visibility of their assemblies, both in
France and elsewhere, the matter is clear, even by your own witness.

Rainerius says, (as is already alleged) that of all Sects which either are
or have been, none has been mo^^ pernicious to the Church (he means the
Church of Rome) than that of the Leonists. First, for the long continuance
thereof; for some say it has continued from the time of Silvester, (who was
Bishop of Rome about the year of Christ three hundred and sixteen) others
say, from the time of the Apostles. Secondly, for the generality, for there is
almost no Country into which this Sect has not entered: the French historian
says Car les Francois, Espagnols, Anglois, Escossois, Italiens, Alemans,
Boemiens, Saxons, Polonois, Lithuaniens, and autres peuples l'ont opinastrement
defender iusques ^icy. L'histoire de France, Liver 1. p. 7. b. de l' imprimerie
pac Abraham H. 1581.
, that the Waldenses about the year 1100, and in the succeeding times, spread
abroad their doctrine, little differing from that which at this day the
Protestants embrace, not only through all France, but almost through all the
Countries of Europe also. For the French, Spanish, English, Scots, Italians,
Germans, Bohemians, Saxons, Polonians, and Lituanians, and other Nations have
obstinately defended it to this day. Matthew Paris the Monk of Saint Albans
has already told us that they were grown so powerful in Bulgaria, Croatia,
and Dalmatia, that among many others they drew some Bishops to their party.

And there were such multitudes of them apprehended in France, that History of
the Waldenses book 2. chap. 2.
the Archbishops of Aix, Arles, and Narbonne assembled at Avignion (anno Dom.
1228) about the difficulties of the executions of those which the Dominican
Friars had accused, said plainly: there were so many apprehended, that it was
not possible to defray the charge of their feeding, nor to find enough lime
and stone to build prisons for them: when they came to wage war with their
enemies, they were so powerful, that they brought an hundred thousand fighting
men into the field Carciter cen^um milli^ a^ma^or^^ in (...) adversus S^mo^^in

; and were then very likely to have utterly overthrown Simon Montfort,
General of the Papal army, had not the unexpected death of the King of
Arragon (intercepted by ambush) quite discouraged and dissolved the Albigenses
army.

Besides, if the Waldenses had not had any visible assemblies, what needed such
councels and consultations, conferences and disputations, inquisitions and
examinations, bans and excommunications against them? They set up the order of
Dominican and Franciscan Friars to preach against them; they leavied forces of
Pilgrims Cruciferi or crossed soldiers, to fight against them; they published
their Croysadoes, promised their pardon of sins, and remission of penance
enjoined, to as many as would take up the badge of the cross, and wear it on
their coate-armour, and go against the Waldenses, as against Sarracens and
Infidels. Now sure had the Waldenses been but some few, dispersed and mean
persons, they needed no such stir to suppress them. But we find, that they
used all possible means for to quell them; (...) Lact^^^. 3. uni^ers^^e co^tra

, that when the Waldenses came into England, (under the name of Catharist's or
Publicans) there was strict charge given, under pain of excommunication, that
none should receive, harbor, or keep them within their houses, liberties, or
territories: nor to have any commerce or manner of dealing with them; and if
any of that sect dyed in that state, that upon no terms, they should have any
prayer or Christian burial; but they saved them a labor of burial: for
Caesarius says Ex quibus quadringenti combus^^ sunt in igne; cateri patibulis
appensi. Caesarius Hist. lib 5. cap. 21.
that at the taking of La-vail there were four hundred of them burnt, and the
rest hanged; and the like execution done in diverse other places; and namely at
Vaurcastle, where after they had strangled the Governor Aimerius, they stoned
to death the Lady Girard, the Popes Legates not sparing (as Thuanus Nec
mulieribus abstinuere Pontificij Legati. Thuan. ad An. 1550. lib. 6. page 515.
says) any Sex at all. Now all this they patiently endured, so that as
Altissidore says Qui omnes s^ mutu^ ^ohor^antes, ro^um accensum u^tronei sub
e^unt. Altissiodorens. page 106. a. obst^puerunt videntes. ibid.
, the beholders were astonished, to see them go so cherefully to their death,
and withal to exhort one another to abide the fiery trial.

PAP.
There might be great numbers of the Waldenses, and them of the meaner sort.

PROT.
That is not so; for Du Haillan says De leur parti estoient le Contes de
Toulouse, de Cominge, de Bigorte, et de Carmain, and Mesm^s l^ Roy d' Arragon.
Bern. de Girard du Haillan. (...) 10
, that many Noble and worthy men took part with them, even to the hazzarding
of their lives and estates, namely; the Earls of Toulouse, of Cominges, of
Bigorre, of Carmain, of Foix, as also the King of Arragon: for Remond had
married Ioane once Queen of Sicilie, sister to John King of England, by whom
he had a son called also Remond; and after the decease of Ioane he married
Elenor, sister of Peter King of Arragon; so that he was strong in affinity, and
confederacy besides, that he had (as one says Gul Armo^ican. Philippidos. Lib.
8. test D. Iac. Vsserio de Eccles. successione and statu. cap. 10. nu. 31.
) as many cities and castles, and towns, as the year has days.

By the way we may observe, that considering the near alliance which was
between the Earl of Toulouse, and his brother in law the King of England: as
also the Earls lands lying so near to Guienne then in the possession of the
English; hence I say we may observe, that this made the way more easy to
communicate the doctrine and profession of the Waldenses unto their neighbou^s
of the English Nation.

PAP.
You tell us of great troops of the Waldenses; and yet they had but bad
success.

PROT.
We must not measure the lawfulness of war by the issue; nor judge the cause
by the event. The eleven Tribes of Israel were appointed by God himself to go
and fight against the Benjamites; the Israelites were more in number than the
Benjamites, and had the better cause; and yet the Israelites were twice
overcome by the Benjamites Iud^^^ 20.
: so King Lewis of France fighting against the Turk, his army was scattered,
and himself dyed of the Plague.

^esides, you have little reason to stand on the success of this war; It is
true indeed that their chief Cittties Toulouse and Avignion were taken, and
the King of Arragon was slain in the Waldensian war; but so also was Simon
Montfort General of the Popes army; he was slain, like Abimelech ( Judges 9)
with a stone cast out of a sling Simon Comes m^ntis sor^is, a^te portam (...)

. And as for King Lewis he dyed at the siege of Avignion, and (as Math^w Paris
says (...) interfectis. and in (...) and (...), plus quam (...). Math. P^^is
(...) ad an. 1226.
) sustained great losses by a terrible plague, strong and venomous flies, and
great waters devouring, and drowning his army; so that there were two and
twenty thousand French slain and drowned during that seige.

Lastly, the Waldenses had no such ill success; for though themselves were
persecuted, yet their doctrine was thereby communicated to others, and spread
abroad throughout the world.

PAP.
You make as if the Pope had dealt ill with the Albingenses; but they dealt ill
with him: for the Earl of Toulouse, or some of his subjects killed the Popes
Legate Friar Peter de Casteaneuff: and this was it that stirred up the Pope.

PROT.
This was but a color of the war, and an untruth: when the Popes Legate
charged the Earl with this fact, his answer was; Hist. of the A^bingens.
book 1. Chap. 3.
that he was no way culpable of the Friars death; that there were many witnesses
of the death of the said Monk, slain at S. Giles, by a certain Gentleman,
whom the said Monk pursued, who presently retired himself to his friends at
Be^caire: that this murder was very displeasing to him, and therefore he had
done what lay in his power to apprehend him, and to chastise him; but that he
escaped his hands; that had it been true which they laid to his charge, and
that he had been guilty of the fact, yet the ordinary courses of justice were
to be taken against him, and not to have wracked their anger upon his subjects,
that were innocent in this case. In the end he was forced to confess that he
was guilty of the murder, only because it was committed within his
territories: so that he was glad to do penance, and that in a strange sort,
for the Legate put a stole about his neck (such as Priests use to wear) and
having his head, feet, and shoulders bare, he led him by the said stole, and
made him go nine times about the grave of the deceased Friar, scourging him
with rods; which the Legate had in his hand, as long as he went about the said
Sepulcher, the Earl to get himself out of the Legates hand, went to Rome, and
was there absolved by the Pope: upon his return, the Legate refused to restore
him, but renewed the excommunication against him Hi^^. of the Albig. book 1.
Cap. 8.
, not as being guilty of the death of the said Monk, but because he had not
driven the Albigenses out of his Country; as he was bound by promise. The Earl
seeing the Legates dealing, strengthens himself with his Allies and
Confederates, and so they fell to open hostility. Lewis the son of Philippus
Augustus, was signed with the cross on his military Cassocke, and strongly
beseiged Avignion one of the Earls chief Cities; swearing Math. Paris ad An.
1226 H^^t. m^^or.
, that he would not depart thence, till he had taken the Town: but he was
glad to go aside to an^ Abbey not far distant, to avoyde the Pestilence,
whereon he shortly after dyed: the Legate the more easily to win the City,
kept secret the Kings death, and despairing to prevail by force, attempted to
do it by fraud. He cunningly persuaded the City to send unto him twelve of
their Citizens to confer upon some good conditions, giving them his oath for
their safe return, protesting and swearing A^^irmans cum ^^ramento, se non ob
(...) obsi^io^em protraxisse, nisi ut sal^tem qu. creret animarum. Id ibid.
, that he prolonged the seige for no other end, but for the good of their
souls: but when the gates were opened to receive them so returning, his army
rushed in, and t^oke the gate, and finally the City, contrary to his oath
given. Thus the City of Avignion, which could not be taken in three months
seige and assault by the power of the King of France, was easily taken by the
fraud and perjury of the Popes Legate.

Matthew Paris, the Monk of Saint Albanes, tells us what others thought of
these proceedings: it seemed unto many a great wrong (says he V^debatur enim
multis abusi^, ut homi^^m fidel^m Christianum in^estarent, c^^ co^staret,
multi^ precibus persu^si^se Legato, ut veniret ad singulas terrae suae
civitates, inquirens a singulis arti^^^et fidei. Id. ibid.
) to trouble a faithful Christian thus, who earnestly entreated the Legate to
examine the faith of his people: and if any City held out against the
Catholic faith, he would make them give satisfaction; and be punished as the
Church should think fit; and for himself he offered, to give an account of
his faith; but (as Matthew Paris says Pro se autem ipso obtulit, si Legatu^
vellet, etiam fidei examen subire. Hae^ omnia Legatus contemp ^it^ nec potuit
Cones Catholicus gratiam inve^ire, nisi pro se and haeredibus suis,
haer^ditat^m su^m deserens, abjurare^. Id. ibid.
) the Legate nothing at all regarded these offers, but sleigted them; nothing
would satisfy him unless the Earl would re^igne and quit claim his lands
and his territories, pro se and haeredibus suis; for himself and his Heirs
for ever; and accordingly they were given to Simon Montfort, for service done
and to be done to the Church.

PAP.
You must show the continuance of your Waldenses, as well as their numbers and
multitude: but that I think you cannot do, for now it seems they were
rooted out.

PROT.
Indeed that was strongly attempted: Saint Dominick spent ten years amongst
the Tholousians; Vincent. Bellona^es. in speculo Historiali. lib. 29. cap. 103.
and 105.
and he, and Didacus a Spanish B. marched against the Land of the Albigenses,
the Friars, Preached, the Inquisitours ploted, the Princes warred against them;
and the Popes they accursed their persons, and interdicted their lands; tolli
tamen non poterant, says Paulus Aemylius Lucius P. utramqui sectam damnaverat,
( Humiliatorum and pauperum a Lugduno) tolli tamen non poterant. Paul. Aemil.
lib. 6. de gest. Franc. p 191.192.
; and yet for all that the Pope could do, they could not be suppressed; and
yet the Pope condemned both the Humiliati, and the poor men of Lions; (for so
they nicknamed them.) John de Serres in his Inventory of the History of
France, Le manuscript de^ miserabiles Albigeo^s ad^ouste, que comme le Pape
vouloit continuer la persecution contre eux -- and s^aprest^it a no^elle
recherche pour en exterm^n^r les r^stes: Lovis ne les voulut su^^ri^, disant
qu^ ille^ falloit persuader par ^araison, and noales contraindre par la force.
Done il avi^t que beaucoup de familles ont es^e conservees ^nces provinces la.
I^han de Serres l'Inventaire in Ludovio. 9. ad An. 1227. tom. 1. p. 505 506.
tells us out of a Manuscript, that as the Pope would have continued his
persecution against them, and that the Marshall de la Foy ( so called for that
he was as it were the chief champion of the immortal war decreed against
the Albingenses) prepared for a new s^arch to root out the remainders: Lewis
would not allow of it, saying: that they must persuade them by reason, and not
constrain them by force, whereby many families were preserved in these
provinces. By this we see some reason given of their preservation and
continuance^ and Thuanus a noble, and unpartiall historian, sometime president
of the Court of Parliament in France, directs us to the place of their aboade,
and habitation.

Though the Waldenses, (says Thuanus Cum huc ^llac ab eo tempor (...) ubi^
exagitarentur, tamen extilere s^mper ^er (...), qui eorum doctrinam (...),
Ioannes Viclevus (...) Boh^mia. I^. (...) page 515.
) were tossed from post to pillar, (as they say) yet there were ever some
found, who in their several courses have revived and renewed their doctrine
buried as it were for a season; and such were John Wickliffe in England, John
Hus in Bohemia, Jerome of Prague, and in our days Martin Luther: so that
reliquiae eorum, the remnant and remainder of their doctrine and profession
began to be kindly entertained and countenanced by many, at Martin Luthers
coming: specially toward the Alps, and the provinces thereunto adjoining.

The same Author says ^
; that after the Waldenses were overcome by force of arms, they retired into
Provence, and toward the Alps; and in those pla^s, they sought out some
shelter for their life, and profession of doctrine: some of them went into
Calabria, where they continewed a long time, even unto the days of Pope Pius
the fourth, (anno 1560) some of them went into Germany, and Bohemia, and there
set up their rest: others of them came Westward into Britain and there took
Sanctuary and harbor: and ^here I leave them, and come to Saint Bernard.

In this age ^lourished that devout Father Saint Bernard, who in diverse maine
points of Religion held with us. He believed Justification by faith alone,
saying ^
. Let him believe in thee who justifiest the ungodly, and ^ei^g justified ^y
faith only, he shall have pe^ce with God.

He disclaimed Justification by works; for he accounted no better of men's best
actions, as they proceed from man, than of a menstruous cloth ^
, according to that of the Prophet, All our righteousness is as filthy clouts.

Indeed he held good works to be the means by, but not the causes why; to be
the Kings High^way to eternal life ^i pr^prie app^li^^tur (...), qu^e dicim^s
nostra, spei quidem s^minaria su^t -- via r^gni, non caus^ regnandi. Id. de
great and lib. arb.
, but not to be any proper cause of salvation. Now the high way is not the
cause, that makes a man come to his journeyes end; the way is but the means,
the motion is the cause.

He left his own Inherent, and laid hold on Christ's righteousness imputed to
us, saying: Nunquid justitias meas cantabo? Domine, memora^or ^ustitiae tuae
solius. Ipsa est enim and mea -- no^ est pallium breve quod non possit ope^i^e
duos; -- and te pariter, and me operiet largit^r larga and ae erna justitia.
Bern. sup Cant. Sermon. 61.
What, shall I sing of mine own righteousness? No Lord, I will remember thy
righteousness alone; for that is mine too; thou art made unto me of God,
righteousness; should I fear that it will not serve us both? It is not a
short Cloak, such as cannot cover two; thy large and everlasting mercy, shall
fully cover both thee and me: in me it covers a multitude of sins; in thee
Lord, what can it cover, but the treasures of piety, and riches of bounty?

Concerning free will Saint Bernard reports, Loqu^nte me ^oram aliquando, and
Dei in me gratiam commend ^^t^, quod scilicet. ab ipsa me in bono and praventum
^gnoscerem, and provehi sentirem, and sperarem per^iciendum. Quid tu ergo, ait
unus ex circumstantibus opera^is? aut quid m^rcedis speras, si totum facit
Deus. Bern. de great. and lib. arb. in (...).
that whiles he commended Gods free grace which prevented, promoted, and (as he
hoped) would perfect the good work begun in him, some that stood by r^plyed,
what is it then that you do? what reward can you look for, if God do all?
and these and such like Pelagian speeches of some Monks, occasioned him to
write his treatise of Grace and free will, wherein he (denying such freewill as
many Popish schoolmen teach) ascribes the whole original power of good, in
the consent of the will unto grace, saying; Non partim gratia, partim liberum
a^bitrium -- sed ut totum in illo, sic totum ex illa. Id de great and lib. arb.
That the good which we do, is not partly Gods; but it is to be ascribed
wholly unto God.

He disclaimed humane satisfactions, saying; Cum ^ec millesim^e, imo nec
minimae par^i, debitorum suorum valeat respondere. Id sermon, de quadruplici
debito.
Who will murmr and say, we labor too much, fast too much; since we are
unable to d^scharge the thousandth, nay not the least part of our debts?

He held that man was unable to keep the Law (in perfection according to Gods
Commandments) Neither (says he Nec latuit praeceptorem praecepti pondus,
^ominum excedere vi^es; sed judicavit utile ex hoc ips^ sua illos
insufficientiae admoneri -- ergo mandando impossibilia, non pr^v^ricatores
homines ^ecit, sed humiles, ut omne o^ obsti^atur -- accipientes quippe
mandatum, and sentientes defectum, clamamus in coelum, and miserebitur nostri
Deus. Bern. sup. Cant. ser. 50.
) was the commander ignorant, that the weight of the Commandment exceeded man's
strength, but he judged it to be profitable, thereby to put them in mind of
their own insufficiency: so that God by commanding things impossible (to us)
did not thereby make man a transgressour, but humbled him, to the intent, that
we receiving the Law, and feeling our own wants, might call to heaven, and the
Lord might help us.

And to the same purpose he elsewhere says; Propterea mandata sua ma^d^vit
custod^re nimi^, ut vi^entes imp^r^ectionem nost^^m def^^ere, and non posse
(...) quo^ de^et, ^ugi^mus ad (...). Ber. sermon. 2 vigil nativ. ^om.
God has therefore commanded his precepts to be observed exceedingly, or to
the full, that we beholding our imperfection, and falling short, and finding
that we are unable to fulfill that which we ought, may fly to his mercy.

He held certainety of Salvation, saying; H^c est te (...) quod (...) in cord
nostro Spirit (...) sanctus, dicens, Dim^s^a sunt tib^ peccata (...). Id. S^rm.
1. in. ^^nunciat.
that a just, man by the testimony of the Holy Spirit within him, may be
assured of grace.

Bernard likewise held, that our works do not merit ( condignely,) and herein
he is most direct and punctual against all Popish merit-mongers. Dangerous
(says he) (...) P^alm. Q^i (...) 1
is the dwelling of them that trust in their own merits; dangerous, b^caus^
ruinous. And, Hoc to^um (...) m^ritum, (...) spem suam (...) eo qui totum
^ominem (...). ibi^ sermon. 15.
This is the whole merit of man, if he put all his trust in him who saves the
whole man. Again, the merits of men are not such (says he) as that eternal
life is due to them of right; (...) hominum merita ut (...) ex ^ure; aut (...)
sermon. 1.
or as if ^od should do wrong, if he did not yield the same unto them; and he
gives a reason hereof: because all merits are Gods gifts, and so man is rather
a debtor to God for them, than God to men; for what are all merits to so ^reat
a glory? Indeed he elsewhere tells us of his merits, but they be Christ's; and
these we do willingly embrace with Saint Bernard and apply them to our selves;
his words are these.

Therefore my merit is the mercy of the Lord M^um provide meritum, mis^ratio
Domini. Non (...) sum (...) sum. Id. in Cant. (...) 61.
. I am not poor in merit, so long as he is not poor in mercy; and if the
mercies of the Lord be many, my merits also are many otherwise, S. Bernard
renounced al confidence of his own merit, reposing his soul on that
imputative Justice, (which is without man) even the merit of Christ, as in that
all-sufficient satisfaction, saying ^ateor non sum dignus ego: nec proprijs
possum meritis (...) obtiner^ c^lorum, (...) duplici jure illud obtine^^
Domin^s meus, hareditate scilicet Patris, and m^rito passin^is; alt^ro ipse
contentur, alterum mi^i donat. Bernardus moriens. ut est in ejus vita. lib. 1.
cap. 12.
; I am not worthy I confess, neither can I by my own merits, obtain the
kingdom of heaven, but rest upon that interest, which I have in the merits of
Christ's passion. Now what could be spoken more Protestant-like? and yet thus
spoke Bernard of himself. And in this sweet meditation the devout Father
closed his life, as the reporter thereof has left recorded.

Now besides these Articles already mentioned (which are weighty ones) Bernard
was no universal T^ent Papist: neither held he diverse points which your Trent
Counsel has established for foundamentall; and namely, the doctrine of
Transubstantiation of which he is altogether silent, even there where he was
likeliest to treat of it, if he had then known it for Catholic doctrine: yea
he there delivers that which makes against it ^a^em ^aro nobis, (...) (...).
etc.

Q^id est m^ndu^a^^ ejus (...), and ^ib re sanguin^m nisi (...) p^^sionibus
(...). Id Psalm Qui habitat. s^r. 3.


.

He taught also that the Eucharist was a commemorative sacrifice only: Ser. in
coena Dom.
insomuch as alleging those words, Do this in remembrance of me: he
men^ioneth no real sacrifice of ^hrists body and blood, such as is made in the
Mass, but a thankful remembrance of his death and passion Vt illa p^^e (...)
victima viver^t in memo^i^ ut praet^^ite mo^tis hab^atur memoria. Se^m i^ C^na

.

Indeed S. B^rnard in that Sermon of the Lords Supper Long di^^at a stylo
Bernardi. B^llar. de scriptor. Eccl^s se^ul 12.
, if it be his, (for Bellarmie says, it is nothing like S. Bernards s^ile)
speaks (...) suum t^ne^e, and alijs dando p^r^ige^e. S^r. in ^^^na Dom. Deum
suum manu and ore (...), and colloquentem sinijp^is and turi. Id ibid.
of the Priests holding his God and reaching him forth to others; as also of
touching God with their hand, with their mouth, and hearing him speak unto
them. Now as the Priest hears Christ speak unto him, so he holds Christ in
his hand; but the Priest hears not Christ speak verily and indeed, but in a
certain peculiar manner, and form of speech, therefore he holds not Christ in
his hand really and indeed, but after a sort: for a strain of Rhetorical
amamplification, he is said to hold God, that holds any thing specially
pertaining to God.

Besides, he held the sufficiency of the Scriptures without Traditions; for
writing unto a Covent of Abbots, he requires Illo praesertim Con ilio, in quo
no^ hominum trad^tiones obstinat^^s desensantur, sed diligenter inqu^ri^ur quae
sit voluntas Dei bona and beneplac^n^ and per^ecta. Bern. Ep. 91.
such a Council, wherein the traditions of men are not obstinately defended,
but which does diligently and humbly enquire what is the good and perfect will
of God: and elsewhere he says, Verbum Dei omnia in omnibus. Id. de ^tilit^te
Verbi Dei Et sup. Ca^t. ser. 86.
that the Word of God is all in all.

He held habitual Concupiscence to be a sin, saying; G^nus illud peccati
quod toties conturbat no^, (concupiscent^as loquor and desideria ma^a) ^eprimi
quidem deb^t. de A^ventu. sermon. 6
That kind of sin which so often troubles us (I mean our concupiscence and
evil desires) ought indeed to be repressed.

Besides, he never taught adoration of Images, he held not the precise number
of seven Sacraments; Serm^ de sacro A^tari, and ablut. pedum; and sermon. alio
de coena Dom.
he stood against the opinion of the immaculate conception of the blessed
Virgin Marie Epist. 174.
, and the like Tenets which be Articles of Faith with you.

In a word, he plainly confessed, Religionis antiquae non sotum ^^^tutem
amisimus, sed nec spe^i^m r^tin^mus. Apo^ogia ad Guli^lin. Abba^.
that the Roman Church was degenerate from the ancient religion.

And this may suffice to show what religion S. Bernard professed: if any man
desire to see more testimonies, he may find them in Master Pankes Collectanea,
out of Saint Gregory the Great, and S. Bernard the devout, showing that in
most foundamentall points they are ours.

PAP.
Well, but I challenge Saint Bernard for one of our side.

PROT.
I have shown already, that he was ours on the surer side: he was indeed a
Monk, and in some things superstitious; and no mervaile, since he lived in a
later age, above a thousand years after Christ, what time as errors crept
into the Church, which he might suck in from the age wherein he lived;
nevertheless, he was sound in the principal points of Religion: for other
things we defend him not; since as your own Proverb goes, Bernardus non
vidit omnia, even holy Bernard had his blemishes.

Yet since he held the foundation of Justification by Faith only in Christ,
and disclaimed his own merits: though otherwise his hay and stubble 1. Corinthians. 3, 11.
of praying to Saints, and such like stuff, as cannot endure the fire of the
Holy Ghosts trial, do burn and consume; yet since he kept close to the
foundation, we doubt not but his soul is safe, and rests with the Lord, God
pardoning his errors, and ignorances, which, he being carried with the stream
of the time, took up, as they were delivered to him, without scanning or
examining them.

The like may be said of Bid, Gregory, and others, that holding Christ the
foundation a right, and groaning under the weight of men's Traditions, humane
satisfactions, and the like popish trash; they by unfeigned repentance for their
errors and lapses known, and unknown, and by an assured faith in their
Savior, did find favor with the Lord: these and the like, we hold to be Gods
servants, and propter meliorem and saniorem partem, by reason of their better
and sounder part, to be with us, lively members of the true Church, though in
some things they were mistaken; and that they may be termed professors of our
faith, inasmuch as the denomination is to be taken from the better part, and
not always from the greater: For example sake, there is much water, and little
wine mixed in a glass, yet it is called a glass of wine; so say we of
professors, S. Bernard and such like, there is in them some bad parts, some
superstition, and Popery; and some good, in that they hold Christ Jesus the
foundation aright; in this case they may in respect of their better part, be
termed and denominated true professors; and therefore you must give us again
Saint Bernard with others, to who^ you have no right or claim, unless it be
to their errors which they sucked in from the corrupt breasts of some of your
side: and so I proceed to the several points in question.

Of the Scriptures Sufficiency and Canon.
Saint Bernard (as we heard) approves Bernard^ Epist. 91:
such a Council, wherein the Traditions of men are not obstinately defended,
but the revealed will of God enquired after: for that, I^em de utilitate verbi
and super C^nt. sermon. 86.
this is all in all. Claudius Seyssel Archbishop of Turin in Piedmont, (one
that was Neighbor to the Waldenses, and labored to inform himself touching
their positions, and also to confute them) says (...) tan^um quae vel in
vete^^ vel in novo Testam^nto sunt ^ons^r^ta, u^i ad literam j^cent, abs^ ^lla
s^na interpretatione ad^^ttuat. Claud. Scys^^l. adv. seclam Walden. page 4.
, that they admitted only the text of the old and new Testaments: so that they
denied unwritten traditions to be the Rule of Faith.

Petrus Cluniacensis, after he had reckoned up the canonical books, says
Res^ant pos^ hos authentic^s sanctae Scripturae libros, se^ non (...) lib^i.
Pet. Clu^^ac. de aut^orit. v^t. Te^^am. Epist. c. P^tro Brusian.
; There are besides the authentical books, six other not to be rejected, as
namely, Judith, Tobias, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, and the two books of
Macchabees, which though they attain not to the high dignity of the former,
yet they are received of the Church, as containing necessary and profitable
doctrine. Hugo de Sancto victore says Suat praeterea alij quidem libri ut
Sapientia Salomonis. libe^ Ie^u filij Syrach and Tob. and libri Machab qui
leguntur ^uidem. sed non scri^^^tur in Cano^^. H^go de S. Vi^^. praen^tat.
Elucidat. de s^^ip. and Sc^iptor. Sacris, ^ap. 6. and cap. 7.
; All the Canonical books of the old Testament are twenty two: there are
other books also (as namely) the Wisdom of Solomon, the book of Jesus the
son of Syrach; the books of Judith, Tobias, and the Machabees; which are
read but not written in the Canon.

The Bible was translated into English some hundred years (as it is probably
conjectured) before Wickliffs translation came forth; a coppie of which
ancient translation my self have seen in our Queens College Library in
Oxford; in the praeface whereof it may be seen, that the translatour held the
controverted books for Apocrypha; for thus he says: what ever book of the
Old Testament is out of these (he makes the same ^anon with us) twenty five
before said, shall be set among Apocrypha: that is, without authority of
belief. Therefore the book of Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Judith and Tobie, be
not of belief. Hierome says all this sentence in the prologue on the first
book of Kings; now if at that time the above said books had been accounted
Authentical by the Church, and of belief, he would have said; but this
opinion of Hieromes is not approved by the Church, as Doctor James has well
observed Dr. James of the Fathers corruption. Part. 2. p. 74.
.

Of Communion under both kinds, and number of Sacraments.
HVgo de Sancto victore gives a reason of the entire communicating in both
kinds: Therefore (says he) Ideo duabus speciebus sumit^r, ut significetur
hujus Sacramenti duplex effectus; valet enim ad tuition^^ corporis and (...).
Hugo de S. Vict tom. 5. cap. 6.
the Sacrament is taken in both kinds, that thereby a double effect might be
signified: For it has force, as S. Ambrose says, to preserve both body and
soul.

Gratian rehearses Gratian. de Consecrat. did. 2.
many ancient Canons and constitutions for communicating in both kinds. Saint
Bernard, in his third Sermon on Palm Sunday, makes the Sacrament of Christ's
body and blood the Christians food.

Touching the Sacrament of Christ's body and blood, (says he De sacrame^to
corporis and sanguinis sui ne^o est qui nes^iat ^anc quoque tan^am and tam
singularem al^moniam ^^ pri^um die ex^ibitam, ea die commendatam and mandatam
deinc^ps ^requentari. Bern. s^rm. 3. in ramis Palmarum.
) there is no man who knows not that this so singular a food was on that day
first exhibited, on that day commended, and commanded to be frequently
received. Saint Bernards words have reference to the Institution of Christ: now
at our Saviors last Supper there was Wine as well as Bread, and Bernard
treating thereof says it was commanded to be frequently received; now if the
whole Church were enjoined so to do, then also is every particular believer
who is of age, and fitted thereunto, enjoined to receive it accordingly.

The precise number of seven Sacraments was not held for catholic doctrine,
no not in the Church of Rome, until more than a thousand years after Christ;
this is ingenuously confessed by Cassander. Until the days of Peter Lombard
(who lived about the year 1145) you shall scarce find any author (says
their Cassander Nec temere quemquam reperias ante Petrum Lombardum, qui certum
a^iquem and de^initum Sacramentorum numcrum statuerant: and de his septem non
omn^s quidem Scholastici aeque proprie Sacramenta vocabant. Cassand. Consult.
art. 13.
) who set down any certain and definite number of Sacraments; neither did all
the schoolmen call all those s^ven, proper Sacraments: but this is without all
controversy (says the same Cassander In hoc c^rte controversia nulla est, duo
esse praecip^a s^lutis nostrae Sacramenta, quomodo l^quuntur Robertus
Tuitiensis, and Hugo d^ S. v^ctore, part. octavd c. 2. de Sacramentis.
Cassander ibid.
) that there are two chief Sacraments of our Salvation: that is to say;
Baptism and the Lords Supper, and so speak Rupertus, and Hugo de Sancto
victore, and he says true; for Rupertus Quae ergo and q^^^ sunt pr^cip^a
nostrae salutis Sacramenta? Sacr^ Bapti^ma, sancta corporis ejus and sanguinis
^ucharistia. Rupert^ de victoria Verbi. ^. 12. c. 11. Notimbergae. 1525.
puts the question, and asks Which be the chief sacraments of our
salvation? and he answers, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord.

Of the Eucharist.
IN this age ^ratian the Monk affoordeth us a notable testimony against
transubsta^tiatio^; his comparison is thus drawn; This holy bread is after its
manner called the body of Christ, as the offering thereof by the hands of the
Priest is called Christ's passion; now the Priests oblation is not properly and
literally in strict terms and sense, the passion of Christ; but as the Gloss
has it, the Sacrament representing the body of Christ, is therefore called
Christ's flesh, not in verity of the thing, but in a mystery (namely) as the
representation of Christ therein is called his Passion.

Gratians words are these Sicut ergo coelestis paxis, qui Chri^ti (...) est,
suo modo vocatu^ corpus C^rist^, cum revera sit (...) ^orporis C^ri^^i -- (...)
^arnis quae (...) 3. D^ Cons^^rat. Did. 2.
. As the heavenly bread, which is Christ's flesh, after a sort is called
Christ's body, whereas indeed it is the Sacrament of his body; and the
sacrificing of the flesh of Christ, which is done by the Priest's hands, is
said to be his passion, not in the truth of the thing, but in a signifying
mystery.

I^annes Semeca who was the first that glossed upon Gratians decrees, tells
us how this comparison is to be meant. This Sacrament (says the Gloss (...)
sa^ramentum, qu^d (...) Christi (...) s^d (...) corpus Coristi, (...)
signi^i^atu^. Gloss. D^^r^t. de Cons^^rat. Did. 2 verbo, C^^lestis.
) because it does represent the flesh of Christ, is called the Body of Christ,
but improperly, not in the truth of the thing, but in the mystical sense, to
wit, it is called the Body of christ, that is, it signifies his Body.

From these premises we infer, that after consecration, the Sacrament is not
in truth Christ's Body, but only in a signifying mystery^ rei veritas, the
truth of the thing, as it is opposed to significans mysterium, a signifying
mystery, simply excludes the reality of the thing; for it is all one, as if he
had said, that it is there only in a signifying mystery; as also in saying it
is there suo modo, after a sort only, he implies, that it is not there
truly, or in the truth of the thing, visibly or invisibly. So that these words
of Gratian, drawn from Saint Austin, and Prosper, seconded by the Gloss, and
inserted into the body of the Cannon law, confirmed by Pope Gregory the
thirteenth, make strongly against the real presence of Christ's body, under
the Accidents of Bread and Wine, as my learned friend Master Doctor Featly made
it appear in his first days Conference with Master Musket, touching
Transubstantiation Dr. Featlyes conference with Mr. Musket. April^ 21. 1621.
.

Besides, there were diverse in this age, who employed both their tongues and
their pens in defense of this truth.

Zacharias Chrysopolitanus says Sunt nonnulli, imo forsan mul^i, sed vix
notari possun^ qui cum damnato Berengario i^em senti^^t, and tamen ^undem cum
Ecclesia damnant -- Illud quoque maxim derident, quod panis and vini species
quidam dicunt in a^re apparere, quidam ver^ s^nsus corporeos falli, post
conversionem panis and vini i^ carnem and sanguin^m Christi Zachar. Episc.
Chrysopol. Comment. in Evangel. Montessar. l. 4. c. 156.
; that there were some, perhaps many, but hardly to be discerned and noted,
that thought still, as Berengarius did, whom they then condemned, scorning not
a little the ^olly of them that say, the appearing accidents of Bread and Wine
after the conversion, do hang in the air, or that the senses are deceived.

Rupertus says Hoc loco silendum non est, male quosdam ignotos, sed absconditi
nominis homines opi^ari, suis quo^que de^endere dictis and scriptis^ panem
verum and potum, quem in sancto Altari sum^^^^^ nihilomin^s Patr^s ill^s
manducasse ^un^ tempo^is and ^i^isse -- huic erro^i pro maximo ^rgumento
ad^ib^nt authoritatem Apostoli 1 C^r. 10 3.4. -- Igitur eadem que ^^ctenus in
Ec^l^sia tole^atur discord^ntium and con^rad^^enta^^ permixtio. Rup^rt. lib. 6.
in commentar. in Io^an. cap. 6. -- and in lib^ 7.
; It is not to be concealed, that there are diverse, though hardly to be
discerned, and noted, which are of opinion, and defend the same both by word
and writing: that the Fathers under the Law did eat and drink the very Bread
and Wine, which we receive in the Sacrament of the Altar. And he says they
grounded their opinion upon that of the Apostle 1 Cor. 10.3.4. They did all
eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink of the same spiritual
drink (for they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock
was Christ.) and the same Rupert adds, that the Church tolerated this
diversity of opinion touching the sacrament of the Eucharist, for so he says
in his seventh book; whence we may observe that for so much as the Fathers
under the Law did eat of the same Christ in Manna that we do in the Sacrament
of the Supper, and yet did not, nor could not eat him carnally, who was not
then borne, nor had flesh: we also in our Sacrament can have no such fleshly

Of Images and Prayer to Saint.

Angelus one of the Eastern Emperors, that when Frederick Emperor of the
West made an expedition into Palestina, the Armenians did gladly receive the
Almaines (...). Nicet. Ch^^^at. Anal^ l. 2.

forbidden alike.

on earth do, and withal he adds, how that the Prophet in the person of the
afflicted Israelites says; Abraham our father is ignorant of us, and Israel
knows us not, Esaias 63, 16. and h^rein Gratian followed Saint Austine
Augustine. de cura pro mortuis. cap 13.
who makes the same inference upon that place of Scripture.

Gratians resolution, in this point is farther laid down by the Gloss in
those terms Fa^it Gra^ianus quindam (...) and re^pondet quod non; and ^oc

. Gratian mooveth a certain incident question; whether the dead know the
things that are done in this world by the living? and he answers that they
do not; and this he proves by the authority of Esaias (viz. Esaias 63.16.) the

; It is not incredible, that the souls of the Saints, that delight in the
secrets of Gods countenance, in beholding the same, see things that are done in
the world below. Inveni^ntur tamen quidam S. Patrum dixisse, quasi ni^il sit in

victore de Sacram. Fidei lib. 2. c^p. 11. tom. 3.
Hugo de Sancto victore leaves it doubtful whether the Saints do hear our
prayers or not, and rejects that saying of Gregory, brought to prove that
they do, qui videt videntem omnia, videt omnia; he that sees him who sees
all things, sees all things: he confesses ingenuously saying, I presume not
to determine this matter ^arther than thus, that they see so much as it pleases
him whom they see, and in whom they see what soever they see: and he says, it
is a hard task to decide these points; and withal thus debateth the matter.

Yea Sed non audiunt, inquis, and ego in ventum ve^ba in^undo, non audientibus

, but thou will reply: If they hear me not, I do but waste words in v^ine, in
making intercession unto them, that do neither hear ^nor understand. Be it
so, Saints hear not the words of those that call unto them: well; nor is it
pertinent to their blessed estate, to be made acquainted with what is done on
earth, admit that they do not hear at all: does not God therefore hear? If
he hear thee, why art thou sollicitous then what they hear, and how much they
hear, seeing it is most certain that God hears unto whom thou prayest? he
sees thy humility, and will reward thy piety and devotion: so that in effect,
Hugo makes it not any material thing or of necessity to pray unto Saints.

Rupertus, upon those Words of our Savior, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father
in my Name, he will give it yo^; John 16.22. says, Qu^^ videlicet praeter hunc

Rupertus lib. 12. in Joan. cap. 16. tom. 2.
that it is the wholesome custom, and Rule of the Catholic Church, to direct
her prayers to God the Father through Jesus Christ our Lord, because there is
no other way nor passage but by him; and again, we need no other chariot save
only the name of Jesus to carry and convey our prayers into heaven.

Of Faith and Merit.

SAint Bernard believed Justification by Faith alone, saying; Let him believe
in thee who justifiest the ungodly; and being justified by Faith only, he
shall have peace with God. Rupertus says (...) in c^^t^ntione (...) Iud^us and
qu^ sola (...) fide Jesus Ch^isti cont^mpt^, num^ros^^ (...) arrogat ex
op^rib^s. R^pert. li^. 2. in li^ Rep. ca^. 29. to. 1.
, that the obstinate Jew sleights the Faith of Jesus Christ, which alone is
able to justify him, and seeks to be saved by his own works.

Rupertus says, Ad quam [salutem] nos g^^tis, ul e^t, nullis nostris
prae^^dentiom meritis per praedica^ores suos ipse vocavi^, and gr^tuad
peccatorum re^^^sione justis^cavit. Id. lib. 1. in ^ 1. Joan.
that God has freely called us by the ministry of his Word, unto the state of
Salvation, and justified us by the gracious pardon of our sins, not upon any
precedent merits of ours.

Saint Bernard likewise held (as we have shown) that our works do not merit
(condignely:) and herein he is most direct and punctual.

The merits of men are not such ( says he Neque ^alia sunt hominum (...), ut
propter ^a vita aete^na debeatur ex jure; aut D^us t^juriam faceret, nisi ^am
donaret -- me^ita omni^ dona Dei sunt, and ita ho^o magis propter ipsa D^o
debtor, q^im est Deus homini^^ quid sunt omnia merit^ ad (...) glo^iam? Ber.
i^ Annunt sermon. 1.
) as that eternal life is due to them of right: or as if God should do wrong,
if he did not yield the same unto them; and he gives a reason hereof, because
all merits are Gods gifts, and so man is rather a debtor to God for them, than
God to men, for what are all merits to so great a glory?

Bernard indeed elsewhere tells us of his own merit; but it is the Lords
mercy which he calls his merit Meum proin^e meritum, mis^^atia Domini. Non
pla^^ sum me^iti inops, quamd^^ ille mis^rationum non ^uerit. Quod si
misericordie Domini multae, multus ni^^lominus ego in mer^tis sum. Id in

. Therefore my merit is the mercy of the Lord: I am not poor in merit, so long
as he is not poor in mercy; and if the mercies of the Lord be many, my merits
also are many.

THE THIRTEENTH CENTVRIE from the year of Grace one thousand two hundred, to
one thousand three hundred.
PAPIST.
WHat say you of this Age?

PROTESTANT.
In this age Sophistry began to encroach upon Divinity; Aristotle and the
Philo^ophers were as much studied as Saint Paul's Epistles; Gratian and Lombard
were as often mentioned in the Schools, as the holy Scriptures; and hence came
so many Sums, Sentences, Quodlibets, Legends, Rules, Decretals, and Decrees:
for now by the example of Peter Lumbard many devised subtle, and intricate
disputations, calling almost every thing into doubt, after the manner of the
Skeptiques, or Academiques; and leaving the plain and wholesome food of the
holy Scripture, they began to gnaw on the bones of a controversy; doting about
questions, and strife of words, 1 Timoth. 6.4. and yet in this curious and
scholastique age, when men had almost lost themselves in the maze and mist of
distinctions, the Lord raised ^^^^ch plain witnesses, as served to testify
his trut^^ though not in the words which the wis^dome of man teaches, yet in
such as the Holy Ghost teach^th 1 Cor. 2.13.
.

In this age lived William Bishop of Paris, Gulielmus Alt^ssiodorensis: Hugo
Cardinalis, who made the first Concordance upon the Bible. Honorius
Augustodunnensis, who composed the sum of history.

Alexander of Hales an Englishman brought up in Paris; he was styled the
Irrefragable Doctor, and was tutour to Bonaventure, of whom he used to say, In
fratre Bonaventura Adam peccasse non videtur. Tri^hem. de sc^ip Eccles.
that He was of such a godly life and behavior, as Adam might seem not to
have sinned in him.

Now also lived John Duns called Scotus, because he was descended of Scottish
blood; he was from the subtilitie of his wit, styled the Subtle Doctor^ he
was borne at Emildon, in Northumberland, and being brought up in Merton
College in Oxford, as also having heard Alexandri Alensis^ Angl^^ quon^am
Parisijs auditor. ^^ithem. ibid.
Alexander Hales read and profess in the University of Paris, he became
wonderful well learned in Logic, and in that crabbed and intricate divinity
of those d^yes; yet as one still doubtful and unresolved, he did overcast the
truth of religion with mists of obscurity, and with so profound and admirable
subtility, in a da^ke and rude style, he wrote many works, that he deserved
the title of the Subtle Doctor, and after his own name erected a new sect of
the Scotists. That he was bo^ne here in England is vouched out of his own
Manuscript works in the Libra^ie of Merton College in Oxford, which my self
have seen, which concludes in this manner Expli^it lectura Su^^ilis in
Vni^e^si^a^e Parisiens. D^ctoris Ioannis D^^s in quod^m Vi^^ul^ Parochiae, de

explicit Lectura etc. that is, Thus en^eth the Lecture of the subtle Doctor
in the Vn^versity of Paris; John Duns borne in a certain little Village or
hamlet within the Parish of Emildon called Dunston in the County of
Northumberland, pert^ining to the house of the Scholars of Merton Hall in
Oxford.

The famousest of all the schoolmen was Saint Thomas of Aquine, entitled the
Angelique Doctor.

In this age lived Robert Grosted, Doctor of Divinity in Oxford, and Bishop of
Lincoln; he was termed the Maull and Hammer of the Romanists; Romanorum
malleus and contemptor. Math. Paris. in H^nr. 3. ad an. 1253.
he wrote a famous letter to the Pope, extant in Matthew Paris, wherein he
proved the Pope by his abominable soule-murthering actions, to be an heritike
worthy of death, yea to be Antichrist, Si quis animas perdere non formidat,
nonne A^tichristus merito est dicendus ^ Id. ibid.
and to sit in the chair of Pestilence, as next to Lucifer himself. Herewith
the Pope was so incensed, that he swore by Saint Peter and Paul, he could find
in his heart, to make the doting Prelate a mirror of confusion to all the
world for his sauciness: but some of the wiser Cardinals dissuaded him from
such courses, telling him that it was true Vera sunt quae dicit, Catholicus est
nobis religio^ior consilium dederunt, ma^ime propter hoc, quia s^iu^t, quod
quand^que discessio est ventura^ Id. ibid. p. 1162.
which he said, that he was holier than any of themselves^ and therefore it was
best to hush the matter, and not to stir the coals; specially since it was
known, that at length there would be a departure from their Church: he
prophesied Nec literabitur Ecclesia ab Aegyptiac^ servitute, nisi in ore gladij
^ruentandi. Id. ibid.
that the Church would never be set free, from her Agyptian bondage, but by the
edge of the sword, which we have seen in part accomplished.

In this age flourished those two learned men, Histor. Gisburn. Gua^^. Hemings.
apud Illyric in Catal. Test. verit lib. 18.
Gerardus disciple to Sagarel us of Parma, and Dulcinus disciple to one
Novarius Hermannus; these held and preached, that the Pope was Antichrist, and
the Church of Rome Babylon: some thirty of their followers came into England,
and were there persecuted for preaching that and the like doctrine.

It is like that this Dulcinus had many followers, for Coc^l^us says,
Fornicatus est spiritualiter cum alienigenis plarimis, cum Wiclevistis, cum
Dulcinistis. Cochl. Hist Hussit. lib. 2. p. 100.
that John Hus committed spiritual fornication with the Wiclevists, and with
the Dulcinists.

Bergomensis the Chronologer says; Ad sex millia utriusque s^xu^ hominum coll.
gerat Dulcinu^: quinimo ad^uc in Tridentinis montibus aliquae ejus extant
reliquia Iac. Phil. Bergom. in supplem. supplem. l. 13. ad an. 1305.
that there were some six thousand people that fo^lowed Dulcinus; and that in
his time, the remainders of this profession were living about Trent; now he
continued his Chronology unto the year of Grace 1503.

Prateolus says, Ejus reliquia nostra aetate varijs in locis and Germaniae and
Galliae, Sacramentarijs eosdem redintegrantibus, re^igu^runt Prateol. tit.
Dulcinus.
that the remainder of the Dulcinists had in his time revived and renewed their
opinions, in diverse places of France and Germany. Platina says Platina in
Clem. 5.
, they were called Fratricelli, or the Brethren, and that Pope Clement the
fifth sent out an army against them into the Alps, where he famished and
starved diverse of them.

Nicholas Eymericus in his Directory for the Inquisitours says, Totam illam
terram Lombardiae suis error^bus implentes, Geraldus, and Dul^^unt. Nic.
Eymeric. secunda p^^t. Director. Inquisitor. qu^est. 12.
that they filled the whole land of Lombardie with their opinions, which he
calls erroneous. Petrus de vincis, Chancellor to Frederick the Emperor, in
his letters to the Christian Princes, fears not to call the Pope an Apostata,
Bestiam ascendentem de (...), plen^ nominibus Blasphemy, Pardique vari^tatibus
circumscriptam ^du^i potest non Curia, sed Cura: mar^^^d sidera^s plus quam
M^rcum: du^s Sa^monem legens, despi^it Salomonem. Pet. de ^in^is. ^ib. 1.
Epist. ^1
and the Beast rising out of the Sea, full of names of blasphemy, and like
unto a Leopard; and again, the Court of Rome, may be called non curia, sed
cura, marcam desideraus plusquam Marcum, more desirous of a mark (of silver)
than of S. Marks Gospel, or of taking of Salmons, than of reading of Solomon.

About this time lived Arnold de nova villa, a Spanyard, who taught Catalog.
Test. verit. lib 16
, that Satan had then seduced a great part of the world: that the faith then
taught, was but such a faith as the devils might have who believe and tremble,
meaning belike a historical, and not a saving, justifying faith; as also, that
the Pope led men to hell: that, he and his Clergy did falsify the doctrine of
Christ: that masses were not to be said for the dead.

In this age there were great odds between William of Saint Amor a Doctor of
Paris, and the Friars Mendicants, or Iacobins; he accused them for troubling
the peace of the Church, in that they preached in Churches, against the will of
the ordinary Pastors, and heard confessions, sleighting the parish Priests, as
men of weak abilities; and also for that they had made a book, which they
called the everlasting Gospel, whereunto they said Christ's Gospel was not to
be compared: Pope Alexander the fourth was content upon complaint made unto
him, that the Friars book should be burned Prae^^pit Papa, ut li^^r secreto^
and si posset ^ieri, fine Fratrum scandalo, combureretur. Math. Pa^s. Hist. ad
an. 1256.
, provided that it were done covertly and secretly, and so as the Friars should
not be discredited thereby: and as for William of Saint Amor, he dealt
sharply with him, commanding his book to be burnt: as also he suspended
Dignitatibus and be^e^icijs omnibus sunt privati, done^ juraverunt revocare
Patisijs, and malijs ^tvitatibus and locis, quicqui^ co^tra dictorum Frat^um
ordi^es implicit vel e^plicit^ evomulssent. Tho Can^^pratan. lib. 2. exempl.

from their benefices and promotions all such as either by word or writing had
opposed the Friars, until such time as they should revoke and recant all such
speeches and writings at Paris, or other places appointed: so tender was his
holiness over the Friars credit and reputation, knowing (belike) what service
might be done to him and his successors by these newly errected orders of
^riers: I call them newly erected, for in the time of Pope Innocent the third
about the year 1198, the Iacobites (an order of preaching Friars) were
instituted by Saint Dominicke; and about the beginning of this age, the order
of Franciscans (preaching) Friars Minors was instituted by Saint Francis

Of the Scriptures sufficiency, and Canon.
SCo^us says, Et id^o pat^t quod Sacra scriptura su^ficienter contin^t
doctri^am necessariam vi^tori -- quantum ad credenda, speranda, operanda.
Sco^us 1. Sent. prolog. qu est. s^^und.
that supernatural knowledge, as much as is necessary for a wayfaring man, is
sufficiently delivered in sacred S^ripture. Thomas Aquinas in his commentary
upon that place of Saint Paul, the Scriptures are able to make one wise unto
salvation, that the man of God may be perfect, 2 Timoth. 3.15.17. says Non
enim qualitercunque bonum facit, s^^ perficit. Hebr. 6. ad pe^^ectinnem
^eramur. Per^^ctum est (...) nihil deest. Tun^ ^rgo homo est per^^ctus, quando
est instruct^s. Aquin. i^ 2. Tim. 3. in tom. 16.
that the Scriptures do not qualify a man after an ordinary sort, but they
perfect him, so that nothing is wanting, to make him happy. And accordingly
Bonaventure says; Fructus Scripturae non est quicunque, sed plenitudo aeternae
foeticita^is. Bonaventura in Breviloq. sect. 3. tom. 6
The bene^it of s^ripture is not ordinary; but such as is able to make a man
fully blessed and happy.

Hugo Cardinalis speaking of the books rejected by us, says Et tales recipit
Ecclesia, non ad p^o^ationem Fidei, sed ad m^rum instructionem. Hugo in Prolog^
Galcatum S. Hieron.
These books are not received by the Church for proof of doctrine, but for
information of manners.

Of Communion under both kinds; and n^mber of Sacraments.
ALexander Hales, howsoever he some way incline to that opinion, that it is
sufficient to receive the Sacrament in one kind: yet he confesses Licet illa
sumptio quae est in ac^^pi^ndo sub una specie ^a^li^^at: illa tamen quae est
su^ duabus est m^^eri^ merit^; tum ratione aug^entationis devotio^^, tum
ratione ^idei di^atation^s actualis, tum ratione su^ptionis completioris,

efficaciae and compl^m. a^^. Halens. summae part 4 qu est. 53. membro pri^o.
that there is more merit and devotion, and compleatnesse, and efficacy in
receiving in both. Again, he says Totus Chris^us non con^i^^tur sub utraque
^^ecie sacra^entaliter^ se^ ca^o tanti^^^ sub spe^ie panis; sangui^ tan^^m su^
^pecie vi^i. H^lens. part. 4. qu^est 4^. memb. 3. a ^ie ^.
; Whole Christ is not sacramentally contained under each form; because the
bread signifies the body, and not the blood; the wine signifies the blood,
and not the body. Concerning the Churches practice, we do not find that the
lay people were as yet barred of the cup in the holy Sacrament: for our
Countryman Alexander Hales who flourished Alexander de Al^^, nati (...)

about the year of Grace 1240. says; that we may receive the body of Christ
under the form of bread only, sicut fere ubique fit a Laicis in ecclesia, as
it is almost every where done of the Laiety in the Church; ^uia C^ristus

it was almost done every where, but it was not done every where.

Concerning the Sacraments, the Schoolmen of this age can hardly agree amongst
themselves, that there be seven Sacraments properly so called.

Alexander of Hales says Sed duo instituit per s^psum, (...) Sac^ame^tum
Baptismi and Eucharistis. Sacramentum ve^o Confirmationis and extreme
^unctionis ded^t per Apostol^s. Alia ve^o tria Sacra^enta quandam habent
additionem a Domino in Evangelio. Halens. Summae, part. 4 quaest. 8. memb. 2
artic. 1.
, that there are only ^oure, which are in any sort properly to be said
Sacraments of the new Law; that the other three supposed Sacraments had their
being before, but received some addition by Christ, manifested in the flesh;
that amongst them which began with the new Covenant, only Baptism and the
Eucharist were instituted immediately by Christ, received their forms from
him, and flowed out of his wounded side.

Touching Confirmation, the same Alexander of Hales says Sine praejudi^io
dicendum, quod Dominus neque hoc Sacramentum institu^, neque dispens^vit, neque
Apostoli^ Institutum suit hoc Sacramentum Confirmationis Spiritus sancti
instinctu in Concilio Meldensi, quantum ad formam verborum, and ma^eriam
elementarem. Id. part. 4 qu. 23. memb. primo.
; the Sacrament of Confirmation, as it is a Sacrament, was not ordained either
by Christ, or by the Apostles, but afterward was ordained by the Council of
Meldain France.

Touching extreme unction, Suarez says Inter Catholicos nonnulli negarunt hoc
Sacrament^m ^uisse a Christo institutum, ex quo p^ane s^quebatur non esse verum
Sacramentum; ita vero sen^it Hugo de S. victore l. 2. de Sacram^. 2. quem

Sum. tract. 7. c. 1. S^a^ez. in 3. part^ Thomae. disp. 39. 2. tom. 4.
, that both Hugo of Saint Victor in Paris, and Peter Lombard and Bonaventure,
and Alexander of Hales, and Altissidorus (the chief schoolmen of their time)
denied this Sacrament to be instituted by Christ, and by plain consequence
(says he) it was no true Sacrament, though they were of opinion that a
Sacrament might be instituted by the Apostles, and therefore admitted not of
this consequence.

Of the Eucharist.
COncerning the Eucharist, Scotus says, Scotus lib 4 Did. 10. quaest. 1.
quantum ergo ad is^ud a^gum.
that it was not in the beginning so manifestly believed as concerning this
coversion. Principaliter autem videtur me movere quod de Sacramentis tene^dum
est, si^ut tenet S. Romana Ecclesia ^ nunc autem ipsa tenet panem
transubstantiari in cerpus, and vinum in sanguin^m, (...) manifesse habetur
Extravagante de Summa Tri^^t. and ^^le cath. firmiter Credimus. Ecclesia
declaravit istum intellectumesse de veritate Fidei in illo Symbolo edito sub
Innoentio ^ertio in Conci^io Later^nensi. et si quaeras quare voluit Ecclesia
eligere istum difficilem intellectum hujus Articuli, cum verba scriptu ae
possent salvari secundum intellectum facilem, and veriorem secundum
apparentiam: dico, quod ^o spiritu expos^^ sunt scripturae, quo conditae, and
ita supponendum est quod Ecclesia Cath. eo modo exposuit, quo tradidit nobis
fides Sp. sancto veritatis edocta; and ideo hunc intellectum elegit, quia
verus. Scotus -- in 4. S^ntent. Did. 11, quest 3..
But principally this seems to move us to hold Transubstantiation, because
concerning the Saraments we are to hold as the Church of Rome does. And he
adds; we must say, the Church, in the Creed of the Lateran council, under
Innocent the third, which begins with these words, Firmiter credimus, declared
this sense concerning Transubstantiation, to belong to the verity of our
faith. And if you demand, why would the Church make choice of so difficult a
sense of this Article, when the words of the Scripture, This is my Body, might
be upholden after an easy sense, and in appearance more true? I say, the
Scriptures were expounded by the same spirit that made them: and so it is to be
supposed, that the catholic Church expounded them by the same spirit: whereby
the faith was delivered us, namely being taught by the spirit of truth, Vnum
tamen addit Scotus quod minime p^obandum est, ^nte Lataranense Concilium non
suisse dogma fidei transubstantiationem: id enim ille dixit quia non lege^at
Concilium Romanum, sub Gregorio 7. neque consensum illum Patrum, quem nos
add^ximus. Bellar. l. 3. de Sacram. Eucharist. cap. 23.. u^um.
and therefore it chose this sense because it was true: thus far Scotus.

Let us now see what Bellarmie says. Scotus tells us (says he) that before
the Council of Lateran, (which was held in the year one thousand two hundred
and fifteen) transubstantiation was not believed as a point of faith; this is
confessed by Bellarmine to be the opinion of Scotus: only he would avoid his
testimony with a minime probandum est; Scotus indeed says so, but I cannot
allow of it; and then he taxes Scotus with want of reading: as if this
learned and subtle Doctor had not seen as many Councels, and read as many
Fathers for his time, as Bellarmine.

The same Bellarmine says, ^oc Dicit Scotus, non ext^re sum Scriptura tam
expresum, ut sine Ecclesiae declara^ione evidenter cog^t transubstantiationem
admittere. Atque ad non est omnino im^ro^^bile. Nam e^^ ^^si Scriptura videatur
nobis tam cla^^, ut po^sit cogere hominem non protervum: tamen an (...) sit,
meri^o dubitari pot^^t, cum homines doctissimi, and (...), qualis i^primis
Scotus fuit, contra^^^^ (...) Id ibid. secu^^o.
that Scotus held, that there was no one place of scripture so express, which
(without the declaration of the Church) would evidently compel a man to admit
of Transubstantiation: and this, says the Cardinal, is not altogether
improbable. It is not altogether improbable, that there is no express place of
Scripture to prove Transubstantiation without the declaration of the Church (
as Scotus said) for although the Scriptures seem to us so plain that they may
compel any but a refractary man to believe them; yet it may justly be doubted,
whether the Text be clear enough to enforce it, seeing the most acute and
learned men, such as Scotus was, have thought the contrary: thus far
Bellarmine, unto whom I will add the testimony of Cuthbert Tonstall the
learned Bishop of Durham.

His words are these An s^tini autem fui^set curiosis omnibus impos^^i^se

; Of the manner and means of the Real presence, either by Transubstantiation,
or otherwise, perhaps it had been better to leave every man, that would be
curious, to his own conjecture, as before the council of Lateran it was left:
and Master Bernard Gilpin, a man most holy, and renowned among the Northern
English, and one that was well acquainted with Bishop Tonstall his kinsman, and
Diocesan, says M^nini Ton^^allum ^pis^opum saepi^s narrasse Innocentium
tertium inco^saltius se^isse, quod transubstan^stanti^^tionis opinionem
arti^^lu^ fidei (...). Quum a^ted liberum ^uisset vel sic vel aliter (...).
V^ta Bernardi Gilpini page 40.
; I remember that Bishop Tonstall often tol^e me that Pope Innocent the third
had done very unadv^sedly in that he had made the opinion of
Transubstantiation an Article of Faith: seeing in former times it was free to
hold or refus^ that opinion.

The same Bishop told me, and many time ingenuously confessed Ita ut Scotus
(quod and Episcopus Tunstallus saepenum^ro ingenue ^atebatur) existimarit,
multo melius faciliusque pot^^sse Ecclesiam uti comm^diore interp^e^atione
v^rborum in sa^^a ^oena. Rever^nter cum antiquis Pa^ribus de sacra Co^na
loquendum judicavit Episcopus, and Transubstantiationis opinionem ^^itte^dam
esse. Illud etiam idem Tunstallus ex scriptis and sermonibus affirmare solebat,
Innocentium tertium nescisse quid ageret, quando Transubsta^tiat^onem inter
^rticulos fidei posuerit: dicebatque Innocentium d^c^is circa se hominibus
car^isse^ adeo equidem inquit Tunstallus, si ipse fuissem ei ^ Consilio, non
dubito me potuisse Pontificem ab e^ Consilio vetraxisse. Vita Be^. Gilpini.
page 46.
that Scotus was of opinion that the Church might better and with more ease
make use of some more commodious exposition of those words in the holy Supper:
and the Bishop was of the mind that we ought to speak reverently of the holy
Supper, but that the opinion of Transubstantiation, might well be let alone.
This thing also the same Bishop Tonstall was wont to affirm both in words and
writings, that Innocent the third knew not what he did when he put
Transubstantiation among the Articles of Faith, and he said that Innocentius
wanted learned men about him, and indeed (says the Bishop) if I had been of
his council, I make no doubt but I might have been able to have dissuaded him
from that resolution.

By this that has been said, it appears that Transubstantiation was neither
holden, nor known universally in the Church before the Lateran Council;
twelve hundred years after Christ: and that when it began to be received as a
matter of Faith, it was but believed upon the Churches authority; and this
Church virtually and in effect was Pope Innocent in the Lateran Council,
twelve hundred years and more after Christ; before which time there was no
certainty, nor necessity of believing it; and the Council might have chosen
another sense of Christ's words more easy and in all appearance more true;
there being no scripture sufficient to convince it.

Of Images, and Prayer to Saints.
HOnorius of Authun in France, says: Nullu^ sapiens Crucem^ sed Christum
crucifixum adorat. Honor. Augustud. in Gemma animae^ ut citatur a Cassandro in
Consult. cap. de Imag.
There is none that is godly wise, who will worship and adore the Cross, but
Christ crucified on the cross.

Roger Hoveden, our native historian, who lived in the beginning of this age,
condemned the adoration of Images; for, speaking of the Synodall Epistle
written by the Fathers of the second Nicen council, wherein Image worship was
established, he tells us; Carolus Rex Francorum misit Synodalem librum ad
Britanniam sibia Constantinopoli directum, in quo libro (he^ pro^ dolor) ^ulta
inconvenienti^, and v^^^ fidei contrari^ reperieba^tur; maxim quod pene omnium
Orientalium Doctorum, non minus quam trecentorum, vel eo amplius Episcoporum,
u^animi assertione confirmatum fuerit Imagines adorari debere, quod omnino
Ecclesia Dei execr^tur. Roger Hoveden part. 1. Annal. p, 405. an. 792.
that Charles the King of France sent into this Isle a Synodall book directed
unto him from Constantinople, wherein there were diverse offensive passages (but
especially this one, that by the joint consent of all the Doctors of the East,
and no fewer than 300 Bishops, it was decreed that Images should be worshipped
(quod ecclesia Dei execratur) (says he) which the Church of God abhorres.

Guilielmus Altissiodorensis says Prop^er ista^ ratione^ and consim^let d^cunt
(...), quod nec n^s oram^s S^nctos, nec ipsi orant pro nobis nisi improprie;
i^e^ (...), qui^ or^mus ^^^m ut Sancto^um (...) no^ (...) Gul. Al. tissindo^.
in Summ^ part. 4. li^. 3. tract. 7 q^ est. 6.
that for such and such reasons many do say, that neither we pray unto the
Saints, nor they pray for us, but improperly: in r^spect we pray unto God, that
the merits of the Saints may h^lpe us.

Of Faith and Merit.
THomas Aquinas says, Opera (...) sunt causae (...) sit justus apud Deum, sed
^oti^s (...) executiones and mani^est^tiones just t^^. Th. Aquin comment. in c.
3 Ep. ad G^lat l^ct. 4. and Romans 3. L^ct. 4. and -- ^usti^icationis in sola
^ide^ Id in ^ (...). 1 ^ect 3. (...) side pa^sionis (...) r^mitt^tur omnis
(...) fide ejas null^s justifi^atur Bonaventura in 4. ^ent. di^t. 15. quest. 1.
that works be not the cause why a man is just before God, but rather they are
the execution and manifestation of his justice: for no man is just^fied by
works, but by the Habit of Faith infused; yea just^fication is done by Faith
only. And Aquinas in his commentary on the Galatians in the place alleged,
tho at the first he mention such works as are performed by the power of
nature, yet afterward he speaks also of works wrought by the power of grace,
and of such as Saint James mentions, Chap. 2. saying; Was not Abraham justified
by works? but these were works of grace; and yet Thomas excludes from
justification, works done in the state of Grace; and says, Justification is
done by Faith only. Bonaventure says, (...) in B. Ch^ys. and qu^tuor D^ctor.
Eccles. in (...) 8 August^^ quaes^. 13.
that by only Faith in Christ's passion, all the fault is remitted, and without
the faith of him no man is justified. Velosillus in his animadversions upon the
writings of the Fathers and Doctors of the Church observes S. Thomas (...) in
1. (...) art 5. and in Romans 4. constanter a^^irmat, ^ullum esse i^ peccato
e^meritum suae justificationis (...) ex co^g^^o, (...). Vega in opus^us. (...).
6. de Iusti^^at.
, that Scotus held not merit of Condig^ity. And Vega says, that Thomas Aquinas
the flower of the Schoole-Divines constantly affirms, that a sinner can not
merit his own just^fication either of congruity, or of condignity; and thus
have these men given in their verdict, but now let us hear themselves speak.

There is no action of ours, says Scotus Qui [actus] s^cundum se co^^iderat^s
absque tal^ acceptatione divine secun^^m ^^r^ctam justiciam non fuiss^t dignus
t^li (...) ex intrinse^^ bonitate qua^ haberet ex (...) principijs; quod (...);
semper enim praem^um est majus bonum merito; and justitia (...) non reddit
meli^s pro (...) bo^o; id^o been dicitur quod semper Deus praemiat ultra
meritum condignu^^ Scotus in prim. Sent^^t^ did. 17 qu 3. nu. 2.
, that without the special ordinance of God, and his divine acceptance, is
worthy of the reward with which God rewards them that serve him, in respect
of the inward goodness that it has from the causes of it; because always the
reward is greater than the merit, and strict Justice does not give a better
thing for a thing of less value: And again he says Loquendo d^ strict^
justiti^, Deus nulli nost^um propter qu^cu^que merita est debtor perfectionis
reddendae, tam intense; propter immod^ratum ^xcessum ill^^s perfectionis ultra
ill^ merita. Idem in 4. did 49. qu. 6.
, That speaking of strict Justice, God is bound to none of us, to bestow
rewards of so high perfection as he does, the rewards being so much greater in
worth, than any merits of ours.

The Prophet David ( says Dr. Vshers Answer to the Jesuit title of Merits.
page 547.
the learned Archbishop of Armagh has fully cleared this case, in that one
sentence Psalm. 62.12. With thee Oh Lord, is mercy; for thou r^ward^st every
man according to his works. Originally therefore, and in it self, this reward
proceeds merely from Gods free bounty and mercy: but accidentally, in regard
that God has tied himself by his word and promise, to confer such a reward,
it now prov^th in a sort to be an act of Justice, in regard of the faithful
performance of his prom^se. For promise amongst honest men is counted a due
debt; but the thing promised being free, and on our part altogether undeserved,
if the promiser did not perform, and proved not to be so good as his word; he
could not properly be said to do us wrong, but rather to wrong himself, by
impayring his own credit. And therefore Aquinas confesses, Non sequitur, quod
Deus effic^atur simpliciter de^itor nobis, s^d (...); in quantum debi^um est,
ut sua ordinatio impleatur. whom. 1.2 ^ quest. 114 art 1. ad 3 um.
That God is not hereby simply made a debtor to us, but to himself; in as much
as it is requisite, that his own ordin^nce should be fullfilled.

William, Bishop of Paris, treating of prayer, gives us this Caveat; Cavendum
est tibi in (...), ne debili aut fragil^ fundamento i^n^t^ris, quod ille
proculdubio fa^it, qu^ de meritis suis con^idit, and t^nquam m^ritis suis
debita petit^^n oratione dona Dei; qui so^is suis viribus aut meritis
i^nititur, D^i ^uxilio, and viribus scipsum private. Gu^^. Parisiens. de
Rhetorica divina, cap. 52.
Not to lean on the weak and frail foundation of our own merits, but wholly
denying our selves, and distrusting our own strength, to rely on the sole
favor and mercy of God; and in so doing, (says he) the Lord will never fail
us.

Cassander says Omnes enim tam veteres, quam recentes -- uno ore pro^itentur,
remissionem peccatorum, and gratiam justificationis n^minem suis qu^mvis in
speciem bonis operibus mereri -- nec ab ^ac sententia abhorrent Scriptores
Scholastici, and recentiores Ecclesiastici. Cassander C^s^ll. Art. 6. de Bon.
operi^.
, That both ancient and modern with full consent profess to repos^ themselves
wholly upon the mere mercy of God, and merit of Christ, with an humble
renunciation of all worthiness in their own works; and this doctrine
Cassander derives through the lower ages of the Schoolmen, and later writers;
Thomas of Aquine, Durand, Adrian de Trajecto ( afterward Pope Adrian the
sixth) Clictoveus, and delivers it for the voice of the then present Church.

THE FOVRTEENTH CENTVRIE. From the year of Grace 1300. to 1400.
PAP.
WHat say you of this fourteenth Age?

PROT.
In this Age learning began to revive; for so it came to pass, that diverse
learned men among the Greeks, abhorring such cruelty as the Turks used
against their Contrymen the Grecians, left those parts, and fled into Italy.
Now by their means, the knowledge of Letters, and study of Tongues, specially
the Greek and Latin, began to spread ab^^ad through diverse parts of the West.
Of this number were Emanuel Chrysoloras of Constantinople, Theodorus Gaza of
Thessalonica, Georgius Trapezuntius, Cardinal Bessarion, and others; in like
sort also afterward John Cap^io brought the use of the Greek and Hebrew
tongues into Germany, as Faber Stapulensis observes Lingnarum ^^gnitio, and
(...) L^tinae and G^aecae, ( ^um postea Hebra^ (...) ex^itat^^^st) circase p^r^
Constantinop^l^os (...) hos^^bu^ Christ^ expugnat^, ^^dire c^^it; pauci^
Graecis, nimirum Bess^^one, Theodoro Gaza, Georgio Trape^^ntio, Emanuel^
Chrysolora, illinc in Italiam recept^. Iac. Faber St^pulen^^n p^ae^at. in
comment. in Evangelia.
: And in the beginning of this age, Hebrew was first taught in Oxford, as our
accurat Chronologer Mr. Isaacson has observed Mr. Henry Isaacsons Chronology
ad an. Chr. 1314.
.

Now also lived Nicholas de Lyra, Nicolaus de Lyra, natione Anglicu^, vir in
Scripturis S. studiofissimus^ Trithem. de scriptor. Eccles.
a converted Jew, who commented on all the Bible.

In this age there were diverse both of the Greek and Latin Church who stood
for Regal Jurisdiction against Papal usurpation; and namely, Barlaam the
Monk; Nilus Archbishop of Thessalonica; Marsilius Patavinus: Michael Cesenas
General of the gray Friars; Dante the Italian Poet; and William Ockam Gul.
Ockam, natione Anglicus, Ioannis Scot^ quondam discipul^s. Trithem. de
scriptor. Eccles.
the English man, sometime fellow of Merton College in Oxford, surnamed the
Invincible Doctor, and Scholar to Scotus the subtle Doctor: Now also lived
Durand de S. Porciano. Nilus alleges diverse passages out of the general
Councels, against the Popes supremacy, and thence infers as follows.

That, (...).

Nilus de primatu Papae lib. 2. page 64.


Rome can not challenge pre-eminence over other Seas, because Rome is named in
order before them; for by the same reason Constantinople should have the
pre-eminence over Alexandria; which yet she has not. From the several and
distinct boundaries of the Patriarchall Seas he argues, that (...). id. ibid.
Page 66.
neither is Rome set over other Seas, nor others subject to Rome.

That whereas Rome stands upon the privilege, that other places appeal to
Rome; he says (...).
, That so others appeal to Constantinople, which yet has not thereby
Jurisdiction over other places. That whereas it is said the Bishop of Rome
judges others, and himself is not judged of any other; he says (...). id.
ibid. Page 70.
, That St. Peter whose successor he pretends himself to be, suffered himself
to be reproved by S. Paul; and yet the Pope (tyrant-like) will not have any
enquire after his doings.

Barlaam prooveth out of the Chalcedon Council, [Canon 28.] That the Pope had
not any primacy over other Bishops, from Christ, or S. Peter; but many ages
after the Apostles; by the gift of holy Fathers and Emperors: if the Bishop of
Rome (says he Nam si Episcopus Romanus an^ea primus ^uiss^t, orbisque
terrarum P^stor ^ S. Petro constitutus, (...), Nunquam sanctissimi Imperarores
Co^stantin. and Justinian. ut dear sui juris promulgassent: Decernimus ut
Romanus Episcopu^ primus omnium sacerdotum sit; quia lege non opu^ uisset.
Barlaam de prim^^^ Ponti^ic. c. 4. p. 198.
) had anciently the supremacy, and that S. Peter had appointed him to be the
Pastor of the whole Church; what needed those godly Emperors decree the same
as a thing within the verge of their own power and jurisdiction?

Marsilius Patavinus wrote a book called Defensor Pacis, on the behalf of
Lewis Duke of Baviere, and Emperor, against the Pope, for challenging power to
invest and depose Kings: He held, (...) principatus siv^ contenti^sa
jur^sd^ctionis, regimin^^, s^u coac^ivi judicij ^ujuslib^t in hoc seculo,
Chri^^us s^ipsum and (...) os exclusit, and ex^ludere vo^u^t. Marsil. Pata^
Def^nsor pacis p^rt. 2. c 4 p. 2.
that Christ has excluded, and purposed to exclude himself and his Apostles
from principality, or contentious jurisdiction, or regiment, or any coactive
judgment in this world.

His other Tenets are reported to be these Catalog. (...). li^. 18.
: 1 That the Pope is not superior to other Bishops, much less to the
Emperor. 2. That things are to be decided by Scripture. 3. That learned men of
the Laiety are to have voices in Councels. 4. That the Clergy, and the Pope
himself are to be subject to Magistrates. 5. That the Church is the whole
company of the faithful. 6. That Christ is the Head of the Church, and
appoint^d none to be his Vicar. 7. That Priests may marry. 8. That St. Peter
was never at Rome. 9. That the popish ^ynagogue is a den of thieves. 10. That
the Popes doctrine is not to be followed.


With this Marsilius of P^dua, there joined in opinion John of Gandune, and
they both held, that Q^od Clerici si^t and ^sse (...) ^ure subjecti potestati
(...), tum (...) j^di^ijs, prae^ertim in causis ^on Eccl^sias^icis, (...) de
Padua, and Io^nnes de Iand^no do^uer^^t (...) de ^leri^ l^b. 1. c. 2^ p^str^mo.
Clerks are, and should be subject to secular powers, both in payment of
Tribute, and in iudg^ments, specially not Ecclesiastical: so that they stood
against the Exemption of Clerks.

Michael Cesenas General of the Order of Franciscans, stood up in the same
quarrel, and was therefore deprived of his dignities by Pope John the two and
twentieth, from whom he appealed ^go secund^m fo^mam juris ab ip^^ s^ut ab
h^re^ico app^llavi egiti^e ad universalem Ecclesi^m, and gen^r^le C^n^ilium.
Michael d^ C^zena, Epist. 12.
to the Catholic univers^ll Church, and to the next general Council.

About this time also lived the noble Florentine Poet Dante, a learned
Philosopher and Divine, who wrote a book against the Pope, concerning the
Monarchy of the Emperor; but for taking part with him, the Pope banished him
Dantes Aligeriu^, vir tam ^n divinis Scripturis, quam in secularibus literi^
omnium suo tempore studiosissimus, pu^sus pa^^a omnibus diebus suis exulavit.
^rithem. de scriptor. ecclesiast^
. But of all the rest, our Countryman Ockam stuck close to the Emperor, to
whom he said D^xit Ludovico Imperatori: O Imperator, defend me gladio, and ego
defendam te Verbo. Trithem. de scriptor. Eccles. verbo Guil. Ockam.
, that if he would defend him with the sword, he again would defend him with
the Word. Ockam argues the case, and inclines to this opinion, that S^rvus
non est major domino. Pilat^s jurisdictione^ habuit coa^tivam super C^ristum,
camque ordinariam, non usurpatam. Ockam lib. 6 Dialog part. 1. cap. 4.
in temporal matters, the Pope ought to be subject to the Emperor, in as much
as Christ himself, as he was man, professes that Pilate had power to judge
him given of God; as also, that neither Peter, nor any of the Apostles had
temporal power given them by Christ, and hereof he gives testimony St^tisse
lego Apostolos judicandos, sedisse judicantes non l^go, Bern. ad Eugen. Ockam
ibid. cap. 3.
from Bernard and Gregory. Ockams writings were so displeasing to the Pope, as
that he excommunicated him for his labor, and caused his treatise or work of
ninety days, as also his Dialogues to be put into the black bill of books
prohibited and forbidden In Romano Indice prohibita sunt ^uae scripsit contra
Ioannem Pap. 22. Possevin. apparat sacer. tom. 1. li^. G. p. 709.
.

It is true indeed, that Ockam submitted his writings to the censure and
judgment of the Church; but (as he says Si quid autem scripsero, correctioni
Ecclesiae Catholicae, non Ecclesiae malignantium submitto. Ockam in Prologo
compend. errorum Joan. Papae 22.
, to the judgment of the Church Catholic, not of the Church malignant. The
same Ockam spoke excellently in the point of general Councels: He held, Non
ideo solummodo vocatur Conciliu^ generale, quia authoritate summi Pontificis
co^vocatur. Ockam. Dial. pa^r. 1. lib 6. c 84.
that Councels are not called general, because they are congregated by the
authority of the Roman Pope; and that Reges and Principe^ and nonnull^ Laici,
possunt si voluerint, ad generale concilium conveni^e, and e^^sdem Concilij
tractatibus interesse. Id. ibid.
if Princes and Laymen please, they may be present, and have to deal with
matters treated in general Councels.

That, Concilium generale, licet sit part Ecclesiae militantis universalis,
tamen non est Ecclesia universalis. Igitur teme^ arium e^^ dicere quod
Concilium generale contra fidem errare non potest. Id. ibid. part. 1. l. 5.
cap. 25.
a general Council, or that congregation which is commonly reputed a general
Council by the world, may err in matters of faith: and in case such a
general Council should err, yet God would not leave his Church destitute of
all means of saving truth, but would raise up spiritual children to Abraham,
out of the rubbish of the Laiety, despised Christians, and dispersed Catholics
Quod si Concilium in ^^^resin ^abe^etur, remanerent alij Catholici, qui occulte
vel public prout expediret, auderent fidem defendere O^thodoxam -- potens est
Deus de lapiditus, id est, Laicis rudibus, and ^bjectis pauperibus, and de
spectis Catholicis, Dei filios suscitare. Id. ibid. p. 1. l. 5. cap. 2^.
.

We have heard the judgment of the learned abroad touching Jurisdiction
Regal and Papal; let us now see the practice of our own Church and State.

In the Reign of King Edward the third: sundry express Statutes were made
Satute of Provisors. An. 25. Edward. 3. cap. 22. Stat. an. 27. Edw. 3. cap. 1.
S^^t. an. 38. Edw. 3. cap. 1.
, that if any procured any Provisions from Rome of any Abbeyes, Priories or
Benefices in England, in destruction of the Realm, and holy Religion: if any
man sued any Process out of the Court of Rome, or procured any personal
Citation from Rome, upon causes whose cognizance and final discussion
pertained to the Kings Court, that they should be put out of the Kings
protection, and their lands, goods, and chattels forfeited to the King.

In the Reign of King Richard the second it was enacted An. 13. Richard. 2.
Statute an. 16. Rich. 2. cap. 4. and 5.
, That no Appeal should thenceforth be made to the Sea of Rome upon the
penalty of a Praemunire, which extended to perpetual banishment, and loss of
all their lands and goods: the words of the statute are An. 13. Richard. 2.
Statute an. 16. Rich. 2. cap. 4. and 5.
, If any purchase or pursue in the Court of Rome any Translations of
Bishoprics, processes, and sentences of excommunication, Bulls, instruments,
or other things; they shall be out of the Kings protection, and their lands and
tenements, goods and chattels forfeit to the King; and process to be made
against them by Praemunire facias.

It was also enacted in the Reign of King Henry the fourth Stat. an. 11. Henr.
4. cap. 8.
, that all elections of all Archbishoprickes, Abbeyes, Priories, Deanries, and
other dignities should be free, without being in any wise interrupted by the
Pope. And indeed it was high time to curb the Popes bestowing of Benefices on
forrainers; for upon an Inquisition taken by Simon Langham Archbishop of
Canterbnry, it was found In ^a Inquisitione compertum ^uit, no^nu^os viginti
Ecclesias and dignitates ipsiu^ Papae authoritate possidere, illisque in super
i^s them privilegijs indult^m esse, ut sine mode atque numero n^ctas licite
retinere possi^t. Antiq. Britan. page 249.
, that some had above twenty Churches and dignities by the Popes authority, and
were thereby further privileged to hold so many more as they could get without
measure or number. Yea, the Romans and Italians were so multiplied within a few
years in English Church Livings, that when King Henry the third caused a view
thereof to be taken throughout the whole Realm, the sum of their revenewes
was found to be yearly, as Matthew Paris says Math. Paris in Henr. 3. ad an.
1240.

-- Rex per singulos Comitatus Angliae ^ec^t inquiri summam Redituum Romanorum,
et inventum est, quod ad ta^tundem pe^^^e ascendisset, quantum Reditus ipsius,
videi^^et 60. millia Ma^carum puri redditus. exceptis alijs varijs emolumentis.
Math. Westmon^st. ad an. 1245. in Henr. tertio.


, Sexaginta millia marcarum, threescore thousand marks, to the which sum the
yearly revenues of the Crown of England did not amount.

By this that has been said, it appears to be an untruth, which the Papists
in their Supplication The Papists Supplicat. answered by Gabr. Powell.
, and the Author of the treatise called the Prudentiall Balance, have given
out, to wit^ Prudentiall Balance cap 21. that all our Christian English Kings
to King Henry 8. we^e Roman Catholics.
That all the Kings of England unto King Henry the eight were papists; for
diverse of them dyed before the grossenes of Popery began; othe^s of the^, as
namely King Henry the first and second, King John, King Richard the second, and
Edward the third, opposed the Papacy. Now the very being and essence of a
Papist consists, in acknowledging the Popes supremacy Bellar. lib. 3. de
Eccles. milit. cap. 2. Nostra.
, which since these did not acknowledge, but withstood it; they cannot properly
be termed Papists, though they were carried away with the errors of those
times.

In this age lived those famous Florentine Poets, Dante and Petrarch; as also
our English Laureat, Chaucer; as also Ioannes de Rupe scissa, or Rocke-cliffe,
and S. Bridget. And these found fault with the Romish faith, as well as with
her manners. Dante in his Poem of Paradise, written in Italian, complains
that the Pope of a shepherd was become a wolf, and diverted Christ's sheep
out of the true way; that the Gospel was forsaken, the writings of the Fathers
neglected, and the Decretals only studied. That in times past war was made
upon the Church by the sword, but now by a famine and dearth of the Word, which
was allotted for the food of the soul, and not wont to be denied to any that
desired it; that men applauded themselves in their own conceits, but the
Gospel was silenced; that the poor sheep were fed with the puffes of wind,
and were pined and consumed away.

Dante his words are these, Dante Ca^^o. 9. del' paradiso. page 483.
Produce et spande il maladetto fi^r^,
Cha desu^ate le pecore et gli agni,
Pero che fatto ha lupo del pastore.
Per quest^ l' evangelio i d^ttor magni
Son derelitti; et solo a i decretali
Si studia si; che pare, a i lor viuagni,
A questo intend 'l papae Cardinali.
which may be thus Englished, She did produce, and forth has spread
The cursed flower, which has misled
The sheep and lambs, because that then
Shepherds became fierce wolves, not men.
Hereupon the Gospel clear
And the ancient Fathers were
Forsaken; then the Decretals
By the Pope and Cardinals
Were only read; as may appear
By the salvage of the gowns they wear.
Again, Id ibid. Canto 18 p. 538
Gia solea con le spade far guerra;
Ma hor si fa, togliondo hor qui hor quivi
Lo pan; ch' el pio padre a nessun serra.
IN the days of old with sword they fought,
But now a new way they have sought
By taking away now h^re, there then
The bread of life from starved men;
Which our pious fathers never denied,
To any one that for it cried.

Now the way of preaching, is with toys

They might spy pardons, and the rest,
How worthy of their trust they be.
By these their Indulgences and pardons,
[And by their Friars absolutions]
Such follies on the earth abound,
That without proof or other ground
Of testimony, men agree
To any promise that made can be.
By this St. Anthony piggs grow fat,
And such like Pardoners; so that
Hereby they feed the belly and the groine,
Paying their people with counterfeit coin.


Here we see how the Poet taxes papal Indulgences which the Friars vented,
enriching themselves by marting such pardons, or Bulls signed or sealed with
Lead, for which the people paid current money; he also taxes such as vainly
trusted to such pardons; as also the fond conceit they had of being shriven
and absolved in a Monks cowle, as if some rare virtue had laid in that Cuculla
or Capuccio, alluding (belike) to the Monks hood, or Friars cowle, as if the
fashion thereof had resembled the Cuckowe.

The same Dante in covert terms, calls Rome the whore of Babylon mentioned
in the Apocalypse; his words are these Dante In^erno Canto 19. page 120.
. Di voi pastor s' accorse' l' vangelista;
quando colei, che siede soura l' acque,
putaneggiar co i regi a lui fu vista;
Quella; che con le set test nacque,
et da le diece corna hebb' argomento,
fin che virtute al suo marito piacque.
The Evangelist meets with you well
You [Romish] Pastors; when he does tell
How he did see the woman, which
Sits on the waters [that foul witch]
To play the whore with Kings; that Beast
That borne was with seven horns at least.
And had the sign of some ten more
To Appease her husband by their power.


The Author alludes to that in the Revelation, of the great whore that sitteh
on many waters, Reuelat. 17.1. and of the beast that bears her, which has
seven heads, and ten horns, verse. 7. with whom the Kings of the earth commit
fornication. Chap. 18. v. 3.

Francis Petrarch the Laureat Poet, and Archdeacon of Parma, a man excellently
skilled in the Scriptures, and one who (as Trithemius says ^r. Pe^rarcha vir
in divinis scripturis e^udi^us, literas humanitatis post longa silentia mortuas
(ut ita dixerim) ab ^nferis revoca^it ad superos. Trith. de script. Eccles.
,) Revived learning after it had been a long time decayed, speaks more fully,
saying Petrarcha Son^ti 92. page 85. part. 1.
; Del' empia Babylonia, ond' e fugitta
Ogni vergogna, ond' ogni been e fuori,
Albergo di dolor, madre d' errori,
Son fugi^t' ^o per allongar la vita.
Out of wicked Babylon
By Gods help at length I am gone;
From which all shame is banished,
From which all good is vanished.
The Lodge of grief and misery,
The Mother of all Heresy.
And elsewhere he speaks as roundly; Petrarch. part. 1. Sonetti 108. page 149.
in tom. 4. Basil. 1581.
Fontana di dolor, albergo d' ira,
Scola d errori, e tempiod heresia,
Gia Roma, hor Babylonia, falsa e ria
Per cui tanto si piagne; e si sospira.
O fucina d' inganni, o prigion d' ira;
Ove' I ben more, e' i mal si nutre e cria;
Di vivi inferno, un gran mira col fia,
Se Christo teco al fine non sad ira.
Wellspring of grief, and fierce wraths Hospital,
The School of error, temple of Heresy;
Once Rome, now Babylon, most wicked, all
With sighs and tears bewail thy pitteous fall.
Thou Mother of deceit, bulwark of Tyranny,
Truths persecuter, nurse of iniquity,
The Living's Hell; a miracle it will be,
If Christ in fury come not against thee
Most shameless whore.


These sayings of Petrarch did so gall the Pope, that Pius Quintus has caused
three Sonnets to be razed Pius Quintus tr^a e^us cantica abradi jussit. Bellar.
in Ap^end. ad librum de Pont^f. c. 21.
out of Petrarch; and so indeed I found in the Petrarch which used Mancano tree
sonnetti Pe^rarch. page 113. Vene^. 1600.
, that three Sonnets were wanting, but that which I have alleged, is found in
the Basil edition.

PAP.
Bellarmine says Non potuit Petrarchs, cum Romam, sive Ave^^^n^m, ^b Curiam
summi Po^ti^i^^s, Babylonem appell^v^t, de ^ide, ^e religione, sed de vitijs
tantum, quae tu^c ^^geba^t, ea dicere. Bellarm. in Append. c. 21.
, that Petrarch spoke thus of the Court of Rome, and not of the Church of Rome;
of Romes corruption in manners, not in doctrine.

PROT.
This answer will not serve: for though Petrarch might mean the Court, by the
name of Babylon, and by imputing to it Covetousness and Licentiousness; yet
when he charges Rome with Idolatry, and calls it the Temple of Heresy, can this
be intended of the Court of Rome? or of corruption only in point of life?
Besides, if any should think, that Petrarch spoke thus only in a Poetical
vein, he is the same man in Prose in his Latin Epistles; for therein
addressing his speech to the Sea of Rome, (...) d^cam^an i^sa^^^ m^^^trix
fornicata ^um Regibus te^^e. Illa ^quidem e^ quam in Spiritu s^^er videt (...),
illa ead^m in (...) es, no ^alia, sede^ ^u^er aqua^ ^^^tas. Petrarch^ Epist. 16
to. 2 p 729.
he says; Thou art that famous, or rather in^amous h^rlot, which committest
fornication with the Kings of the earth; the self some strumpet thou art,
which the sacred Evangelist saw in the spirit; the self some, I say thou art,
and no other; having thy sent upon many waters; then he speaks of her doom,
saying Quid exp^ct^^ nisi quod Io^nnes idem (...) Babylon magna, and (...) ibid
p ^30. (...) and ne p^^ticipes ^^tis ^el^ctorum ^jus, and de pl^gi^ ^jus ibid.
; What other end do thou expect, but the same prophesied by John: Great
Babylon is fallen, is fallen, and made an habitation for devils? But thou my
dear friend, with the same Apostle hear another voice speaking from Heaven,
Come out of her my people, and be not partakers of her iniquities, that so you
may receive none of her stripes.

To these two Italians (to make up a Triumvirate of famous Poets) we may join
our English Laureat Sir Geoffry Chaucer. This noble Knight, who by marriage was
brother in law to John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, found fault with the Faith,
as well as the manners of the Romanists in his days, as may appear by these
instances following; of St. Peter's successor he says The ^^owmans tale in
Chaucer.
, in the ^^owmans tale. P^t^r the Apostle.
Peter was never so great a fool,
To leave h^s [Key] which the Papists say he has of Heaven gate.
Key with such a [Such a Lorrell] as the Pope.
Lorrell,
Or take such curs^d such a tool;
He was advis^d nothing well,
I trow they have the key of hell.
Their Master is of that place Marshall,
For there they dressen them to dwell;
And with false Lucifer there to fall;
They been as proud as Lucifer,
As angry, and as envious;
From good faith they been full far,
In covetize they been curious.


This, and much more does he utter in the person of a simple Ploughman,
implying thereby that the meanest Country^body in those days, could out of
Gods Word, tell what was right and religious, and what otherwise; yea, and tax
the wickedness and blindness of the Romanists in those days.

Touching their Shrift, Relics, Pardons, and merit of works, he says as
follows Chaucer in Prolog. in the description of the Friar.
. Full sweetly heard he Confession,
And pl^asant was his Absolution.
He was an easy man to give penance,
Th^re as he w^st to h^ve a good pittance.
For unto a poor ord^r for to give,
Is sign that a man is well yshrive.
For many a man is so hard of heart,
That he may not weep though him smart.
Therefore in stead of weeping and of prayers,
Men mote give silver to the poor Friars.


Touching the pardoner he says The Prologue to the pardoners tale.
; Ne was there such another Pardoner,
For in his male had he a pillowbere,
Which as he said was our Ladies veil.
He said he had a gobbet of the sail
That Saint Peter had when that he went
Upon the Sea till Jesus Christ him shent.


In the Pardoners tale he says The Pardoners tale. Chaucer.
, Mine holy pardon may you all warish,
So that ye offer nobles, or sterlings,
Other ^ls^ silver spoones, brooches, or rings.
Boweth your head under this Bull;
Comes up ^e wives, and offers of your wool;
Your names h^re I ent^r in my roll anon,
Into the bl^sse of Heaven shall ye all gone.
I you assoile by mine high power
Ye that offeren, as clean and eke clear
As ye were borne.


And els^where he says The Summoners tal^. Chaucer.
, The cleanness and the fasting of us Freers,
Makes that Christ accepts our prayers.


In the Romant of the Rose, he appli^th the name of Antichrist to that Sea,
saying The Romant of the Rose. Chauc.
, Of Antichrist's men am I,
Of which that Christ says openly;
They have habit of holiness,
And living in such wickedness.


Take now a taste of the questions, which in the person of Jack Vpland, he
mooves to the Friar.

Friar says he Chaucers Treatise called Jack Vpl^^d.
, Why make ye men believe that your golden A Trentall is thirty Masses.
Tr^ntals, sung of you, to take therefore five or ten ^hillings at the l^ast;
Against the Mass.
wole bring souls out of purgatory? if this be sooth, certes ye might bring
all souls out of pain, and that will ye naught, and then ye be out of
charity.

Freere, what charity is this, to prease upon a rich man, Against works of
Supererogation.
and to entice him to die in a Friars cowle, and be buried among you, from his
Parish Church; and and to such rich men, give letters of Brotherhood,
confirmed by your general seal; and thereby to bear him in hand, that he
shall have part of all your Masses, Mattens, Fastings, wakings, and all other
good deeds done by you, and your brethren, both whiles he lives, and after his
death? Why grant ye them the merit of your good deeds, and yet weeten never,
whether God be apayd with your deeds, ne whether the party that has that
letter, be in state to be saved, or damned?

Fre^re, Of Auric^^ar Con^ession.
why hear ye not poor folks shrift, but are Confessors to the rich, to
Lords and Ladies, whom ye mend not? but they be bolder to pill their poor
tennants, and to live in lechery.

In this Age John de Rupe scissa was famous for prophecies and predictions. The
Chronicler reports of him as follows Le Pape Innocent s^^. brus^er en ce
temps (l'accus^nt de sorcellerie) un Cordelier nomme I^an de Rocque taillade en
Avignon, pource qui'l est^it fort aspre en ses sermons contre le siege Romain;
e^ pourc^^ qui'l avoit prophetise beau^op des chooses advener touchant les
Papes. Ian. Francois le Peti^^ Le Grand Chronique d^ Holland. tom. 1. lib. 3.
pa^ 293.
. Pope Innocent about that time caused a Cordelier, whose name was John de Rupe
scissa, (accused of sorcery) to be burned in Avignion; because he was too
sharp in his Sermons against the Sea of Rome, and because he had prophesied
many things to come concerning the Popes, and amongst others said in plain
terms; that the Pope would be one day like unto that Bird, which being naked,
was fledged and feathered by borrowing a feather of every bird; and then seeing
herself so furnished, fat, and fair, she began to flutter and strike at
others with her beak and claws; the other birds that had made her so gay,
seeing her pride and insolency, redemanded their own feathers, and so left the
poor bird naked, and starved with cold. The like (says he Le semblable diso^t
il que c^ seroit un jour du Pape, et ^ource (...) tenu et declare heretic. Il
avoit commance a prophetiser des l' an. 1345. du ^emps du Pape Clement 6. e^
vit on advevo^ plusieurs chooses de ce qui'l avoit prealit. id. ibid.
) will one day befall the Pope: and for this he was taken and pronounced an
Heretic: he began to proph^si^ from the year 1345. in the days of Pope
Clement the Sixth; and diverse of those things came to pass which he for^told.
Thus far the Chronicle.

Froissart the Historian says Ence temps ung ^^ere (...) p^^in de grand
Cl^rgie and de grand ^ntendement e^ la Cite D^ A^ignon es^oit qui lo app^lloit
^rere I^han de Roche taillade; l^ quel ^rere min^ur le Pape innocent 6. fas^it
(...) en prison a^ chastell de Baignoux pour les grandes marvell^s quil disoit
a advenir. Io. Froissart. tom. 1. page 14^.
; Under Innocent the Sixth there was at Avignion a c^rtaine Franciscan Friar,
^ndued with singular wit and learning, called Ioannes a Rupe-scissa, whom the
Pope kept in prison in the Castle of Baignoux, for wonderful things which he
affirmed should come to pass, especially upon Ecclesiastical Pr^lats. This
John offered to prove all his assentions out of the Apocalypse, and the ancient
books of the holy Prophets; and indeed this Parable, or similitude of the
Bi^d, may very well seem to be taken out of the Apocalypse; for there it is
said; that The Kings of the earth gave up their power and strength to the
Beast: Apocalypse 17.13. but at length they shall hate the whore, and shall make
her desolate and naked, and shall eat^ her flesh, and burn her with fire. v.
16. And this was it that he meant by the Parable of the Bird, namely, that
Christian Princes which had endowed the Sea of Rome with large privileges and
possessions, would in time spoil her, and leave her desolate, accordingly as
St. John foretold.

In like sort Br^dg^t, a Canonized Saint, foretold as heavy a doom to the
Papacy. She Crucisigi^ and p^rdis ani^^^ electorum (...); si^ilis (...)
Luci^^ro; (...) Pilato, immitior Judah, ab^o^minabi^ior Iudaeis. Sed^s tua
demergetur quasi lapis ponde^osas, qui non sub^^lit ^ntequam (...) novissi^um
pro^undi. Brig^t. in Revelat. (...) 1. cap. 41.
calls the Pope a Murderer of souls, the disperser and devourer of Christ's
sheep, more abbominable than the Jews, more despightfull than Judas, more
unjust than Pilat, worse than Lucifer, and that his seat should sink like a
weighty stone, alluding belike, to the fall of Babylon set forth in the
Revelation, Apocalypse 18.21. by the Parable of a Millstone cast into the Sea,
so shall Babylon be thrown down, and found no more.

Alv^rus Pelagius wrote a book of the Lamentation of the Church, wherein he
notably taxed Monastical vows; for speaking of the Monks and Cloysterers of
his Age, he says Paupertatis professores, sed haereditatum successores. Alvar.
Pelag. de planctu eccles. lib. 2. c. 54.
They professed poverty, and yet expected other men's states and inheritances.
And speaing of Priests and Votaries which had vowed chastity, he says of them
Sed hodie Cellulae nostrorum Anachoritarum Hypocritarum a mulierculis
visitantur. Id ibid. lib. 2. c. 51.
, That the Celles of Anchorites were daily visited by women; and in another
place Per plurimos annos de latere Concubinae qualibet die surgunt. l. 2. c. 27.
; Priests for many years together do arise every day from their Concubines
sides, and without going to Confession, say Mass. And again Perpaucisunt
hodie Presbyteri, maxim in Hispania, and regno Apuliae, qui cum sint publici
Concubinarij etc. Id. ibid. lib. 2. c. 7.
, There be few Priests in these days, in Spain and Apulia, which do not
openly foster Concubines. He says Def^cit hodie in Ecclesia Spi^itus
prophetiae. Id. l. 2. cap. 5.
that now adays, The Law is perished from among the Priests, and vision among
the Prophets, and that is fullfilled which is written, 1 Kings, Chap. 22. v.
22. I will go out and be a false spirit in the mouth of all his Prophets.

In this age the Church and State of England was much burdened with the order
of Franciscan Friers^ insomuch as Richard Fitz-Ralph, an Irishman, Chancelour
of Oxford, Archbishop of Armagh, and Primate of Ireland, a learned Divine, as
Trithemius says Vir in divinis scripturis eruditus. Trithem.
wrote and preached against the begging Friars.

In his Sermons at Paul's Cross in London in the year 1356. he taught In statu
[Innocentiae] nullus fuisset mendicus, ergo juxta ejus statum ^^si legis
necessitate urgente non voluit esse, nec d^buit mendicus^ unde consequitur,
quod nec unquam Christus ^uit sponte mendicus. Lex praecipit, omnimo indigens
and mendicus non erit inter vos, Deuteronomy. 15. cap. ^rmacanus sermon. 1. fact. in
vulgari apud crucem S. Pauli London. 1356.
, That Christ did not undertake any such voluntary poverty, as the Friars vow;
he held it an unchristian course to be a wilful beggar, as being condemned in
the fifteenth Chaper of Deuteronomy.

He discovered Id ibid. Sermon. 4.
the Friars hypocrisy, in that though they pretended poverty, yet they had
houses like the stately Palaces of Princes, Churches more costly than any
Cathedral Churches, more and richer ornaments than all the Princes of the
world, more and better books than all the Doctors of the world; cloisters and
walking places so sumptuous, stately and large, that men of Arms might fight
on horseback, and encounter one another with their spears in them: and their
Apparel richer than the greatest Prelates.

The contentions between Armachanus, and the Friars grew so hot, that
Armachanus went in person to Avignion Comparentibus ^am Archi^piscop^ quam
Fratribus in Avinione coram P. Innocentio sexto, An. D. 1357. Richardus public^
protul^t and legit propositiones sua^. T^ithem. verbo Rich. Archiep. Ardma^.
, where Pope Innocent the sixth kept his Residence, and there in the presence of
the Pope, and the four orders of Friars he declared his opinion, and
maintained such propositions as he had formerly held and publicly taught: the
issue was this; the Pope had such use of these Friars, and the Friars had such
store of money, Armachanus opiniones suas ^rg^ Fratre^coram summo Pontifice
diu, plures^^ sustinuit, and ipsos manif^ste ^ suis deviasse regulis multis
rationibus demonstravit. Sed t^ndem (p^o^ dolor) Clero Anglicano sibi
subtra^ente promiss^, and exub^r^^te ^ ^uria Fratium sa^i^ magn^ (...), Fratres
sua (...) ante su^ data (...). Walsing^m in Edw^rd tertio.
(as Walsingham says) that they procured favor in the Popes Court; so that
Armachanus could not prevail; though (as the same Walsingham says) He proved
the cause stoutly and manifestly against them.

To speak yet a little more of our homebred witnesses: now lived Richard de
Bury, Bishop of Durham, borne at S. Edmundsbury in Suffolk, and son to Sir
Richard Angervile Knight; he wrote Philobiblon (...) and M^. Godwin in his
(...).
, and had always in his house many Chapleines that were great Scholars; Of
which number were Thomas Bradwardine, Confessor to King Edward the third, and
consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury, but never inthronized: Richard
Fitz-Ralph, Walter Burley, and Robert Holcot the Dominican.

Bradwardine was sometime fellow of Merton Coll^dge in Oxford; and commonly
called The profound Doctor. He taught the Article of free Justification
through Faith in Christ, the principal foundation of Christian Religion. He
complains that the same had happened to him in this cause which sometime fell
out with Elias the Prophet. Behold (says he) (...) Domi^e, ^odie ^um Pel^gio
p^o libero (...) gratuit^m gratiam (...) pugnant; and ^ontra Paulum ^ugil^m
g^a^i^ (...)? -- T^tu^ (...) mundus post Pela^^^^ (...) in errorem: (...)
Domin^, and judi^^ ^^usam ^uam Tho. Bradw^^^in. Pres^t. in libr^s de (...) Dei
co^t^a Pelagium.
I speak it with grief of heart, as in old time against one Prophet of God,
there were found eight hundred and fifty Prophets of Baal: So at this day, in
this cause, how many (O Lord) do now sight with Pelagius for freewill against
thy free grace, and against Paul the spiritual Champion of grace? how many at
this day reject free grace, and only declare free will to be sufficient unto
Salvation? for the whole world almost is gone after Pelagius into error. Arise
therefore O Lord, and judge thine own cause.

Now also lived that famous Preacher Taulerus at Strasbrough in Germany;
Bellarmine tells Hunc vir^m, ut suspecti^ circa fidem co^tempsi^ Io. Eckius,
sed egragie eum defendit Ludovicus Blosius. Bellar. de scriptor Eccles.
us that Eckius ( Luthers great Antagonist) suspected Taulerus that he was not
a sound Catholic; but Jews Blosius has notably defended him; the truth is,
his judgment was reasonable clear, considering the time wherein he lived. For
instance sake; he says Religiosi^tique, ad^o fo^tem reliquerunt aqu^e vivae
(Ierem. 2.) ut in fundo suo par^^ aut nihil luminis and vitae habea^t Taul^rus.
sermon. in Ascens. Dom. Marc. ult.
, There be many, and the^ of the religious sort, that have forsaken the
fountain of living waters, and dug themselves pits, that can hold no water,
Ierem. 2.13. and these (says he) are wholly addicted to their own
I^stitutes, orders, und outward exercises; now though they perform many and
great works in appearance, yet it is not their going on procession and
pilgrimage, to procure pardons and indulgences (as they call them) it is not
all their Orizons, their knocking on their breast, their gazing on curious
pictures and images, and their bowing of the knee before them; all this (says
he) Et. licet multa isti opera grandia and apparentia perficiant, ut quod pro
Indulgentijs (ut vocant) consequendis circum^unt, quod orationi insistunt, qu^d
pectora ^un^unt, quod pulchras contemplant^r Imagines, quod genua flectunt,
quod totam per vagantur civitatem, nihil tamen horum acceptum est Deo in illis.
Quare? quod a^orem, and intentionem suam in his omnibus non a^ Deum referant,
sed contorquent ad creaturas. Idem. Dominic. 18. post Trinit. sermon. 2. Math. 22.
will not make their service acceptable to God: and why? because that in doing
this, they direct not their affections and intentions unto God, but divert them
to the Creature.

He says Mul^i sunt qui Religiosi vocantur, qui magna qu^da^ adsumant
exercitia, ve^bi gratia; ^^junia, vigil^as, orationes, ^reb^as con^essiones,
credunt namque se ob sola externa opera ^usti^icari and salvari posse, quod
utique ^ieri non potest; ^tiam cor exigit Deus. id. Sermon. in Festo de uno
aliquo Confessore, Luc, 11.
, There be many that go under the name of Religious, who take great pains in
set Fasts, wakes and vigils, orizons, and frequent shrift; and think they shall
be saved and justified by these bodily exercises; but it can not be so, for God
requires the heart. He says, (alleging the Prophet Esaias, 64.6.) that all
our righteousness is as filthy elouts; and that therefore we must not put our
trust, or repose our con^^dence in any thing that is ours, be it our words or
works, but in God.

He commends unto us Faciendum, quod mulierem Ch^nanitidem fecisse ex ^vangelio
didicimus: quid enim illa fecit? ac^essi^ ad Dominum. Id. Domini^. 2 Quadrages.

the practice of the woman of Canaan; and farther says, he knew a Virgin who
took the like course, and obtained her request; Now we know the practice of
the woman of Canaan, of whom S. Chrysostom long before him observed Chrysostom.
in dimissione Chananeae; see Cent. 5.
; that she entreated not James, nor John, nor came to Saint Peter, but
breaking through the whole company of them, said; I have no need of a
mediator, but taking repentance with me for a spokesman, I come to the
fountain it self.

By that which has been said, we see what Taulerus thought touching humane
traditions, man's merits, and Saintly invocation.

In this age also lived Gregorius Ariminensis, whom Vega styles V^lent ille
Gregor. Ariminensis, maximus and studiosissimus Divi Augustini propugnator.
Vega in Opus^. de Iusti^icat. quaest, 6.
, The most able and careful defender of St. Augustine. This learned
Schoole-man in his book upon the Sentences has diligently confuted diverse
tenets which are now holden by the Church of Rome touching Predestination,
Original sin, Free Will, the merit of works, and other points.

PAP.
You have produced diverse witnesses; but Mr. Briereley excepteth against them
Pro^. Apology in the Authors advertisement in margin.
; and namely against Nilus, as erroneous touching the proceeding of the holy
Ghost, as also a professed adversary to the Roman Church; insomuch as his book
is put in the Catalogue of books forbidden Nilus Thessalon. contra Pap^ Prim.
al^as Illyrico suppositus, po^itur i^ter libr^s prohibit^s, in (...) lib.
prohib. ^ussu Council. Trid. Hanov. 1611.
. And as for John de Rupe scissa, William of St. Amor, Petrus Blesensis,
Ockam, and Scotus, they were such as only reprooved the life and manners of
the Clergy Prot. Apol. tract. 2. cap. 2 sect. 2. page 328.
.

PROT.
If you bar Nilus from witnessing on our behalf, because he erred in the
point mentioned, by the like reason may we challenge Damascen, whom you usually
produce on your behalf, as also others of the Greek Church.

Neither can you disable his testimony, because he wrote against the Popes
primacy and purgatory; he had no personal quarrel with the Bishop of Rome
(for ought we know) he might give his judgment on these points, and be
unpartiall: if the Pope forbad his book, there be other good men that approove
it, and that for the proofs and reasons which he brings.

Touching the other exception; for the preventing ^hereof, I have purposely
given instance in this Catalogue in points of faith, and sparingly alleged
such as only taxed Romish corruptions in life and manners; which yet is
oft-times accompanied with error in judgment; for as Ockam says Mali m^res
excae^ant intellectum, and ita qui potest peccare, potest incidere in errorem
etiam contra fidem. Ockam Dialog. part. 1. lib. 5 cap. 26.
; Because evil manners blind the judgment, therefore every assembly which may
err notoriously in manners, may err against the Faith. Besides, William of
St. Amor (as has been said) opposed their Monkish vows, which is a
Doctrinal point; Ockam opposed the Popes supremacy, which is a Dogmaticall
point; Peter of Bloix, and John de Rupe-scissa, held the Pope to be Antichrist,
and Ockam and Scotus held with us in diverse doctrinall points.

And now having cleared this coast, I come to speak of our countryman John
Wickliffe; he was borne in the North, where there is (near to the place where
I live) an ancient and worshipful house, bearing the name of Wickliffe of
Wickliffe: He flourished about the year 1371. was Fellow of Merton-colledge,
Master of Balioll-colledge in Oxford, where he commenced Doctor, and was
chosen Reader in Divinity. In his public Lectures at Oxford he showed
himself a learned Schoole-man, in his ordinary Sermons a faithful Pastor of
the Church, for whose use and benefit he translated the whole Bible into the
vulgar tongue; one Copy whereof written with his own hand, is extant in St.
John Baptist College in Oxford. In his writings he spoke and taught against
the then corrupred doctrine of the Church of Rome, and specially against the
order of the begging Friars, exhibiting a complaint to the King and Parliament
against the Orders of Friars; which thing created him the hatred of diverse
Prelates, but many good men favored him.

PAP.
Were there many that took part with Wickliffe, and followed his doctrine? and
were those of the better rank, or only some mean persons?

PROT.
He was highly favored of the Nobility, the City of London, and the University
of Oxford. He was publicly borne out (as Parsons confesses Three Convers.
of England, part 1. chapter 10. n^. 36.
) by John of Gant, and Lord Henry Percy, the one of them Duke of Lancaster, the
other Marshall of England: And Walsingham says De Curia Principissae Ioannae
Ludovicus Clifford pompose vetans ne praesum^r^nt aliquid contra ipsum
sententialiter definire -- timore con^^^^^ sunt. Walsingam i^ Rich. 2. p. 205.
, That when Wickliffe personally appeared before the Prelates, who purposed to
put the Popes Mandate in execution, Lewis Clifford came with a Prohibition from
the Queen, charging them not to give sentence against him; whereupon they were
sore frighted, and desisted.

In like sort, another time he escaped their hands, by the means of the
Citizens, Burgesses, and Commons of London, as the same Walsingham says Non
dic^ (...) tant^m Londinenses, sed ^^l^^ ipsius (...) si impudent^r ing^rere

; and indeed the Londoners favored him so much, that in all likelihood it
stayed the Prelates from farther proceeding against him. But that which
Walsingham most admires, is this; that Wickliffes opinions were not only
entertained in Cities and Towns, but even in the University of Oxford it
self, where was (as he says Ox^n^^^se (...) (...) gen^rale quae ^^

) the very height and top of wisdom and learning. Neither did some young
Students only follow him, but even the chief of the University, Master Robert
Rigge Vice Chancellor, and the two Proctors took part with him; as also
Nicholas Herford, John Ashton of M^rton-Colledge, John Ashwarby of
Oriel-Colledge, Pastor of St. Mary's Church; these being preachers, and
Bachelours of Divinity joined with him, and were questioned on that behalf.

Cleri. Id. ibid. page 286.
, that when the Archbishop of Canterbury had sent Wickliffes condemnation to
Robert Rigge, Chancellor of the University of Oxford, to be divulged, he
appointed them to preach that day, whom he knew to be most zealous followers
of Wickliffe; and among others, he ordained one Philip Repington, a Chanon of
Leycester, to preach on Corpus Christi day, who concluded his Sermon with these
words; for speculative doctrine (says he) such as the point of the Sacrament
of the Altar is, I will set a bar on my lips, while God has otherwise
instructed or illuminated the hearts of the Clergy. And afterward, when
Bulls came thick from Rome, from the two Gregory's the eleventh and twelfth,
against Wickliffe and his doctrine; the whole University gave a testimony in
favor of him, under their seal, in their Congregation house in these words
among others John Stowes Annals in Richard the second. An. 1406. October. 5.
. God forbid that our Prelates should have condemned a man of such honesty for
an Heretic: but there is nothing that may more amply testify the spreading
of his Doctrine, than an Act of Parliament in the days of King Richard the
second, where it is related Statute Anno quinto Rich. 2. cap. 5.
, that there were diverse, preaching daily, not only in Churches and
Churchyards, but also in Markets, Faires, and other open places, where a great
congregation of people is, diverse Sermons containing heresies, and notorious
errors for so they pleased to style it in those days.

PAP.
Was Wickliffes doctrine followed after his death?

PROT.
That which Wickliffe taught, was neither borne with him, nor died with him;
indeed if either the strength or policy of man could have made it away, it had
not continued as it does, to this day; for in the year 1378. Pope Gregory the
eleventh directed his Bull to the University of Oxford against the doctrine and
Articles of that learned man; even Rome it self ringing of his opinions in
that University; and Walsingam says Diu in pendul^ harebant utrum papal^m
Bullam deberent cum honor recipere, vel omnino cum deed core ^efutare. Th.
Walsing. in Rich. 2. p. 200.
, that the Pope taxed the Heads of the University for the slight care they
took in the suppressing of Wickliffes doctrine; and the same Walsingham
complains, that those of the University were long time in suspense, whether
they should receive the Popes Bull with honor, or reje^t it with reproach.
Afterward Gregory the twelfth directed another Bull to Oxford against
Wickliffe. Thomas Arundell Archbishop of Canterbury, held a Council at Oxford,
and procured a visitation and sharp Inquisition against the Heads of
Colleges, Halls, and others suspected of Wicklevisme, or Lollardy: and this
Constitution is to be seen in Linwood Constitut. Pr^vincial. Angli^ in Gul.
Linwood. lib. 5. cap de Magistris. Quia in super; and lib. 5. cap. de H^eret

after his death and burial; and this mandate of the Popes was executed by
Richard Flemming Bishop of Lincoln, as Linwood testifies, who lived at the
time when this was done, to wit, in the year 1428. and thus was the canonical
censure passed upon Wickliffe, and his adherents; now the secular power joined
with them; for in the days of King Henry the fourth and fifth, there was made
the Statute de Haeretico comburendo Statute an. 2. Henrie^ q^inti. cap. 7.
against Her^sie and Lollard^y. and an. ^. Henr. 4. cap. 15^
, whereby the Wicklevists and Lollards were adjudged to be burned.

After this King Edward the fourth sent mandatory letters to the Governors in
Oxford, to make search for Wickliffes books, and to burn them; and
accordingly the Masters and Doctors did: Here is now both his bones and his
books burnt; they thought (belike) to make sure work, and never to hear more
of the man again: but so it was, that out of his ashes, as it were, there
arose another Phoenix and generation of Wicklevists which renewed his memory and
doctrine; belike then there were many that followed his Doctrine; or else why
made they so much ado? what needed so many Statutes, Letters, and
Proclamations? so many Bulls, Councels, and Constitutions? Indeed there were
many in Oxford, and elsewhere, and them of good note, who embraced Wickliffes
opinions after his decease, as namely Mr. Foxes Church-story, vol. 1. in Rich.
2. page 475. etc.
, Lawrence Redman, master of Arts, David Sawtree, a Divine, William Jones,
Thomas Brightwell, William Haulam a Civilian, Raphe Greenhurst Fellow of
New-colledge, as also one Walter Brute a Layman, mentioned by one William
Wideford, a great Papist; this Wideford writing against Wickliffe, mentions Vt
alia^ declaravi in Epistola missa Domino Ersordensi contralibrum Waltheri

expetend. and sugiend. page 110.
a book of his own, sent to the Bishop of Hereford, in confutation of the
book of Walter Brute.

In a word, Wickliffes doctrine was not contained within England only, but it
gave light to other countries also; insomuch as one Peter Pain Petrus Pain
Anglus de Civili dominio Clericorum per tres desd^sseruit. id. ibid. page 157.
, who was Wickliffes Scholar; and was sent with other Legates to the Council
at Basil, went into Bohemia, whither he carried with him some of Wickliffes
books, some part where of John Huss^ translated into his mothers tongue, as
Cochleus says Petrus Pain Anglus, discipu^us Wiclephi. Pragam cum libris

how one of the Bishops wrote to him out of England, that he had two Volumes of
Wickliffes, which were almost as large as Saint Austins works.

PAP.
What taught Wickliffe? taught he as you do?

PROT.
He taught the same in substance, that we do; as may appear by a Treatise
Wickless Conformity to the Church of England by Tho. Iam^^.
of Wickliffes Conformity with the now Church of England both in doctrine and
discipline. Besides, we may take a taste of his Tenets out of his Treatise
against the orders of Friars, wherein he says as follows.

First John Wickliffs Treatise against the orders of Friars. cap. 1. and 18.
Friars seyen, that their Religion founden on sinful men, is more perfect than
that Religion or order, which Christ himself made.

Friars pursuen true Priests, and letten them to preach the Gospel Cap. 12.
and 36. ibid.
. They pursuen Priests, for they reproven their sins, as God bids; both to
burn them, and the Gospel of christ written in English, to most learning of
our nation.

Friars send out Idiots full of covetise to preach, not the Gospel; but
Chronicles, fables, and leasings, to please the people, and to rob them Cap. 13.
.

Friars Cap. 15.
by letters of Fraternity deceiven the people in Faith, robben them of
temporal goods, and maken the people to trust more in dead parchment, sealed
with leasings, and in vain prayers of Hypocrites, than in the help of God.

Friars Cap. 16.
perverten the right faith of the Sacrament of the Auter, and bringen a new
heresy, they say it is an Accident withouten subje^t; which heresy came never
into the Church till the foul feende Satanas was unbounden after a thousand
years.

Friars Cap. 19.
being made Bishops, robben men by extortion, as in punishing of sin for
money, and suffren men to lie in sin, getten of Antichrist false exemption.

Friars Cap. 20.
teachen Lords, and namely Ladies, that if they dyen in Francis habit, they
shall never come in hell, for the virtue thereof.

Men sayen, the Friars be not liegemen to the King Cap. 23.
, ne subject to his laws. For though they stealen men's Children, (to enter
into their orders) it is said there goes no law upon them.

Friars Cap. 27.
saien apertly, that if the King and Lords, and other men stonden thus against
their begging, and other things; Friars will go out of the land, and come
again with bright heads: and look whether this be treason or no?

Friart Wickliffes complaint to the King and Parliament. The 2 Article.
faynen, that though an Abbot and all his Covent ben open traitors, yet the
king may not take from them an half penny.

Friars Cap. 34. ibid.
also destroyen the Article of Christian faith, I belief a common or general
Church: for they teachen that the men that shall be damned, be members of holy
Church, and thus they wedden Christ and the devil together.

Friars Cap. 44.
by hypocrisy binden men to impossible things that they may not do, for they
binden them over the commandments of God, as they themselves say.

Friars Cap. 24.
wast the treasure of the land, forgetting Dispensations, vain pardons, and
privileges.

But of the pardon that men usen to day fro the Court of Rome z, they have no
sikernes (that is, certainty) by holy writ, ne reason, ne ensample of Christ,
or his Apostles.

By this we see that Wickliffe stoutly opposed those Innovatours the Friars,
who (like their successors the Jesuits) taught and practiced obedience to
another Sovereign than the King; persecution for preaching the Gospel;
exemption of Clea^gy-men; the use of Legends in the Church, and reading of
fables to the people; pardons and indulgences; the heresy of an accident
without a subject; singular and blind obedience; and lastly, works of
Supererogation.

Now whereas Wickliffe was reputed an Heretic, it is likely that this
imputation was laid upon him especially by Friars, to whose innovations he was
a professed enemy.

PAP.
Many exceptions are taken against Wickliffe, and namely, that he held Wicle^^
Articulus sextus in Concilio Cons^antiensi dam^atus sess. 8. Deus debet obedir^
diabolo. Bellarm. i^ praefat. controversiar. Harding in Apologia Iuelli part.
1. chap. 2. divis. 1.
; That God ought to obey the devil.

PROT.
Our learned Antiquary of Oxford, Doctor James, has made Wickliffes Apology,
and answered such slanderous objections as are urged by Parsons, the Apologists
and others.

Now for the objection made, there is neither color nor savor of truth in it;
there was no such thing objected to him in the Convocation at Lambeth; neither
can his adversaries show any such words out of any book written by Wickliffe,
although he wrote very many. Indeed we find the quite contrary in his works,
says his Apologist; for Wickliffe says Commentar. in Psalm. p. 112 ^este T.
Iamesio in Wicklif^es conformity.
, That the devil is clepid (that is, called) Gods Angel, for he may do
nothing but at Gods suffering; and that he serves God in tormenting of sinful
men. The phrase indeed is strange, and if either he, or any of his Scholars
used such speeches, their meaning (happily) was, that God not in his own person,
but in his creatures yields obedience to the devil; that is, sometimes
gives him power over his creatures.

PAP.
Wickliffe taught Rhemist. annot. in 1 Peter 2. sect. 8. and Parsons three
convers. third part. chap. 3.
, That Magistrates and Masters are not to be obeyed by their subjects and
servants, so long as they are in deadly sin.

PROT.
Even as light House-wives lay their bastards at honest men's doors, so you
falsely father this ^is-begotten opinion on Wickliffe, which some of your own
side say Alphonsus a Castro advers. ^ares. lib. 14. tit. Tyrannus. Gerson prima
part contra Assertiones Ioannis Parvi^ fol. 81.
, belongs to one John Parvi, a Doctor of Sorbone. And indeed in right it is
your own, inasmuch as you, upon color and pretense of heresy in Princes,
absolve subjects from their Allegiance A Bull granted by Pope Pius the fifth to
D. ^^^rding for absolving the Queens Subjects.
, and raise them up in arms against their lawful Sovereign; witness your
bloody massacres in France, the death of the two last Henryes in France; the
untimely death of the Prince of Orange; the many attempts and treasons against
Queen Elizabeth; as also that hellish design of the Gunpowder treason.

But supppose Wickliffe said so, yet his words might have a tolerable
construction; to wit, that a Prince being in state of mortal sin, ceased to
be a Prince any longer; he ceased to be so in respect of any spiritual right
or title to his place, that he could plead with God, if he were pleased to
take the advantage of the forfeiture; but that in respect of men, he had a good
title still in the course of mundane justice; so that whosoever should lift up
his hand against him, offered him wrong D. Field of the Church-booke, 5. chap.
45. in fine. -- Wickliffe thought that godless persons, howsoever Officio in
office and place, they be Kings and Bishops; yet merito, that is in me^it, they
are neither, because they are unworthy to be either. D. Field in Append. 2.
part. p 86.
.

Wickliffe indeed admonishes the King, and all other inferior Officers and
Magistrates, as elsewhere he does Bishops; That he bears not the sword in
vain, but to do the office of a King, well and truly to see his Laws
(rightly) executed, wherein if he fail, then he tells him, that he is not
properly and truly a King, that is, in effect Perdens nomen officij and
ordinis in effectu. lo. Wicleu. de verit. script. 513.
and operation; which words are spoken by way of exhortation: but so far was
he from mutiny himself, or persuading others to rebellion, that never any man
of his rank, for the times wherein he lived, did more stoutly maintain the
Kings Supremacy in all causes, as well as over all persons ecclesiastical and
civil, against all usurped and foreign Jurisdiction, and one of his reasons
was this, that otherwise he should not be King over all England, but Regulus
parvae partis Id. de fundam. leg. Angl. cap. 36.
, a petty governor of some small parts of the Realm.

PAP.
Wickliffe taught Brereleyes Pr^t. Apolog. tract. 2. cap. 2. sect. 4.
, that so long as a man is in deadly sin, he is no Bishop, nor Prelate,
neither does he consecrate, or baptize.

PROT.
If Wickliffe said so, he said no more than the Fathers, and a Council said
before him. Saint Ambrose says N^msi aliter esse cupis, Epis^opus esse non
potes; nisi si^ irr^prehensibili^, 1. Tim. 3. Ambros. de dignit. Sacerdot. c.
4. tom. 4.
, Unless thou embrace and follow the good-worke of a Bishop, a Bishop thou
can not be. The Provincial Council says Quicunque sub ordinat^one
Presbyterij, vel Episcopatus mortali crimine se dixerint esse pollutos, a
supradictis o^dinationibus submovend^s c^nsuimus. Council. Valentinum sub
Damaso. cap. 4.
, Whosoever after the order of Bishop or Priesthood shall say, they have been
defiled with mortal sin, let them be remooved from the foresaid orders.

The truth is, Wickliffe lived in a very corrupt time, and this made him so
sharply inveigh against the abuses of the Clergy; but abusus non tollit rei
usum; and yet Wickliffe writes Lib. Miscel. page 260. Wiclev. i^ Ms.
against them that will not honor their Prelates. And he elsewhere expresses
his own meaning, that Nomen non facit Episcopum sed vita. De v^rit. Scrip. p.
443.
it is not the name, but the life that makes a Bishop; that Quicunque nomine
tenus Sacerdos, vel Episcopus qui non compensat illi nomini ipsius^ nomini^
ration^m, non est vere Episcopus vel Sacerdos. ib. page 443.
, if a man have the name of a Prelate, and do not answer the reason thereof
in sincerity of doctrine, and integrity of life; but live scandalously and in
mortal sin, that he is but a nomine-tenus Sacerdos, a Bishop or Priest in
name, not in truth: Nevertheless his ministerial Act may be availeable, for
thus says Wickliffe Nisi Christianus ^u^rit Christo ^nitus per g^atiam, non
habet Christum Salvatorem, nec sine falsitate dicit verba Sacrament^lia; licet
pro^int capacibus: Oportet enim Sacerdotem con^cientem esse memb^um Christi, ^t
u^ Sancti loquuntur, quodammodo ipsum Christum. de verit. Script. page 138.
, Unless the Christian Priest be united unto Christ by grace, Christ cannot be
his Savior; nec sine falsitate ^icit verba sacramentalia, Neither can he
speak the Sacramental words without lying, licet prosint capacibus, Though
the worthy receiver be hereby nothing hindered from grace.

PAP.
Wickliffe held Parsons and Brerely. loccitat.
, that it was not lawful for any Ecclesiastical persons to have any temporal
possessions, or property in any thing, but should beg.

PROT.
This imputation is untrue; for what were the lands and goods of Bishops,
Cathedral Churches, or otherwise belonging to Religious houses, which were
given Deo and Ecclesi^, were they not temporal possessions? and yet are
rightfully held, according to Wickliff^s tenure by Ecclesiastical Ministers;
and long might they and peaceably enjoy them for him, in as ample manner as
ever they did, so long as they were well employed according to the will and
purpose of the Donours, willing nothing contrary to Gods Word.

But for the lands belonging to so many Chaunteries, Abbeyes, Friaries,
Priories, Monasteries, and other religious houses, he was of opinion (...)
malum foret ^t expropriata f^rent omni^ temporalia quibus Ecclesi^ Anglicana
est dotat^. De verit. Script. p. 465.
, that Kings might dispossess them of them, and give them genti facienti
justitiam, to good and godly uses.

Concerning the other part of the objection; Wickliffe indeed commends a kind
of Evangelicall poverty, and withal alleges Wicklif^es Complaint to the
Parliam. page 13.
that of Saint Paul to Timothy, That we are to be apaid, that is, contented, if
we have lifelode, that is, living, and to be hiled, that is, covered withal,
to wit, with food and raiment; nevertheless he did not debar Ministers from
actual having, but from affecting the things of the world, which were to be
renounced per cogitationem and affectum Vt Cleric^ ^int pauperes in facto, vel
i^ ani^o, vel utrinque, and ^mnino quod cov^a^^ ab ^^ariti^ and fostu seculi.
De ver. Scrip. p. 570
, in mind and affection, as he says.

Lastly, touching begging, he was so far from joining himself to the begging
^ri^r^, and their order, that he wrote a set Treatise against their order, as
also he put up a petition to the Parliament against them. Parsons three.
Convers. part. chap. 10. number 37.


PAP.
Wickliffe and his disciples went barefooted, and basely clothed in course
russet garments down to the heels,

PROT.
Wickliffe went well apparrelled, and kept a good table of that which was his
own; insomuch as he professes Inter alia peccata de quibu^ timeo, hoc est
unum prae^^puum, quod consumendo in excessivo victu et vestitu, bona pa^perum,
deficio^ De ver^t. Scrip. page 192.
, that He fears not any thing will be so much laid to his charge, as that
he spends that in good fare and apparel, which might be bestowed on the
poor.

damnat. in Council. Constant.
, that tithes were mere Alms, and that for the lewdness of the Priests, the
parishioners might detayne their tithes at at their pleasure.

PROT.
Wickliffe lived in a time wherein he saw tithes, oblations, and the Churches
revenues spent in riot and luxury, the cure of souls neglected, and the poor
unreleived; and seeing this great abuse of tithes, he let some inconsiderate
speeches fall touching tithes: so that whereas he seems to be against
tithes, it is to be understood against tithes, as then they were abused by
Friars; for Friars then had power from the Pope to appropriate tithes to their
Covents, by which means tithes came into their possession. This thing
Wickliffe thought unlawful, and would have had tithes reduced to their ancient
use again.

Besides, Wickliffe would nether have tithes taken from the Church, nor yet
from the Incumbent but in some cases: not from the Church, for his rule was

others also Posi^^, quod sit not^rio crimine irreti^us. Ibid. page 413
, unless the fact were v^ry ^candal^us and notorious; and thereof he would
^ot have the people, but the Prelates and superiors to judge and censure: And in
case the party delinquent be either so vicious a man of life or doctrine, as
that there is no hope of his amendment, or else has committed some such fact
as wilful murder or Treason, whereby he is ipso facto depriveable in law, the
tithes are not to be quite taken away from Auserre a Clerico bona fortun^e est

gives instance in Elies sons Wickliffes complaint to the Parliament. page 12.

Wickliffe taught Prot. Apol. tract. ^. cap. 2. sect. 4.

PRO^.
Wickliffe tells us Deus nemini promitti^ paenam vel praemium, nis^ sub
condition tacita vel expressa De verit. Scrip. p. 383.
, that Gods promises and threatenings are conditional; and that as God has
appointed the end, so he has appointed the means of our salvation; but
notwithstanding he grants such a necessity, yet he adds In exposit. Decalogi.

therein he plainly shows the contrary; condemning equivocall propositions

And elsewhere he says Wickliffes Complaint. p. 55.

appears that Wickliffe was no usual dissemb^er of his faith, as Mr. Brerely
would have it.

PAP.
Wickliffe Brereley loc. citat^.
inveied against the Church, for that he had been deprived by the Archbishop
of Canterbury, from a certain Benefice.

PROT.
Because he was deprived of his Benefice, he wrote against the Church; by the
like reason, because he was preferred to another Benefice in Leichestershire
where h^ dyed; therefore he should not have inveighed against the Church. But I
should think that the great John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, might have
helped him to a small head-ship of Canterbury College in Oxford. For Pars^ns
confesses Three Convers. part. 1. c. ^0. n^. 36.
that Wickliffe was in great favor with the Duke, and publicly borne out by
him; and the Duke (as the same Parsons says Ibid. part. 3. cap. 5. number. 11
) Governed all in the later days of his Father King Edward the third, and was
also in good favor with his Nephew King Richard the second, all the time that
Wickliffe lived; so that in all likelihood he might have helped him to the
Bishopric of Worcester.

Besides, if Wickliffe (as Parsons says Ibid. part. 3. cap. 5. ^^. 14.
) contemned all temporal goods, and adjoined himself to the begging Friars;
what made him then affect the Bishopric of Worcester?

Well, but the missing of these places provoked him to inveigh against the
Church; so was Jerome provoked by the Clergy of Rome, and this sharpened his
style against them Cum in Babylone ver s^rer, and pu^pur^ta meretrici^ colo^^^
essem -- and ec^e Pharisae^rum c^^c^^^avit Senatus. Hieron. ad Pa^linam. in
lib. Dydim^ de Spir^ Sancto^ praef^t.
; and yet are not Saint Hi^romes works any whit the more misliked.

Lastly, he inveighed not against the Church; for he protests that he did as
near as he could both write and speak, and do all things, ad Honorem Dei
and utilitatem Ecclesiae De verit. Script. p. 145. and 15.
, for the glory of God, and the benefit of his Church.

The occasion of Wickliffes discontent I find to be this Godwins Catalogue of
the Bishop^ of England.
Simon Langham, Archbishop of Canterbury, sequestered the fruits of the
Benefice of Pagham from Canterbury College; and withal molested the Scholars
there, intending to displace them all, and to put in Monks, which in the end
he brought to pass. Now Wickliffe was one of them that were thus displaced,
having withstood the Archbishop in this business with might and maine; but by
the Popes favor, and the Archbishops power, the Monks overbore Wickliffe and
his fellows,

PAP.
You have spoken enough of Wickliffe, and his Disciples; what were those
Lollards you mentioned?

PRO^.
They were a company of true and godly professors; ^ome have conceited them to
have been called Lollards of Lollium, cockle or darnell, and so says the
gloss in Linwood Linw^od sup^ provincial. Constit. Angl. lib. 5. ^ap. de
Haeret. Finaliter. Glossa in verbo Lollardi^, sic dicta a Lollio. quia s^^ut
Lollium inficit s^getes, ^ic Lollardi.
; as also in the Squires prologue in Chaucer.

I smell a Loller in the w^nde (quoth he) abides for Gods digne passion, for
me shall have a predication, this Loller here will preach us s^mewhat -- here
shall he not preach, here shall he no Gospel gloss, ne teach; he believes
all in the great God (qu^th he) he would sown some difficulty, or spring
cockle in our clear corn. But they were called Lollards from one Raynard
Lollard, History of the Wal^enses. book 2. chapter 11.
who at the first was a Franciscan Monk, and an enemy to the Waldenses, but
yet a man carried with a sanctified desire to find the way of salvation. He
afterward taught the doctrine of the Waldenses, was apprehended in Germany by
the Monks Inquisitours, and being delivered to the secular power, was burnt at
Cologne. He wrote a Commentary upon the Apocalypse, wherein he applied many
things to the Pope as to the Roman Antichrist. This was he of whom the
faithful in England were called Lollards; where he taught, witness that Tower
in London which at this present is called by his name Lollards Tower, where the
faithful that profe^sed his religion were imprisoned.

Boccace, Saint Vincent of Valence; of the order of preaching Friars; Io^chim
Abbot of Ga^abria; to them he adjoyneth the Friar R^ynard Lollard. And so I
proceed to the several points in question.

Of the Scriptures suffici^n^y and Canon.
Wickliffe says De verit. S^ript. page ^5 l^b. de 7. p^^^^t. mo^tal. page 40.
-- Scriptura s^c^ndu^ sensum suum s^cr^m (...) pr^ qua^^m scien^^^ ne^^ssari^
(...) de ver. S^rip. page ^6^
, that Christ's law suffices by it self to rule Christ's Church; that a
Christian (...) well under^tanding it, may thence gather sufficient knowledge
during his pilgrimag^ h^re on earth. Lyra upon those words in the Gospel, They
have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them, Luke 16.29. makes this
inference H^bent Mosen qu^ docuit moralia and agenda; and ^r^p^^^as qui
doc^er^nt mystica and credenda; et ista suffic^unt ad salutem; and ideo
sequitur. audiant il^os. Lyra (...) Lucae cap. 16. ver. 29.
, Moses he taught mor^lity, and what was our duty to do; the Prophets taught
mysteries, and what we are to believe; Et ista sufficient ad salutem, and these
are sufficient for our salvation; and therefore it follows, Hear them: so
that he reduces all to two heads; the Agenda, or practical part^ and the
Credenda, or Articles of the Creed, and these essential necessaries contained
in the Scriptures, he makes sufficient to salvation.

Amongst the sundry opinions which Ockam reckons up, this is one, says Ockam
Illae solae ^eritates sunt Catholicae repu^ande. and de necessitate s^lu^is
credende^ quae in Canone Bibliae explicit vel implicit^ asseruntur. Itaque si
a^ique veritatos in Biblia sub ^o^ma propria mini^e contmentur, ex solis tamen
contentis in ^a consequentia necessaria and ^ormali possunt inferri; sunt in^er
Catholica^ connumerand^. Ockam Dialog. part. 1. lib. 2. cap. 10.
, That only those verities are to be esteemed Catholic, and such as are
necessarily to be believed for the attaining of salvation, which either
expressly are delivered in ^cripture, or by necessary consequence may be
inferred from things so expressed.

Richard Fitz-Raphe, Archbishop of Armagh, and Primate of Ireland, says, It is
defined in general Councels, that there are two and twenty Authentical books
of the Old Testament. Concilijs Generalibus definiunt viginti duos libros
veteris Testamenti esse authenticos. Armacha^ in Quastionib. Armenorum, lib.
19. ca^. 19.
Nicholas Lyra the converted Jew, is plentiful in this argument; Now that I
have by Gods help Postquam anxiliante Deo scripsi super libr^s Sa^rae
Scripture Canonicos, super alios intendo scribere qui no^ sunt de Canone,
scilicet^ L^ber Sapientiae, Ecclesiasticus, Judith, Tobias, and libr^
Maccabaeorum; recepti sun^ ab Ecclesia, ut ad morum informationem in ^a
legantu^, ^amen eorum authoritas ad probandum e^ quae in contentionem veniunt
minus idonea reputatur. Lyra praefat. exposit. in Tob^am.
(says he) written upon the Canonical books of holy Scripture, beginning at
Genesis, and so going on to the end; trusting to the help of the same God, I
intend to write upon those other books that are not Canonical, such as are
the book of Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Judith, Tobias, and the books of
Macchabes; and withal adds, that it is to be considered, that these books
which are not Canonical, are received by the Church, and read in the same for
the information of manners; yet is their authority thought to be weak to prove
things that are in controversy. And the same Lyra writing upon the first of
Esdras, the first Chapter, says, That though the books of Tobias, Judith, and
the Maccabes be Historical books, yet he intends for the present to pass
by them, and not to comment on them, and he gives his reason; namely, quia non
sunt de Canone apud Iudaeos, nec apud Christianos, because they are not in the
Canon, neither with the Jews, nor with the Christians.

Wickliffe also held S^tis est pro su^ militia ^abere 22. libr^s de veteri
Testamento -- Authentic^s. Wickli^^e de ver. Scrip. p. 110.
, that there are but two and twenty Authentical books of the Old Testament.

Of Communion under both kinds; and number of Sacraments.
THe custom of communicating in both kinds, was not abolished in the beginning
of this Age, but was retained in certain places, especially in Monasteries,
until the year of our Lord thirteen hundred and more. Thus writes Cassander
In utraque spec^e Communio (...) locis, prasertim (...) Mon^sterijs ret^nt^
^st, idque usque ad annum amplius mill ^imum trecentesimum. Cas^ander Consult.
Art. 22.

Matrimony to be a Sacrament properly so named, and of the same nature with the
rest, or to give grace.

Robert Holcot our countryman, denied Ho^cot^ (apud Petrum de Aliaco in
qu^rtum) negat Confirmationem esse proprie Sacramentum. Cassand. Co^sult. art.

that Confirmation was from Christ's Institution; now Bellarmine says
Sacramentorum a^t^orem solum Christum esse. Bella^. l. 1. de Sacram. cap. 23.
, that Christ only can institute a Sacrament Alphonsus de Castro advers.
Hares. lib. 14. tit. unct. extrem.
, Alphonsus a Castro tells us, and that from the testimony of Iodocus
Clichtoveus, and Thomas Walden, (a bitter adversary of Wickliffes) that
Wickliffe held extreme unction, or annealing, was not a Sacrament.

Of the Eucharist.
Ockam says Occam Cent^log. conclus. 39
, There are three opinions of Transubstantiation, of which the first supposes
a conversion of the Sacramental Elements; the second, an annihilation; the
third affirms the bread to be in such sort transubstantiated into the body of
Christ, that it is no way changed in substance, or substantially converted into
Christ's body, or does cease to be, but only that the body of Christ in every
part of it, becomes present in every part of the bread. This opinion he says,
the Master of Sentences mentions, not much disliking it; yet it is not
commonly holden.

Their own Proctours and Canonists, Hostiensis and Gaufridus tell us
Hostiensis etiam and Gaufridus, and Berengarius sup. Decret^l. firmiter
credimus; et cum Martha e^^e quod pa^is substantiam remanere dicunt; imo potius
referunt ad Confessionem Berengarij, quae fuit per Concilium approbata Durand.
in 4. Sent. did. 10 q. 1. nu. 13
, that there were diverse in those days, who taught, that the substance of
bread did remain; and this opinion, say they, was not to be rejected.

Durand was of opinion Durand. 4. di^^. ^ ^. qu^ 1.
, That the material part of the consecrated bread was not converted; insomuch
that Bellarmine professes Bellarm. l. 3. de Euc^ar^ c. 13. sententia Durandi
haeretica est, licet ipse non sit dicendus haereticus, cum pa^atus fuerit
Ecclesiae judicio acquiescere.
, that saying of Durand is heretical, although he is no heretic, because he
is ready to submit to the judgment of the Church.

Wickliffe says Wickliffe against the orders of Friars. cap. 16.
, that Friars perverten the right faith of the Sacrament of the Auter, and
bringen in a new heresy of an Accident withouten subject; and whence Holy writ
says openly, that this Sacrament is bread that we breaken, and Gods body;
they sayen, that it is another bread nor Gods body, but accident withouten
subject, and naught; and thus they leaven holy writ, and taken new heresy on
Christ and his Apostles, and on Austin, Ierom, Ambrose, Isidore, and other
Saints, and the Court of Rome, and all true Christian men, that holden the
faith of the Gospel. Now for his own opinion, he expresses it in these
terms Iste panis est been, ver^, e^ realiter, spiritualiter, virtualiter, and
sacramentaliter corpus Christi. Wickliff. Confessio de Sacram. Eucharist. page
58.
, that the body of Christ was really and truly in the Sacrament, in his kind,
that is, Sacramentaliter, and figuraliter by way of Sacrament, and
figuratively; to wit Sicut Johannes Baptista figuraliter fuit Elias, and non
personaliter. Art. 4. in Sy^od. Constant. damnatus.
; as Saint John Baptist figuratively was Helias, and not personally. So he
says Est verus panis naturaliter, and corpus Christi figuraliter, Art. 49.
Oxon. damnatus.
of the consecrated host, that it was Christ's body in figure, and true bread
in nature; or which is all one, true bread naturally, and Christ's body
figuratively. And Wickliffe is very confident in his opinion; for he says
Confess. de Sacram. Anglice page 64.
, that the third part of the Clergy of England, would be ready to defend the
same upon pain of losing of their lives, cum non fuerit materia martyrij plus
laudanda, there being no better cause of Martyrdom.

Of Images and Prayer to Saints.
TO speak properly (says Durand) a the same reverence and respect which is
due unto the Samplar, or person represented, is not to be given to the Image,
sign, or Representee, neither ought the imag^ to be adored with Latria, (or
divine worship) for any reference or relation it has to the thing represented
thereby. Holcot also a principal Schooleman, says Nulla adoratio debetur
Imagini; nec licet aliquam Imaginem adorare. Holcot. in lib. Sapient. cap. 13.
lect. 158 p. 524.
; No adoration is due to an Image, neither is it lawful to worship any image;
and his reason is this; Latria, or divine worship, is due only unto God. But
the image of God is not God, therefore Latria, or divine worship is not due
unto an Image: Otherwise (says he) The Creator and the creature should both be
adored with one honor. By this we see the Tenet of Thomas Aquinas controlled,
who taught Thom. Sum. part. 3. quaest. 25. artic. 3.
, that the Crucifixe and Image of Christ was to be worshipped and adored with
the selfsame honor, to wit, of Latria, that Christ Jesus himself was to be
honored with.

Durand also held Fa^ere Imagines ad r^praesentandum D^um Pa^^em, and Spiritum
s^nctum, aut v^nerari ^^s imagines ^atuum est. Vnde Damascenus dicit, qu^d
insipientiae summae est, and im^ietatis figu^are quod est d^vinum^ Durand. in
3. Sent. did. 9. qu. 2. number. 15.
, that it was utterly unlawful to picture or represent the Trinity, or God,
otherwise than as in Christ he took our flesh, and was found among us as man.
Wickliffe was of opinion Wickliffes Apology. chap. 8. sect. 6.
, that it were better to banish Images clean out of the Church; and to this
purpose he alleges that noted saying of Epiphanius; and according to his
doctrine not long after Wa^singam^ p. 358.
William N^vill, L^wis Clifford, Thomas Latimer, and John Montague turned out
Images out of certain Chapels within their Jurisdictions.

Concerning prayer to Saints, whereas we hold it vain to pray to the Saints
deceased, unless we might be assured that they heard and understood our
prayers, and beheld the secret thoughts of our heart; some have conceited the
glass of the Trinity, according to that of Gregory; He that sees God, who
sees all things, cannot but see all things in him; but this saying is rejected
by Hugo de S. Victore, as we heard in the last age, as also by Occham O^^ham
Dial page 2 tr. 1. cap. 3. ubi con^utat Iohan^em 22. H^^^sin esse pronunciat.
di^e^e; ^il^ntes Deum nulla ignorare, etc. Magist Sent. l. 2. did. 11.
accipiendum dicit d^ctum G^^gor^^, de hij^ quorum cognitio beatum facit

est quia ^oris sit ^liquid quod igno^^nt. Cum igitur non vid^at omnia^ and per
consequens non Facialiter cl^re vident Deu^^.
, Scotus, and sundry other excellent men. It is true indeed, that they see God
face to face. 1. Corinthians. 13.12. yet this Faciall vision makes not the blessed
Saints to know all things. Every one which beholds the Sun, does not behold
every thing which the Sun effects and enlightneth. The Saints know
according to the capacity of creatures, and so far forth only as it pleases
God, and is sufficient for their happiness: so that this glass of the Trinity
does not represent things according to the manner of a Natural Glass; but as
Speculum voluntarium; such a Glass as makes reflection of such notices as God
is pleased to manifest more or less, when, in what manner, and to what persons
himself pleases. Gregorius Ariminensis resolves peremptorily Greg.
A^^minens. lib. 2 di^t. 9.10. quaest. 1. ex 2. Paralipom. ex dicto Salomonis,
Tu solus nos^i corda istorum hominum; et ex libro de Ecclesiasticis Dogmatibus,
Secreta cordis ill^ solus novit, etc. probat nullam cre^turam ^ognos^ere
cogitationes ^o^dium n^st^orum.
, that neither Saints nor Angels know the secrets of our hearts, but that this
is reserved as peculiar to God alone.

Besides, there wanted not some, who in this dark age of the Papacy, held it
superfluous to pray to the Saints; insomuch that John Sharp in the University
of Oxford publicly disputed these two questions, of praying to Saints, and of
praying for the dead Praesertim, cum^ quibusdam famosis v^r^similiter
aestimatur, quod hujusmodi suff^agia and o^ationes in Ecclesia Dei super^^^unt:
quibusdam vero sap (...) vi^etur cont^artum ^ohn Sharp prooem. in quaestiones
de orationibus sanctorum, and suff^agijs via^orum M S. in Bibliot^eca Collegij
Mertonensis Oxon. Cited by D. Usher in his answer to the Jesuit Tit. of prayer
to Saints^ p. 452
, especially, because it was esteemed by some famous men, and not without
probability, that such suffrages and prayers were superfluous in the Church of
God, although some other wise men thought the contrary.

Wickliffe also is noted by Bellarmine Bellar. lib. 1. de Sa^ct. B^atit. cap.
15. ex ^ho. Waldensi tom. 3. tit. 12^ cap. 108 and sequent.
, for one that opposed Invocation of Saints. Wickliffe indeed says as
follows Stultitia videtur sontem omn^o^ par^t. orem relinqu^re, and ad rivum
turbidum and remotum accedere. Quis faceret Scurram med^atorem suum, ut R^gis
p^ratioris et clem^ntioris colloquio potiretur? Wickli^fe cap. 30. Te^tij
Trial. and Waldensi^ tom. 3. tit. 12. cap. 111. et 114
; It seems to be a very great folly to leave the fountain which is at hand,
and fetch water a far off out of a muddy poole. Who would make a Scurra, or
vain fellow his spokesman to procure him access and audience in the Kings
Court, the King himself being more courteous and easilier to be entreated,
than the mediator whom the petitioner used? where Bellarmine Quib^s verbis
obiter Sanctos Scurris, and rivis ^^rbidis conferebat. Bellar. (...) citato.
bids us, by the way observe how Wickliffe^ compared the Saints deceased to
scurrilous persons, and troubled waters; this indeed is a shrewd imputation,
but Wickliffe presently expresses his own meaning; saying Sancti igitur
incoelo licet non sint Scurrae, sed incorporati Christo per gratiam Salvatoris,
tamen minus se habent in comparatione ad i^lum, quam Scurra ad Regem terrenum.
Apud Wicletum and Th. Waldens. loco citato,
, The Saints in Heaven although they be no scurrilous persons, but incorporated
into Christ by the free mercy of their Savior; yet they are less in
comparison of him, than any mean Groom, ^ester, or Para^ite is in comparison
of an earthly King. Now what great harm is there in this comparison? Job
compared man, Yea a righteous man, to a worm; even the son of man which is
but a worm. Job 25. v. 6. Yea but the word Scurra, is an odious term; so it
is indeed as now adays it is used. The vulgar Interpreter used the word
Scurra, and Lyra expounds it de vilibus perfonis, of mean persons; and our
English translates it, vain fellows. Wehn David daunced before the Arc,
Michal said to him 2 Samuel 6.2^.
, The King uncovered himself to day in the eyes of his servants, as one of the
vain fellows openly uncovereth himself. Howsoever, were it that Sanctos non
esse invocandos docuit Ioannes Wiclevus, qui^ scilicet and ipsi K^ave^ sive
scurrae, hoc ^st servi, (vocabulo in hoc sen^u veteribus Anglis usitatissimo)
essent, non autem Ne^u^ones, ut odiose interpretatur Bellarminus Anglici
Idiomatis prorsus igna^us. Gabr. pouelus in praefat. ad Acad. Oxon. ad lib. de
Antichristo.
Wickliffe used the Latin word Scurra, in a mollified sense, or the word Knave
in the English. Time we know is the Emperor of words, and in process thereof
some of them degenerate from their first institution. Idiota at first was used
for a private man, now we take it for a fool, for an Idiot. The Wisemen that
came from the East, were called Magi, Math. 2.1. Now we may not term them
Magicians, for that were to call them Sorcerers: if one should call a King a
Tyrant, it were treason, or a Wise woman Saga, he would be hardly thought of:
so among the Latins, Fur, a Thief, when before it was a Servant.

Virgil.
Quid faciant Domini audent cum talia Fures?
When Thieves.
Slaves thus saucy are,
What will their Masters dare?
In like sort, the word knave sounded not formerly so odiously as now adays it
does; for Chaucer The Millers tale.
used it for a Servant. Go up (quoth he) unto his Servant.
knave, Cleape at his door, Cleape, that is, Calls
and knock fast with a stone. And in the same sense it is used by Sir Philip
Sidney in his Arcadia.

If that my man must praises h^ve,
What then must I that keep the knave?
Now, to proceed, Wicliffe in the other comparison alludes to that of the
Prophet; Ier. ^.13.
They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out
Cisterns, broken ^esternes that can hold no water: and so indeed are the purest
creatures in comparison of God; for (as Job says) he charged his Angels with
folly. Job 4.18. Yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight. Job 15.15. So
that Wickliffes comparison was very fit, when he said the Saints were but like
troubled waters, and them remote, and a far off, in respect of God, who is
the pure wellspring, and at hand, for as the Psalmist says Psalm. 145.18.
; The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him; yea, all such as call upon
him faithfully.

Of Justification, and Merits.
Chemninitius has collected a number of sayings out of the Fathers and
Schoolmen for proof of Justification by faith only, and amongst the rest,
for this fourteenth Century he produces Lyra in 3. cap. ad Galat^ Ad quid suit
lex utilis? quasi dicat, ^i Lex non justificavit, s^d sola fides, quare ergo
posita est and datae? Chemnit. loc. Theolog. part. 2 a de Iustificat. p. 773.
the testimony of Nicholas Lyra.

Wickliffe also taught Dec^everunt Apostoli sufficere ad salvationem
Christianismi -- fidem Domini Jesus Christi. De ver. Script. pag^ 494 Maritum.
Christi per se su^^icit (...) hominem r^dimere a Geh^nna. ibid. page 552. De
per se Sufficientia^ intelligitur sine (...) ca^sa (...) ib^d. page 553.
, that Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ is sufficient for Salvation^ that, the
merit of Christ is able by it self, to redeem all mankind from Hell, and that
this sufficiency is to be understood without any other cause concurring.

PAP.
Master Brereley says, that the Doctrine of Justification by only faith, was
unknown to Wickliffe. Prot. Apol. Tract. 2. cap. 2. sect. 4. subdivision, 2.

PROT.
By that which has been alleged, it appears it was known to him; but what
if it were not so fully known to him? Wickliffe was a long time kept in the
mist of popery, so that he could not by and by discern the truth in all
points; we blame him not for that he saw no more: we bless God for it, that he
saw so much as he did, specially in this dark time of the papacy.

PAP.
Walden says Waldens. tom. 3. cap. 7.8.9.
, that Wickliffe defended Humane Merits.

PROT.
The same Friar says Wicklevist^ d^str^^nt lib^rum arbitrium. Walden. tom. 3.
page 24.
that the Wiclevists overthrew the point of freewill; if they took away
freewill, how held they humane merits? D. James shows out of Wickliffes
works, that he refuted the doctrine of merit, specially in his Commentaries
upon the Psalms, where he bears down Commentar. in Psalm. p^g 474.
, those proud Pharisees, which said, that God did not all for them, but think
that their merits helps.

He taught, that we are all sinners, not only from our mothers womb, but in
our mothers womb Infantes pe^cant in matris utero. In exposit. Decalogi. page
77.
; so that we cannot so much as think a good thought Comment in Psalm. page 109.
, unless Jesus the Angel of the great Council send it; nor perform a good
work Ibid. page 423.
, unless it be properly his good works Ibid. page 79.
, His mercy comes before us, that we receive grace, and follows us helping
and keeping us in grace: he concludes, Comment. in Psalm. page 374.
that it is good only to trust in God: was this man a Pelagian? Friar Walden
would make men believe he was one. Howsoever, there be other of our
Countriemen, Bradwardine, Occham, and Holcot, men of special note in this age,
who speak excellently in this point.

Bradwardine, in his defense of the cause of God against the Pelagians of his
time, disputes this point at large showing; Disputat meritum non esse causam
^terni praemij: ^umque Scriptura and Doctores confirment^ Deum praemiaturum
bonos propter merita sua bon^, Propter, non significare caus^m proprie^ s^d
improprie vel causam cognosc^ndi velordinem, vel denique d^spositionem
subjecti. The Bradward. in summa contra P^lagian. a page 350. ad 353.
that Merit is not the cause of everlasting reward: and that when the
Scriptures and Doctors do affirm, that God will reward the good for their
good merits (or works:) Propter did not signify the cause properly: but
improperly, either the cause of knowing it, or the order, or the disposition of
the subject thereunto.

Occham says, Quia nullus actus ex puris naturalibus, nec ex quacunque cau^a
creata potest esse meritorius, sed ex gra^ia Dei voluntary, and liber^
acceptante. Ockam in prim. Sen^. did. 17. qu est. 2.
No act done in puris naturalibus, or proceeding from any created cause
whatsoever, can be meritorious, but by the free promise, and acceptance of
God. Holcot says, that our works have this worth, or value in them, not
naturally, as if there were so great goodness in the nature or substance of
the merit that everlasting life should be due unto it^ but legallie, in regard
of Gods ordinance and appointment: even Sicut parva pecunia Cupri, ex natura
^ua, siv^ natu^^li valo^e, non valet tantum, quantum unus panis, sed ex
institutione Principis tantum valet. Rob. Holcot in lib. Sapient. cap. 3. lect.
36.
as a little piece of copper of it own nature or natural value, is not worth
so much as a loaf of bread, but by the ordinance and institution of the Prince
it is worth so much.

Richard Fitzraufe afterward Archbishop o^ Armagh in Ireland, says Cum aliquod
genus praemij a^icui red^endum est, non propter condignitatem operis, sed
propter promissionem, and sic p^opter justitiam pr^mianti^. Armachan. in
quaest. Armenor. lib. 12. c. 21
that the reward is rendered, not for the condignitie of the work, but for the
promise, and so for the justice of the rewarder.

Gregorius Ariminensis concludes peremptorily, Ex hoc ulterius infero, quod
nedum vi^ae aeternae, sed nec alicujus alterius praemij aete^ni vel temporalis
aliqui^ act^s hominis ex quacunque cha^itate^licitus, est de Cond^gno
meritorius apud Deum. Greg. in 1. Sent. did. 17. qu. 1. art. 2.
that no Act of man, though issuing from never so great charity, meriteth of
condignitie from God, either eternal life, or yet any other reward; whether
eternal or temporal; and he gives his reason out of the Apostle, 1 Cor. 4.7.
quoniam quilibet talis actus est donum dei, juxta illud Apostoli, 1 Cor. 4.
because every such act is Gods gift, every such work is the gift of God, and
what have thou, that thou have not received? and if thou have rec^ived it, why
do thou glory, as if thou had not received it? Durand also is most resolute
in this point Quod redditur potius ex liberalitate dantis quam ex debi^o
operis, ^on cadit sub meri^o de cond^gno stricte et proprie accepto. Sed
quicquid a Deo accipimus, sive si^ gratia, sive sit g^oria, ^ive bonum
temporale vel spirituale, potius and principalius accipimus exlib^ralitate Dei,
quam redd^tur ex debi^o operi^ ^rgo nihil penitus cadit sub me^ito de Condigno
sic accepto. Durand in 2. Sent. did. 27 qu est. 2. sect. 12.
, that which is conferred rather out of the liberality of the giver than out
of the due of the work, does not fall within the compass of merit of
Condignitie, strictly and properly taken. But whatsoever we receive of God,
whether it be grace or glory, whether temporal or spiritual good, whatsoever
good work we have before done for it, yet we r^ceive the same rather out of
Gods liberality, than out of ^he debt or due of the work. Therefore nothing
at all falls within the compass of Merit of Condignitie, so taken

And Caus^ autem ^ujus ^st, quia et ^uud quod sumus, and quod habemus, ^ive
sunt boni actus, sive bo^i ^^abitus, s^u ^sus; ^otum est in nobis ex
liberalitate divina gratis dante and conservante. Et quia ex d^no gra^^ito
nullus obligatu^ ad dandum amplius, sed poti^s recipiens m^gis ^bligatur danti:
ideo ex bonis habitibus, and ex bonis actibus, ^ive usibus nobis a Deo datis,
Deus non obligaturnobis ex aliquo debito lu^^itiae ad aliquid amplius dandum,
ita quod si non ded^rit ^it i^ jus^^s; sed potiu^ nos sumus Deo obligali: and
sentire, seu dicere opp^situm, ^st tamerarium se^ Blasphemum. Id. sect. 13.14.
the cause hereof is, (says he) because both that which we are, and that which
we have, whether they be good acts or good habits, or the use of them, is
wholly in us by Gods liberality, freely giving and preserving the same. Now
because none is bound by his own free gift to give more, but the receiver
rather is more bound to him that gives: therefore by the good habits, and by
the good acts or uses which God has given us, God is not bound to us by any
debt of Justice to give any thing more, so as if he did not give it he should
be unjust; but we are rather bound to God. And to think or say the contrary,
is rashness or blasphemy: and yet the Rhemists in their Annotations upon the
sixth chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews and the tenth verse, go very
far in the contrary.

THE FIFTEENTH CENTVRIE, From the year of Grace, 1400. to 1500.
The Benefit of Printing.
PAPIST.
WWhat say you of this fifteenth Age?

PROT.
In this Age knowledge increased by the means of Printing, which was found out
at Strasburg in Germany by one John Guttenburg: And indeed the benefit of
Printing was great; for hereby the languages were div^lged, books were far
easilier now dispersed, than formerly the Manuscripts could be, and learning
and good letters were generally communicated. Besides, that in this Age God
raised up diverse Worthies, who by their confessions, writings, and martyrdom,
witnessed the truth of the Gospel, as namely John Husse, and Hierome of Prague.

PA.
Were Hus and Hierome men of learning, and a godly life, and withal were they
Martyrs, as you would seem to make them?

PRO.
Indeed they bitterly inveighed against the ambition, pride, covetousness and
negligence of the Clergy; they urged the necessity of oftener preaching then
was usual in those times, and desired to have the Communion in both kinds,
according to the ancient custom of the Primitive Church, and could not be
induced simply and absolutely to condemn the Articles of Wickliffe Er^ores
Ioannis ^ss damn^ti in Concilio Constantien^i, quonia^ public prae^icab^t
^oann^m Wicleff, vi^um Catholi^um, et authorem Evangeli^um Council. Constant.
Caranza in Summa Conc^l.
, but thought many of them might carry a good sense; and that the Author of
them was a man that carried a good mind, howsoever he might fail in some
things; and for these and the like tenets and reproves they were burnt at
Constance contrary to the public faith, and safe conduct given by the
Emperor, yea, Aeneas Sylvius (afterward Pope Pius the second) says expressly
Placuitque Sigismun d^ Imperatore suadente Ioannem and Hieronymum ad Synoduns
vocari. Aen. Sylv. Hist. Bohem. cap 36.
; It was thought good by the persuasion of Sigismund the Emperor, that John
and Hierome should be called to the Council of Constance, so that they came
not of their own accord, nor yet without their warrantie and safe conduct: but
the Fathers of the Counsel dealt ill with them, breaking the faith of the
Emperor, and dispencing with the breach of his safe conduct, as being of no
force without theirs; because (forsooth) faith was not to be kept with
Heretics (as they vainly alleged;) therefore these poor men must have no
privilege of their Passe-port; the Emperor (says Campian Casar obsignavit,
Christ^mus orbis r^signavit, major Ca^sare^ C^m. Rat. 4.
in a flourish of his) Sealed their Pass, but the Christian world, to wit the
Council of Constance greater than Caesar, brake up the seal, and voided the
Imperial warran^, notwithstanding the Emperor had both called the Council,
and in a City of his own^, where he only had authority; and Wenceslaus King
of Bohemia, at the request of the Council, sent thither John Hus, under the
safe conduct of the Emperor.

Now what Master Hus his learning was, his works yet remaining do testi^ie.
Besides, he translated the Scriptures into the Boh^mian tongue, which
occasioned (as Cochleus says) Instituit Mechanicos^ qui sac^as literas in
ver^a^u^am li^guam tra^sl^ta^ ^^^vide l^g^^t^s, ^um Sacerd^tibus c^ram plebe
d^^pu^are^t^ quinetiam libros (...) mulleres. Cochleus Hist. Hussit. lib. 1.
page 18.
Artisans and Tradesmen to read them; insomuch as they could dispute with the
Priests; yea, their women were so skilled, as one o^ them made a book, and the
Priests of the Thab^rites, were so skilled in arguing out of the Scripture,
that one of them named Rokyzana, who had been present at the Counsel at
Basil, undertook Vobiscum, Fr^ter dilecte, pro sancti Calici^ Co^munione ad
plebes, scripturis S. Doctorum sententij^. C^^^num deductionibus, and
rationibus, gaudens and l^^t^^, vol^ hab^re collatione^. Epistola Rokyzanae ad
lo. Capistranum. Cochl. ibid. lib. 10. page 370.
to dispute with Capistranus, a great and learned Papist, touching Communion in
both kinds, and that out of the holy Scriptures, the ancient Doctors, and the
Churches Canons and Constitutions, as also from the force of natural reason.

Aen^as Sylvius says, Hut lingu^ potens, and mundioris vitae opinione cl^rus.
Aen. Sylv. Hist. Bohem. cap. 35.
That Hus was an eloquent man, and that in the worlds estimation, he had
gained a great opinion of holiness.

Hierome was a man of that admirable eloquence, learning and memory, that
Poghius the Florentine Historian and Orator admired his good parts; and the
same Poghius being an eyewitness of his trial at the Council of Constance
Nihil unquam protul^^ indignum vi^o bono; ut si id in ^ide sentiebat, quod
verbis profitebatur, nulla in eum, nedum mortis causa inveniri justa poss^t. O
virum dignum memori^, hominum sempitern^. Epist. Poghij ad Leonard. Aretin. in
Fasc^c. rerum expetend. and fugiend. page ^53.
says; He was a man worthy of eternal memory, that there was no just cause of
death in him; that he spoke nothing in all his trial unworthy of a good man;
yea he doubts whether the things objected against him were true or no.
Besides, he was so resolute at his death, that when the Tormentor kindled the
fire behind his back, he bid him make it in his sight: For if I had Id. Ibid.
feared the fire (said he) I had never come hither, and so whiles the fire was
a making, he sung Psalms, and went cheerfully to his death.

The like resolution was in John Husse at his death: for whereas his enemies
made a crown of paper with three ugly devils painted therein, and this title,
Archheretike set over; when John Husse saw it, he said, Acts and Monum. volum.
1 book 6. p. 624.
My Lord Jesus Christ for my sake were a Crown of thorns, why should not I
then for his sake, wear this light Crown, be it never so shameful? I will
do it, and that willingly, and so he died constantly; and so indeed the
story reports, Qu^si ad epulas invitati ad incendium properar^^t. Aen. Sylv.
Hist. Bohe^. cap. 36.
that they went to the stake as cheerfully, as it had been to a banquet. John
Husse may seem to have had some prophetical inspiration: for at his death he
prophesied, saying, Cum duceretur ad r^gum, ha^c voce^ f^tidic^ edidit: Post
centum anno^ exoriturum Cygnam, que^ non sicut istum imbecillem Anserem
ustulari sint Sacerd^t^s. Martin Mylius in Apotheg. Mori^^t. seu^ Homo disce
mori. page 93.
You roast the Goose now, but a Swan shall come after me, and he shall escape
your fire: Now Husse in the Bohemian tongue signifies a Goose, and Luther a
Swan, and this Sw^n succeeded him just an hundred years after: for so these
two blessed servants of God prophesied saying, Ad E^is^opo^um agm^^ dixisse
sertur: Post c^ntum an^^s r^spondebit^s D^o and mihi. Id. Ibid.
We cite you all to make answer, and after an hundred years to give an
account of this your doing un^o God: and acco^di^gly as they foretold, it came
to pass: for they suffered martyrdom in the year 1416. and just an hundred
years after, to wit, in the yea^e 1516. the Lord raised up Luther, who ind^ed
called the Pope and his doctrine to a reckoning. Upon this prophetical speech
of John Husse, there was money coined i^ Bohemia, with this inscrip^ion in
Latin on the one side, Acts and Monum. vol. 1^ book 6. page 770.
Cintum revolutis annis Deo respondebitis et mihi, anno 1416 Hie onymus
condemnatus: that is, After an hundred years you shall answer to God and to
me: and on the other side of the plate was engraven, Credo unam ^ss^ sanctam
Ecclesiam Catholicam, anno 1415. Io. Husse, I believe one holy Catholic Church.

PA
Did Husse and his followers teach as you do?

PRO
For substance of doctrine, they taught as we do; their enemies indeed
misreported their doctrine, and charged them with that they never held:
insomuch as Husse solemnly protested, even at the point of death, Cum ergo
Arti^ules (...) ^unqua^ tenerim, qu^s ^alsi testes (...) me diposu^runt, sed
^ontrarium tenu^rim, (...), scripse^imque and praedi^av^^im. Cochl H^st Husti^.
lib 2. p^. 110.
That he never held those Articles which the false witnesses deposed against
him: but held, and taught, and wrote the contra^y; taking it upon his death,
that he taught nothing but the truth of the Gospel, which he would then
seal with his blood. Now touching their doctrine, we are driven to tak^ the
sca^tling of their opinions from the pens of t^eir adv^rsaries, by whom we
perceive that it is very p^ob^ble, (...) Hussi^es were instructed, and much
helped by Wickl^^ss books; and accordingly we find, that both Aen^^s Sylvius
Ex quibus vir q^idam genere nob^li^, apud Oxoni am lit^^is studens^ cum (...),
quibus de (...) preciosum (...) suae (...). Ae^ Sylv. Hist. Bohem. cap. 35.
and Cochleus report, that the means whe^^by ^he Bohemi^ns came to know the
doctrine of Wickl^ffe was, for that a certain noble man studying in Oxford,
carried thence with hi^ into Bohemia Wi^klifs books, de Realibus universalibus
As if it had been some rare jewel: and Cochleus says, Cochl. Hist. Hussit. ^
1. page 8.
That as a Bohemian brought first into Bohemia Wickliffes books, de Realibus
uni^er^alibus, So there was afterward one Peter Paine^ a Scholar of
Wickliffes, who after the death of his Master came ^lso into Bohemia, and
brought with him W^^kliffes books, which were in quantity as great as Saint
Au^^ines Works; many of which books Husse did aft^rwards translate into their
mother tongue. Bellarmine Bellarm. Praefat. general. controvers.
j^ynes the Wicklifists, Hussites^ and Waldenses together, as holding the same
points of doctrine, and reproving the same abuses of Rome. And Platina, says,
D^o ex sectatoribus Vigleff. ^ombusts sunt Ioann ^ and Hieronymus. Pla^^na in
vita Joan. 24.
that H^sse and Hierome were condemned in the Council of Constance, as being
followers of Wickliffe. Aeneas Silvius says, Valden^ium sectam amplexi sunt.
Aen. Sylv. Hist. Bohem. c^p. 35.
the Hussites embraced the p^ofession of the Waldenses: Now we have already
shown the tenets of the Waldenses and Wickliffe. But to come to particulars;
besides, the Hussites, there were others also of his disciples, which were
called Thaborites, Confess. Tabor. ^. Rokensan. An Dom. 1431.
of the place Thabor, which their General Zisca built as a Ci^ie of refuge for
his men. These Thaborites dis^ented more from the Church of Rome, and came
indeed nearer to the purity of the Gospel, then the rest of the Hussites.
There is in Cochleus a confession of faith, made by one John Pezibram a
Bohemian, Coc^l. H^st. Hussit. lib. 6. p^g. 233. and ^ib. 2. page 93
who speaking of these Thaborites, records these following to have been some
of their tenets; namely, That material Bread remains in the Sacrament, and
herein they were very confident, insomuch as Procopius one of their Governors
said^ Quod si c^ntum forent Doc^ores, p^nem m^te^^alem in Sacra^ento non m^nere
cont^stan^^s, di^o eo^ omnes (...) ad collu^ and fallere Cochl. lib. 6. pa. 22^.
That if an hundred Doctors should hold the contrary, he would t^ll them to
their face they were all mistaken.

They held, A^^n. Sylv de Orig. Bohem cap 35. Bellar. lib. 1. d^ S^nct. Beat.
c. 15.. Deinde
That the Saints now triumphant are not to be prayed unto.

H^sse his scholars after his death brake In omnibus civitatib^s P^age

Haeret. 18.
They denied Purgatory, and by consequent, Prayer for the dead. They maintained
Communion in both kinds to be administered to the Lay People.

They held N^n Papa s^d Christus est Caput Ecclesiae. Coc^l. l. 1 page 50.
That Christ is the head of the Church, and not the Pope; as also that the Pope
might err, and that diverse Popes had been Ibi^. page 52.
Heretics.

They held (...) est slandu^ (...) and (...) se (...) Scriptu^e (...) et novi
Test^m^^^i. (...). li. 1. page 51^
The holy Scriptures to be the Judge in point of controversy.

Lastly, Husse was condemned by the Council of Constance, for holding, (...)
est sancta univers^l^^ E^clesia, que est pr^ed (...). C^n^^ Coast^^^ (...) 15.
Art. 1. apud C^ranz.
That the Congregation of the Predestinates, and Elect, were the Church of God,
which yet was the self same doctrine which Gregory the Great taught: For he
held the Church of God to consist of right Believers, saying, Se^undum (...)
sue gratiam san^^am ^cclesi^m de in (...) p^rmansuris Sanctis co^struxit. Greg.
in Cantic. cap. 3. tom. 2.
That Christ according to the grace of his fore knowledge, has built his holy
Church of Saints, which shall continue for ever: and that Intra (...) mensuras
sunt omnes electi; extra has omnes ^eprobi. Id Moral. in Job l 28. c 9. tom. 1.
All the Elect are contained within the compass and circuit of the Church, and
all the Reprobates are without: because Specie tenus ad ^idem Regni veniunt.
Id. ibid. lib. ^5. cap 11.
they do but only in outward show come ^o the kingdom of grace: So that
Gregory says as well as Husse, That the Elect only are of the Church.

Now (as learned Doctor Field says) Richa^d Fi^ld of the Church, book 1. cha.
8.
This was the meaning of Wickliffe, Husse, and others; who say, that the Elect
only are of the Church, defining the Church to be the multitude of the Elect;
not for that they think them only to pertain to the Church, and no others;
but because they only pertain unto it principally, fully, effectually, and
finally; and in them only is found that which the calling of grace (whence the
Church has all her being) intends, to wit, such a conversion to God as is
joined with final perseverance, whereof others failing and coming short, they
are only in an inferior, and more imperfect sort, said to be of the Church.

PA.
Did the doctrine of Husse, and his followers continue any long time?

PRO.
It continneth even unto this day; for Cochleus in the year 1^34, Wishes
Faxit Deus ut videam Hussita^um reliquia^ ad per^ectam ^^^lesiae unitatem
redire. Cochl. lib. 12. page 441.
that he may see the remainders of the Hussites to r^turne to the Church, and
the Germans to cast out all n^w s^cts; whereby it is clear, that Husses
doctrine was sensibly and apparently continued not only unto the days of
Luth^r (who began not to show himself till the year 1517) but even after his
time also.

PA.
Had the Hussites any Bishops or Priests of their own, lawfully calle^?

PRO.
Huss^ and H^erome were Priests themselves, and whiles they lived they had
Priests and Preachers; and after their death, the^r follower, Nacti sunt
Episc^pum Archtepiscop^ S^ff^^g^neum, ordina^^runt ^er ^um Cle^^cos ^^ctae suae
quotquot voluerunt. Cochl. lib. 4. page 168.
Got them a Bishop, who was Suff^agan to the Archbishop of Prague, and by him
they put i^to holy Orders, as many Clerks as they would, which thing the
Archbishop took so ill, that h^e suspended his S^ffragan. But it was not long
after, that Conradus the Archbishop himself, became a follower of Husse
likewise; and under this Conrad President of the Convocation, the Hussites
Concilium Pragense Hussitaru^ In nomine D^mini Amen. ^n^ipit Sancta Synodus
ann. D^m^ 1421. sub Conrado Archiep^ civitatis pragensis etc. Cochl. lib. 5.

held a Council at Prague, and there they compileda Conf^ssion of their Faith,
which the said Archbishop and diverse Barons of Bohemia did afterward
resolu^ely maintain. Besides Sigismund the Emperor (in a treaty with the
Bohemians) S^holares Diocaesis Pragensis ad sacros ordines cons^^rabunt. Cochl.

Granted that the Bishops should promote to holy Orders the Bohemians, even
Hussites which were of the University of Prague.

PA.
Were there many that followed Husse, and were they of the better sort, or
only some mean persons?

There were forty thousand German Horsemen gathered together to destroy them;
but upon their approach the Germans turned their backs and fled, not without
some secret judgment of God as he thinks.

Ae^eas Sylvius ^aith, I^stituti su^t tres ex^^^cit^s, priusq^am hostis (...)
^on p^ctu d^retur, foedss^^a ^^^pta ^uga -- mi^atur ^ulia^us unde hic ti^or.
Aen. Sylv. hist. Bo^em. cap. 48.
There were three several Armies levied against the Hussites, entering Bohemia
in three places; but (as the story says) Non visum hostem fugerunt, they ^led
before they did see the enemy; and again the second tim^, Priusquam hostis
ullus daretur in conspectus, foedissima coepta fuga; they fled away with shame,
before any enemy came to fight, and left their Tents to the Bohemians: insomuch
as Julian Cardinal of Saint Angelo, marvailes exceedingly at this their sudden
fear, and shameful flight.

When Pope Eugenius had sent the same Cardinal Julian his Legate to the Council
of Basil, and presently after sent him commandment to dissolve it; Julian laid
open unto him by letters, how great an injury he should do himself; and
brought many reasons against it, among others this, that the Bohemians, who had
been called thither, would by good right, say: Nonne vide^itur hic digitus
Dei? (...) exercitus ^r^^torum ^o^ies f^g^t a (...) little, and nun^ (...) ^u

Is not here the finger of God to be seen? Behold Armies have so often fled
from before them, and now the Universal Church also fl^^th behold they can
neither be overcome with Arms, nor by L^arning; this must needs appear a
miracle wrought by God, to declare that their opinion is true, and ours false.

Neith^r were the Hussites any such mean persons, for even the Nobles of
Bohemia, sent two solemn Ambas^ages John F^x in Con^ilij Con^tanti^^^ hist^ria.
to the Council of Constance, in the behalf of Husse; and when the Council
neglected their request, and dealt ill with them, burning their Pastor Husse,
notwithstanding his safe conduct given him by the Emp^rour; then indeed they
defended themselves under the conduct of John Z^scay their Ge^erall, who at one
time led fo^^^ tho^sand ^ouldiers into the field, (...) supra (...) millta
(...) convenere Aen ^ylv. hist. Bohem. cap. 38.
and had such success in his enterp^ises, that Aeneas Sylvius reports of him,
That eleven times in fought battles, he returned Conqueror out of the
field. Yea, Cochleus wondereth at the strange success he had, saying, Mirae
pro^ecto et fortunae and indust^iae, in bellis suit Zisca, ut vix ulla
Graecorum, H^brae^^^, out Latmorum historia talem re^^rat belli du^^m, qualis
Zisca ^uit. Cochl. Hist Huss. lib. 5. page 206.
That scant any history of the Greeks, or Latins, or Hebrews does mention
such a General a Zisca was.

Now for their visible Congregations, there needs no other Testimony than
this; when the Council of Constance had robbed them of their Minister Husse,
and nimmed from them the blessed Cup of the Eucharist, which Christ had
bequeathed unto them; then the Bohemians much affected with this ill dealing,
Ass^mbled themselves together near unto Thabor Castle, and there to the number
of thirty thousand, Circiter triginta millia hominum convenerunt, atque i^i
CCC. mensas in patentibus C^mp^s erexerunt, ex quibus p^pulo Sacramentum
Cali^is ministrarunt. Cochl. ibid. lib. 4. page 172.
having three hundred tables erected in the fields for that purpose, they
received the Eucharist in both kinds.

PA.
Master Brerely says, P^ot. Apol. tract. 2. chap. 2. sect. 5.
The Hussites rose up in arms, and were seditious; and Father Parsons says,
Parsons third Part^ of the three convers. chap. 6. nu. 16, 17, 18.
That Zisca was a rebel against his king VVenceslaus.

PRO.
The Reverend and laborius Deane of Exceter, Master Sutcliffe says, Matthew
Sutcliffes Answer to Parsons third part. chap. 6. book 1. page 81.
That the crime of rebellion is rather to be imputed to the Romish Clergy, and
their adherents. For Subinco the Archbishop of Prague stirred up Sigismund
against the king, as Sylvius testifies. Hist. Bohem. c. 35. And that king was
taken prisoner, first by his Barons, next by his brother Sigismund, as is
testified in the same History c. 34. Whereas the wars of Ziscay were rather
against strangers, than others; and happened after the Co^ncel of Constance, and
the kings death. And again, Math. Sutcliff. ibid. li. 3. cap. 11^ page 284.
Being forced by the per^idiousnesse of the Pope and his accomplices, he took
arms for his own necessary d^fence, and the protection of the innocent; so
that he d^fended his poor countrymen against the invasion of strangers Id
ibid^ Book 1. chapter 2 pag^ 28.
And thus far master Surcliffe.

And so I come to speak of such other worthies, as God raised up in this Age,
whose Testimonies we shall have occasion to produce; as nam^ly, Peter de
Alliac^ Cardinal of Cambrey, John G^rson Cha^cellour of Paris, Paulus
Burgensis, Alphonsus Tostatus Bishop of Avila, Thomas Walden the Englishman,
Nicholas Clemangtes Archdeacon of Bayeux in France, Dionys^us Carthusianus,
Cardinal Bessarion, Cardinal Cusanus, Trith^m^us Abbot of Spanheim, Wesselus
Preacher at Worms, Hierome Savonarola a Dominican of Florence Gabriel Biel,
John, and Francis Picus Earls of Mirandula, Laurentius Valla a Patr^cian or
Senator at Rome, Baptista Mantuan the Poet and Historian.

John Gerson was a good man, and one that much desired the Reformation of
things amiss, he was present at the Council of Constance, Claruit personaliter
in Co^cilio Constantiensi -- pro ver^t^te tuend^ ^^ivatu^ est patri^ ^t
dignitatibus, ad civitate Lugdunensem con^ugit. Trithem de Scriptor. Eccles.
and for speaking freely therein against the Disorders of the Roman Church he
was deprived of his goods and dignities by the Pope, and expulsed the
University by the Sorhonists; it is recorded of him, ^^tule ^^t ^hi ^^le
digniss^mi, D. (...) Ge^son. multos coll^giss^ ^ue ulos, quo^ quotidie ip^e in

^enoren Mon Dieu mon createur (...) de vestre pour se^viteur I^han Gerson. In
sine quartae partia operum Gersoni^.
that being thus deprived of his goods and dignities, he be^ooke himself to
teaching of School, wherein his manner was daily to cause all his Scholars,
^he little children, to join with him in this short Pray^r; My God, my maker,
have mercy upon thy miser^bl^ servant Gerson. John de Serres in his Inventory
of France, in the life of Charles the seventh says, that Gers^n retu^ning
from Basil, died for grief at Lions: and in the third part of Gersons works,
I find this Epitaph made on him; -- aemula turba fugat,
Ast hunc dum fugeret, fovit Germania felix,
Fit tibi Lugdunum posterior requies.


That is; The envious multitude do make him ^ly,
But flying he finds r^st in Germany;
And after this at Lions.


Touching the power of the Pope, in disposing the affairs of Princes, and
their States; Gerson says, it was given unto him, by such as flattered him,
and told him, Non est potestas temporalis vel ec^l^siastica nisi a Papa; in
(...) ^emore scripsit Ch^is^us^ R^x Regum, Dominus dominantium, de ^^jus
potestate disputare instar sacril^gij est, cui neque quisqua^ di^e^e potest,
cur i^a ^a^is? men^^r si non inveniun^ur hae^ scripta ab illis etiam qui
sapientes sunt in o^ulis suis; si non inveniuntur praet^^ea ^uisse per summos
Ponti^ices haec credita. Gerson de potestate Ecclesiasti^. considerat. 12. in
part prima oper.
That as there is no power but of God, so there is none whether Temporal or
Ecclesiastical, Imperial or Regal, but from the Pope, in whose thigh Christ
has written, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; of whose Power to dispute, is
Sacrilegious boldness, to whom no man may say, Sir, why do you so? though he
al^er, overturne, waste and confound all States. Let me be judged a liar (says
he) if these things be not found written, by them that seem wise in their own
eyes, and if some Popes have not given credit to such lying and flattering
words; yea he says, Etiam usque ad imitationem Lu^i^^ri ut ad^rari velint
sicut Dij. Gerson in part prima post tractatum de unitate ecclesiastic^ addit
quatuor co^siderationes ad ^ulcimentum praem^ssarum; in qua^ta consid. haec
verba hab^ntur.
That in imitation of Lucifer, they will be adored and worshipped as gods; not
enduring whatsoever they do, that any one should ask them why they do so,
they neither fear God, nor reverence men.

Gerson denied the infallibility of the Popes judgment, and taught, Cum
summus Pontifex sit peccabilis. Id. de potest. Eccles. considerat. 11.
That he was subject to error, and that in case of error, or other scandalous
misdemeanour, he may be judicially deposed; and to this purpose he wrote a
treatise De auferibilitate Papae; Libellus de aus^ribilitate Papae in part
prim^, oper. Gerson
That the Pope might be safely taken away from the Church, and yet no danger
follow of it.

Gerson shows, Nulla ^ff^nsa Dei est venialis de se, nisi tantummodo per
resp^ctum ad divinam misericordiam (...) vult de ^ac^o quamlibe^ offensam
imput^re ad mo^te^, cum ill^d p^sset justissime. Gerson de vi^a ^pirituali
animae. lect. 1. part. 1.
that all sins, Even they that seem least and lightest, are by nature
mortal.

Touching Indulgences or pardons; whether the power of the Keys extend only,
to such as are on earth, or to them also that are in Purgatory, the opinions
of men (says Vtru^ vero claves ecclesiae se p^ssint ^xtendere non solum super
terram, sed sub te^ra in purgatorio, sunt opiniones ad utramque partem
probabiles; and favorabile est dicere quod sic, saltem per indirectum propter
communionem in charitate. Gerson. de Indulgent. Consideratione 11. part prima
oper.
Gerson) are contrary and uncertain: but howsoever, this he pronounces
confidently, Idem ibid. Consid 8.
That only Christ can give such Pardons for thousands of days and years as
many Popes assume to th^mselves power to grant. So that in Gersons time it was
not resolved, whether the power of the Keys extended only to such as are on
earth, or to them also that are in Purgatory: yet he says, it might be
favorably construed, that they reached to them in Pu^gatorie, at least
Indir^ctly.

Gerson was present at the Council of Constance, and there preached against
the Articles of Wickliffe, and the Bohemians; if Wickliffe make for you, Gerson
does not; for Gerson condemned Wickliffes opinions.

PRO.
D. Field in his Appendix. first part. page 85, 86, 87.
Gerson preached against such Articles as Were brought to the Council of
Constance, by the English and Bohemians; now those Articles were many of them
impious, in such sort as they were proposed by them, that brought them: as that
Council. Constantiense Sess. 8.
God must obey the d^vill: that Kings or Bishops, if they fall into mortal
sin, cease to be Kings or Bishops any longer, and that all they do is
merely void. Whereas Wickliffe never delivered any such thing, nor had any
such impious concei^, as they sought to fasten on him: neither is it to be
marvelled at, that impious things were falsely and slanderously imputed to
him, seeing we are wronged in like sort at this day For Campian is not ashamed
to write, Campian Rat^o^. ^.
That we hold God to be the Author of sin, and that all sins are equal in
Gods sight; and Bristow says, B^istow Motive 39. p^g. 151. Antuerp. 1597.
That Protestants are bound to avoid all good works; which tenets we utterly
disclaim and detest: and many things no doubt were writ^en by Wickliffe and
Husse, and others, in a good and godly sense, which as they are wrested by
their adversaries, were heretical and damnable. So then Gerson might condem^e
as imp^ous, some posi^ions falsely imputed to Wickliffe, not knowing but that
they were his, and dislike other that indeed were his, as not delivered in such
sort, and such form of words, as was fit, or savoring of too much passion and
violence; and yet for all this, both Gerson and Wickl^ffe be good men, and
worthy guides of Gods Church in their times.

And so I come from Gerson to Cameracensis, from the Scholar to the Master;
for Petrus de Alliaco is willingly and respectfully acknowledged In Epistol a

Petrus de Alliac^, gave a T^act to the Council of Constance, touching the
Reformation of the Church: P^tr^ ^e Alliaco Card. Cam^rac. de Re^ormatione

there does he reprove many notable abuses of the Romanists, and gives advise
how to repress them; this treatise of the Cardinals is extant in Orthuinus.
Gratius his Fasciculus rerum expetendar^^ and fugiendarum, pagina 206. etc.
There should not be multiplied (says he) Quod in Ecclesiss ron tam m^gna
imaginum varietas multiplicaretur, non tot nova Festa solemnizarentur, etc.
P^t. de Alliac. de reform. Eccles. consid. 3.
such variety of Images and Pictures in the Church, there should not be so many
Holy days, there should not be so many Saints canonized; Maxim vid^tur
necessarium quod dim^nu^rentur Religiones Ordinum M^ndicantium; eorum s^atus

jam horrendum quorundam proverbium sit, Ad hunc s^atum venisse E^clesians, ut

such numbers, and variety of religious persons is not expedient^ there are so
many orders of begging Friars, that their state is burdensome to men, hurt^ull
to Hospitals, and to the poor. He says, that it was then a Proverb, The
Church is come to that estate, that it is not worthy to be ruled, but by
Reprobates: yet withal he concludes, Id. Ibid. considerat 6. apud Orth. Great.
page 208.
That as there were seven thousand, who had not bowed to Baal; so it is to be
hoped there be some, which desire the reformation of the Church.

Now also lived Archdeacon Clemangies, who in a set treati^e, freely painted
forth the corrupt state of the Roman Liber de corrupto statu Ecclesiae.
Church.

He wrote an Epistle to Gerard Maket, Non mentis tantu^ affectu a Babylone
descedendum, sed etiam pedib^s corporis. Nam qui de tali loco hoc praecipit,
quid de illo put^s ^uisse dictur^ in quo no^ modo sana^ doc^^ina^ non recipient

a Doctor of Paris; the argument whereof is this: That w^e are not only to
depart from Babylon with our affections, but with our bodily fecte: now he
that commands this of such a place, what do thou think (says the same
Clemangies) he would have said of that wherein not only sound doctrine is not
received, but where such are cruelly persecuted, as contradict their w^ls, yea
rather their madn^sse? Speaking of their votaries, he says, Puellarum
Monasteria, V^^eris execranda prostibu^^ -- ut idem sit hodi^ puellam velare,

Sect. 2. p. 22.
What I p^ay yo^ are Numeries now a days, but Br^thel-houses and common Stews:
the harbors of wanton men, where they satisfy their lusts? that now the
vayling of a Nun, is all one, as if you prostituted her openly to be a
Whore. He spoke excellently also in the matter of General Councels, and so
did Cardinal C^sanus, who treating of Councels, and the Pope, delivers these
positions following.

That Sed a^ universale Concil^um pr^prie captum, sit supra R^manum Pontifi^^,
creo^ dubium esse non debere. C^san. de Concordanti^ Catholic^. lib. 2. c. 17.
it is without all question, that a General Council properly taken, is both
superior to the rest of the Patriarchs, and also to the Roman Pope.

I believe (says Cusanus) Id. Ibid. lib. 3. cap. 15.
that to be spoken not absurdly, that the Emperor himself, in regard of the
^are and custody of preserving the faith committed unto him, may Praeceptive
indicere Synodum, by his imperial authority and command assemble a Synod,
when the great danger of the Church requires the same, Negligen^e aut
contradicente Romano Pontifice, The Pope either neglecting so to do, or
resisting and contradicting the doing thereof.

He says, Rom^num Pont. in co^dendis statu^ is generalibus ^am non habere
potestatem quam quidam adul^tores eidem contribuunt; ^ilicet, quod ipse tantum
statuere habeat, alijs consulentibus. Id. Ibid lib. 2. cap. 12.
That the Roman Bishop has not that power which many flatterers heap upon
him; to wit, that he alone is to determine, and others only to consult or
advise.

Whiles we defend (says Cusanus) Dum hanc partem defendimu^, quod Papa non e^^
universalis Ep^scop^s, sed super al^os primus; and sacr^rum Concili^rum non in
Papa, sed in consensu omnium vigorem fundamus; tunc quia veritatem defendi^us,
and unicuique suum honorem reserva^us, recte Papa^ honoramus. 99. Did.
Ecclesiae. Cusan. Ib. c. 13.
That the Pope is not universal Bishop, but only the first Bishop ^ver others;
and whiles we ground the power of sacred Councels upon the consent of the
whole assembly, and not upon the Pope, we mai^^taine truth, and give to every
one his due honor: and then concluding the former positions, the Cardinal
says: Idem cap. 15.
I observe little or nothing in ancient Monuments which agrees not to these my
assertions. Now also lived Laurence Va^la a learned man, and a most excellent
Divine (as Trithemi^s calls him) Theologus praes^antiss. Trith. quo supra.
he was a Roman Patrician, and Chanon of the Cathedral Church of Saint John
of Laterane in Rome: he wrote a treatise of purpose against the forged
donation of Constantine, whereby the Pope challenges his pretended Jurisdiction

He pronounces of his own experience, Papa and ipse bella pacatis populis
infert and inter civitates principesque discordias se^it; Papa and alien^^
fitit opes and su^^ absorbet, rem Ecclesiastica^, and spiritum sanctum quaestui

That the Pope himself does make war against peaceable people, and sows
^iscord between Cities and Princes; that the Pope makes gains, not only of
the comm^n wealth, but even of the state Ecclesiastical, and of the h^ly
Ghost, and that later Ropes labored to be as foolish and wicked, a^ the
ancient ones were holy and wise. For this and the like freeness of his speech
and p^^^ he was d^iven into exile by the Pope. I know indeed that Master
Brereley is offended with us for challenging Cus^^^^ and Valla, as witnesses on
our behalf: and therefore he would make his Reader believe, Prot. Apology in
the Authors advertise^ent.
that Valla being an eager enemy to the Pope, can not be an indif^erent
witness, but rather a party; and that both o^ them retracted their opinions,
and submitted themselves to the Catholic Church, and so they might without
yielding to the Romish faction: he says they retracted, but he cannot tell
when, or before whom this Recantation was made or written, perhaps it is
written on the back side of Constantines Donation.

Neither have we corrupted Valla, to make him a party for us: he was an
honest man, and we take his testimony as it is recorded, and comes (...) our
hands; he was not an enemy to the Pope, but to the forgeries of the papacy:
and this madethem billet his name amongst such books as are forbidden, and In
I^dice prohibit^rio Pij quarti autho^itate ^dit. Page 81.
prohibited.

In the later end of this age lived Baptista Mantuanus, and Franciscus Picu^,
Ea^le of Mirandula: the Oration of Picus in the Council of Lateran is extant:
wherein, besides his taxing the behavior of the Clergy, he uses these
words: Piet^s in superstitio^^^ pene pr^^^^uit. Io^n. Franc. Pici Mirand. de
Reformand. morib. Oration ad Leon. 10. and Council. Latera^. tom. 2.
That piety is almost sunk into superstition.

He held not the Popes sentence for an infallible Oracle of truth: for he
says, that if the greater part offer (as was done in the Council at Ariminum,
which stood for the Arrian heresy) to decree ought against the Scriptures; we
are not in this case to follow the most voices, but to join our selves with
the lesser numb^r, being sound in faith: Yea we are rather (says he) Quinimo
simpl^^i po^ius Ru^^ico, and in^anti, A^^^ulae, quam and Pontifici Maxima^ and
mill Episcopis credendum, si cont^a Evangelium ^sti illi p^o Evangelio verba
^a^erent. Joan Franc. P^^us Mirand Theorem. 16. to. 2.
to believe a plain countrey^man, a child, or an old woman, if they speak
according to the Scriptures, rather than the Pope, and a thousand of his
Prelates speaking against the word of God.

That the Pope may err, he shows by this Similitude^ Fieri autem potest, ut
^t vicarium caput aegrote^, quemadmodum and natural, and sicuti noxios hoc
humores, ita illud prava d^gm^^a immittat in corpus, quod cum accidit, pro
medela laborandum, and si desperatur sa^us ab^^nd^n ^umcapi^^s au^^m male sani
and deliri ^o^t^gia vitanda sunt, ne and ipsi artus pestilenti humore
tabe^ie^ent. Id. de ^ide and ordine Credendi. Theorem. 25.
Even as the natural head may be sick, and noisome humors may flow from the
brain into the body: Even so this Deputy-head (to wit ^he Pope) may be sick,
and from hi^ head-ship naughty opinions (says he) may be derived and
conveied in^o the body of the Church.

He was one who desired the Churches reformation: for in the foresaid Oration
in the Lateran Council, he wishes Sacra literae vtriusqu^ Instrumenti
rec^gnoscend^e, and c^m a^tiq^^^ and castigatis prim^ve originis exemplaribus
^onserende, ut ab er^at^^ purgentur -- ver^ historiae ab Apo^ryph^s nugis
segregand^e. O^^tio ^ici. in Fasci^. ^er expet. and fugiend. page 210.
, That the copies of the old and new Testament were compared with the ancient
and best Originals, and purged from such faults, as they have contracted
through tr^ct of time, or the neglect of the Transcribers; and that the true
and authenticke Histories were severed from the Apocryphal.

Baptista Mantuan was a famous Poet and Historian, and Prior of the Carmelite
Friars: he is commended by Trithemius Sacrae The^logiae Docto^; Philosophus
insig^is. Tri^hem de Scriptor. Eccles. verbo B^pt. Mantuan
for a great Divine, and an excellent Philosopher, he is very sharp against
the Romanists, as may appear by these few instances following; Mantuan de
calalamit. tempor. lib. 3. tom 2.
Tyrij vestes; venalia nobis,
Templa; Sacerdotes, Altaria, Sacra, Coronae,
Ignis, ^ hura, Preces; Coelum est venale, Deusque^


That is; Temples and Priests, Altars and Crowns,
they sell for pelf;
Fire, Frankincence, Prayers, Heaven,
and God himself.


Whereby he (happily) meant, their breaden God in the Mass.

Mantuan says Mantuan de Calam. temp^r. lib. 3. page 61.
as follows, of Hilarie a married Bishop; and Bishop of Poictiers in France.
Non nocuit ^ibi progenies, non obstitit uxor,
Legitimo conjuncta thoro, non herruit illa
Tempestate Deus thalamos, connubia, taed^s.


That is; Thy offspring was no prejudice to thee,
Nor could thy lawful wife an hindrance be:
In those days God allowed the Marriage bed
To Priests; their cradles, and the lamps which led
To Hymen's rites.


Of the Woman Pope he says as Mantuan. lib 3. in Alphonso, page 26. to. 3.
follows; Hic pendebat adhuc, sexum mentita virilem
Foemina, cui triplici Phrygiam diademate mitram
Extollebat apex, and Pontificalis adulter.


That is; Here yet her statue hung; who faign'd
Her self to be a man; who is famed
The Purple-triple Crown to have bore,
And last was proved a Popish Whore.


Where it may be, the Poet meant that at that time there remain^d the Statue
or Picture in Rome, resembling the Woman Pope travailing with Child; or the
statue or seat, whereon the new Pope sat, to try that he was a man, and no
woman, according to that of Henry Stephens, in his Apology for Herodotus. Cur
etiam nostro jam hic mos tempore cessat?
Ante probet quod se quilibet esse mar^m.


The same Mantuan glanceth at their manner of such frequent repetitions, as
they used in their Prayers; as if God were served by reckoning up their
M^ntuan. lib. 4. Alphonsi.
Muttering upon a pay^e of Beads, for so he terms it. Qui filo insertis
numerant sua murmura baccis.


Now also lived John of Vesalia, a Doctor and Preacher at Worms; he held, V^^m
textum expone^do per alium, Doctorum Scriptu, etiam sanctorum quantum cunque
nec gloss ^r^di^^ So^a Dei grati^ salv^ntur E^ec^i; Indulgent^a^ nihil esse
credit; Per^grinantes ^om^m fatui sunt. P^ral^ipom. Abbatis Vrsp^rgens.
That the best Interpreters o^ the Scriptures expound one place by another,
because men obtain not the spirit of Christ, but by the spirit of Christ. That
the Doctors, be they never so holy, are not to be believed for themselves, and
the Gloss as little. That, the Elect are saved only by the mercy of God.
That Popes Indulge^ces, auricular Confession, and Pilgrimages to Rome a^e
vain. For holding these and the like propositions he was sharply handled by
the Inquisitours; he is charged by Parsons, but unjustly, to have held the old
error of the Gre^kes, Math. Sutcliff^s Answer to Parsons t^ird p^rt of the
three convers. book 1 chap^ 3.
Who deny the Holy Ghost to proceed from the Son, as well as the Father.

There lived at the same time (but somewhat younger) Doctor Wesellus of
Gronning in Friz^land, he was called Lux Mundi, the light of that Age. He
wrote a set treatise of Papal Pardons and Indulgences; and therein he says
(grounding his speech on Gersons testimony) that Liquet ig^tur ex vene^a^i^^
huju^ vi^i sententia, i^^ulge^tia^ Pap^les non ^am ^e^t^m si^num remiss^^^^^
esse quam perfectam (...) ri^ionem cordis inter hoc (...) lares contriti.
Wess^l de po^estate Romans in Indulgent. cap. 4. page 579.
Papal Indulgences and Pardons are not so sure a token of the remiss^on o^ a
man's sin, as is the true contrition of heart. He says, that Doctores antiqui
nihil express scripserunt, quia (...) abusus nondum temporibus Augustini,
A^bro^ij, Hi^r^^^mi, Gregorij ^^repserat. Id. Ibid. c. 7.
The ancient Doctors wrote nothing expressly of Popes Pardons, because this
abuse was not crept into the Church, in the days of Saint Austine, Ambrose,
Hierome, and Gregorie^ And having consulted both with Civilians and Canonists,
he cannot find them to make Jubilees, and Pardons, ancienter than Pope Boniface
the eight, who lived about the year 1300.

It is now time to look homeward, and to acquaint the Reader with our
homebred Confessors and Martyrs. I will begin with the reign of King Henry
the fourth, who was (I take it) the first English King that put any to death
for denying the Romish doctrine: for after that Richard the second was deposed,
and that this Henry came violently to the Crown, he was willing to keep in
with the Clergy, who in those times ba^e great sway.

In this Kings reign, Acts and Monuments, Book 6. page 515. volum. 1
William Sawtree a Priest, was burnt for denying the real presence; and so
also was John Badby burnt, for being a Wicklevist, or Lollard, as they termed
i^. William Thorpe, Priest, and John Purvey, were persecuted for the doctrine
of the Sacrament. Waldensis called this Purvey, The Lollards Library, and a
Gloss upon Wickliffe.

Now these men Gabr. Powel. in Praefa^. ad lib. de Antic^^isto^
were not void of Learning and knowledge, for Sawtree was an Oxford Divine,
Thorpe was Fellow of our Queens College in Oxford; Purvey was Master of Arts
in Canterbury College, and wrote a Commentary on the Apocalypse whiles he was
in Prison.

In the time of King Henry the fifth^ Sir John Old Castle was a chief Favourer
of the Wickliffians. This Sir John, by his Marriage contracted with a Kinswoman
of the Lord Cobhams of C^uling in Kent, obtained the title thereof. He was (as
Friar Walsingham a peevish enemy of his, says) Erat iste Ioannes fortis
vi^b^s, ope^i Ma^tio sati^ id^neu^. R^gi prop^e^ probitatem ch^rus and
acceptu^^ sed tamen propter haere^^cam pravitat^m valde suspectus. Walsing. in
Henr. 5. page 382.
A very valorous Gentleman, and in specia^^ favor with his Prince, for his
honest Conversation, though held in some jealousy in point of Religion.

He wrote his belief which was very Christian-like, but the Prelates accepted
not of it; so that diverse crimes were devised against him, and at last he was
pronounced an Heretic in the point of the Sacrament, and was executed by the
Statute of Lollardie.

Walsingham says, Ecce domi^e Ioannes in hac schedula vestra plu^a ^ona
continen^ur, ac satia Catholica, sed habens terminum ad responde^dum super
ali^s. Id ibid pa 383.
That this Sir John being brought before the Archbishop of Cante^bury, he
took out of his bosom A copy of the Confession of his Faith, and delivered
it to him to read, which the Archbishop having read, said, That it contained
in it much good and Catholic matter; but yet he must satisfy him touching
other points: the same Walsingham saith^ that Ali^erqu^ se^tit et docet de
Sacramenti^ Altaris, and Poenitentiae, Pe^eg^inationibus, and adorationibus
im^ginum, ac clavibus, quam Romana Eccl^sia docet and affirmat. Ibid.
It was alleged against him, that he held and taught, touching the Sacrament
of the Altar, and Penance, Pilgrimages, Adoration of Images, and the Power of
the Keys, otherwise than the Church of Rome taught.

(...) says) La q^al mo^te suppo^^^ta (...) ^onstante. (...) lib. 3 p 93.
They constantly endured their death. Whiles Savonarola was in durance he
wrote excellent meditations upon the Psalms; and therein in the matter of free
Ius^ification he is very sound, and cl^are on our side. The E^le of Mirandula
accounted him an holy Prophet, and d^s^nded him, and his Writings: the like
also did that rare Scholar Marsilius Ficinus. Philip de Commi^^es that
^xcellent Statesman, and Histo^ian, was well acq^ainted with him, and had
often conference with him: For my part (says he) (...) p. 338.
I hold him to be an honest man, and a good: he co^nted him also to have had
the spirit of p^ophecie, (...). Id. I^id Ch^pit^e 53.
inasmuch as he foretold many things, which in event ^roved true, yea such
things as no mortal man could naturally have known; For he foretold the
French King my Master (says Comminees) that after his sons death, the King
himself should not long survive him; and these his Letters to the King my
self have read.

PA.
Parsons says, The (...) p^^t of the t^ree Co^ve^s. Chap. 9. nu. 9, 10.11^12.
That Savonarola was put to death for moving and maintaining of sedition in the
Commonwealth of Florence, though in all matters of Religion he agreed fully
with the Catholic Roman Church.

PRO.
What his Religion was, let his own works testify: Guicci^rdine says, (...)
Do^t^ina sua (...) Catolica. (...) li^ 3. page 94.
that among^^ other things h^e was charged, That his doctrine was not fully
Catholic, he means Roman Catholic; and Comminees says, (...), q^id (...)
Fre^e (...) l' appellant he^^t^que. Phil. Comm^es, C^^nique du Cha^les 8. cap 5.
That one of the Friar Minorites, his professed adversary, charged him to be an
Heretic; so that in his opinion, he was not in each point a Roman Catholic.
And to take the Popes proces^e which was published against him, as we find it
in Guicciardine; Therein it is given out, that Savonarola had a holy desire,
^he per opera sua si ^onvo^^ss^ il Con^ilio u^iv^^sa^e^ nel qual^ (...) stata
d^lla (...) Hist. (...) page 95.
that by his means a General Council might be called, wherein the corrupt
customs of the Clergy might be reformed, and the estate of the Church of God,
so far wandered, and gone astray (might be reduced, so far forth as was
possible) to the likeness of that it was in the Apostles time, or those that
were nearest unto them, and if he could bring so great and so profitable a
work to effect, he would think it a far greater glory, then to obtain the
Pope-dome it self: in the same Process it is contained, Disprezzato
i^commandamenti d^l ponte^ice, aff^rmando le cen^ure publi^ate contro lu^
^ss^re i^ju^te ^t invalide. Id. ibid. page 94.

Non per revelatione divina, ma per opinion^ propria fondata sulla do^trina,
and oss^rvatione dell^ Scrittura sacra. Ibid. page 95.


how he despised the Popes commandments, and returned publicly to his ol^
office of preaching, affirming that the (Pop^s) censures published against him
were unjust and of no force: as also that the matters by him prophesi^d, were
not pronounced by divine revelation, but by his proper opinion grounded upon
the doctrine, and observation of holy Scripture.

And now let the Reader consider by that which Guicciardine reports of
Savonarola, and namely touching the opinion he had of the Popes authority, and
his excommunications; touching general Councels, and the deformity and
degeneration of the Churches state, in respect of antiquity; as also what
Comminees says, of his preaching of the Reformation of the Church, and that by
the Sword as formerly our Grosthead Bishop of Lincoln foretold, and then let
him judge of what profession he was likely to be.

Now for the point of faction and sedition: It is true inde^d that there was a
great faction in Florence, not only amongst the Laity, but the Spiritualty
al^o; but it does not appear that Hierome, was the Author or nourisher of this
discord, or that he had any hand in that tumult Amazzarono Francesco ^alori
p^imo de fauto^i d^^ Savonarola. Id. page 95.
wherein Francisco Valori, a principal favourer of Savonarola, was slain.

When Saint Paul preached the Gospel in Asia, the whole City of Eph^sus was
full of confusion, and they rushed into the Common place, and caught Gajus and
Aristarchus, Paul's companions of his journey. Act. 19. ver. 29. Was Paul, or
his companions the occasion of this tumult? Savonarola preached the word of God
in Florence, his adversaries took Arms, entered the Monastery of Saint Mark
where he was, and drew him, and two of his brethren, Dominick and Silvester,
out of the Covent, and put them into the common prisons, upon occasion of a
mutiny in the City; but Hierome and his f^llowes occasioned not this tumult.

It was indeed p^^tended tha^ he sided with the one faction in Florence, but
Philip de Comminees (who knew him better than Pa^sons) touches that which
brought the Fr^er to the s^ake; nam^ly, In that he proph^sied, and that so
vehemently and freely of the coming in of foreign forces, and of a King that
by force of Arms should reform the corrupt state of the Church, and chastise
the Tyrants of Et dis^it que l^ ^oy (...) de Die^ pou^ r^^orme^ l' Eglise par
for^e, chastier les t^rans. Et ^ ^au^e de ce (...) disoi^ seavo^r les (...) par

d^ plu^i^urs d^ la vill^ de Floren^e. P^^l de Comine^s, cap. 5^^ qu^ su^^a.
Italy: this was it (says he) which made the Pope, and the state of Florence
hate him.

Thus have we heard of his life and death, there remains nothing now but his
Epi^aph, wherewith Flaminius, a famous Poet of Italy has honored him.

And thus it is, Dum fera fla^ma tuos Hieronyme pascitur artus.
Religio flevit dilani^ta comas,
Flevit, et, o, dixit, crudeles parcite flammae,
Pa^ite, sunt isto viscera nostra rogo.


That is, Whiles Hi^rome to the fiery stake was led,
Religion tore her hair, and wept, and said,
You cruel flames, oh spare this tender heart,
For whiles he burns, Religion feels the smart.


And so I proceed to the several points in question.

has followed upon the contempt of holy Scripture, which doubtless is
sufficient for the government of the Church, for otherwise Christ had been an
unperfect Law give^, exper^e^ce will teach.

That Wickliffe affirms, that neither Friars nor Prelates may define a^y
thing in matters of faith, unless they have the au^hority of sacred Scripture,
or some special revelation, I dislik^ not, says Waldensis, Ved^tur infer^^
quod nulli fratr^s ^el Praelati quidq^am debeant in mate^ia fi^ei de^mire, nisi
ad hoc habu^^^^t Scripturae autho^itatem, v^l revelatione^ a spirit^ sancto

but his waywardness and craft I condemn, and think it necessary (lest we
wrest the Sc^^ptures, and err in the interpretation of them) to follow the
^radition of the Church, expounding them unto us and not to trust to our own
private and singular conceits. This is that which Vincentius Lirinensis long
since delivered.

Alphonsus Tostatus says, Qua^quam is^i libri ab Eccle^ia recipiantur ^oll^us
^uctoritat is solid sunt; id^o ad confirmandum and probandum, ^a quae in
^^^bi^^ venerint inutiles sunt Tostat. p^aefat. in lib^^ Paralipom. q. 2.
Although the books (in question) be received of the Church, yet are they not
of any solid au^hority; and therefore they are improfitable to prove, and
confirm those things which are called in question, according to Saint Hierome.

Thomas Waldensis cites out of Hierome, the Can^n of the old Testament in these
words: In 22. volumina supputantur quibus q^^si literis et exordijs in Dei
D^ctrina etc. Wald. doct. fide^. lib. 2 Art. 2^ circa initium.
As there are tw^nty two letters, by which we write in Hebrew all that we
speak; so there are accounted twenty two books, by which as letters, we are
instructed in the doctrine of God; and withal adds; That the whole
Canonical Scripture is contained in the two and twenty books.

Dionysius Carthusi^nus in writing upon Ecclesiasticus, says, Denique lib^r
iste non est de Canone id est inter s^ripturas Canoni^as co^puta^d^^ qua^vis de
^^us ve^itate n^^ dubitatur Di^nys Carth. prolog. in Ecclesiast.
That book is not of the Conon (that is) amongst the Canonical Scriptures,
although there be no doubt made of the truth of that book. This is likewise
confessed by Pererius the Jesuit, saying, Miro^ m^g^^ Ni^. de Lira, et Dion.
Carthusianum, quinon n^gant ^as historia^ esse veras ^^d nega^t ^as ^am^ ad

Dionysius Carthusianus, and Lyra, do not deny the History of Susanna to be
true, but they deny the books of Judith, Tobit, and the Maccabees to apertaine
to the Cononicall Scriptures. And the like observation touching Lyra, is made
by Picus Mirandula; and Job. ^^^pic. Mi^^a^d ^heor^m 5. de Fide ^t ord. C^^d.

Picus himself would have us note, that many things which in the Decrees are
reckoned for Apocryphal, and so accounted by Hierome, are nevertheless read
in the Divine Service, and many things also which some hold not to be tru^.

Of Communion under both kinds; and number of Sacraments.
The Council of Constance did not simply forbid the ministering of the Sacrament
in both kinds, but the teaching of the people, that of necessity it must be so
ministered; for so we find in the thirteenth Session of the said Council,
Council. Constable. ^ess. 13
That if any should obstinately maintain, that it was unlawful, or ^rronious
to receive in one kind, he ought to be punished, and driven out as an Heretic.

Gerson, howsoever he thought, that the Church might lawfully prescribe the
communicating in one kind alone, (wherein we cannot excuse him) yet he
acknowledges, Deb^t con^edi quod ^^^q^ando potu^t fi^ri. and factum est sine
peccato, imo ^um merito, quod aliqui L^ici communicarent sub ut^a^que specie.
Gerson. t^act. de Communione sub utr^que specie. part. 1.
That the Communion in both kinds was anciently used.

The Council of Basil Council. Basil Sess. 30.
permitted the Bohemians to continue the use of the Communion in both kinds,
upon condition, Cum ea condition ut crederent Co^munionem sub una esse
^^citam. Bell^r. li. 4. de Euchar cap. 26. Secundo Ex Ae^. Sylv. hist. Bo^em.
cap. 52. and Genebra^d. lib. 4. ^hron.
That they should not find fault with the contrary use, nor sever themselves
from the Catholic Church.

a Preacher of Prague, being admonished by Petrus Dresdensis, after he had
searched into the writings of the ancient Doctors, and by name Dionysius, and
Saint Cyprian, and finding in them, the communicating of the Cup to the Laity
commanded, he thenceforth exhorted the people by no means to neglect, or omit
the receiving the Communion of the Cup.

Cardinal Bessarion, Bishop of Tusculum, professes in express terms:

We read only of two Sacraments, which were plainly delivered in the Gospel.

Of the Eucharist.
Waldensis says, Primi Conv^^sion^m (...) p^r viam identificationis
supposito^um efficient; secundi per viam impanationis; tertij per viam
appellationis figuralis and tropi^ae, ^um quibus concurrit Wicleff. Via
impanationis in^^^ntum placuit Guidoni, ut si fo^et Papa ^psam decerneret
eligendam. Tho. Waldensis de sacram Euchar. cap 64. tom. 2.
That some supposed the Conversion that is in the Sacrament, to be, in that the
bread and wine are assumed into the unity of Christ's person: some thought it
to be by way of Impanation; and some by way of Figurative and Tropical
appellation.

The first and second of those opinions, found the better entertainment in
some men's minds, because they grant the essential presence of Christ's body,
and yet deny not the presence of the bread still remaining to sustain the
appearing Accidents.

These opinions he reports to have been very acceptable to many, not without
sighs, wishing the Church had Decreed, That men should follow one of them.
Whereupon John Paris writes, That this way of Impanation so pleased Guido the
Carmelite, sometime Reader of the Holy Palace, that he professed, if he had
been Pope, he would have prescribed and commanded the embracing of it.

Petrus de Alliaco Cameracens^^ 4. Sent. quest. 6. a^t. 2. lic^t ita esse non
s^qua^ur evidenter ex Sc^iptura.
the Cardinal, profess^th, that for ought he can see, the substantial
Conversion of the Sacramental elements, into the body and blood of Christ,
cannot be proved either out of scripture, or any determination of the universal
Church, and makes it but a matter of opinion, inclining rather to the other
opinion, of Consubstantiation. His words are these, Pa^et quod i^^e modus sit
possibilis, nec repugnat rationi, nec authoritati Bibliae, im^ faci^^or ad
intelligend^ et rationabilio^ quam etc. Camerace^s. in 4. Sent. qu. 6. art. 2.
page 265. lit. F.
That manner or meaning, which supposes the substance of bread to remain
still, is possible; neither is it contrary to reason, or to the authority of
the Scriptures; nay it is more easy, and more reasona^ble to conceive, than
that which says, the Substance does leave the Accidents. And of this opinion
no inconvenience does seem to ensue, if it could accord with the Churches
determination. And he adds, That the opinion which holds the substance of
bread to remain, does not ^vidently follow of the Scripture, nor in his
seeming, of the Churches determination.

Biel says, Non inven^tur ^xpressum in Canon^ Bibliae, unde de hoc antiquit us
suerun^ diversae ^piniones. Bi^^. in Canon. Mis^ae. ^ect. 40.
It is not expressed in the Canon of the Bible, how the body of Christ is in
the Sacrament, and hereof anciently there have been diverse opinions.

Cajeta^ says, Dico autem ab Eccl^sia q^um non apparea^ ex ^vangelio ^^acti^um
aliqu^d ad intellige^dum haec verba prop^ie. Ca^etan. in 3. part. Thom. qu. 75.
a^t. ^.
that secluding the Churches authority, there is no written word of God
sufficient to enforce a Christian to receive this doctrine [of
Transubstantiation.]

Saurez the Jesuit ingeniously professes, Ex Catholici^ sol^^ Cai^tanus in
Commentario ^ujus articul^ qu^ ^^ssu ^ij v. in Romana editio^e expu^ctu^ est,
d^cuit, se^^usa ecclesi^ authoritate ve^ba i^^a al veritatem han^ confirmandam
non suffice^e. Su^rez to^. 3. Disp. 46. ^erti^.
that Cardinal Cajetan in his Comment^rie upon this Article, did a^^irme, that
those words of Christ. [ This is my Body] do not of themselves sufficiently
prove [ Transubstantiation] without the Churches authority: and therefore by
the Commandment of Pius Quintus, that part of his Commentary is left out in
the Roman Edition.

By this it appears, that their learned Council of Schoolmen who lived in
this Age, were not fully agreed upon the point.

Of Images, and Prayer to Saints.
Abulensis Quaedam suot qu^e nec in statu^ nec in figura co^grue assigna^^
possunt, sicut Trinita^ beata. Abulens. in De^t. 4. quaest. 5.
was so far from allowing the worship of Images, as that he held it a thing
unlawful in it self, Deuteronomy. 4.16. secluding Adoration, to make any visible
Image or representation of God according to his de^ty: for hence (says he)
these In imaginib^s ^ignan^ibus Deum pu^e, s^ilice^ trinitatem, duo
inconvenientia siqui possunt; primum, Idolatria, ne etiam Im^go colatur;
secundum, error et haeresis, scilice^ attribuere D^^ illam Corporieta^em, and
essentiale^ differentiam, qualem tres i^^as siguras sign^re canspi^imus Id
Ibid. quaest 4
two inconveniences will follow: First, The Peril of Idola^rie, in case, the
Image it self should come to be adored: and Secondly, Error and Heresy,
whiles one shall as^ribe to God such bodily shapes and forms, as the Trinity
^s usually pictured withal.

Now that Abulensis with others held it unlawful to picture or repres^nt the
Trin^tie, is acknowledged by Bellarmine, saying, Bell^r. de Imag. Sanct. lib.
2. cap. 8. Hae^ opinio Calvi^^ est aliquorum Catholicarum.
It is Calvin's opinion in the first book of his Institutions, cap 11. that it
is an abominable sin to make a ^^sible and bod^ly Image of the invisible and
incorporeall God; and this opinion of Calvin's is also the opinion of some
Catholic Doctors, as Abulensi^ [upon 4. Deuteronomy. quest. 5.] and Durand [upon 3.
did. 9. qu. 2.] and Peresius, in his book of ^raditions.

Gerson condemned all m^king of an Image, or portraiture, appointed or
accommoda^ed to worship and aadoration^ saying, Ad adorandum ig^ur and colendum
prohibe^tur imagines fieri. Gerson in compend. Theolog. de 1. pr^^^^pto. in
secund^ part oper.
Thou shall ^ot adore them, nor worship them; which are thus to b^
distinguished, Thou shall not adore them; that is, With any bodily reverence,
or bowing, or kneeling to them; Thou shall not worship them with any devotion
of mind. Images therefore are prohibited to be either adored or Worshipped.

The same Gerson disliked Iudicate si tanta Imaginum and pic^urarum in
Eccl^sijs var^tas expe^iot, and an pl^^es simpli^^s nonnu^qua^ (...). G^rson
(...). defect. viro^um Ec^l^si^st. part 2 Over.
the variety of pictures and Images in Churches, occasioning Idolatry in the
simple.

If Christians were in no pe^ill of Idolatry by worshipping Images, why does
Gerson complaine^ H^n^ superstitiones in populis quae Religion^^ inf^^^unt
Chisti^^^^, d^m sicut ^lim Iudei solo si^na qu^runt, dum Imaginibus exhibent

that Superstition had infected Christian Religion, an^ that people, like
Iewes^ did only s^eke after Signs, and yield Divine honor to Images.

Cassander writes in this manner: Sa^io^ thus Sch^l^sti^is d^sp ic^t sententia
Thom^, qui^^nset ^magi^em eadem ^d^ratione ^ol^nda^, qua^es ipsa ^^litur quae
^magine signifi^atur; in q^i^us ^st Durandus, et R^b. Holc^t. Gabriel qu^que

Imago, neque ut consideraturin se (...) q^od lignum est, l^pis (...) m^t^llum,

Cas^and. Consult. de Ima^in.
The opinion of Thomas Aquinas, who holds, that Images are to be wo^shipped,
as their Samplers, is disliked by sound^r Sc^oolemen, amongst whom is Durand,
Holcot, and Gabriel ^iel.

Biel reports the opinion of them which say, that an Image, neither as it is
considered in it self mater^ally, nor yet according to the nature of a Sign
or Image, is to be worshipped.

And he says well, that this opinion of Thomas was disliked of others; for
besides those already mentioned; this was one of the Problems which Picus
Mirandula proposed to be maintained by him at Rome, namely; that Nec cr^x
Christi, ne^ ull^ Im^g^ ado^anda e^t ad^rat^one L^trie, eti^m ^o m^d^ quo p^ni^
Thomas. (...) M^rand Conclusiones t^m 1.
Neither the Cross, nor any other Image was to be worshipped with Latria, or
Divine worship, no not in that sense as Thomas would have it. And when othe^s
carped at this, and other his Assertions touching ^he Sacrament of the
Eucharist, himself made his own Apology, and defense.

Touching Invocation of Saints, though Gerson did not absolutely condemn it,
yet he reprehendeth the abuses and s^pers^i^ious observations, then prevailing
in the worshi^ping of S^ints, very bitterly. For in his Consolato^y tract of
Rectifying the Heart, amongst many other consid^rations he complains, Ge^s^n
de dire^^i (...) Co^d^^ ^^ns^de^at ^6.
That ^h^re is incollerable ^uperstitio^ in the worshipping of Saints,
innumerable observations without all ground of reason, vain credulity, in
believing things concerning the Saints, reported in the uncertain Legends of
their lives, superstitious opinions of obtaining Pardon and remission of
sins, by saying so many Pater nosters in such a Church, before such an Image;
as if in the Scriptures and Authentical writings of holy men, there were not
sufficient direction for all acts of piety and devotion, without these
frivolous Additions.

Gabriel Biel in his Lectures upon the Canon of the Mass, says, Dicendum quod
sancti in Patria qui de facto in coelis sunt, naturali cognitime pura
vespertina, quae est cognitio reru^ in proprio genere, nullas orationes nostrum
in terae consistentium, neque mentales, neque vocales cognoscunt, propter
immoderatam distantiam ^^tor nos and ipsos. Gabr. Biel. in Canone Missae. Lect.
31.
That the Saints in Heaven, by their natural knowledge, which is the knowledge
of things in their proper kind, know no Prayers of ours that are here upon
earth, neither mental nor vocal, by reason of the immoderate distance that is
betwixt us and them. Secondly, Non est de ratione beatitudinis esse^tialis; ut
nostras orationes, au^ alia facta nostra, matutina cogni^ione videant in verbo.
Id ibid.
That it is no part of their essential beatitude, that they should see our
prayers, or our other actions in the eternal word; and thirdly, Vtrum autem
videre n^stra^ orationes pertineat ad eorum beatudinem accidentalem, non per
omnia certum est. Ibid.
That it is not altogether certain, whether it do appertain to their
accidental felicity to see our Prayers. At length he concludes, Vnde
probabiliter dicitur, q^. licet non necessa^io sequitur ad sanctorum
beatitudinem, ut orationes nostras audiant de co^gruo; tamen Deus eis revelat
omnias quae ipsis offeruntur. ibid.
That it may seem Probable, that although it do not follow necessarily upon
the Saints beatitude, that they should hear our Prayers of congruitie, yet it
may seem probable, that God reveals unto them all those suits, which men
present unto them.

By this we see that for the maine, Gabriel concludes; that the Saints with
God, do not by any power of their own, by any natural, or evening knowledge
whatsoever, understand our prayers mental or vocal; they and we are d^sparted
so far asunder, as there can not be that relation between us; so that we
might happily call, and they not be Idonei auditores, not at hand to hear us.

Now as learned Master Mountague, now Lord Bishop of Chichester says, Master
Richard Montagu, now L. Bishop of Chichester, his Treatise of the Invocation of
Saints. page 129.
The Saints their natural or evening knowledge only is that which we must
trust unto, as being a lonely in their power to use and to dispose; and of
ordinary dispensation.

In a word, Peter Lombard says, Pet. Lombard. Sent. lib. 4. did. 45.
It is not incredible, that the souls of Saints hear the prayers of the
suppliants.

Biel says Bi^l in Canon. Missae lect. 31.
, (as we have heard:) That it is not certain but it may seem probable, that
God reveleth unto Saints all those suits, which men present unto them: here is
nothing but probability and uncertain^y; nothing whereon to ground our praying
to Saints.

Of Justification and Merits.
Trithemius the Abbot, who lived in this age complains, that Cr^brius
Philosophos Gentili^m quam Christ^ Apostolos all^^^ntes; ut in Cathedra Christi
crebrius Aristoteles ^it^tur in medium quam Paulus ^ut Petrus -- veram number
igitur ^ Kymolane, quaeramus sapienti^m, quae in Sol^ Fide Domin^ nostri Ies^
Christi formata consillit. Trithem. epist. Familiar. epist. 26. ad Kymola^.
Aristotle and the heathen Philosophers were oftener alleged in the Pulpit,
than Saint Peter and Saint Paul; and therefore he disswades his friend
Kymolanus from too much study of profane sciences: Let us (says he) seek
after true and heavenly wisdom, which consists in faith only in our Lord
Jesus Christ, working by love.

Cardinal Cusanus in a treatise of his De pace fidei, brings in Dialogue-wise,
Saint Peter and Saint Paul instructing the several nations of the world,
Greeks and Arabians; the French and the Almanies, Tartarians and Armenians;
and there in that conference he labors to bring them to an agreement In
pace fidei, in the unity of faith; and amongst other things he proves Paulus
quid igitur justificat cum qui iustitiam assequitur? Tartarus. Non merita,
ali^s non esset gratia, sed debitum^ Vis igitur quod sol^ Fides justific^t
adper^eptionem ^ternae vitae? Paul. Volo. Cusan. de P^ce fidei. cap. 25. page
876.
at large, That we are justified only by faith in Christ, and not by any merit
of our own works.

The doctri^e of free Justification is excellently handled by Savonarola in his
meditations upon the fiftieth Psalm, which Possevine Pridi^ quam d^ceretur ad
mortem, sc^ipsit inter imn^ne^^^^ supplicij angustias latin^ sermon 31, et 50
med^tationes. Possevin. in App^rat. tom. 1. verbo Hi^^onym. Savonar.
acknowledges, to be composed by him whiles he was in durance, the day before
he was led to the stake.

Upon occasion of those wo^ds of the Psalmist, They gat not the land in
possession through their own sword; neither was it their o^ne arm that helped
them, but thy right hand and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance;
because thou had a favor unto them, Psalm. 4^. ver. 3.4. ^e sweetly
comm^nteth on this sort; (...) quia vo^ui^. S^vonarol. in Psalm. 50. ve^s. 1.
Thou ^av^uredst them, that i^, they were not saved by their own merits or
works, l^st they should glory th^^ein; but even because of thy go^d will and
ple^sure. Upon occasion of that Petition of the Lords prayer, Forgive as our
trespasses, he renounceth all merit of his own works, and professes Vere
tanquam pa^nus menstraute sunt omnes ^ust^^^ae a^strae, [ E^ai. 64.6]
^^gitationum mal ^^um nostra^^^ nullus est numeras. Hieron. Savon^r. in orat.
Do^^nic. page 177.
in the words of the P^ophet Esaias, That all our righteousness is as the rags
of a menstruous woman.

Picus Mirandula treating on the same Petition says, it is certain that we
are not saved for our own merits, but by the only me^cy of our God.

Gerson taught that we are not justified by the perfection of any inherent
quality, Quia cert (...) est, quo^ ^os non salv^mur p^opt^r m^rlta nostra, sed
per s^^am Dei miseri o^dia^ P^e. Mirand. in orat. Dom. to 1
Quis gloriabit^r mundum ^or se habe^e? po^ro qui^ Esaias se cum ^eteris
i^volvens ^ibique vil^scens humili co^^^ssione prot^lerit l^gimus; om^es (...)
no^t (...) G^rson de Consolat. li 4. P^o^^ 1. (...)
that all our inherent righteousness is imperfect; yea, that it is like the
polluted rags of a menstruous woman, that it cannot endure the trial of Gods
severe judgment; even Esaias himself with the rest became vile in his own
eyes, and pronounces this lowly confession, all our righteousness is as
filthy rags.

The Cardinal of Cambray proves (...). 1^ Sent. Dull. 1. qu. 2.
by many reasons and authorities of Scrip^u^e, That no act of ours, from how
great charity soever it proceed, can merit eternal life of condignity. And
whereas God is said to give the kingdom of h^aven for good merits or good
works; the Cardinal for clearing hereof delivers us this distinction; ^aec
dict ^, Propter, (...) capi^^r Conse^^ti^e; and tun^ den^tat ordinem
consecutiones uni^s rei ad aliam quand^que vero capitur Cau^alites^ Pet.
C^meracens. in 1. S^n^. Dist^ 1 qu. 2. art. ^.
That the word Propter, or for, is not to be taken Causally, as if good works
were the efficient cause of the reward, as fire is the cause of heat; but
improperly, and by way of consequence, noting the order of o^e thing following
o^ another; signifying that the reward is given after the good work, and not
but after it, yet no^ for it: (...) ad p^^es^ntiam esse unius sequitur esse
alteri^s non ^am^s vnt^tejus ne^ ex natur^rei sed ex sola vo^unta^e alterius^
and s^ actus (...) dicitur cau^a (...) praemij. Id in 4. Sent. qu. 1. ar^. 1.
so that a meritorious act is said to be a cause in respect of the rew^rd, as
Causa sine qu^ non also is said to be a ca^se, though it be no cause properly.

Thomas Walden professes plainly his dislike of that saying: Qu^d homo (...)
(...) est dign^^ (...), aut h^^ grai^^^ vel (...) g^ori^; quam^is qui^am
S^^olastici inve^^runt ad hoc dicendum terminos de condigno and cong u^.
W^ldens. tom 3. ^^ Sacram. tit. 1. cap. 7.
That a man by his merits is worthy of the kingdom of heaven, of this grace or
that glory: ho^s^ever certain schoolmen, that they might so sp^ake, had
invented the terms of Condignity and Congruity. But Reputo igitur saniorem
Theologum, fidelio^em catholicum, et Scripturis sanctis magis concorde^; qu^
^ole meritum simpliciter a^negat, et cu^ mo^^sic^tione Apostoli, and
scriptur^rum concedit, quia simpliciter quis non mer^tur regnum coeloru^, sed
ex gratia D^i, aut volu^tate la^gi^oris. ^b.
I repute him (says he) the sounder Divine, the more faithful Catholic, and
more consonant with the holy Scriptures, who does simply deny such merit, and
with the qualification of the Apostle and of the Scriptures, confesses, that
simply no man meriteth the kingdom of heaven, but by the grace of God, or will
of the Giver: Si^ut om^es sancti pr^ores ^sque ad recentes Scholast^cos, and
comm^nis scripsit Eccles^^ Ibid.
as all the former Saints, until the late Schoolmen, and the Universal
Church has written.

Out of which words of Waldens we may further observe (says the learned and
Right Reverend Doctor Usher, Archbishop of Armag^) Bi^^^p Vshe^s answer ^o the
Iesu^s Challenge Tit of Me^^t. p 581
both the time when, and the persons by whom this innovation was made in these
later days of the Church: namely, that the late Schoolmen were they, that
corrupted the ancient doctrine of the Church, and to that end devised their new
terms of the merit of Congruity and Condignity.

Paulus Burgensis, expounding those words of David, Psalm. 36.5. Thy mercy O
Lord is in heaven (or reaches unto the heavens) writes thus. Gloria^
coelestem nu^lus de condigro secundum lege^ communem m^re^ur -- Et sic
manifestum est, quo^ ^a coelo m^xime (...) misericordia Dei in beatis. Paul.
Burgens. addition. ad ^yran. in Psalm. 35.
No man according to the common Law can merit by condignity the glory of
heaven. Whence the Apostle says in the 8. to the Romans, that the sufferings
of this time are not worthy to be compared with the future glory which shall be
revealed in us. And so it is manifest, that in heaven most of all the mercy of
God shines forth in the blessed.

I will close up this point, as also this age, with that memorable saying of
Ernestus, Archbishop of Magdeburg, lying on his deathbed Quinquennio o^^e
Luther. Job. ^ Munster in Vortlage heredi^^^ij, discurs. Nobilis. Propos. 3. ad
Ann. 1512.
some five years before Luther showed himself: Keimich ^rawe, ich begere ewer
work nirge^ts Qu^ Mein^s He^ren Christi we^ke mussens assein thun^ Daraus
v^rl^sse ich mi^h. Catalog test. verit. lib. 19. ad ve^bum, I trust no b^dy, I
d^e not desire your wo^kes, to any thing, the works of my Lord Christ ^holly
must do it, on those I rely.
It is witnessed by Clement Scha^, Chaplain to the said Archbishop, and one
who was present at his death; that a Friar Minor used this speech to the
Archbishop: Take a good heart most worthy Prince, we communicate to your
excellency all the good works not only of our selves, but our whole order of
Friar Minors; and therefore doubt not, but you receiving them, shall appear
before the tribunal Seat of God righteous and blessed. Whereunto the
Archbishop replied; By no means will I trust upon my own works. or yours,
but the works of Christ Jesus alone shall suffice, upon them will I repose my
self.

THE SIXTEENTH CENTVRIE, From the year of Grace, 1500. to 1600.
Of Martin Luther.
PAPIST.
WHat say you of this sixteenth Age?

PROTESTANT.
We are now (by Gods assistance) come to the period of time, which was agreed
upon in the beginning of our conference; to wit, to the days of Martin Luther;
for about the year of Grace 1517, he began to teach, and Preach against
Indulgences. And withal I have produced a Catalogue of our professors, unto
this present sixteenth Centurie.

PA.
Stay your self; you must ( says Master Prot. Apolog. tract. 2. chap 2. Sect.
11. sub. 3.
Brerely) show us your professors during the twenty years next before Luther.

PRO.
It is done already; for besides our English Martyrs, we have produced
Trithemius the Abbot, and Savonarola, both which lived within the time
mentioned, and held with us the Article of free Justification; and Savonarola
(howsoever the matter be otherwise colored) was burnt for Religion in the
year 1498.

Besides, there have been in all Ages, and in the time mentioned, such as held
the substantial Articles of our Religion, both in the Roman, and Greek
Church; and by name, the Grecians in common with us, have openly denied the
Popes Supremacy, Purgatory, private Masses, Sacrifices for the dead; and
defended the lawfulness of Priests marriage.

Likewise, in this Western part of the world, the Scholars of Wickliffe,
called Lollards, in England, the Tabo^ites in Bohemia, and Waldenses in France,
maintained the same doctrine in substance with our modern Protestants, as
appears by a Confession of the Waldensian Faith, set forth Responsio

Neither did these whom we have produced dissemble their Religion; but made
open profession thereof, by their Writings, Confessions, and Martyrdomes, as
also their just Apologies are extant, Acts and Monum. vol. 1. lib. 6. page 812.
to clear them from the Adversaries imputation.

PA.
I thought Luther had been the first founder of your Religion; for there be
some of your men who call Bu^^r in epist ad Episcop. Hereford. prot. Apo^.
tract. 2. ^ap. 2. sect. 11.
him the first Apostle of the reformed doctrine.

PRO.
Luther broached not a new Religion, he only drained and refined it from the
Lees and dregs of superstition; he did not form or found a new Church which
was not in being, but only reformed and purged that which he found, from the
soil^ of errors, and disorders.

When Hilkiah the Priest, in Iosiah's time, 2. King. 22
found out the book of God; he was thereby a means to bring to light, what
the wicked proceedings of Manasses, Amon, and others, had for a season
smothered; and so did Luther, he was the instrument whom God used for the
farther enlightening his Church; and yet hereupon it no more follows that he
was the first that preached our Religion, than upon the former, that Hi^kiah
first preached the Law.

The Protestants Church by Luthers means began no otherwise in Germany, than
health begins to be in a body, that was formerly sick, and overcharged, and
now recovered.

So that in respect of doctrine necessary to salvation, the Church in her Firm
members (as Saint Austine speaks) Etiam tun^ suis firmissimis eminet Ecclesia.
August epist 48. tom. 2.

Quid^m fideles fi^missimi ^ur^aba^tu^. Aug Epi. 80. Quid^m ^^miss^mi p^o ^ide

Sic Ecclesiai^ F^um^ntis Dominicis conserva^a est. Ibid.


was the same before Luther, and afterward; and it began to be by his means
only according to a grea^er measure of knowledge, and freedom from such
corruptions, as formerly (like ill humors) oppressed it, and ove^charged it.
The Pro^estants Church then is the same with all good and sound Christians that
lived before them, and succeeds the sound members of the visible Church, that
kept the life of true Religion in the substantial matters of Faith and
Godliness, though otherwise those times were da^kened with a thick mist of
errors.

Now whereas some call Luther the first Apostle of the reformed doctrine, they
did not ther^by intend, that he was the first that ever preached the doctrine
of the r^formed Churches; for they could not be ignorant, that after Christ and
his Apostles, and the Fathers of the first five Ages, Bertram, and A^lfricke,
and Berenger, Peter Bruis, and Henry of Toulouse, Dulcinus, and An^ldus, and
Lollardus, Wickliffe, Husse, Hierome of Prag^e and others stood for the same
truth which we profess; but their meaning was, that Luther was the first, who
in their Age and memory, publicly and succesfully set on foot a general
reformation of the Church in these Western parts.

And thus in a tolerable sense Luther may be called the first Apostle of the
Reformation, though not simply the first that preached the Protestants doctrine.

Bishop Jewel says, Apolog part. 4 cap. 4. di^^^. 2.
that in Luthers days, in the midst of the darkness of that Age, there first
began to shine some glimme^ing beam of truth; his meaning is not, that the
truth was then first revealed, but that by Luthers m^anes, it was manifested in
a fuller measure and degree of l^ght and knowledge, than it was in the f^rmer
and da^ker times of Popery; yea, he gives p^rticular instance of true
professors that were before Luther, namely; Saint Hilarie, Gregory, Bernard,
Pauperes de Lugduno, the ^ishops of Greece and Asia, as also Id. Part 4 page

Did Luther himself acknowledge he had any predecessors, or forerunners?

PRO.
I answer with my worthy and learned friend Doctor Featly, M^st^r ^^shers
R^^l^^tion, and Doct^r Featlyes Answer.
that Luther acknowledged the Waldenses (term^d fratres Pigardi) as appears by
his Preface before the Waldension Confession. I found (says he) in these men
a miracle, almost unheard of in the Popish Church; to wit, that these men
leaving the doctrines of men, to the utmost of their endeavor, meditated in
the Law of God day and night, and were very ready and skillful in the
Scriptures: whereas in the Papacy, the greatest Clerks u^terly neglected the
Scriptures. I could not but congratulate both them and us, that we were
together brought into one sheepfold.

Of John Husse and Hi^rome of Prague he says, Ioannem Hu^ and Hier^^ (...)

They burned John Husse and Hierome both Catholic men, they being themselves
Heretics and Apostates: and in his third Preface he says; he has heard
from men of credit, that Maximilian the Emperor was wont to say of John Husse:
Alas! alas! they did that good man wrong.

And Erasmus Roterodam in the first books which he printed (lying yet by me)
writes; ^o Hus exustum quidem, sed non convictum esse.
That Husse indeed was condemned and burned, but not convicted.

PA.
To what Church did Luther join himself? and why left he the Roman Church.

PRO.
He joined himself in point of faith, to the ancient Primitive and
Apostolic Church that went before him, and for his present Communion, to that
sound part of the Roman Church, which then with him, hated the corruptions,
which the Romish faction, for the maintenance of their pomp and profit had
upheld.

In particular, he joined himself to those honorable personages, the Dukes
of Saxony and Wittenberge, and the Earl of Mansfield, and to such Ch^istian
congregations as within their territories began to abandon Popery, and reform
themselves. He received Ordination in the Church of Rome; this ordination (for
substance) was good, and by virtue thereof he preached the word, and brought
the people to see and detest, not the Church of Rome, but her corruptions, from
whence he severed himself, to wit, from the Roman Court, and faction therein:
so that he leapt not out of the Church, he kept himself still within the
barne-floore thereof, only he leapt out of the husk of popish errors.

Now this his separation and ours from error ^s warranted by Gods word, since
Gods people are commanded, Apocalyp. 18.4.

that have commented on the Revelation, call Rome, Babylon; and that this is to
be understood not only of heath^n Rome, but of Rome Christian, after that it
had forsaken hea^henisme, and had received the faith of Christ, and turned
again from that unto Antichristianisme.

PA.
If any Protestant Church were in being before, or at Luthers appearing, then
would they upon his preaching, have acknowledg^d him, and joined themselves to
him; but ( as Bell^rmine says) B^ll^r. lib. a. de not. (...) 5.. ^rae^^re^^^i.
they did not.

PRO.

^si^^der, Stu^mius, and Ma^tin Bucer: and th^se (says he) seemed to have

that the applause of the world did much support him, most men being weary of
the frauds, and wicked p^actices of the Romanists.

Neither are these penurious examples, to give instance in Melanchton,
Pelican, Bucer, and others, as Brereley scornefully calls i^, Prot. Apol^
tract. 2. ^a. 2 sect. 11.
for they were as great scholl^rs as that age aff^^ded. P^llican was one who
made great help for r^viving the Hebrew tongue, and was Luthers ancient; and
so was Io^n Capnio, or Reuchlin, who brought Greek and Hebrew into Germany.

Now besides his c^evals, and contemporaries, the Wald^n^es, as also John H^sse
bare a torch before Luther, and showed him his way.

PA.
Master Brereley says, Id ibid page 443.
That Melanchton, P^lican, and Bucer were originally Catholics, and followed
Luthers example in revolting from the Catholic Church.

PRO.
Saint Paul was originally a Pharisee, and yet he did well to forsake the
leaven of their traditions, and embrace the doctrine of the Gospel. And so did
Saint Austin the Quem meum ^^rore^ nonnull^^ op^^^ula me^ satis ind^ca^t ante
^pis^opatum me^m s^^^pta. Aug de P^aedestinat. Sanct. cap. 3. tom 7.
error of the Manichees and Pelagians, and embraced the truth of the Gospel.

Besides, they left not the Catholic, but the Roman Church, nor that
altogether, but the faction that was therein, to wit, the papacy.

Schlus^elburg Theolog. Calvinist. lib. 2. page 130.
It is impudency to say, that many learned men in Germany did hold the
doctrine of the Gospel before Luther.

PRO.
Schlusselburgs words are these; Vtenhovius writes impudently, that he heard
Pelican affirm, that many learned men in Germany, held the doctrine of the
Gospel before Luther appea^ed, and that Pelican himself impugned the popish
purgatory, before the name of Luther was heard of. Now why may we not believe
Vtenhovius and Pelican affirm^ng the same, and being honest men, as well as
Schlusselburg denying it.

Besides, admit there were not any in Germany, yet there might be elsewhere
many thousands; as in Bohemia, France, and England, and other parts, who before
Luthers time, embraced the doctrine of the Gospel.

PA.
Master Brereley says Prot Apol. tract. 2. c^p 2. s^ct ^1. subd. 2. and P^op^.
Apol. the Conclus. S^ct. 9.
out of Luthers works, that upon a conference had with the Devil, Luther gave
over the Mass, and changed his Religion.

PRO.
Suppose this Conference were extant in all the Dutch copies of Luthers works
(which yet some make doubt of) yet might this conference be only imaginary,
even a strong spiritual (...), and not any personal or real conference: now
from such a spi^ituall conflict, dream or app^^ition, you cannot draw any
sound proof.

But (supposing the truth of this conference) had not Christ a con^^^^nce with
Satan, and Saint Bernar^ a combat with him Aff^it autem Satan (...) adv^^^^.
Au^hor vitae Bern^^d^. lib. 1. cap. 12.
? is their religion ere a whit ^he worse to be liked?

Your Romish Saints were very familiar with the Devil. Saint Oswald wrestled
with him; Saint Dunstane took him by the nose; Christopher in the Legend is
said to have served the Devil; and Saint Xavier was usually vexed with him
after Dinner, Supper, Recreation, and saying of Mass; insomuch as the Devil
often times put him into a cold sweat; as H^ssenmullerus Tur^ianus Iesuita mihi
notiss^mus saepe dixit illum [Z^vie^] a coena, pra^dio, Miss^. in
recreationibus eti^m ita a demonibus exagitatum, ut in magna copi. a
frigidissimum mortis sador^m fuderit Hassenmuller. Histor. Ie^uit^ci ordinis
cap. 11. page 427.
reports of him from Turrian the Jesuit.

PA.
The Devil brought arguments against saying of Mass, and disputed against it;
therefore the Mass is good, or else the Devil would not have found fault with
it.

PRO.
This follows not; for every thing the Devil mislikes, is not therefore
good, neither is all he moves one unto, therefore bad. For instance sake;
Aliqua de part nos allegavit [Deus] ut te duceremus in c^nobium sac^aram
virginum. Del^io. Disquisit. Magic. tom. 2. lib. 4. cap. 1. page 144.
he came in the habit of Saint Vrsula, and moved one to enter into the Order of
Nuns; will you say, therefore veiling of Nuns is bad?

PA.
Luther used the selfsame arguments against the Mass, which Satan did: now
how could they be good proofs that were brought in by Satan? or why would
Luther believe him?

PRO.
Luther shows only, how Satan tempted him to despair, for that he had been
a Masse-monger; which Luther knew to be naught without the Devils prompting.

Besides, all that the Devil speaks is not devilish: the Devils, that
possessed the men, confessed, and said, Luke 8. chap.
Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God; afterward they entered into the
Heard of Swine; now the Heardmen they came into the City, and told what was
done, and said, now what though the H^ard-men told how the Devils confessed
this Article of the Christian Faith, That Christ was the Son of the living
God? was not this a true confession, though the Heard-men had first heard it
from the Devils, and likewise reported it from them?

Luther heard such and such arguments against the Mass; might not those
arguments be true, though Luther hea^d them from Satan, Gods Ape?

It is true indeed that the Devil in telling truth, ha^h an evil intent; and
so it was here: for he labored to drive him to Despair, by accusing him for
saying M^sse, which now he condemned: and the more to terrify him, he lays
down Quid si tales missae horrenda essent Idololatria? Luther tom. 7. de Mis^a
priva^a. page 230.
reasons against it; thereby to let him see his old errors; and all this to
drive him to despair: thus Satan truly lays a man's sin before him, truly
accuses him; but it is to make him despair: as he dealt with Cain and Judas,
whose example Luther accordingly alleges upon this occasion. And this was
the end the Devil aimed at, as appears by Luthers own words, saying, Proinde
bone siater domine Papista non mentitur Satan quando accusat, aut urget
magnitudinem peccati -- sed ibi m^nti^ur Satan quando ultra u^get ut d^sperem
de grati^. id. ibid.
Satan lies not, when he lays a man's sin to his charge, and the
heynousnesse thereof; but then does Satan lie, when he would have me despair
of the mercy and favor of God.

Again, it is observable, where Luther was thus tempted^ not whiles he kept
in the Monastery, but when he was leaving it, and coming to the truth; then
the devil began to be busy with him, fearing that he had slipped his chain.

Lastly, mark the issue of this conference; in this conflict the devil was
foiled, and Luther won the field, and in effect makes this glorious conquest: I
Luther have sinned in saying private Masses without Communicants, contrary to
Christ's Institution^ but the devil lies in tempting me to dispai^e with
Cain; I will therefore with Peter be s^rry for my fault, and return to my
Savior.

PA.
Luther broke out into distempered passions, and was at odds with some of
Zuinglius his followers.

PRO.
What if Luther after the plain homeliness of a blunt German liberty, used
some over broad speeches? that he was too much carried with the violent
stream of his passion, it is to be imputed to humane infirmity, and the
perverseness of the manifold adversaries he found in those times.

Besides, there was as great unkindnesse Socrat hist. Eccles. lib. ^. cap. 13.
of old, between Chrysostom and Epiphanius, Hierome and Ruffinus, and others.

PA.
Bellarmine says Bellar. lib 4. de notis Eccles. cap. 13 eod^m.
out of Cochleus, that Luther began to oppose Indulgences, not because he had
any just reason to mislike them; but because the publishing of them was
committed to the Dominicke Friars, and not to the Augustine Friars, of which
order himself was.

PRO.
This is reported by his sworn enemy, and that against the whole course of
things that passed in those times. For Luther (before this occasion was offered
him) had cleared the doctrine of Original sin, of nature and grace, of
free will, and the like; which were the maine grounds wherein he dis^ented from
the Romish Synagogue.

Indeed he manifested his oposition chiefly against papal Indulgences; and he
had reason for it: for at that time things were in so bad a state, that the
blood of Christ was proph^n^d, the power of the Keys was made contemptible,
and the redemption of Souls out of Purgato^ie, was set at a Stak^ at Dice, by
the Pardonsellers, to be played for, as Guicca^di^e says; This bred great
indignation, and many scandals in diverse places, but (as he says) Havena
concitato ni mo^ti (...) indegnatione, and scand^io ass^i, and specialmente
nella Gemania, d^ne ^ molti de ministri er^^^ved^ta vender^ per poco prezz^ ^
gracan si sulle tavern la ^acu^ta de^ liberare l' anime d' (...) purgatori^
(...). histor. libro terzo decimo page 379.
especially in G^rmanie, where were discovered many of the Popes ministers
selling for a small price, or set upon a game at Tables in a Tavern, the power
to redeem the Souls of dead men out of Purgatory.

In like sort, that other noble Historian, Th^anus, of more credit than a
hundred Cochleusses, says, Peccatum in sacris maneribus dispensa^du, Leo
graviore ^umulavit, ^um Laurentij puccij Cardinalis impulsu, pec^niam ad
immensos sumptus undique corrogaret, missis per omnia Christiani orbis Regna
Diplomatis omnium delict^rum exp^atio^em ^c vitam aeternam polli^itus est,
constituto pi^tio, quod quisque pro peccati gravitate dependere^. Iac. Thuan.
Histor. sui Temp. ad ann. 1515.
that Pope Leo, by the instigation of Cardinal Puccius, gathered huge sums of
money, by sending his Breves abroad every where, promising exptation of all
sins, and life everlasting upon a certain price, which any should give
according to the ^eynousnesse of his offense. Then arose up Martin Luther a
professor of Divinity in Wittenberge, who first confuting, and then condemning
the Sermons which were made for Indulgences, at length questioned that power,
which the Pope assumed to himself in the same Breves.

PA.
Was Luther a man of an holy life?

PRO.
Erasmus who was well acquainted with him, says Et tamen ^i illi faverem ut
viro bono, quod fatentur et hosts. Erasm. tom. 3. in ^pist. ad Albert. Episc.
and Principem Moguntin. Cardinal. -- Illud video ut quisque vir est eptimus, it
a illius scriptis minime offendi. Id. Ibid.
that He was accounted a good man, even of his very enemies; and this I
observe (says the same Erasmus) That the best men are least offended with his
writings.

He had gained such reputation with the people, that (as Come se le
persecutioni n^s^^ssimo pi^ dalla innocenza della sua vita, and d^lla sani^a
d^lla do^trina ^heda altra ^agione. G^^cciard Histo^. It^l. lib. 13. page 380.
Guicciardine says) Many conceived, that the troubles which were raised
against ^uther, took their Original, from the innocence of his life, and
soundness of his doctrine, rather than upon any other occasion.

Erasmus seems to point at that which brought Luther to most of his troubles,
namely; for that he touched to close upon the Popes power, and Supremacy; as
also that he taxed their Indulgences and pardons which served for the
maintenance of their prelacy and Clergy; for thus it is reported Erasmus duo
magna esse Lutheri peccata dixit; quod ventres Mona^^^^^^, et Coronam P^pae
attigisset Charion in Chron. auct. a Pencero. lib. 5.
of him; that when he was asked by Frederick Duke of Saxony his Judgment of
Luther; he said, that there were two great faults of his, one, That he meddled
with the Popes Crown; another, That he meddled with the Monks Bellyes.

And let this suffice to be spoken by way of Apology, and in behalf of Martin
Luther, and that Reformation which so many worthies before him desired,
himself began and attempted, and others now at length h^ve happily effected.

PA.
You tell us of a Reformation: did the Catholics desire it, were they not
content with the Religion then in use?

PRO.
It seems they were not; for diverse of them Gave up their lives, for the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ, Act. 15.26. rather than they would yield to the
Romish superstition.

Besides, I have already given instance in such as foretold, and wished for
this Reformation.

Robert Grost-head Bishop of Lincoln, prophesied, Non liberabitur Ecclesia ab
Aegyptiaca servitute, nisi in ore gladij cruentandi. Math. Pa^^s. in Henr. 3.
ad Ann. 1253.
that The Church would never be set free, from out of her Egyptian bondage,
but by the edge of the Sword.

Another of our Contrymen, William O^cham, a learned School man,
complains, that in his time, Scripturas S. subver^unt, dicta Sanctorum
denegant, sacros Canones, legesque civiles reprobant: qui videbantur Ec^l^siae
nostrae columnae, in haeresium soveam se praecipitant. Occham in Prologo.
Compend. error. Ioanni^ 22.
They perverted Scriptures, Fathers, and the Churches Canons; and that these
were no Young men, or novices, or unlearned ones; but such as should be Pillars
of the Church, did cast themselves headlong into the pit of Heresies.

John Gerson advised, that in case the Pope and a General Council would not
make Reforma^ion, (whereof he had little hope) Provi^eant sibi dum silverint ^t
po^uerint me^bra per Provincias aut R^g^a. Gerson. in Dial. Apologet. de

then the several par^^ and provinces of Christendom, should themselves
redress things a^is^e.

The Cardinal of Cambrey, and Picus Mirandul^ presented their treatises of the
Chu^ches Reformation, the one to the Council of Constance, the other to the
Lateran Council.

Pelagius Alvarus set out the Complaint of the Church, and Archdeacon
Clemangies the Corrupt State of the Church.

Hierome Savonarola the Dominican, told the French king, Charles the eight (as
Philip de Comminees says) That he should have great prosperity in his voyage
into Italy, and that God would give the Sword into his hand: and all this, to
the end he should reform the corrupt state of the Church, which if he did not
perform, he should return home again with dishonor, and God would reserve
the honor of his work to some other, and so (says he) it fell out.

When Luther arose, and began to oppose Indulgences, the more wise and moderate
sort wished the Pope to reform Poi ^he non era accompagnata col corregere in
loco medesimile cose da^nabili Guicciard. hist. It^liae lib. 13. page 380.
things apparently amiss, and not to prosecute Luther: but this Council was
not followed: whereupon, diverse parts (according to Gersons Council) began this
work of Reformation, so much desired by all good men, howsoever opposed by the
pope, and his adherents.

PA.
A Reformation presupposes that things were amiss; will you charge the
Catholic Church with error?

PRO.
We say that particular Churches (and such is that of Rome) may err, and
diverse have erred. Sixtus Senensis reckons S^xt. Senens. Biblioth. lib. 5.

up many Fathers that held the Millenary error, mistaking that place in the
Revelation, 20.5. They said, that there should be two Resurrections; the first
of the godly, to live with Christ a thousand years on earth, in all wordly
happiness, before the wicked should awake out of the sleep of death; and
after that thousand years, the second Resurrection of the wicked should be to
eternal death, and the godly should ascend to eternal life: this error

continued almost two hundred years after it began, before it was condemned
for an heresy; and was held by so many Churchmen of great account, and
Martyrs, that Saint Augustine and Jerome did very modestly dissent says the
same Senensis.

The opinion of the necessity of Infants receiving the Sacrament of the Lords
body and blood, as well as Baptism, did possess the minds of many in the
Church for certain hundreds of years, as appears by that which Saint
Austine writes of it in his August. contra duas Epist. Pelag. lib 1. cap. 22.

; That the whole world almo^t was gone after Pelagius into error; arise
therefore O Lord (says he) and judge thine own cause.

Gregorius Ariminensis says, Aut si in aliquo discordat, magi^ deviat a
Catholica veritate, quam dic^um ^elagij Greg. Arim. lib. 2. did. 26 qu. 1.
ar^. 2.
That to affirm, that man by his natural strength, without the special help
of God, can do any virtuous action, or morally good, is one of the damned
heresies of Pelagius, or if in any thing it differ from his heresy, it is
further from truth.

The same Gregory says, T^emendum mihi videtur negare authorit^^em Sanctorum,
^ contra etiam, non est tutum contraire ^o^muni opinioni, and con^c^sioni
magistrorum nostroru^. Id. lib. 2. did. 33. quest. 3.
The heresies of Pelagius were taught in the Church, and that not by a few, or
them mean men, but so many, and of so great place, that he almost feared to
follow the doctrine of the Fathers, and oppose himself against them therein.

Cardinal Contaren says; Alij enim Catholicae sese religionis tit^lo
venditantes, and luth^ranorum adversarios jactantes, du^ arbitrij libertatem
nimium astruere cona^tur Christi se gratiae plurimum detrahere non intelligunt.
Contaren. de Praedestin.
That there were some who pretended to be Catholics, and opposite to Luther,
who, whiles they labored to advance free will too high, they detracted too
much from the free grace of God, and so became adversaries to the greatest
lights of the Church, and friends to Pelagius.

It is not strange then, that we^ say there has been a defection not only of
Heretics from the Church and faith^ but also in the Church, of her own
children, from the sincerity of faith d^livered by Christ and his Apostles: not
for that all, or the whole Church at any time did forsake the true faith, but
for that many fell from it; according to that of Saint Paul, 1. Tim. 4.1. In
the last times some shall depart from the faith, att^nding to spirits of error.

Besides, such a famine of the word, as fell out in these later times, must
needs have brought in corruption in doctrine; and this was it that called for
Reformation.

For in sundry ages last past, the Roman Church has behaved her self, more
like a step-dame, then a natural mother; insomuch as she has deprived her
children of a principal portion of the food of life, Nam fides ex diviat verbi

Ancestors as devoutly aff^cted to the Saints as we, thought is not fit, that
the rehearsal of the Saints lives, should shoulder out the books of the old
and new Testament, and the reading thereof.

And hereby it came to pass (as one of their own Authors says) Quoni^m in

That the greater number of people understood no more concerning God, and
things divine, in particular and distinct notions, then Infidels or heathen
people. And here in England, there was such a dearth of the word, in these
later times of pope^y; Acts and Monum. vol. 2. lib. 7. page 819. in Henr. 8.
that some gave five marks, some more, some less for an English book; some
gave a load of hay for a few Chapters of Saint James, or of Saint Paul in
English.

Was it not now high time to reform these things? but Rome would neither
acknowledge her errors, nor re^orme them, but rather sought to defend them,
persecuting such as by authority established, labored this reformation. How
easy and safe had it been for Rome (had she tendered the peace of
Christendom) to have (according as the truth required) permitted the u^e of
the Cup, as sometime the Council of Basil allowed it to the Bohemians, and the
public service of God in a known language, as was sometimes granted to the
Slavons A^^ Sylvi^s hist. B^^^m cap. 13
: as also to have abolished the worship of Im^ges, and the like, without which
the Church was, and that very well for a long time. But Rome would not yield in
one point, lest she should be suspected to have erred in the rest; and
therely the Infallibility of the Roman Oracle the Pope, be called in question.

That which is reformed, Id reformatur, quod id m^n substant^a per^ everat.

remains the same in substance that it was before: And therefore the Catholic
Religion, and the substantial exercise thereof should have remained in England
upon the Reformation; but you have set up another Religion.

PRO.
We do not say that the Catholic Religion is reformed, for that cannot be
amended; but that we have reformed Religion, in that we have purged it from
certain devises and corruptions which had crept into it.

Before this reformation, Religion was like to a certain lump^, or mas^e,
consisting partly of gold, and partly of other refuse metal and dross; to a
sick body, wherein besides the flesh, blood, and bones, and vital spirits;
there were also diverse naughty humors that had surprised the body; (...). Angl
c. Sp^l^ten^ cap. 85.
our reformation took not away your gold (to wit those fundamental truths
wherein you agree with us) but purged it from the dross; it drew not the good
blood from the body, but only purged out the pestilent humor; so that we have
retained whatsoever was sound, Catholic, and primitively ancient: only those
things that were patched to the ground-soles of Religion, that we have pared
away as superfluous: we have not removed the ancient land-markes, but only
cast down some encroachments and improvements of popery: we have no more
er^cted a new faith in respect of the substance, and essentials thereof, than
that zealous reformer Iosia, 2 Kings, 23.
built a new material Temple when he cast out the Idols, and Idolatrous
worship out of the Lords house.

There is no other difference betwixt the Reformed and the Romish Church, D.
V^hers Se^mon at Wansted page 31.
then betwixt a field well weeded, and the same field forme^ly overgrowne with
weeds: or betwixt a heap of corn now well winnowed, and the same heap lately
mixed with chafe. And if it be a vain and frivolous thing to say, it is not
the same field, or the same corn; as vain and frivolous is it to say, the
Church is not the same it was, or in the same place, after it is swept, and
cleansed of the filth and dust: or to say, D Field of the Church book 3. chap.

the Churches of Corinth and Galatia (after their reformation occasioned by
Saint Paul's writing) were new Churches, and not the same they were before:
because that in them before, the Resurrection was denied, Circumcision
practis^d, discipline neglected, and Ch^is^s Apostles contemned; which things
now are not found in them; Master Cade his Iustificat of the Church of England.

If our Roman Church were so corrupt, whence then had you the truth? what you
had, you received from us.

PRO.
Saint Austine says, Codi^^m portat Iudens unde credat Christianus, Librarij

that the Jews were to the Christians Library-keepers of the books of the Law
and the Prophets: and might not the Romanists perform the like office to the
Protestants?

The Jewish Church what time it was unsound, preserved the Scripture^Canon; and
by transcribing^ and reading the same, Romans 3.2. Acts 15.2.
delivered the whole text thereof tr^ly to others. And thus the Roman Church,
though in many things unsound, preserved the books of holy Scripture, and
taught the Apostles C^eed, with sundry parts of divine truth gathered from the
same; and by these principles of Christianity preserved in that Church,
judicious and godly men, might with study and diligence find out what was the
first delivered Christian doctrine in such things as were necessary to
salvation.

And herein was Gods gracious providence s^ene, that even that Church wherein
Luther himself received his Christianity, Ordination, and power of
Ministry, should for the benefit of Gods children preserve the Word and
Sacraments, and deliver them over to us, though somewhat corruptly, by their
adding more Sacraments than ever Christ ordained, and abusing those which we
retain with diverse unwarrantable rites and Ceremonies.

In a word, we received from you some truth mingled with error; we have pared
away your corruption, as a worm out of an Apple, and retained the wholesome and
substantial truth.

PA.
Was there any Chucrh in being save our Roman Catholic, in the Ages next
before Luther? if so, show u^ where it was, and with whom it held Communion?

PRO.
When Christ came first into the World, the Jewish Church was corrupted both in
doctrine and manners; this Church had in it Scribes and Pharisees as well as
Zachary and Elizabeth, Joseph and Mary, Simeon and Anna, with others: these
were all of the same outward Communion with the Priesthood; for they resorted
to the Temple, there they prayed and performed such holy rites as God himself
enjoined, until they heard farther of the Gospel by Christ's manifestation.

Now I demand, were not Joseph and Mary, and such good people ^ound members of
Gods Church, although the Scribes and Pharisees bore all the sway in the
Church, and had the Priesthood, the word, and Sacraments in their dispensing?
yet even then God had a Esai. 1.9.
Remnant of holy people which made up his Church; though others went under the
name thereof, and exceeded them in number. Now with these, the sound part kept
an outward Communion, yet did not partake in all their erroneous doctrines, but
condemned their grosser errors.

In like sort, we were all of one outward Communion, of one Church wherein
salvation was; and yet we shared not in those errors, which a faction in the
Church (like the Pharisees of old) maintained. For (as learned Dr. Field says
Doctor Field of the Church. book 3. chap. 6.
) The errors which we condemn at this day, whereupon the difference grows
between us and the Romish faction, were never generally received, nor
constantly delivered, as the doctrines of the Church; but doubtfully disputed,
and proposed as the opinions of some men in the Church, not as the resolved
determinations of the whole Church. For had they been the undoubted doctrines
and determinations of the Church, all men would have holden them entirely, and
constantly, as they held the doctri^e of the Trinity, and other Articles of the
Faith. And I have already shown from age to age, that the errors condemned by
us, never found general allowance, and constant consent in the days of our
fathers, but that some worthy guides of Gods Church ever opposed them.

And thus was our Church preserved under the Papacy, as whea^e is among tares;
S^c Ecclesia i^ ^rumentis Domi^i^is conserv^ta e^t. Augus^in. ep 48. tom. 2.
for we were formerly mingled together like corn and chafe in one heap,
until the time of Reformation came, and winnowed our wheat from the chafe of
Popery: So that howsoever diverse under the Papacy (not brooknig Reformation)
maintained sundry erroneous opinions, Si Concilium in haeresin la^eretur
rem^ne^ent alij Catholici qui (...) vel ublice prout expe^^i ^t, and re^t (...)
orthodoxam Occh in Dialog. part. 1. lib. 5. c. 28.
Yet there were other worthies who (living within that Community) were not
equally poisoned with error, but firmly believed all fundamental truth, and
delivered the maine Articles of Christianity over unto others.

For Answer then to the Question, Where had our Church her being in the Ages
next before Luther? we say, It was both within the Roman Church and without
it. For (as learned Doctor Chaloner says D^ctor Chaloner's tre^tise upon Credo
Eccl^si^n S. Catholic. 2. part. ^^ct. 2.
) Our Church had in those days a twofold Subsis^encie, ^he one, Separate from
the Church of Rome, the other Mixed and conjoyne^ with it.

Separate, so it was in the Alb^genses, and Waldenses, a people who^ so soon
as the Church of Rome had inte^preted her self touching sundry of those maine
points of d^ff^rence between us, and that a man could no l^nger Communicate
with her in the public worship of God, by reason of so^e Idolatrous rites and
customs which she had establish^d^ arose in France, Sav^y, and the places
near adjoining, and professed the same substantial Negatives and Affirmatives
which we do, in a state, Sepa^at^ from the Church of Rome, having Pastors and
Congregations apart to themselves, even unto this day. From these descended the
Wicklefis^s in England, and the Hussites in Germany, and others in other
Countries, who Ma^gre the ^urie of fire and Sword maintained the same doctrine
as they did.

The state of the Church mixed and conjoined with the Church of Rome it self,
consisted of those, who making no visible separation from the Roman profession,
as not perceiving the mystery of iniquity which wrought in it, did yet mislike
the grosser errors, and desired a Reformation.

To answer then the qu^stion directly, where was the Pr^testants Church before
Luthers time? that is, where was any Church in the world that taught that
doctrine, which the Protestants now teach? ^ say, it was not only apparent
enough in the Greek and Eastern Churches, and in such as had made an open
separation from the Romish corruptions; such as were in these Western parts,
the W^ldenses, Wickle^i^ts and Hussites; but it was also within the community
of the Romish Church it self: even there (as in a large field) grew much good
corn among tares and weeds: there (as in a great b^rne, heap or garner) was
preserved much pure grain, mixed with store of chafe.

Object.
I except against that you have said: Master Brereley calls Prot Appol. tract.
2. cap. 2. sect. 13.
it a Ridle, To say your Church was under the Papacy as wheat is under the
chafe, and yet the Papacy was not the true Church.

Answer.
It is no Enigma or Ridle, it being all one in effect as to say; the Christian
Church at our Saviors coming, and after, consisting of Joseph and Mary,
Simeon and Anna, the Shepherds and the Sages, Christ's disciples and others, was
in and under the Jewish Church, consisting of Scribes and Pharisees (who with
their false glosses, and vain traditions had corrupted the Law of God) was not
sanum membrum, a sound part of Gods Church; but as our Savior says, Like
sheep without a Shepherd, Mark 6.34.

Object.
You say your Church was under the papacy, but the papacy was not the true
Church; by the like reason you may say, that the hidden Church of God is
preserved among the Turks: can there be a Church without an outward ministry?

Answer.
It follows not, and the reason of the difference is; because amongst the
Turks there is not that means of salvation; inasmuch as they have not given
their names to Christ; but the true Church of God may be preserved within the
Romish Church, in as much as they have the Scriptures, though in a strange
tongue, as also Baptisme^ and lawful ordination, and the like helps, which
God in all ages used, that his Elect might begathered out of the midst of
Babylon.

And whereas you urge an outward and public ministry, this makes nothing
against the Church of England, which (for substance) has the same descent of
outward ordination with the Roman Church, ^
neither can any man show a more certain pedigree from his great Grand father,
than our Bishops and Pastors can, from such Bishops as your Church accounts
canon^call in the time of King Henry the eight, and upward: such ^a^re evidence
can we produce for an outward and publ^ke mi^istery in the Church of England,
and such ordination we hold very necessary; and yet in case it cannot be had,
Gods children by their private reading, and meditation of that which they have
formerly learned, may supply ^
the defect of a public ministry, even as some Christians at this day being
sl^ves in Turkey or Barbary, may be saved without external ministry: but this
is in case of extremity; for us, we never wanted a standing ministry.

Neither did the Waldenses, Wickliv^sts, and Hussites, (for so I call them for
distinction sake) ever want an outward and lawful ministry amongst them, for
the administration of the word and Sacraments^

Object.
You say your Professors communicated with the Roman Church, but did not
partake in her errors, as you call them; did they not join with them in the
Mass^, and the Letanies of the Saints, and the like?

Answer.
The thing we say is this; that howsoever they outwardly communica^ed with
Rome, yet diverse of them misliked in their heart their grosser erro^s, they
groaned under the Babylonish yoke, and desired reformation, besides, many of
them were ignorant of the depth and mystery of popery.

Object.
If your Protestant Church were in b^ing, at, and before Luthers appearing,
then did such as were members thereof, either make profession thereof, or not:
Bellarm. lib 3. de Eccles. Milit. cap. 13. Denique.
if they did, tell us their names, and where they did so: if they did not, then
were they but dissemblers in Religion, according to that of Saint Paul, Romans
10.10. and our Savior, Math. 10.33.

Answer.
I will but take what your Rhemists grant, and re^o^t your own argument: they
say ^h^m. Annot. in 12. Apocal.
; That the Catholic Church in their time was in England, although it had no
public government, nor open free exercise of holy function: whence I argue
thus; if their Roman Church had any being at that time in England, then their
Priests and Jesuits, either made public profession of their faith, or not: if
they made open profession, why then did they go in Laymens habits, and lurk
in corners? if they made not open prof^ssion, then were they but dissemblers.
Besides, I have already given you in a Catalogue of our professors, who within
the time mentioned, witnessed that truth which we maintain by their writings,
confessi^ns, and Martyrdom.

Now, for us we have rejected nothing but popery, we have willingly departed
from the Communion of their errors, and additions to the faith; but from the
Communion of the Church we never departed.

In a word, there were some who openly, and constantly withstood the errors
and cor^uptions of their time, and sealed with their blood that truth^ which
they with us professed: others dissented from the same errors, but did not
with the like courage opp^se themselves; such as would s^y to their friends in
private: Thus Sic dic^rem in s^holis, s^d (...) (maneat inter (...) d^v^rs^m

Was not the Mass publicly used in all Churches at L^thers a^pearin^? was
Protestancie then so much as in being? says Master Prot. Apol. tr^ct. 2. cap.
2. sect. 2. page 3^^.
B^e^ely.

PRO.
If by a Protestant Church, (says learned Doctor D^ctor Field of the Church
(...) second edition in h^s Appendix to the third book. Ox^o^d 16^8.
Field, we me^ne, a Church believing and teaching in all poin^s as Protestants
do, and believing and teaching nothing but that they do, the Latin, or West
Church (wherein the Pope ^yran^ized before Luthers time) was and continu^d a
true Protestant Church; for it taught as we do, it condemned the superstition
we have removed, it groaned under the yoke of tyranny which we have cast off;
howsoever there were many in the mid^t of her, that brought in, and maintained
superstition, and advanced the Popes Supremacy.

But if by a Protestant Church they understand a Church that not only dislikes
and complains of Papal usurpation, but also abandon^th it; and not only
teaches all necessary and saving truth, but suff^reth none within her
jurisdiction to teach otherwise; we confess that no part of the Western
Church was in this sort a P^otestant Church, till a Reformation was begun of
evils formerly dislik^d.

Now whereas it is obj^ct^d, that the Mass (wherein they say many chief
poin^s o^ their Religion are comprehended) was publickely u^ed at Luthers
appearing.

It is answered by Doctor Field that the usi^g o^ the Mass as the public
Liturgy, is no good proof; inasmuch as manifold abuses in p^actice besides,
and contrary to the word of the Canon and the in^en^^^^ of them that first
compo^ed the same^ have cre^t into i^; as also sundry Apocryphal things have
slipped into the public Service of the Church, these things will b^tter appear
by ^articular instances.

Concerning private Masses, wherein the P^iests alone does Communicat^ without
the people, it is contra^y to ^he Canon of ^he M^sse, saying in the ^lurall
number [ Sumpsimus] we have ^ec^ived; Mi^^ale Eccles. Sarisbur^in Cano^^.
an^ Quo^quot ex hoc altaris participatione, etc. That all we which in ^he
participat^on of the Altar, have receiv^d the sacred body and blood of t^y
Sonne^ etc.

John Hossme^ster a learned man, expounding the prayers of the Mass^, has
these w^rds; C^ss^^der. cons^lt. de solita^ia M^ss^^
The thing it self proclaims it, that as w^ll in the Gre^ke, as Latin
Church, not only the Priest which sacrif^^eth, but the other Priests and
Deacons also, yea and the people, or at le^st some part of them did
Commu^icate^ which custom how it grew out of use I know not; but surely we
should labor to bring it in again.

By this it appears, that the Priests receiving alone and the neglecting or
excluding the communicating of others, as no^ much nec^ss^ry, is indeed a point
of Romish Religion; but contrary to the words of the Canon; and ^he ancient
custom of the Church: it proceeded from the i^devotion of the people, or
rather ^he negl^g^nce or error of the guides of ^he Church, that either failed
to stir them up to the perform^nce of such a duty, or made them bel^eve their
Act was sufficient to com^unicate the benefits of Christ's passion to them; but
this course was misliked by them of the better sort.

Concerning Communion in one kind, that is another point of Romish Religion,
supposed to be contained in the Mass, which yet wan^s the liking and
approbation of the best and wo^thiest guides of Gods Church then living:
Cassander in Consult. d^ utr^que specie.
Cassander says, It is sufficiently manifest, that the ^niversall Church of
Christ until this day, and the Western or Roman Church, for more than a
thousand years after Christ, did minister the Sacrament in both kinds to all
the members of Christ's Church, at least in public, as it is most evident by
innum^rable testimonies, both of Gre^ke and Latin Fathers.

It is true indeed, that in case of necessi^ie, as when children, or such as
were sick and weak, were to ^eceive the Communion, they used to ^ip the
mystical bread into the consecrated wine, under pre^en^e of Ca^efull avoiding
the danger of spilling it, and greater reverence to^ards the holy Sacrament:
from this custom^ wh^^^ yet was ^isl^ked (as appears by Hildebe^^ (...) (...)
epist 64 in tom. 12. Biblioth. P^^ page 3^^. Colon. 1618.
) some proceed^d farther, and began to teach the people, that seeing the body
and blood of Christ cannot be separated, in that they partake of the (...) they
partake of the other also, and that therefore it was sufficient to receive in
one kind alone. N^^th^r yet could this give satisfaction; for howsoever the
custom of communicating under one kind prevailed; yet there wanted not such as
sufficiently expressed their judgment, that communicating in both kinds, as
Christ first did institute, and the Church for a long time observed, was fit
and convenient, perfect and complete, and of more efficacy, and cleerer
representation, than the other under one kind alone.

Come to another maine point, the proper, and propitiatory sacrifice for the
quick and the dead, and see whether at Luthers appearing, before and after,
all that used that Liturgy had such an opinion of a sacrifice.

Saint Off^rin^^ quid^^, sed (...) Amb. o^. in H^b^. 10.
Ambrose, and Saint Chrysostom (...) Chrysos. in Heb (...) 17.
, by way of correction say, We offer the same sacrifice, or rather the
remembrance thereof.

Peter Lombard proposing the question, whether that which the Priest does, may
properly be named a Sacrifice, or Immolation, answers; (...) (...) et
oblationem, qui^ (...) est, and (...) Quotid^^ autem (...) Sacramento, quia in
sacramento (...) illius quod (...) Pet. (...) Sem lib. 4 Did. 12. li^. ^^..
that Christ was only once truly and properly offered in sacrifice; and that
h^e is not properly immolated or sacrifised, but in Sacrament and
Representation only.

Lyra says, (...) in Heb 10. ca.
that If thou say the Sacrifice of the Altar is daily offered in the Church; it
must be answered, that th^re is no reiteration of the sacrifice, but a daily
commemoration of that sacrifice that was once offered on the Cross.

Georgius Wi^elius, a man much honored by the Emperors Ferdinand and
Maximilian, G^^g. Wi^^lius in (...) D. Field
defines the Mass to be a Sacrifice Rememorative, and of praise and
thankesgiving, where many give thanks for the price of their Redemption.

The Author of the Enchiridion of Christian Religion, publish^d in the
provincial Co^ncell of Colen, says; Enchir^d Col^ni^nse de Euch^r. t^ste
coa^m.
In that the Church does offer the true body and blood of Christ to God the
Father, it is merely a representative sacrifice; and all that is done is but
the commemorating and representing of that sacrifice which was once offered on
the Cross.

By that which has been said, it is clear that the best and worthiest guides
of Gods Church, both before and after Luthers time, taught not any new real
offering of Christ to God the Father as a propitiatory sacrifice to take away
sins, but in effect as we do; namely, that the sacrifice of the Altar is
only the sacrifice of praise and thankesgiving, and a mere representation and
commemoration, of the sacrifice once offered upon the Cross, his being the
real sacrifice on the Cross, ours only the Sacramental Representation,
Commemoration, and Application thereof; so that Christ is not newly offered any
otherwise, than in that he is offered in the view of God, nor any otherwise
sacrifised, than in that his sacrifice on the Cross is commemorated and
represented.

And thus the Fathers term the holy Eucharist, an unbloody Sacrifice, not
because Christ is properly, and in his substance offered therein, but because
his bloody sacrifice upon the Cross, is by this unbloody commemoration
represented, called to remembrance, and applied.

Besides these points mentioned, I have already produced witnesses in all ages
and in all parts of the world, rejecting those books as Ap^cryphall that we
do; and shown, that even until Luthers time, the Church did not admit the
Canon of Scripture which the Romanists now do, nor ever accounted those books
canonical, which we think to be Apocryphal: and by these instances it may
appear, That all were not Papists who held with the Mass.

The thing then we say is this; that though the Mass was generally in u^e, at,
and before Luthers time^ yet diver^ points belonging th^reunto, were not
believed by the worthie^t guides in God, Church, at, and before Luthers time;
though indeed there were some in the Church that so co^ceived of them, as the
Romanists now do; and the reason hereof is this.

They were not generally received by all m^n, nor as the und^ubted
determinations of the Church; not as Dogmata fidei, but Dogmata scholae,
controverted, and dive^sly disputed among the learned, and holden with great
liberty of Judgment by the greatest Doctors; as appears by their own books
of controversies, written by Bellarmine, Sua^ez, Azorius and others, which
confute their own writers almost as much as they do Pro^estants.

Besides, had they been the undoubted doctrines and determinations of the
Church, all men would have holden them uniformly, entirely, and constantly,
Doctor Fields Ap^ndix to the fi^th Book, part. 3. p^g. 11.
as they held the doctrine of the Trinity, the Creation, the Incarnation of the
Son of God, and other Articles of the Faith.

Objection.
If these points were held as you say, not by the best members of the Church,
but by a domineering faction therein; how came it that the prevailing faction
suffered others to dissent from them in judgment?

Answer.
So long as men yielded outward obedience to the Church-ceremonies without
scandal; in other things they were suffered to abound in their own sense; so
that they submitted themselves to the obedience of the Church of Rome.

Besides, the Church of R^me had not so strictly defined those Tenets in any
Council before, as afterward they did in the Council of T^ent.

PA.
Our name Catholic is ancient; your Protestant name came not in till after
Luther: Besides, it is a scandalous thing for your Church to derive authority
from Wickliff^, Husse, Luther, and Calvin.

PRO.
Indeed, the name Protestant began upon the Sicid in. Com. lib. 6. ad ann. 1529.
prot^sting of the Elector and La^d grave against the Edict: howsoever, the
Faith is ancient, though the name be not, and yet if you stand upon names, we
are called Acts 11.26.
Christians, and into that name were we 1 Co^inth. 1.13.
Baptized; and that is anci^nter than your Roman catholic. Now you are called
Catholics, but it is with an alias, or addition, Roman-Ca^holickes; as much
as to say, Particular Universal, the part is the whole, one City the wo^ld;
and it is your selves that term you Catholics. Now if one Papist call
another so, it is but as if one Mule should claw another. The Hagarens boldly
usurped the name of Sarazens, although they were only the brood that sprang
from the womb of Hagar the handmaid of Sara. The Papists by this term
Catholic, work upon simple people, arguing from the one, to the other, as if
all the privileges of the Catholic Church belonged to the Roman, but we
tell them, as (...) sed Cath^^^^^ non ^st. ^^tat lib. 3.
Optatus did the Donatists (who pinned up the Church in a corner of Afric, as
the Romanists now con^ine her to their See) that Their Church is Quasi

member thereof.

Chichester coming to visit him, began to comfort him, repeating to him such

tell this to such as me, and others in my case, but open once this window to
the people, and then farewell altogether.

If you hope so well of our forefathers, why hope you not so well of us their
children?

Answer.
The parties are not alike; besides there is great difference of the times,
then and now; the former were times of ignorance, these are the days wherein
light is come into the world; in what they erred, they erred ignorantly,
following the conduct of their guides, doing as they taught them; and so were
mislead as Saint Austine says, Hoc inquies majo^es nostri a suis parentibus
accepe^^^t; respondetur, sed errantes ab errantibu^ aut calumniantibus. Aug.
cont. Crescon. grama^at. li. 3 c. 33. tom. 7.
Errantes ab errantibus, by their blind guides: but upon better information we
presume, they would have reformed their errors. Now he is more to be pitied
who stumbleth in the dark, than in the daylight; men are now admonished of
their er^rours, offer is made to them to be better instructed, so that their
censure will be heavier, if either they dote on their own opinions, unwilling
to be instructed in the reveled truth: or after sufficient knowl^dge and
conviction, for some worldly respects, they wilfully and obstinatly persist in
their old errors; and (which is far worse) hate and persecute the maintainers
of the truth.

Saint Cyprian says, Si quis de an^ecesso (...), vel ^^noran^et, vel
simpliciter, non hoc obser^avit and t^nuit, quod n^s d^mi^us f^cere exem^^o and

If any of our Predecessors, either of ignorance of simplicity, has no^

Saint Augustine Alla ^^usa est ^orum qui in istos haereticos imprudenter
in^urrunt, ipsam esse Christi e^clesiam ex^stimante^; alia co^um qui noverunt
non ^sse Catholic^n. Augustine. de Bap^. (...). Donat. cap. 4..
puts a difference betwixt Heretics, and them that believe Heretics; and he
says farther: Qui se^tentiam suam (...) ^als^m ac perversam, n^ll^ pe^tinaci
anim^sit^te defendunt; praesert^^ quam non auda^^^ presumptionis ^ue
pepere^unt, seda seductis, atque i^ err^rem lapsis parenti^^s acc^per^nt,

They that defend an opinion false and perverse without pertinacious
selfe-mindednesse; especially, which not the boldn^sse of their own
presumption has begotten, but which from their seduced and erroneous Parents,
they have received, and themselves do seek the truth with care and diligence,
ready to amend their error, when they find the truth; they are in no wise to
be reckoned among Heretics: this was the case of our Fathers under the
Papacy.

In a word, our Fathers they lived in those errors of ignorance, not of
obstinacy, and knew not the dangerous consequence of them; such men by
particular repen^ance of sins known, and general repentance of unknown,
might by Gods mercy be saved.

If holding the foundation will serve, as you seem to say in the case of our
forefathers, then we may safely obtain salvation in the Church of Rome.

Answer.
This follows not; for the Church of Rome builds many things which by
consequent destroy the foundation: Doctor (...) in his (...) Advertisment (...)
to his (...) of the Old Religion.
Rome does both hold the foundation, and destroy it; she holds it directly,
destroys it by consequent. As the Galathians held the foundation (to wit,
salvation by Jesus Christ) and yet withal held a necessity of joining
Circumcision with Christ; which doctrine, by consequence destroyed the very
foundation, for so Saint Paul wrote unto them, Galat. 5.2.4. If they were
circumcised, Christ profited them nothing, h^e became of none effect unto them,
they were fallen from grace. In like sort, Popery opposes the Faith, not
directly, but obliquely, not formally, but virtually, not in express terms,
but by consequence.

Popery overthrowes the foundation by consequence, whiles it brings on so many
stories of unsound adjections, and corrupt super-additions, upon the ancient
ground-sole of Religion, as are like to ^ndanger the whole frame. The learned,
and acute Doctor, Doctor Hall, now Lord Bishop of Exceter, gives several
instances hereof. Doctor Hall, Decad 6. epist. 4. to Doctor M^b^u^ne.
Popery overthrows the truth of our Justification, whiles it ascribes it to
our own works: the All-sufficiencie of Christ's own Sacrifice, whiles they
reiterate it daily by the hands of a Priest. Of his Satisfaction, while they
hold a payment of our utmost farthings, in a devised Purgatory. Of his
Mediation, while they implore others to aid them, not only by their
Intercession, but their Merits; suing not only for their prayers, but their
gifts: the value of the Scriptures, whiles they hold them unsufficient, obscure
in points ess^ntiall to salvation, and bind them to an uncertain d^pendance
upon the Church. Now for the simpler sort, whil^s in truth of heart, they hold
the maine principles which they know; doubtl^sse, the mercy of God may pass
over their ignorant weakness in what they cannot know. For the other, I fear
not to say, that many of their errors are wilful. The light of truth has
shined out of heaven to them, and they loved darkness more than ligh^. Thus
far that learned ^ishop.

PA.
The Protestants (at ^ast many of them) con^^sse there may be salvation in our
Church; we absolutely deny there^s salv^tion in theirs: therefore it is saf^r
to come to ours, than to s^ay in theirs, to be where almost all grant
salvation, than where the greater part of the world deny it.

PRO.
This point is fully cleared by the judicious Author M^ster Fishers Rel^ti^n o^
his ^hi^d Confer^nce, ^^^wered b^ R. B. C^^pl^ine to the R^^ht R B. o^ St.
D^^ids.
of the Answer to Fishers Relation of his third Confer^nce.

Upon this very point says h^e Ib^d page 68.69.
, (that we acknowl^dge, An honest ignorant Papist may be saved) they work upon
the advantage of our Charity, and their own want o^ it, to abuse the weak;
but if they would speak truly, and say, many Protestants indeed con^esse, there
is salvation possible to be attained in the Roman Church, but yet the errors
of that C^u^ch a^e so many (and some, such as weaken the foundation) that it is
very hard to go that way to heaven, especially to them that have had the truth
manifested unto them; the heart of this Argument were broken.

The force of this Argument lies herein; that we and ou^ adv^rsaries consent,
that there is salvation to some in the Roman Church. What? would you have us
an malicious (at least as rash) as your selves are to us, and deny you so much
as possibility of salvation? if we should, we might make you in some things
strain for a proof. But we have not so learned Christ, as either to return
evil for evil in this h^adie course, or to deny salvation to some ignorant
silly Souls, who hold the foundation, Christ Jesus, and survey not the
building.

But this was an old trick of the Dona^ists who shut up the Church in Afric,
as they do now in Rome, and the Roman See. For in the point of Baptism (
Whether that Sacrament was true in the Catholic Church, or in the part of
Donatus) they exhorted all to be Baptized among them: Why? Because both parts
granted, that Baptism was true among the Donatists; which that peevish sect
most unjustly denied the sound part, as Saint Austine (...) apud Donati^^^^
B^pti^mum. and ^lli ass^runt, and nos conced^ (...) etc Augustine. lib. ^^de
^aptismo cont. Donat. cap. 3.
delivers it. I would ask now, had not the Orthodoxe Bap^isme among them,
because the Donatists denied it injuriously? or should the Orthodoxe against
truth, h^ve denied Baptism among the Donatists, to cry qui^tance with them?

Besides, what have they gained by some Protes^ants confession, saying tha^
some might be saved in the Roman Church? this term, [ Might be Saved] gr^nts
but a Possibility, to some we^ke ones, no sure or safe way to salva^ion. For a
safe way they can hardly go, who pertinaciously adhere to their errors,
having sufficient means to be better informed. Howsoever, their reckon^ng is
like to be ^he heavier, who for some byrespects oppose a know^e truth, which
they either do, or might believe, if their hearts were upright, and not
perversely obstinate, and not only so, but draw other we^ke ones to their bent.
Saint Augustine says, Si mi^i vide^etur unus and id^m Hereti^us and Haereti^^
^redens homo, etc August^^ de ut^lit. credendi cap. 1. tom. 6
There will be ever a difference between an Heretic, and a plain well
meaning man that is misled, and b^leeves an Heretic. God pittieth the blind,
that would feign see and cannot; but will he pity them that may see and will
not? that harden themselves in their affected wilful blindness? he delivered
Jonas from d^owning in the bottom of the Sea, will you plung your selves
therefore, to see if God will deliver you? Because we grant, Bishop V^^ers
Sermon it Wins^^d, of ^he Vn^^e of Faith. page 26.
(says that most learned Prelate, Doctor Usher) that some may escape death in
Cities, and Streets, in^ected with the Plagu^, will you therefore be so fool
hardy, after warning giv^^ of the present danger, as to choose to take up your
lodging in a Pesthouse? if you do, we may well say, in our C^arity, Lord have
m^rcie upon you: but you may justly fear, that you dangerously tempt the Lord,
to send you Strong delusion to believe a lie, 2 Th^s. 2.10.11 12.
because you received not the love of the truth, to believe it.

L^stly, if we grant you a possibility of salvation, and you deny the same to
us (which yet is not yours to give, or to withhold;) ^h^s shewe^h not tha^ you
have mo^e truth on your side than we, but rather that we have more charity
than you, who without truth or modesty (a^ our learned Prov^st of Queens
College in Oxford has shown in his ^
Answer to Charity mistaken) dare af^^rme, that Protestancie destr^yeth
salvation.

B^^ let not the Protestant b^e discouraged with this h^^dy censure; for we
are confident, that the faith p^o^essed in the Church of England is the
Catholic, O^th^doxe, and saving ^aith, and we can show good ^eason ^o^ it.

^
For to b^leeve the Scripture of the two T^staments, to b^l^^ve the th^ee
C^eeds, in the sense of the ancient P^^^itive Church, to receive the four
great general Coun^^ls, so m^^h magnified by antiquity; to admit, What ever
the Fathers for the first five hundred years with joint consent agreed upon,
to be bele^ved as a necessary point (...) salvation, or at leastwise to be
humbly silent, not presuming to condemn the same, is a faith, in which to live
and die, cannot but give salvation, specially being accompa^ied with a godly
life, and a faithful death.

^
Now whether it be wisdom in such a point as Salvation is, to fors^ke a
Church, in the which the g^ou^d of salvation is f^^me, to follow a Church, in
which it is possibl^ o^e may be saved, but very probable one may do wo^s^, if
he look not well to the foundation, judge ye^^ I am sure Saint Augustine ^
thought it wa^ not, and judged it A great sin, in point of salvation, for a
man to preferr^ (...), incertainties and naked ^os^ibilities before an (...)
and certai^e course. Now this ^ul^ of Sa^nt Augustines makes for us; for we
go upon cert^in^^^s, an^ walk in ^
the Via tu^a, the safe way, ^s that le^rn^d Knight, and my worthy good (...)
has shown at large.

(...) b^ene said, the vanity of the (...) for (as Master ^^del says, ^
in hi^ (...) Wad^sworths motives) by the (...) b^tter to have become a Jewish
Pro^elite, i^ the Apo^^les time, then a Christian: for the Christians
acknowledged the Jews to be the people of God, and s^iled them brethren,
notwithstanding their zeal to the Ceremonies, and traditions of their Fathers,
excused their ignorance, and ba^e with them. Whereas on the contrary they
called those that professed Christ, Heretics and S^ctaries, accursed them,
drew them out of their Synagogues, imprisoned them, as you do now the
Protestants.

By like reason a Pagan in Saint Augustines time, should rather have made
himself a Christian among the Donatists, then with the Catholics. For (as it
is already noted) the Catholics granted the Donatists Baptism to be true, and
accounted them bre^hren: the Donatists on the contrary Augustina pi^^ ^8.

do oftentimes grant our Conclusions, and that in sundry things our course is
the safer. As in making no Image of God. In trusting only in the merits of

Lord Jesus Christ alone. In allowing Ministers to marry. In diverse other points
also, many of your side, say the same with the Protestants, as it is already
shown in this trea^ise.

And therefore, if you will force the Argument, to make that the safest way of
salvation, which differing parts agree upon; why do you not join with u^,
since for the Positive, and Affirmative Articles of our Religion, no^ only the
m^st, but al^, Pr^t^stant and Pap^^^ ag^e^ therein?

For example s^ke, (...) C^alo^er's (...) Credo Eccle^i^m S. Catholicam. Page
8^ 85.
We agree on both sides, the Scrip^ures to be the R^le of Faith, the books of
the old Testam^nt written in Hebrew to be Canonical, that we are justified
by Faith, that God has made two Receptacl^s for men's s^^les aft^r death,
Heaven and Hell, that God may ^e wo^shipped in spirit without an Image, tha^ we
are ^o pray unto God by Christ, that there be two Sacram^n^s, that Christ is
really rec^ived in the Lords Su^per, that Christ made one oblation of himself
upon the Cross, for the Redemption, Propi^iation, and Satisfaction for the
sins of the whole world.

In a word, where they take the Negative part, as in withholding the Cup from
the Lai^ie, fo^bidding the administration of the Sacraments in the vulgar
tongue, and restraining the marriage o^ P^iests, yet even in th^se they
condescend unto u^, for the lawfulness of the things in themselves, and in
resp^ct of the law of God, an^ o^pose them only in rega^d of their
conveniencie, and for that the Church of Rome has otherwise orda^ned.

But see, our ^ffi^mations content them not. To the Scriptures the^ add^ and
equalize unwrit^en Traditions; to ^he Hebr^w Canon, the Apocrypha; to Faith in
the act of Iu^^ification, works; to Heaven and Hell, Purga^o^ie, Limbus Patrum,
and Limbus Puero^um; to the wo^ship of God in spirit, Images; to Prayer to God
by Christ, I^vocation and Intercession of S^in^s; to Bap^isme and ^he Lords
Supper, five other Sacram^nts; to the Reali^ie of Christ in the Sacramen^, his
Co^porall presence; to the Sacrifice of Christ upon the Cros^e, ^he Sacrifice
in the Mass; wit^ other like; and these we deny, as being Corrupt Additions
to the Faith.

These be our grounds wherein we enter-common with them; and these be their
additions and improvements which they have raised and enclosed upon the Lords
Freehold. Let us bri^fely survey them both: Bell^^m^ne is confid^nt that The
Apostles never used to Preach openly to the people other things than the
Articles of the Apostles Cre^d^ the ten Comman^^m^nts, and some of the
Sacraments: because (says he) (...). B^lla. de (...) D^i. lib. 4. c^p 11.
Primum.
these are simply necessary and profitable for all men; the rest besides, such
as that a man may be saved without them.

If one worship God without an Image, they will not deny but that this
spiritual worship is acceptable to God. If one call upon God alone, by the
only mediation of Christ, they will not say that this d^votion is fruitless.
If one say the Lords Prayer, or other devotions in the vulgar tongue, they will
not deny but that such Prayers as a^e made with understanding and in a known
languag^ may be fruitful and effectual.

For Lyra says, Si populus int^llig^^ orationem Sac^rdoti^, m^lius ^educitur
in D^um^ and d^voti^s ^^sp^nd^t (...). Lyra in 1 Cor. 14.
that If the people understand the prayer of the Priest, they are better
brought to the knowledge of God, and they answ^r Amen with greater devotion.

Cardinal Cajetan who had often performed the public service in an unknown
tongue in the Church, yet contrary to his practice professes, (...) doc^rina

p^p^lo (...) lingu^ (...) and p^pulo quam (...). (...) in c^p. 141. ad Co^inth.
ve^s. 17.
It is better, by Saint Paul's doctrine, for the ^difying of the Church, that
public prayers were made in a vulgar tongue, to be understood indifferently
by Pri^sts and people, ^han in Latin.

If a man receive the Sac^ament in both kinds, they will not, I suppose deny,
but that it is very comfortable to receive both p^rts o^ the Eucharist.

Alexander of Hales, the first and greatest of all the School m^n, pr^fesse^h;

both kinds is of more merit, for inc^ease of devotion and faith.

If o^e pe^forme the best wo^kes he can (which we also require) and stand not

not to trust to his own merits, but wholly and solely to cast himself on the
m^rcy of God in Jesus Christ.

Now this justifies our Religion, and shows that it is su^^icient to
salvation; in as much as the grounds thereof (setting aside the matters in
question between us) are fully able to instruct a man in all points necessary
to his salvation, both how to live religiously, and to die comfortably.

Hence also it follows, that (by their own conf^ssion) the controve^ted
points are unnecessary, and superfluous; in as much as a man may be saved, who
neither knows nor believes, nor practices these additions and excesses of
theirs.

Archbishop of Spalato says) (...) 1. nu. ^.9, 10. (...) Docto(...) in De(...)

Heresy consists in the defect, not in the excess of believing; and he is an

The Analogy and integrity of faith is hurt and broken by Addition, as well as
Subtraction, by Diseases as well as by Maimes. We are forbidden, (...) 4.2.

under the same p^naltie, either to add, or diminish ought from Gods word:
Faith is of the nature of a rule, or certain measure, to which if any thing be

(...) cap. 14.
) Is contained in a Rule; to know nothing beyond it, is to know all things. And

in our body the superabundance of humors is as dangerous as lack of them: as
many dye of Plethories as of Consumptions; a hand or foot which has more
fingers, or toes than ordinary, is alike monstrous, as that which wants the
due number. A foundation may be as well overthrown, by laying on it more than
it will bear, as by taking away that which is necessary to support the
building: Errors of addition are dangerous, as appears by these instances
following. The Samaritanes feared the Lord, and served their own Gods, 2.
King. 17.33. The Galathians believed the Gospel, yet retained also, and
observed the legal Ceremonies, Galath. 4.9. August. Haeres. 85.
Helvidiu^ held that blessed Mary had other children unto Joseph her husband,
after her son Jesus; here was an excess of belief, for he believed more
than was revealed: this opinion of Helvidius, although it be not denied in the
Scripture, yet it is erroneous, in as much as it is not therein affirmed,
neither can it be thence deduced by any good consequence; and therefore the
Church holding that she was a pure Virgin both before the birth of Christ, and
that she also continued a Virgin all her life after, condemned Helvidius for
an Heretic: now why were the Helvidians adjudged Heretics? surely because
they believed more than was reveled in the word, and would have thrust that on
the Church for an Article of faith, which had no ground at all.

And this is your case, you over-^each in your belief as the Helvidian
Heretics did: witness your tenets of Transubstantiation, adoration of Images,
Invocation of Saints, Purgatory, the Popes supremacy, and the like; wherein
your faith is monstrous, 2. Sam. 21.20.
like the G^ant of Gath, who had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot
six toes: and so it is with you; who in the new Creed of Pope Pius the fourth,
have shuffled in more Articles of faith than ever God, and his Catholic Church
made.

Neither do we fall short in our belief: for we measure our faith, by the
standard and rule of Gods written word^ now since it jumpeth with the rule, it
neither fails in defect, nor over-reacheth in excess. Now by this time I
hope I have performed the task which I undertook.

You have indeed given in a Catalogue of visible Professors in some part of
Christendom, but what is this to the whole universal Church?

PRO.
Very much; for these particular congregations serve to make up the whole state
of Christ his Church militant here on earth: now this Church far and wide
dispersed, has in her particular members (for substance of doctrine) taught as
we do.

In the Western Church we have the consent of the Waldenses in France, the
Wicklevists in England, commonly called Lollards, and Thaborites in Bohemia.

Here be then the Greek and Latin Church; the Churches in the the East, West,
North, and South; all of them teaching (for substance of doctrine) as we do.

I know indeed, that Bellarmine sleighteth these Churches of Graecia, Armenia,
Russia, and Aethiopia, saying, Bellarm. de verb. Dei. lib. 2. cap. ult. in fi^e
We are no more moved with their examples, than with the examples of Lutherans
and Calvinists; for they be either Heretics or Schismatics. So that all
Churches (be they never so Catholic and ancient) if they subscribe not to the
now Roman^ Faith, are either Schismatic or H^reticall. But we may not be so
uncharitable to these afflicted Churches. For (as learned Bishop Usher says)
Bishop Vshers Sermon of the Unity of Faith. page 28.
if we should take a survey of these Churches, and put by the points wherein
they did differ one from another, and gather into one body the rest of the
Articles wherein they all did generally agree, we should find, that in those
propositions which without all controve^sie are universally ^eceived in the
whole Christian world, so much truth is con^eined, as being joined with holy
obedience, may be sufficient to bring a man unto everlasting salvation.

Object.
I except against the Greek Church, for that it denies the procession of the
Holy Ghost from the Son of God.

Answer.
See the learned Answer to Master Fishers Relation of his third Conference, by
R. B. page 5.
Every error denies not Christ the foundation. Indeed it would have grated the
foundation, if they had so denied the procession of the Holy Ghost from the
Son, as that they had made an inequality between the Persons; but since
their form of speech is; Spiritum vero sanctum and ex Pa^re, et Spiritum
patris nominamus, ex silio a^tem Spiritum sanctum non dicimus^ sed spiritum
filij nomin^mus. D^mascen. lib. 1. ^id. Orthod c^p. 11.
that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father by the Son, and is the spirit
of the Son, and since, (as the Master of the Sentences says) Sed cum non sit
aliud Spir^tum sanctum esse Patris vel Filij, qu^m esse a Patre et Fi^io: etiam
in hoc in eandem nobiscum Fi^et s^ntentiam convenire videntur, li^et in ve^bis
di^^^^tiant. Magist. 1. Sent. Did. xi. D.
Non est aliud, It is not another thing to say, the Holy Ghost is the Spirit of
the Father and the Son, then that he is, or proceeds from the Father and the
Son, in this they seem to agree with us, In eandem fidei sententiam, upon
the same sentence of Faith, though they differ in words: Since I say, they thus
express themselves, they may continue to be a true Church, though erroneous
in the point mentioned.

In like sort, Scotus (following his Master Lombard) says, Pate^et ips^m
contr^rietatem non esse veraciter real^m, sicut est vocal^^. Scotus in 1. S^nt.
Did xi. qu. 1.
that The difference between the Greeks and the Latins in this point, is
rather Verbal, in the manner of speech, than Real, and material.

Besides, it seems by the same Scotus, that the Greeks held no other Heresy,
Sed quis audet hunc auctorem D^mascenu^, Basilium, Gregorium, and similes
patres Graecos arguere haeres^os. Id. Ibid.
then Saint Basil and Gregory Nazianzene held, whom yet no man durst ever yet
call Heretics; so that you must give us the famous Greek Church again.

PA.
I have yet diverse Parsons, third part of the three conversions. In his examen
of Foxes Calender. Chap. 6. number. ^ and nu. 9. and nu. 11.
exceptions to take at your Catalogue, as also at your English Martyrologie;
for you have named out of Fox, some for Martyrs, who were very mean persons,
namely, John Claydon, a Curriar of Leather, Richard Howden a Wooll-winder; as
also some, by name, Thomas Bagley, for a Martyr, who was a married Priest.

PRO.
What though some of them were tradesmen? did not Peter stay diverse days in
Ioppa, with one Simon a Tanner, Act. 9.43. Was not that godly convert Lydia a
seller of Purple? Act. 16.14. Has not God chosen the base things of the world
to confound the mighty? 1 Cor. 1.27. etc.

Besides, they were no such base people; for among others, I produced Sir John
Old Castl^, Lord Cobham, and Sir Roger Acton knight, burnt for Religion in the
reign of king Henry the fifth: and in Queen Mary's days, there were five
Bishops, one and twenty Divines, and eight Gentlemen who suffered for the
truth.

Lastly, what though some of them were simple people? Ruffin. Eccles. His^. l^.
1. cap. 3.
Ruffinus makes mention of a heathen philosopher at Nice, who through his great
skill in the art of Logic, wound himself (Adder-like) out of the bishops
arguments, that they were not able to put him to silence, until there rose up
in the Council a simple man who knew nothing but Christ and him crucified, who
with some blunt Interrogatories so amazed the Philosopher, that not only as a
dumb man he had not a word to reply, but yielded himself to the truth which
the plain man had uttered. Yea but they were married priests, whom we produce
for martyrs; what then? Gregory Nazianzen brings in his Father, who was Bp. of
the same See, speaking thus of him; Gr^gor. Nazianz. in Carmine d^ vita ^u^.
Edit. Morel. Paris. tom. 2.
Nondum tot annisunt tui, quotjam in sacris mihi sunt peracti victimis: that
is; the years of thine age, are not so many, as of my Priesthood. Whereby it
is clear that Gregory Nazianzen was born to his father, after the time of his
holy Orders. Doctor Hall the Honor o^ the ma^ried Clergy. lib. 2. sect. 8.
And least any man should susp^ct that this (...), this nondum, or, not a^ yet,
might reach only to the bi^th, not to the begetting of Gregory Nazianzen, so
as perhaps he might be born after his fathers o^d^rs^ and begotten before
them; it is further shown (which makes all sure and plain) that Gorgonia and
Caesarius the sister and brother of this Gregory, were by the same father
begotten af^erwards; as is evide^t both by that verse of Nazianzen, who
speaking of his mother, as th^n childles when she begged him of God, Nazianz
Ibid.
lays; Cupiebat illa masculum soetum domi
Spectare, magna ut pars cupit mortalium.


And the clear testimony of Elias Cretensis, saying, Quamvi^ enim si nari
vitatem^pectes, etc. Eli^s Cr^t^ns. in orat. G^eg. Naz. 19.
Although if you regard his birth, he was not the only child of his Parents,
forasmuch as after him both Gorgonia, and Caesarius were borne.

Now if this Bishop after holy Orders conversed conjugally with his wife, and
that without the Churches scandal; then is it not any disparagement to some of
our Martyrs that they were married Priests.

PA.
Fox names some for Martyrs, who afterward were living.

PRO.
There might be some that received the sentence of death, and martyrdom, and
yet the same parties upon occasion, and mediation, might come to be reprieved,
or released, and this not come to Mr. Fox his knowledge. This cannot discredit
the whole story, taken for the most part out of your own registers, and other
credible witnesses.

PA.
You have put some into your Catalogue who were excommunicate persons, and
condemned to be burnt for Heretics: as namely Husse, and Wickliffe, whose
body was dug up forty years after his burial, and burnt by the Popes
command.

PRO.
Indeed they were Heretics in such manner as Christ was called and condemned
for a Math. 26.65.
Blasphemer; or as Saint Paul says Acts 24.14.
, After the way which they call heresy, so worship we the God of our Fathers,
believing all things which are written in the Law and the Prophets.

Indeed, if this be heresy, to acknowledge no other foundation, then that
which God himself has laid, no other Mediator then Christ Jesus, nor any
expiation but by his blood, nor any propitiatory sacrifice but his death, nor
any satisfaction to Gods justice but his obedience, nor any rule to guide us
infallibly to salvation, but his word contained in the holy Scriptures; if this
I say be heresy, then may they and we be so reputed.

Now to discover who be Heretics indeed, let the Reader look to the voice of
the Church before these odds grew, and see which way the Church inclined. For
though in the Primitive Ages thereof, the writers could not speak so expressly
and punctually against heresies until they sprang up, yet even then they
delivered such grounds, as might serve to overthrow the errors and
superstition which afterward arose.

Yea but our Professors have been excommunicated and condemned, so was the
blind man in the Gospel, whom our Savior cured, he was cast out of the
Synagogue, John 9.34.

Ejecerunt ^um ^oras, id est, ^ societate aliorum homi^um excommuni^^verunt.

and yet Christ took him into his protection, for the good profession he made.

It might be that in those papal censures, the keys were mistaken, or the
wards of the lock changed, and then Errante clave Ecclesia, their censures did
not bind.

dignity and honor, to Flaviani in their age, Bucer and F^gius after their
death; what time that papal conspir^cie had not only with an erring Key bound,
but dug up their bodies out of their graves, and burned them to ashes.

The papal faction has been but too peremptory in their censures; ^hey were
far from the moderation of the Curat in Paris, who being to publish an
Excommunication, what time there was great difference between the Emperou^
Frederick the second, and Pope Innocent the fourth, he thus acquitted
himself. Give ear (says he to his Morney of the Mystery of Iniquity.
Progress. 51.
Parishioners) I have received commandment to pronounce the solemn sentence
of Excommunication against the Emperor Frederick, candles put out, and bells
ringing. Now I know not the cause that deserves this, and yet I am not ignorant
of the great odds that is between them: I know also that one of them does
wrong the other, but which it is I know not: so far forth then as my power
does extend, I excommunica^e and pronounce excommunicated one of the two,
namely him that does the injury to the other, and absolve him that suffers
the wrong, which is so hurtful unto all Christendom. Thus far he.

Now the thing which we require on the behalf of out professors so
injuriously dealt withal, as that their sworn enemies b^came both their
witnesses and their Judges, which even common reason it self Inimicus
capitalis nunquam admittitur esse accusator. Glossa apud Gratian. par. 2. causa

Parsons third part of Convers. chap. 3.
Your Waldenses, Wicklifists and Hussites, and such as you account Confessors
and Martyrs they errea in diverse points, they varied amongst themselves, and
differed from you; so that they cannot belong to the same Church.

PRO.
Concerning Wickliff^, Husse, and the rest, if they have any of them borne
record to the truth, and resisted any innovation of corrupt Teachers in their
times, even to blood, they are justly to be termed Martyrs: yea, albeit they
saw not all corruptions, but in some were themselves carried away with the
stream of error. Else, if because they erred in some things, they be no
Martyrs; or because we dissent from them in some things, we are not of the same
Church, both you and we must quit all claim, to Saint Cyprian, Justin Martyr,
and many more whom we count our ancients and predecessors, and bereave them
also of the honor of martyrdom, which so long they have enjoyed. Irenaus, and
Justin Martyr held the error of the Millenaries, Cyprian and many others held
Rebaptization necessary for such as were baptized by heretics. S Austin, and
the greatest part of the Church for six hundred years, held a necessity of
the Eucharist to Infants; and in other things differed one from another; and
from the Church in the aftertimes, correcting their errors: yet because they
all entirely and stedf^stly held all the necessary fundamental principles
which these errors did not infringe, neither held they these errors obstinatly,
but only for want of better information; they were of the same Church and
Religion whereof we are. S. Austin says, Alia sunt de quibus inter se

There be some things in which the most Learned, and best Defenders of the
Catholic Rule (the bond of faith preserved) do sometimes not agree among
themselves; and one in some one thing says righter than anoher.

Now if the different opinions of the Fathers in some points, hindered not their
union in substance of the faith, and their being members all of the same
Church: why should the like or lesser differences now among the Protestants,
hinder their union in substance of the same faith, and their being members all
of the same Chuch, both among themselves and with the Fathers? yea but
Wickliffe and Husse with others mentioned in our Catalogue, they erred in point
of faith; it is true, but yet their error was not joined with pertinacy; they
err^d not incorrigibly, bu^ for want of better information; they erred in that
doctrine of faith, wherein the truth was not fully scanned, declared, and
confirmed by a Plenary Council, as S. Austin speaks (...) and ipse sine

Answer.
The Protestants, especially we of the Church of England are at unity, as
appears by the Harmony of our confessions, as also by our joint subscriptions
to the Articles of Religion established.

And for the point mentioned, the difference is nothing so great, as you would
have it thought: for (as the most learned and judicious Zanchius De D^ssidio in

Doctor Field out of him.) In all necessary points, both the parties agree and
dissent in one unnecessary, which by right understanding one another, might
easily be compounded.

Both sides Extra C^^^am, panis non dissert ab alijs communibus ^ibis -- pa^^m

says Zanchius, do agree, that the elements of bread and wine are not
abolished in their substance, but only changed in their use; which is, not
only to signify, but also to exhibit and communicate unto us, the very body
and blood of Christ, with all the gracious working and fruits thereof.

Both parties agree, that the very body and blood of Christ are truly present
in the Sacrament, and by the faithful truly and really received.

Thus far all parties agree, that is, in the whole necessary and sufficient
substance of the doctrine of this Sacrament: for the other matter wherein they
differ, Sed de modo praesentiae inter hos and illos non convenit. Ibid.
de modo, of the manner how Christ is present in the Sacrament, seeing it is
not expressed in the Scriptures, in the judgment of Zanchius, Neque enim in
scriptis ulla aperta mentio est de unione Corporis Christi cum Symbolis, vel de
praesentia corporis Christi in Coena; quamobrem potuisset. haec question s^^e
ullo ecclesiae detrimento omitti. Ibid.
it might well be omitted; and they themselves confess, when they have gone as
far as they can to determine it, still it is ineffable, and not possible to
be fully understood. It is enough for us (says the same Quare Ecclesiam
Christi, et fideles non solum panem; sed etiam ipsum verum Christi corpus in
Coena recipere ac manducare: id quod certi satis, meo judicio, esse debuerat in
Ecclesia Christi. Ibid.
Zanchius) to believe the body and blood are there, though how and in what
manner we cannot define.

So then in this maine controversy between them about Consubstantiation,
which as Zanchius says, Secum traxit illam aliam de ubiquitate quaestionem.
Ibid.
did afterward occasion that other of ubiquity; in both these controversies,
the main truth on both sides is out of controversy; that Christ is really and
truly exhibited to each faithful Communicant, and that in his whole person he
is every where: the doubt is only in the manner, how he is in the Symbols, and
how in heaven and earth.

Now for other ods amongst us, they be but in Ceremonies, or at worst, in
points of no absolute consequence; whereas the differences amongst Papists
concern the life of Religion.

They differ concerning the Supreme authority of the Church, whether it be in
the Pope, or in the General Council. The Councels of Constance and Basil
determined, Constant. Council. sess. 4 Basil. sess. 33. Comment. Aen. Sylvij de
gestis Basil. Conc. lib. 1.
that a General Council was above the Pope; the Council of Florence decreed
the Pope to be above a General Council.

They differ concerning the manner of the conception of the Virgin Mary. The
Dominican Friars following the Thomists, hold that she was conceived in
Original sin; the Franciscans hold the contrary.

The modern Popes dis^gree with the ancient, concerning the dignity of
universal Bishop, adoration of Images, Transubstantiation, Communion in both
kinds, and the Merit of good works, as is already shown in the fifth and
seventh Centurie of this treatise.

So clear is it, that some doctrines of the later Roman Church were opposed by
the ancient Roman Bishops th^mselves, to wit, adoration of Images Adorare vero
Imagines, om^ibus modis d^vita. Greg. lib. 9 ep. 9
, as also the dignity and title of universal Bishop Idem lib. 6. ep. 30.

Besides, the Jesuits and Dominicans differ at this day concerning the weighty
point of Free Will and Grace.

The truth is, the Popish Faith varieth not only with their persons, but
according to time and place; so that they can exchange their tenets upon
occasion, advance or cry down their opinions at their pleasure, as may best
serve for their advantage. For, (as Azorius the Jesuit says F^equ^nter accidit
ut quae (...) pa^cis ab hinc (...) non crat, modo (...) recipi^tu^. In (...)
non^ulla scriptores tradid^tun^ Cru^e^ non esse (...) dae^ honor and

lib 2. ^p 13
) It falls out often, that that which was not the common opinion a few years
since, now is. And, that which is the common opinion of Divines in one Country,
is not so in another; As in Spain and Italy, it is the common opinion, that
Latreia, or divine worship is due to the Cross, which in France and Germa^y is
not so, but some inferior kind of worship due thereunto. And Navarrus the
Casuist says, (...), ut contraria asseratur in e^; scilicet Papa^ esse
Concilio superiorem. Mart. (...) cap. Novit. de Iudi^ijs.
That at Rome, no man may say, that the Council is above the Pope, nor at
Paris, that the Pope is above the Council.

In a word, the Papists are at great odds, but they cunningly conceal them;
insomuch as it is observed, that some of them would say to their friends in
private; Sic dicerem in Scholis; sed tamen (mane^^ in^er nos) div^rsu^ sentio.
(...). ad Abbat. Visperg. page 448. edit. Basil. 1569.
Thus, or thus I would say in the schools, and openly; Sed (maneat in^er nos)

We may (happily) be at ods in some Scholasticke points; but not in matters

You would have us believe, that at the sound of the Pop^s sentence, like frogs
in a marish, at the falling in of a great log or stone, you are all hushed and
silenced: but it is not so, for since the Trent decrees were published, diverse
of your side are divided about the sense thereof; i^somuch as they differ in
the maine points thereof, which in your account are fundamental, and the
deniers thereof reputed Heretics. This may appear by these instances.

to be above a Council; and yet since that time, Convincitur inde aliquid magis
esse authoritatis penes totum Concilium recte (ut decet) congregatum, quam
penes solum Ponti^icem. Alph. a Castro. advers. haer. lib. 1. cap. 2.
Alphonsus a Castro has writ the contrary. The Trent Council teaches (Sess.
6.) Justification by Inherent righteousness, condemning those that believe the
imputation of Christ's Righteousness; and yet Albertus Pighius Pighius
controvers secunda de Iustis^^t. hominis.
defends imputed ^ighteousnesse, and so does Cardinal Contaren, in his
treatise of Justification.

Again, the Pope decreed against the certainty of grace and salvation, defining
(Sess. 6.) that no man should believe these things of himself; and yet
Dic^mus, (...) acroborari, and clariorem in nobis a^^idue ^ie^i ad^ptae Grati^
Certitudin^m. Catharin. Disceptat. (...) de certitudine Gratiae.
Catharinus defended the contrary, holding that a man might have the certainty
of Faith touching these things^ and when the Trent Councels authority was
objected against him, he eluded it by diverse slight distinctions. The truth
is, the Papists have a kind of unity, to wit, a superstitious and
hypocritical crouching to the popes chayre^ for so long as they agree to go to
mass, swear to the popes supremacy, other things are tolerated although they
consent like harp and harrow.

And surely were it not for the great profit, and riches, which knit the parts
of this body together like twins that have different heads, but tied together
by the belly, we should see this great body of the papacy, would soon be
divided, scattered, and dispersed.

Howsoever, for any differences amongst the Protestants, we may thankefully
acknowledge, that it was the wonderful Providence of God, that so many
several Countries, Kingdoms and States, abandoning the abuses of the Church,
or rather Court of Rome, and making particular reformation in their own
dominions, without general meetings and consents, should have no more, nor
greater differences than are found amongst them.

It is usual with you in your Catalogue to say, such and such, as namely S.
Bernard, or the like, taught (for substance) as you do, agreeing only with you
in some fundamental points; but this will not serve to make them members of
your Church; for by the like reason the Quartadecimanes, Novatians, Donatists,
and Pelagians might pretend to the Catholic Church, in as much as they agreed
therewith in some fundamental truths.

Answer.
1 Agreement in one or more fundamentals, makes not a man a Catholic
Christian, tho disagreement in any one fundamental joined with obstinacy
makes a man an Heretic.

2 To make a man actually a member of the true Church, more is required than
agreement in the profession of the same fundamental points of faith: for not
only heresy, but schism also excludes a man from Communion with the true
Catholic Church.

3 Fundamental points as well conce^ne life and manners, as faith; and he that
impugneth the doctrine of the Decalogue, is as well an Heretic, as he that
impugneth the doctrine of the Creed. Nicholas directly impugned the one, and by
evident consequence the other, by maintaining his impure communion, or rather
community of wives.

4 The Quarta decimanes, who kept Easter on the fourteenth day precisely were
of two sorts.

Some, as Polycrates and other Bishops of Asia, kept it so, merely in
imitation of S. John the Evangelist; and those were never condemned for
Heretics. Others kept the fourteenth day by virtue of the Mosaicall Law; and
these by consequent destroyed the foundation; as those did among the
Galathians, who urged Circumcision, to whom S. Paul there professes, That
Christ should not profit them, and that they were fallen from grace.
5 Novatians erred in a fundamental point concerning Repentance, and by
consequent overthrew that Article of the Creed, Credo remissionem peccatorum.

6 The Donatists were rather Schismatikes than Heretics, and rather made a
rent in the Church, then were excluded from it. Saint Austin in his seventh
tome, every where calls it Schisma Donati: in the end they grew to be
heretics, and denied in effect that fundamental Article, Credo Ecclesiam
Catholicam.

7 The Pelagians erred in diverse fundamental points, concerning original
sinn^, and the necessity of Grace.

For farther answer we say, that the Authors we produce against the Romanists
are of two sorts.

1 Some we allege only as Testes veritatis, in such or such a point, or
points of faith. 2 Others we produce as members of our reformed Church, and
forerunners of Luther.
Of the first sort is Bernard, very orthodoxe in all points against the
Pelagians, but otherwise tainted, and an open enemy to the Albigenses.

Of the second sort are the Waldenses, Wicklifists, and Hussites who (as
appears by their confessions of faith extant in Orthuinus Gratius, and the
History of the Waldenses) agree with u^ in all Fundamentals, not only in some,
as the Heretics above mentioned agreed with the Church.

Objection.
What though Saint Hierome, Bernard, and others agree with you in some general
truths? men of contrary religions may have diverse materials of doctrine common
to both: now this is but a genericall agreement, which is no more than the
agreement between a man and a beast.

Answer.
1 Saint Hierome and Bernard are not well rancked together; Saint Hierome was a
through Papist in no point; Bernard was in some, living in a corrupt age,
seven hundred years after Saint Hierome.

2 Besides, we answer, that Waldo, Wickliffe and Husse, with others, agree with
us not only Generically, in the common grounds of Christianity, but
Specifically in those formal points, which we hold at this day against the
Roman Church; and as for such calumnies as are cast upon them, they are
already confuted in this treatise, neither will any indifferent person regard
them; for when once that infamous name of Heretic was fastened upon a man,
nothing was too heavy for such an one, any thing was believed of that man: and
from thence it is, without question, that we find so many, so absurd, so
senseless opinions imputed to them by the Romists; such as indeed could not
in truth with any possibility, fall into the imagination, or fancy of any
man, much less be doctrinally, or dogmatically delivered.

Besides, many of the books and writings of Wickliffe and Husse are extant,
wherein are found no such doctrines as Papists have charged them with, but
rather the contrary.

So that we hope there is no indifferent person will regard their slanders; for
even at this day, when things are in present view and action, they calumniate
the persons, and falsify the doctrine of our professors, as grossly as ever
Pagans traduced the Primitive Christians, for instance sake, they give it out,
that we hold, that Norint isti suorum axiomata^ Deus est author peccati, opera
nostra Deu^ nequaquam curat, etc. Campian. rat. 8.
God regards not our good works; whereas we believe, that Apologia Ecclesiae
Anglicanae ( in 2. part. ca. 2^) testatur, Bona opera necessaria esse
Christiano ad salutem. Rainold. apolog. These. Page 263.
Good works are necessary to salvation; and, Sona opera sunt necessaria ad
salutem; non tanqua^ causa ad eff^ctum, vel meritum ad mercedem; sed tanquam
antecedens ad Consequ^^^, vel tanquam medium ^i^e quo non ad ^inem. Zach.
Vrsinus Catechetic. part 3. de gratitudine.
Works are said to be necessary for us unto salvation, to wit, not as a cause
of our salvation, but as a mean or way, without which we come not unto it; as
a Consequent following Justification, wherewith Regeneration is unseparably
joined.

In like sort, they gave out, that Beza recanted his Religion before his death;
whereas he lived to confute this shameless lie, and with his own hand wrote a
tract which he called Beza Redivivus, Beza Revived.

Thus also of late have they, dealt with that Reverend zealous and learned
Prelate, Doctor King, late Bishop of London, giving it out in their idle The
Protestants plea. The Bishop of Londons Legacy.
Pamphlets, that he was reconciled to the Church of Rome, which is
unanswerably Doctor Henry Kings Sermon at Paul's Cross 25. November. 1621.
proved to be a gross lie: for toward his death he received the holy
Sacrament at the hands of his Chapleine, Doctor Cluet, Archdeacon of
Middle-sex: he received it together with his wife, children, and family, whom
he had invited to accompany him to that Feast: whereof he protested in the Si^
Henry Martin his Chancelour, Master Mathias Chaldicot^ Master Philip King his
brother. Doctor Henry King, Doctor John King, his son^es etc.
presence and hearing of diverse personages of good note, that his soul had
greatly longed to eat that last Supper, and to perform that last Christian
duty before he left them: and having received the Sacrament, he gave thanks to
God in all their hearing, that he had lived to finish that blessed work, for
so himself did call it. And then drawing nearer to his end, ^e expressly caused
his Chapleine, then his Ghostly Father, to read the Confession and absolution,
according to the ordinary form of Common prayer appointed in our Li^urgie.
Did this worthy Prelate now dye a Papist, who to his last breath, communicated
with the Church of E^gland?

Besides, whereas Preston the Priest was given out to be the man that
reconciled the Bishop to the Sea of Rome; Preston (as appears by his
Examination and Answer taken before diverse honorable Commissioners The
Examination of Thomas Preston, t^k^n before the Lo^d Archbishop of Canterbury
at Lambeth, December. 20. 1621.
) protested before God, and upon his conscience, as he should answer at the
dreadful day of Judgment, that the said Bishop of London did never confess
himself unto him, nor ever received Sacramental absolution at his hands, nor
was ever by him reconciled to the Church of Rome, neither did renounce before
him the Religion professed and established in the Church of England.

Yea, he added farther, that as he hoped to be saved by Christ Jesus, he to his
knowledge, was never in company where the said Doctor King, late Lord Bishop of
London was, neither did he ever receive letter from him, nor did write letter
unto him, neither did he ever (to his knowledge) see the said Bishop in any
place whatsoever, nor could have known him from another man.

You have singled out some testimonies of Fathers, Schoolmen, and others; and
alleged them on your own behalf, as if they had thereby been of your
Religion: whereas they be our witnesses, and speak more fully for us, than for
your side.

Answer.
According to the Rule in law; Testem que^ quis inducit pro se, te^etur
recipere contra se; you have produced them for your own ends, and now in
reason you cannot disallow them, when they are alleged by us; so that you
must give us leave to examine your men upon cross Interrogatories.

Besides, one may be a material witness, who speaks home to two or three
Interrogatories, although he cannot depose to all the rest.

It is no part of our meaning to take the scantling of our ancestors Religion
from some single testimonies, wherein they either agree with, or dissent from
us; but from the maine body of the substantial points of doctrine which are
controverted betwixt us at this day. Neither make we any such simple
collection, Such a man held such a point with us, therefore he was a
Protestant: no more then we allow them to frame the like: Such a man, in such
or such a particular, agreed with the n^w Church of Rome, therefore he was a
Papist. For, it follows no more than this; an Ethiopian or Tauny-moore is
white in part, namely in his teeth, therefore he is white all over. But our
care has been, (that since In the mouth of two or three witnesses every word
is established, Deuteronomy. 19.15. and tha^ as Unique testi, ne^ Catoni creditum est.
Hieron. Apolog. advers. Ruf^in. lib. 2. page 223. ^om. 2.
Hie^ome says, One single witness, were it Cato himself, is not so much to
be credited) to join together the several testimonie^ o^ such worthies as
lived in the same age; presuming, that what some of note delivered, and the
same not opposed by their contemporaries, that, that is to be supposed to have
been the doctrine commonly received in those countries, and at that time.

Upon these and the like considerations, the Reader may be pleased to rest
satisfied with such passages as have been produced on our behalf, though not
so thronged and full in every age; inasmuch as diverse of our Ancestors have not
left unto us sufficient evidence, whereby it might appear what they held in
diverse particulars. Besides that, there be diverse testimonies suppressed, so
as we can hardly come by them; as namely in Faber Stapulensis his Preface to
the Evangelists, there is a notable place touching the Scriptures Suficiencie;
the words are these: The Scripture suffices, and is the only Rule of eternal
life; whatsoever ag^eeth not to it, is not so necessary as superfluous. The
Primitive Church knew no other Rule but the Gospel, no other Scope but Christ,
no other Worship than was due to the Individual Trinity. I would to God the
form of believing were fetched from the Primitive Church. Thus says
Stapul^nsis.

Now this whole passag^ is appointed by the Expurgatory Index of Spain, to be
l^f^ ou^ in their later editions; and yet by good hap, I met with this passage
Verbum dei suffi^it, hoc unicum satis est ad vitam quae terminum nescit
inveniendam: ^aec u^ica regula vitae aeternae, magistra est, u^inam credendi
form^ a Pri^itiv^ peteretur E^clesi^, quae nullam regulam prae^e^ Evangelium

Ann. 1^23.
in an edition a^ Bas^l^ as also in anoth^r at Colen An. 1541.

In like sort I ^^nd alleged out of Lu^ovicus Vives, his Commentaries upon
Saint Augustine d^ Civitate Dei, these passages following touching the Canon of
the Scripture, and the practiced Adoration of Images in his time; namely the
same Vives says, that The story of Susanna, of Bell, and the Dragon are not
Canonical Scripture; he says also, that Saints are esteemed and worshipped by
many, as were the Gods among the Gentiles.

These places I carefully sought for, in the several editions of S. Austin, at
A^twerpe, Anno 1576. at Paris, Anno 1586. at Coleine, Ann. 1616. but no such
place was there to be found, the Divines of Lovaine had taken a course with
them, and suppressed these testimonies; but by good hap I met with them in the
Basil Edition, Q^^dea Beli H^^toria and tot^m 14. caput ^um histo^ia Su^^nnae

Those whom you have named in your Catalogue, were Bellar. lib 4. de Eccl. cap
5.. P^ae^erea. And Brereley^ Prot. Apol. tract 2. cap. 2. sect. 12.
originally Catholics, and not Protestants; Wickli^fe and Husse were Catholic
Priests, and Luther was an Augustine Friar: you cannot name such as were
Protestants originally, they came forth of our Church.

Answer.
Whence I pray you sprang Christ's Apostles? were they not taken out of the
Jewish Church at that time much corrupted? S. Paul speaking of himself, and
the service of his God, 2 Timoth. 1.3. Cui servio a progenitoribus meis^ id
est, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, qui ^uerant very culiores Dei^ and similiter
Ga^ali^^ qui nut^ivit Paulu^, and in lege do^uit. Ly^an. in loc.
says, Whom I do serve from my progenitors, meaning Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
the first Fathers of the faithful; for as for S. Paul's immediate predecessors,
it is likely that they relished of the leven of the Pharisees.

It can be no more prejudice to our Church, that Luther, Wickliffe and Husse
were originally Papists, than to S. Paul that he was originally a Pharisee, or
to S. Austine that he was orinally a Manichee, or to our Ancestors at the first
conversion of our land that they were originally heathen, or to all true
Converts that they were originally unregenerate. For as Tertullian says, De
ve^^ris suimus, s^unt ^on nascuntur Christiani. Terullian Apologet. advers.
Gent. cap. 18.
Fiunt non nascuntur Christiani; We are not borne Christians, but we become
Christians.

Neither is it true that we can name none of our Church that were not
originally Papists. For Farellus and the Waldensian Ministers for more than
400. years were not originally Papists (though Waldo himself was.)

Besides, the Fathers for 600 years, and the Monks in Britain at Augustines
coming were not originally Papists.

In the Greek Church from 700. to 700 afterward, many thousands held as we
do in all fundamentals, who never were originally Papists, nor millions of
others in the Eastern Churches, and namely in the Greek Church, there have
been from 700. to 700. afterward, many thousands which held as we do in all
fundamentals, and never were originally Papists.

Lastly, the like argument might be urged against all that embraced Reformation
in Josias days, that they originally were involved in the common errors and
Idolatry of the Jewish Church. Likewise that Zachary and Elizabeth, and Simeon,
and Anna, and the Apostles were originally deduced from that Church, which held
many errors concerning the temporal kingdom of the Messiah, and divorces for
other causes than adultery, etc. Which errors Christ and his Apostles reproved.

In England, and most parts of the world, the first Christians were originally
Paynims and Idolaters: what prejudice is that to Christianity, or advantage to
Heathenisme?

Your Churches professors mentioned in your Catalogue wanted lawful succession.

Answer.
There is a twofold succession; the one lineall and local, the other
doctrinall; this of doctrine is the life and soul of the other. Eis obaudire
opportet qui ^um Episcopatus successione Charisma verita^is certum a^ceperunt;
Reliquos qui absistunt a principali successione suspectos habere. Iren. advers.
Haer. lib. 4. cap. 43.
Irenaeus describes those which have true succession from the Apostles; To be
such as with the succession of the Episcopal office, have received the
c^rt^ine grace of truth: and this kind of succession he calle^h the princip^ll
succession. Gregory Nazianzen having said, that At^anasius succeeded Saint
Mark in godliness, Greg Nazianzen. in l^^d (...).
adds, That this succession in godliness is properly to be accounted
succ^ssion: for he that holds the same doctrine is also p^rtaker of the same
throne, but he that is against the doctrine, must be reputed an adversary, even
while h^e sits in the thro^e, but the former has the thing it self, and
the truth: so that according to Irenaeus and Nazianz^n, succession in doctrine
su^ficeth: yea Nazianzen (as we have heard) makes it all one (...); so that he
which holds the same truth of doctrine may be said to sit in the same Chair
of succession.

Besides, we are able to show succession also in place for ^ive hundred years
in most parts of Christendom; and since that in the Greek Church until this
day, and in the Latin Church from the time of Waldo, in France, Bohemia, and
other places.

And for the Church of England, the lineall succession of her Bishops is shown
particularly by Mr. Francis Mason, de ministerio Anglicano; Mr. Goodwin in his
Catalogue of the Bishops of England, and Mr. Isaacson in his Chronologicall
Table of the succession of the Bishops of England.

PA.
Name in the space of a thousand years next before Luther, three known and
confessed Protestant Bishops, succeeding each to other, and if you had such,
express their agreement with you, in the maine points controverted between us.

PRO.
This demand was eagerly pressed upon me, by a Romish Priest, but the Stone
which he hurled at me, not coming forth of David's sling, recoiles upon
himself, like the stone that Achilles flung at a dead skull, which ^ebounded
back and struck out the slingers eye^ -- Redijt lapis ultor ab osse,
Actorisque suifrontem, ocul^sque petit.


For I would in like manner demand of him to name three known and confessed
Popish Bishops succeeding each other, who maintained the worship of Images
before the second Council of Nice; or that believed Transubstantiation before
the Roman Council under Pope Nicholas^ or that avowed the dry and half
Communion before the Council at Constance under Martin the fifth; or that held
the effect of the Sacraments to depend upon the Priests intention before the
Council at Florence; or defined the Pope to be above a General Council
before the Council of Lateran under Leo the tenth; or that determined the
twelve new Articles of Pius the fourth his Creed to be all de Fide, and
necessary to salvation, before the Council of Trent.

Besides, there is no necessity of naming three Bishops succeeding each other,
and opposing Popery: It suffices to name such as opposed it, tho they sat
not successively in the same Chair; for all Romish errors and superstitions
rushed not in at once into the Church, but by degrees; now such as held the
fundamentals with us, and opposed any one error or more when they were first
espied to creep into the Church, they were Protestants, though they went not
then under that name.

Now according to this account of Protestants, we can produce many more than
three Bishops succeeding each other, who in their times made head against
Romish usurpations and superstitions; for instance sake, S. Austine, and with
him two hundred and seventeene Bishops of Africa, and their successors for a
hundred years together (if their own Boni^acij 2. Epis^. ad Eu^al. Al^xandr.

Records be true) opposed the Popes supremacy in point of Appeals.

To speak nothing of the innumerable Bishops in the Eastern Churches, and the
Habassines and Muscovites, and elsewhere succeeding each the other for many
hundred years, differing in no fundamental point from Protestants, and
keeping no quarter at all with the Pope or See of Rome; when Austine the Monk
was sent into England by Gregory the Great, the most ancient British and Irish
Bishops withstood the Popes authority and ordinances, stiffly adhering to the
Churches of Asia in their celebration of Easter; and tho they were cut off from
the Popes Communion, yet they slighted it, and persisted in their former
opinions and customs, as I have already shown in the sixth Centurie.

In the later ages, The History of the ^^ld^nses book. 1. Cha 9
Rainerius the Popish Inquisitour, makes mention of two famous Bishops of the
Waldenses, one Balazinanza of Verona, and one John de Lugio, about the year
1250. And I have shown in the twelfth age, out of Matthew Paris, Ipse
[^ath^l^m^us] ^reat Epi^^opos, and Ecclesias pers^^e ordina^e ^ont^ndi^. Math.
Par^^ Hi^^or. ad ann. 1223
about the year of Grace 1223, that amongst the Albigenses, there was one
Bartholomew who ordered and governed the Churches in Bulgaria, Croatia,
Dalmatia, Hungaria, and appointed Ministers, insomuch as the Bishop of
Portuense, the Popes Legate in those parts, complained thereof. And in the
fifteenth age, I have shown out of Cochleus, in his History of the Hussites
Cochleus Histor Hussit. lib. 5.
, known and confessed Protestants, how Con^adus Archbishop of Prague became
an Hussite, and held a Council at Prague in the year 1421 and there compiled a
Confession of their Faith agreeable to the doctrine of the Reformed Churches.
Now those who succeeded the forenamed Bishops among the Waldenses and
Albigenses, as also the Hussites, although they carried not the titles of
Bishops, yet they exercised Episcopal authority in ordaining Priests, the
Catalogue of whom is extant in the history of the Waldenses and Albigenses.
And thus they have in Master ^ed^l^ letters to Wadsworth. chap. 11.
Germany, those whom they call Superintendents, and general Superintendents;
and where these are not, as in the French Churches, yet There are, says
Zanchius, usually certain chief men that do in a manner bear all the sway,
as if order it self, and necessity led them to this course. And what are
these but Bishops in effect, unless we shall wrangle about names, which for
reason of State, those Churches were to abstain from.

Since you impute so many errors to the Church of Rome, which you pretend to
have reformed, tell us when those corruptions came in, for doubtless some
histories would note them, some learned men oppose them: for in every great and
notorious change, there may be observed the Author, time and place, with the
like Circumstances, as Bellarmine In omni insigni mutatione demonstra^^ possunt
author ejus, tempus quo coepit, locus ubi. Bellarm. lib. 4. de not. cap. 5.. In

says.

By the like reason it would follow, that a Tenant who had long dwelt (he and
his Ancestors) in a decayed house, should not be bound to repair it, unless
his Landlord could tell him in what year or month every rafter or wall began
to decay; a sick patient should not purge out an ill humor, unless he or his
Physician could name the time, when his first mis-diet had bred this humor; so
Naaman because he was once clean, and could not tell the very time, means,
and degrees of the coming of his Leprosy, might be proved to be clean
still, and need neither the Prophet nor the washing, 2 King. 5.

Errors and abuses are not all of one sort; there were some heresies, such as
the Arrian and Nestorian, which struck at the very head, the one at the
divinity of Christ, the other at the divinity of the Holy Ghost, and these
being notorious, were soon discerned, and opposed, and herein Bellarmines
reason many take place: but Popery, like that mystery of iniquity, 2 These.
2.7. works closely, it creeps and spreads abroad like a Cancker, or Gangreene,
2. Tim. 2.17. it is like the Cockatrices Egg, a long time in the shell, before
the Cockatrice it self appear.

Now these kind of corruptions creep into the Church secretly and insensibly,
and are best known by their differences from their first pure doctrine; so
that if we can show the present doctrines of Rome (refused by us) disagree from
the Primitive, it is enough to show there has been a change, though we
cannot point out the time, when every point began to be changed.

Tertullian says, Ipsa enim doctrina ^orum cum Apostolica co^parat^. ex

Besides, they that call upon us to show the time, place, and persons, of such
and such changes in Religion, cannot themselves perform the like.

Gregory de Valentia, a learned Jesuit, confesses, that the use of receiving
the Sacrament in one kind, began first in some Churches, and grew to be a
general custom in the Latin Church, not much before the Council of
Constance, in which, at last (to wit, about two hundred years agon) this
custom was made a law. But if they put the question to him, as they do to us,
and ask him, When did that custom first get f^oting in some Churches? he
returns this for Answer, Valent. de Legit. usu Euchar. cap. 10.
Minime constat, it is more than he can tell.

long unknown, it is not to be marveiled that in the first times of the Church
there was no use of Indulgences; for they had their beginning after that men
had a while been scared with the torments of Purgatory, which as the same

Bellarmine says, Sancti coeperunt coli in Ecclesia universali, non t^m Lege

that The worship and Invocation of Saints was brought into the Church rather
by custom than any precept.

Concerning prayer in an unknown tongue; It is to be wondered how the Church
altered in this point, ( Mirum in h^c re, quam Ecclesiae mutata fit consuetudo.
Erasm. in 1. Cor. 14.
says Erasmus) but the precise time he cannot tell. So little reason have they
to think that al such changes must be made by any one certain author, it being
confessed, that some of them may come in pedetentim (as B. Fisher says of
purgatory) by little and little, not so very easy to be discerned; some may
come in by the silent consent of many, and grow after into a general custom,
the beginning whereof is past man's memory (as the abstaining from the cup) and
some may arise of the undiscreet devotion of the multitude (as those of
Purgatory and Indulgences) and some from the want of devotion in the people,
(as ^he private Masses) and some also must be attributed to the very change of
time it self; as public prayers in an unknown tongue, in Italy, France and
Spain, for there a long time the Latin was commonly understood of all: but
when afterward, Seu paucorum d^sid^, ne laborem susciperent immutandi and
corrigendi Liturgiam, posteaquam p^r barbaras gentes, Latinus sermo paulatim
corruptus exolevit, and a^ire coepit in varias vulgares Linguas, etc. Rainold.
These. 5. page 164.
by the invasion of those barbarous nations, the Goths and Vandals, their
speeches degenerated into those vulgar tongues that are now used there, then
the language, not of the Service but of the people, was altered; so that upon
the fall of the Empire, learning began to decay, and the public Service no
longer to be understood, by reason of the change of the vulgar tongues.

Lastly, we are able to show, (as appears by the eighth Centurie of this
treatise) when, and by whom corruption of doctrine has been brought in; and
how opposition has been made from time to time in case of the adversaries
violent intrusion; for instance sake, for the space of six hundred years and
more, next after Christ, the Catholic doctrine of the Church of Rome was
this, that Images were not to be adored; and this is witnessed by Gregory the
Great, who allowed G^^gor. lib. 7. epist. 109. ad Seren.
no use of Images but only Historical; for so he says, They are not set up to
be worshipped, but only to instruct the people that be ignorant: yea he
speaks positively, Imagines ador^re ^mnibus modis de v^ta (...) lib. 9. ^p. 9.
that The worshipping of Images is by all means to be avoided. Now this
doctrine maintained by Gregory the first, was changed by Gregory the second
and third, Adrian the first and second; so that here we have taken them (...)
with the manner, to wit, with doctrine novel, and differing from their
Ancestors, and therefore need no farther examination. But that the Reader may
trace them along; we find that this Innovation was resisted by three hundred
thirty eight Bishops at Constantinople, in the year 754, and though
afterward it got strength at Nice, was defended by Rome, and at last got to
be a part of the Roman Faith; yet was the same disliked, denied, opposed, and
resisted by all the good men that lived in that and aftertimes, as Charles the
Great, the council of Franckford, Lewis his son, the Synod of Paris,
Alcuinus, and the Church of England.

Will you charge our Religion with novelty? can that be called new which is of
so long continuance?

PRO.
Diverse points of your Religion are confessed novelties; your own men yield,
that for Above a thousand years after Christ, Bellar. de Romans pon^. lib. 4. c.
2.. Secunda opinio.
the Popes judgment was not esteemed infallible, nor his authority Bellar. de
Council. lib. 2 cap. 13.
above that of a General Council; the contrary being decreed in the late
Councels of Constance and Basil: that Not any one ancient Writer Gregor. de

reckons precisely seven Sacraments; the first Bellar. de S^cr^m. lib. 2. cap.

Author that mentions that number being Peter Lombard, and the first Council
that of Florence: that in former ages for thirteen hundred years, Cassand

The holy Cup was administered to the Laity: that Nic. de Lyra in 1. ad.

divine service was celebrated for many ages, in a known and vulgar language,
understood by the people: that Transubstantiation was neither named, Scotus
apud B^llarm. lib. 3. de Euchar. cap. 23.

Et Erasm. in 1 ad Cor. cap. 7. In Synoxi, Transubstantiationem, serod^^^^ivit

nor made an Article of faith before the Council of Lateran, which was above
twelve hundred years after Christ: besides, many more confessions of this kind
which might be produced.

Now that a thing may be novell, though of long duration may appear by this;
our Savior when he would declare Pharisaicall Traditions to be Novelties, did
not respect their long continuance in the corrupt estate of the Church, but
says, Math. 19.8. Ab initio non fuit sic, that they were not from the
beginning delivered by God, or practiced by the Church: so that if the duration
and antiquity of your opinions be but humane, that is, not Apostolical,
neither from Apostolical grounds, they may according to Tertullian, Constat
p^oinde ^mne^ doctrinam quae cum illis ^c^l^sijs Apostolicis, mat^icibus and
Originalibus fidei conspir^t, veritati d^pu^andam, id sinc dubio tenent^m, quod
Ecclesiae ab Apostolis, Apostoli a Christo, Christus a Deo sus^epit; reliquam
vero de me^dacio praejudicandam, quae sapiat contra v^ri^at^m Eccl^siarum and
Apos^olerum, and Christi, and Dei. Tertull. de praescrip. adv^rs. Haeret. cap.
21.
be esteemed new and novelties; for a point is new in Religion that did not
proceed from God and his blessed spirit, either intermin^s, or by deduction
from his word that is the Ancient of days, whatsoever pretenses of duration
and continuance may be supposed.

It remains then, that that is new in Religion which is not most ancient; so
that if you cannot derive your Religion further then from some of the Fathers,
the tradition whereupon it is builded, is then but humane, and so a new thing,
even Noveltie it self. And therefore Tertullian tells us, Id ve^ius qu^d
prius, id prius quod et ab ini^io, ab i^^tio quod ab Apostolis Tertul. lib. 4.
adv^^. M^^cion. cap. 5.
That is most true, which is most ancient, that most ancient which was from the
beginning, that from the beginning which was from the Apostles; as if there
were no truth in faith that was not from the beginning. If Christ was always
and before all, truth is a thing equally ancient, and from all eternity, says
the same Si s^mper Ch^^^us ^^ prior omni^us, aq^^ ve^^tas s^mpiterna and
antiqua ^^s. Tertul. de Virgin. V^land. cap. 1.
Father; and therefore whatsoever savor^th against the truth, this (says he
Q^od^uaque adversus veritat^m sapit, hoc erit haeresi^, etiam vetus ^onsuetu^o.
Ibid.
) is Heresy, though it be of long continuance; for there is no Veritati nem^
praescribere potest, non spatium temporum, non patro^inia persona^um. Ibid.
prescription of time, that will hold plea against the Ancient of days, and
his truth.

I know that Pamelius in his notes upon Tertullian would ward off these
testimonies by saying Vide^ur is^ud pertinere ad initium su^erroris: Nam and
number 6. meminit Paracleti a Domino missi, id est, Montani, ^ac. Pamelius in
notis in Tertul. de Virginib. Veland. ca 1.
, that Tertullian spoke thus, When he began to fall into the fancy of
Montanus; but be it so, yet he delivered some truths after he lapsed into
Montanisme: besides, Bellarmine for proof of Monastical vows, and veiling of
Nuns, Bellar. lib. 2. de Monachis. cap. 27.. Tertullianu^ libro de Velandis
Virgin.
alleges diverse places out of the same treatise of Tertullians, de
Virginibus velandis, of veiling of virgins; and then (belike) Tertullian was no
Montanist, when Bellarmine for his advantage alleged him.

PA.
Our Religion Prot. Apology, tract. 2. cap. 2. sect. 12.
says Mr. Brerely is that good seed, which Christ the good husbandman first
sowed in his field, Math. 13.24. yours is like the Tares, which the enemy
(afterward) came and sowed among the wheat.

PRO.
A great part of your Religion, specially that which is controverted betwixt
you and us, and namely your Trent additionals and Traditionals, was not sown
by the good husbandmen, Christ and his Apostles; but by the envious man, by the
craft of the man of sin, and his accomplices, the sins of Christian men so
requiring; for (as it is already observed) erroneous doctrine, it may be,
antiqua, ancient, but it cannot be, prima, that one truth and faith, Ephesians.
4.5. Which was once delivered to the Saints, as Saint (...) verse. 3.
S. Inde speaks: and therefore is Christ the Husbandman, first presented in
the Parable, as Seminans, sowing good seed in his field, before the Enemy is
produced Reseminans, resowing the same Acres with unprofitable grain.

Besides, Religion is one thing, and Reformation another, the one presupposes
the other; our reformation is of a later date, our Religion is the old
Religion, coevall with the Primitive and Apostolic, howsoever you tax us with
noveltie.

But the Disciple is not above his Master; the Jews could say to our Savior,
Mark. 1.27.
What new doctrine is this? and the Grecians to S. Paul, Acts 17.18.
May we not know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speak is? but we say
in our just defense, Nos non sumus Novatores, sed vos estis Veteratores. Ios
Scaliger. Respons. ad Nic. Sera^ij Min^^vale.
it is not we that aff^ct noveltie, but it is you that counterfeit the face of
Antiquity; as the Josh. 9.4.5.
Gibeonites dealt with Joshua, deceiving him by the show of old sacks, old
bottles, old shoes, old bread that was mouldie, as if they had come a far
off, whereas they dwelt but hard by: in like sort you put on a visour of
antiquity, but once search the ground thereof, and draw aside this mask, and
then your tenets appear to be but noveltie in comparison of primitive
antiquity: for as Tertullian says, Ita ex ipso ordine manifestatur, id esse
Domini^um and verum, quod sit prius traditum; id outem ext^aneum and falsum
quod po^^erius immissum. Tertul de p^ae^. advers. Haer. cap. 31.
That is true which is first, and that false which is later.

In a word, we are no Reformatam modo religion^m dictmus, non formatam de novo.
Renovatores modo sumus, non Novatores. L. Eliens. Episc. in Respons. ad Bellar.
Apolog. cap. 1 page 21.
Innovators, but Reformers; we do not profess any Religion new made, but a
religion reformed, and refined; so that we may say with the Christian Bapt.
Matuan. ad Leon. X. Eclog. 10.
Poet: Haec novitas, non est novitas, sed vera vetustas:
Relligio, et Pietas Patrum instaurata resurgit,
Quod tua corrupit levitas, et nota tuorum
Segnities; igitur si quis labentia tecta
Erigat, et sterilem qui mansuefecerit agrum,
Iudice te damnandus erit.
It is no novell thing we preach,
But such as ancient Fathers teach.
The truth which former Popes concealed,
Does now begin to be revealed;
Must he be blamed that repaires
The ruined Church, and weed's out tares?
And thus have our Reformers done,
And they for this must be undone.


It is true then that the good seed was first fowne by the Apostles, and
fructified in the Church generally for 60. years; afterward the Enemy
sup^r-seminavit zizania, he resowed the tares, which in part were weeded out by
Waldo, Wickliffe and Husse, but more universally and publicly by Luther,
Calvine, and others; so that we have not sown any tares upon the Churches
gleabe land, but only weeded out such as were sown by others in the dead of
the night, in the time of ignorance, not whilst the Husbandman himself slept,
For he which keeps Israel neither slumbereth nor sleeps, but cum dormirent
homines, whiles men slept, that is, the overseers of the Vineyard grew
careless, and negligent. And thus might tares be sown, though the time and
^eedsman were not known: for it is confessed by your Trent-^athers, Cum multa,
sive temporum vitio, sive hominum in^u^ia and improbitate irrepsisse videantur,
quae a tanti s^crisi^ij dignitate aliena sint. Council. Trid. Ses^. 22 in
Decreto de obtervandis and evitandis in ^^^^bratione Missae.
That many things, through the fault of times, or the negligence and
wickedness of men, have seemed to have crept in [to the Masse] which are
repugnant to the dignity of so great a sacrifice: and yet they cannot t^ll when
these abuses crept in, nor by whose default.

And thus by Gods assistance, I have finished the task which I undertook,
having named out of good Au^hors, a Catalogue of such professors as taught
(for substance) as the Church of England does, and withal cleared the
Catalogue of our professors from such exceptions as the adversary has made
against them; and in producing this evidence, I have (as he speaks in Job
8.8.) enquired of the former ages, and made search of their Fathers, and have
dealt as Ioseph's steward did when he made search for his masters Cup, He began
at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the Cup was found in Benjamin's
Sack, Genesis 44.12. we have begun with the former ages, passed along the middle,
and descended unto Benjamin's, even to the later ages, abutting on Martin
Luther's time, and have found even with these younger ages the Cup that we
sought for, to wit, A Protestants Church, visible and conspicuous.

And now having (I hope) satisfied your demand, Where was our Church before
Luther; I would require the like of you, namely, to show, if you can, out of
good Authors, I will not say, any Empire or Kingdom, but any City, Parish or
Hamlet, within five hundred years next after Christ, in which there was any
visible assembly of Christians to be named, maintaining and defending either
your Trent Creed in general, or these points of Popery in special; to wit,
1. That there is a treasury of Saints Merits, and super-abundant sati^factions
at the Popes disposing. 2. That the Laity are not commanded by Christ's
Institution, to receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper in both kinds. 3.
That the public Service of God in the Church, ought, or may be celebrated in
an unknown tongue. 4. That private Masses, wherein the Priest says, Edite and
bibite ex hoc omnes, eat and drink ye all of this; and yet eats and
drinks himself only, be according to Christ's Institution. 5. That popes
pardons are requisite, or us^full to release souls out of purgatory. 6. That
extreme unction is a Sacrament properly so called. 7. That we may worship God
by an Image. 8. That the pope cannot err in matters of Faith.


Show us now, if you can, or any Papist in the world, that these points above
named, which are maine points with you, inasmuch as you account the denyers
thereof Heretics; show us, I say, that they were generally and constantly held
for Catholic Church tenets in the first five hundred years next after Christ,
which is the very flower of primitive antiquity.

But of these matters, (since this present conference is enlarged beyond my
expectation) at our next meeting, if you please. Mean time and ever, the Lord
of his mercy direct us in his own ways, In the old way, which is the god
way, as the prophet calls it, Ierem. 6.16. and call home such as wilfully, or by
ig^orance, have gone astray, that at length they may be brought to that John
10.16.
One Shepherd, and that One Sheep fold of Christ Jesus: to whom, with his
Father and the blessed Spirit, be praise for evermore. Amen.
