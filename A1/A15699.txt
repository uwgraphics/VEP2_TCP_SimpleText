The Honest VVooer, His mind expressing in plain and few terms,
By which to his Mistress his love he confirms.

To the tune of, Lulling beyond her.


FAirest Mistress, cease your moan,
spoil not your eyes with weeping,
For certainly if one be gone,
you may have another sweeting:
I will not complement with oaths,
nor speak you fair to prove you,
But save your eyes to mend your cloths
for it is I that love you.
I will not boast of substance great,
wherewith I can endow you,
Nor what apparel nor what meat,
I Am able to allow you;
You know it is time that all things tries
let then my affection move you,
And weep no more but save your eyes,
for it is I that love you.
If I should say you have golden hairs,
I should both lie and flatter,
Why should I say thine eyes are stars,
when there is no such matter?
Every like is not the same
yet none I prize above you,
To sigh so sore you are much to blame,
for it is I that love you
With courtly words I cannot court,
like one whose tongue is filed,
By subtle speakers in that sort,
poor women are often beguiled:
I speak no more but what I mean,
then do as it does behove you,
And do not waste your tears in vain,
for it is I that love you.
You may, I know, have choice of men,
that many ways excel me,
But yet in love I pass all them,
my conscience this does tell me,
Then let no riches buy my prise,
nor flattering words remove you,
To sigh and sob you are very unwise,
for it is I that love you.
I am thy constant Pyramus,
be thou my constant Thysbe,
That such a match is made by us,
let this a sealing kiss be,
I never will revoke my vow,
nor deem any Less above you,
Then dearest leave your sorrow now,
for it is I that love you.
Now if you do my love deny,
and utterly refuse me,
I will not say for love I Will dye,
in that you shall excuse me:
Some say so, yet mean nothing less,
but pity I hope will move you,
Not to put me to that distress,
for it is I that love you.

AS the lost intant does rejoice,
when he has found his Mother,
So am I glad to hear the voice
of you my constant Lover:
Believe me Harry if you will,
since I so true do prove you,
Come when you will and welcome still
for it is I that love you.
I loved a false disloyal youth,
which caused my thus lamentingus,
For in his words there were no truth,
but subtle circumuenting;
You use plain dealing which is best,
so still it does behove you,
And therefore set your heart at rest,
for it is I that love you.
And now henceforth I will give ore,
to weep for him that ieeres me,
And his affection I Will abhor,
for no true love he bears me,
With you I will rejoice my dear,
let no false tales remove you,
Believe not every news you hear,
for it is I that love you.
