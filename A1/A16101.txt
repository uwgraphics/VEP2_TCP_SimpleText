Syrack. XXXII.
If God to rule, do thee elect
Pride not thy self therein
As one of thine, be in effect
Thy people so to win.
Let care for them, be thy repast
That wisdom be their choice
And when thy duty, done thou have
Sit down with them rejoice.
Of honor then, receive the crown
In wisdom to excel
For wisdom, wynneth great renown
which does become thee well.
Hinder not Musyke.

To the Uertuous and Godly learned Prince, Edward the.vi. by the grace of
God, King of England, France, and Irelande, Defendour of the Faith, and on
earth next and immediately under Christ, of the Churches of England and
Irelande the Supreme head, your graces humble, loving, and obedient servant
Christofer Tie, wysheth the continuance of God his fear to dwell in your
graces heart, long to raygne in much honor, health, wealth and victory.
COnsydrynge well, most godly King
The zeal and perfect love:
Your grace does bear, to each good thing
That given is from above.
And that your grace, often times does look
To learn of the last day:
The which ye find, with in gods book
That will not pass away.
Whose book is given, in these your days
Wherein ye do rejoice:
And eke praise him, in all his ways
And that with thankeful voice.
Which does make glad, your subjects all
And moves them to learn:
Gods lyuelye word, and how they shall
The truth thereby discearne.
Behold O King, of God elect
And ye shall right well se:
That as your highness, is affect
So will your Subjects be.
Your grace may note, from time to time
That some does under take:
Upon the Psalms, to write in ryme
The verse pleasant to make.
And some does take, in hand to write
Out of the book of Kings:
Because they se, your grace delight
Insuche like Godly things.
And last of all, I your poor man
Whose doings are full base:
Yet glad to do, the best I can
To give unto your grace
Have thought it good, now to recyte
The stories of the Acts:
Even of the twelve, as Luke does write
Of all their worthy factes.
Unto the text, I do not ad
Nor nothing take away
And though my style, be gross and bad
The truth perceive you may.
Your Majesty, is not to teach
Thapostles words are plain:
With ynkhorne terms, they did not preach
But sought an easy vain.
Plainly to speak, their masters will
The people to enstruct:
That they their calling, might fulfill
In truth them to conduct.
Prayinge your grace, not to think now
That I do condescende:
The pleasant style, to disalow
But do it much commend.
But he that shall, of scripture treat
If he will please God well:
Of force he must, such terms forgeat
The truth plainly to tell.
My Ignorance, thus to excuse
I have my mind expressed:
I trust your grace, will not refuse
To make of it the best.
And if your grace, shall in good part
My simple work so take:
My wits to this, I will conuart
All vain things to forsake.
My calling is, another way
Your grace shall here in find:
By notes set forth, to sing or play
To recreate the mind.
And though they be, not curious
But for the letter mete:
Ye shall them find, harmonious
And eke pleasant and sweet.
That such good things, your grace might move
Your lute when ye assaye:
Instead of songs, of wanton love
These stories then to play.
So shall your grace, please God yt Lord
In walking in his way:
His laws and statutes, to record
In your heart night and day.
And eke your realm, shall floryshe still
No good thing shall decay:
Your subjects shall, with right good will
These words record and say.
Thy life O King, to us does shine
As Gods book does thee teach:
Thou do us feed, with such doctrine
As Christ's elect did preach.
The living God, grant thee to raygne
In great honor and wealth:
Thy virtuous life, good Lord maintain
And send thee prosperous health.
Thy dear Systers, the sprite them lead
To love the word of God:
Which shall them stand, in better stead
Then does their whole liuelod.
Thy whole counsel, the Lord preserve
And grant to man and wife:
To crave of him, not ones to swerve
From his sweet word of life. Amen.
CHRIST did ascend, up in to heaven
As ye shall after read:
Mathias was, of the eleven
Elect in Judas stead.

IN the former, treatise to thee
Dear friend Theophilus:
I have written, the verite
Of the Lord Christ Jesus.
Which he to do, and eke to teach
Began until the day:
In which the sprite, up did him feache
To dwell above for aye.
After that he, had power to do
Even by the holy ghost:
Commandments, then he gave unto
His chosen least and most.
To whom also, him self did show
From death thus to reuyue:
By tokens plain, unto his few
Even fortye days alive.
Speaking of Gods, kingdom with heart
Chusynge together them:
Commaundynge them, not to depart
From that Jerusalem.
But still to wait, on the promys
Of his father the Lord:
Of which ye have, heard me or this
Unto you make record.
For John with water, did baptyse
But ye shall baptist be:
Even with the sprite, that is ryghtwyse
Within few days trust me.
When they were then, all him before
They moved him to tell:
If at that time, he would restore
The kingdom to Israel.
He said to them, I do record
The knowledge is not youer:
To know the times, that God the Lord
Has kept in his own power.
The holy ghost, receive shall ye
Which shall teach you to do:
And ye shall all, my wytnes be
Jerusalem unto.
In all Jury, and Samarye
To wytnes I you send:
And preach my word, that shall tarry
Even unto the worlds end.
When he had said, these words aloude
While they beheld the light:
He was up take, into a cloud
Straight way out of their sight.
And while they lokt, up sted fastly
To heaven as he up went:
Behold two men, stood there them by
And white was their garment.
Which said ye men, of Galile
Why gase ye up in vain:
This Jesus thus, up take from ye
Shall thus come down again.
Then did return, each one of them
From Oliuet the mount:
A journey from, Jerusalem
One Sabbath day I count.
When they came to, Jerusalem
A parlare there was dyght
Where did abide, each one of them
That I will now recyght.
Peter and James, John and Andrew
Philip and eke Thomas:
Bartylmewe James, Simon Matthew
Judas that James son:
These all abode, with one accord
In supplication still:
And did desire, of God the Lord
His promise to fulfill.
And women that, were ^ertens
With them to heaven ^yd call:
Besides the mother, of Jesus
And eke his brethren all.
In those days Peter, stood up stout
Emyds them all truly:
To vewe the names, which was about
An hundredth and twentye.
And said ye brethren, the scripture
Must needs fulfilled be:
Which David by, the spirit so pure
Of Judas did foresee.
Which did gide them, that took Jesus
To his confusion sure:
Who numbered was, for one of us
In ministration pure:
And now he has, possessed the ground
Of great iniquity:
Despair has driven, him to confound
His life upon a tree.
He brast in two, the mydst about
His body was so swowne:
His bowels all, they gushed out
As it is right well known.
The dwellers at, Jerusalem
Does call the field this day:
Acheldama, the which with them
The blood field is to say.
The book of psalms, does thus declare
Be void his dwelling place:
Another shall, even for his share
His byshoprycke enbrace:
Wherefore of these, the which with us
Has been in company:
At all such times, as Christ Jesus
Went in and out us by.
Even from the first, baptism of John
Till Christ went up certain:
To witness we, must ordain one
Of Christ's rysynge again.
And they right soon, appointed two
Joseph hight Barsabas:
Whose surname was, Iustus also
The other Mathias.
They prayed and said, thou Lord can taste
All hearts and them discus:
Which of these two, show that thou have
Given fellowship with us.
That one may exercise, the place
Of ministration well:
Thapostle ship, from which Judas
By his transgression fell.
And they gave forth, their lots with speed
Which wrought by power from heaven:
Mathias was, elect in deed
And went with the eleven.
THE coming of, the holy ghost
Peter did preach in deed:
Even at Jerusalem, where most
The faithful did increase.

Cloven tounges did, to them appear
Like as they had been fire:
And sat upon them, every where
To fulfill their desire.
The holy ghost, did them advance
To tounges right wise and sage:
Even as the sprit, gave vtteraunce
So changed their language.
And there dwelt at, Jerusalem
Jews that feared the Lord:
Of every country, some of them
That came to bear record.
Now wha^ this voice, came thus to pas
The multitude did more:
They came together, where it was
And were amassed sore.
For every one, heard his own tongue
That he had used long:
They wondered all, both old and young
And said them selves among:
Behold are not, these men new sprung
Even out of Galile:
How hear we then, each one his tongue
Wherein right borne were we.
Parthians, Medes, and Elamits
Mesopotamians:
And men of Iurye, Luke recytes
With Capadocians.
The Pontans, and the Asyans
Phrigi, and Pamphilie
Of Egypt, and the Lybyans
Dwellinge Sirene nere bye.
Strangers of Rome, Iues Proselits
Tharabians said thus:
They spoke our tounges, which truly hyts
Of God the works wondrus.
They were amassed, and sore afraid
Wo^dringe at this strange syne:
And other mocked, them and said
They are full of new wine.
Peter stood up, the truth to tell
Straynynge his voice to them:
Of Jury and, to those that dwell
Even at Jerusalem.
Be this well known, unto you all
And with your ears hear say:
These are not droncke, as ye them call
This third hour of the day.
But this is it, that spoken was
Of the prophet Ioell:
In the last days, shall come to pas
Says God as I shall tell.
I will power out, says God the Lord
My spyryte upon all flesh:
Your sons and, daughters shall record
Young men shall see things fresh.
Your old men shall, dreme dremes always
On my servants will I:
Power out my sprite, even in those days
And they shall prophecy.
Wonders in heaven, I will provoke
And on the earth great change:
Blood, fire and the, vapoure of smoke
Which shall appear right strange.
The Sun shall turn, into darkness
The Moon eke into blood:
Before the day, of great Iustes
The Lord shall think it good.
And it shall be, even in those days
Who so will mercy crave:
And call upon, the Lord always
Doutles he will him save.
Ye Israelites, be ye not deffe
But hear this if ye can:
The Lord Jesus, of Nazarethe
Of God approved man.
Among you was, miraculus
Great wonders he did show:
God wrought by him, things wonderus
Emidst of you ye know.
Him have ye taken, by the hands
To scourge him with a rod:
After he was, given you in bands
By the foresyght of God.
Ye have him crucifed, and slain
But God again him raised:
And losed him, from death and pain
In him still to be praised.
Because it was, impossible
To withstand his great might:
For David which was, credible
Did prophecy aryght.
I saw God always, before me
He is on my right hand:
That I should never, moved be
My heart did understand.
Great joys my heart, did feel in deed
My tongue was glad also:
My fleash did live, without all dread
In hope void of all woe.
Because my soul, to make his moan
In hell shall not left be:
Ne yet suffer, the holy one
Corruption for to see.
Thou have of life, showed me the light
With joy my heart possessed:
Even with, thy countenance so bright
My soul is brought to rest.
Ye men and brethren, my words mark
Let me speech freely have:
Even of David, the Patriarch
For he lies dead in grave.
And his sepulcher, does remain
With us unto this day:
No dout he was, a prophet plain
And knew what God did say.
Not only say, but also swear
And in his oath repeat:
The fruits of his, loins shall prospere
And sit upon his seat.
In that Christ in, the fleash should rise
He right well saw before:
And said he should, rise up right wise
And live for evermore.
His soul should not, be left in hell
His fleash corrupt naught shall:
God has him raised, up right well
Whereof we wytnes all.
Syns now that he, by the right hand
Of God exalted is:
And by the Lord, does understand
The holy ghostes promis.
Now of his words, ye know the end
As ye may hear and see:
David to heaven did not ascend:
But truly thus said he.
The Lord unto, my Lord did say
Sit thou on my right hand:
Untyll I make, thy foes to stay
Thy foot on them to stand.
All Israel, know this certain
And therein to persist:
The same Jesus, whom ye have slain
God has made Lord and Christ.
When they heard this, their hearts did fall
And said Peter unto:
And eke to the, Apostles all
Brethren what shall we do.
And Peter said, to them repent
And then Baptism begin:
In Christ his name, by whom God sent
Remission of sin.
Ye shall receive, the holy ghost
The promise so did fall:
To you and yours, in every coost
Such as the Lord shall call.
He bare witness, of great comfort
Exhorting them each one:
To save them from, thou toward sort
And generation.
They that his preachinge, did embrace
Were baptist even through out:
There came to them, that day by grace
Three thousand souls about.
They did follow, thapostles lore
Doctrine and company:
Breaking their bread, and evermore
In prayer certaynelye.
And eke of every soul the fere
Of God on them did fall:
Wonders and signs, were showed each where
By the apostles all.
And such as did, believe Gods will
Together kept in bands:
To have all things, in comen still
They sold their goods and lands.
Departing them, even in the Lord
As every man had need:
Being daily, with one accord
In the temple in deed.
In every house, the bread to part
Their meat to eat aryght:
With joy, and singlenes of heart
Praysynge the God of might.
They had favor, with every one
The Lord added right fre:
Unto the congregation
Such as should saved he.
The contents.
THE halte restored, is certain
Even to his perfect strength:
And Peter preched, Christ right plain
As ye shall read at length.

Even at the Temple door.
Which is called, the Beutifull
That he might alms crave:
Of them that went, to the temple
Some help of them to have.
And when he saw, Peter and John
Right nere the temple drew:
Their alms he, did axe anon
And they both did him view.
And said to him, look thou on us
And he was well a paid:
Hopinge of them, to have alms
But Peter to him said.
Silver and gold, now have I none
But such as God gave me:
By virtue of, the holy one
The same give I to thee.
Now in the name, of Christ Jesus
Of Nazareth arise:
In company, to walk with us
And praise the Lord most wise.
He took him then, by the right hand
And lift him up at length:
Upon his feet, he straight did stand
His bones received strength.
And he did spring, stand, walk and start
In at the temple door:
Lepynge, praysynge, even with his heart
The living Lord therefore.
The people all, did him well see
Praise God for his good state:
And they knew well, that it was he
Which begged at the gate.
They were filled, with great wondryng
And were amassed sore:
Even at this man's, sudden healynge
That was so lame before.
This healed halt, held fast also
Even of Peter and John:
The people ran, to them in to
The Porche of Solomon.
When Peter saw, them wonder so
These words to them he spoke:
Ye Israelittes, I say of who
This wondering do ye make.
Or why look ye, with stedfastnes
On us as we could do:
By our own power, or holiness
This cure this man unto,
The God of Abraham and Isacke
And Jacob this has done:
God of our fathers, without lack
Has glorifed his son.
Jesus whom once, refused ye
In Pilates presents plain:
When he had judged, him to be
Losed from death and pain.
But ye denied, the holy one
A murderer to save:
And eke killed, the Lord alone
His life ye would not have.
Which God has raised, from the deed
Whereof we wytnes can:
Through faith in his, name confirmed
His name upon this man.
Whom ye did see, and know also
When faith in him did rise:
Which faith has given, this man unto
His health before your eyes.
Now dear brethren, I know that ye
Have done this wicked deed:
Through ignorance, as seems me
Which did your rulers lead.
But God before hand, he did utter
And eke his prophets wylled:
To teach that Christ, the death shoul suffer
Which he has now fulfilled.
Repent ye now, I say repent
And turn to us this day:
That all your sins, now evident
May clean be done away.
For when the time, of refreshynge
Shall come to us with speed:
In presents of, the Lord and King
Above all Kings in deed.
And when God shall, him send the day
Before preached to us:
Unto you all, which is to say
The Lord and Christ Jesus.
Which must have heaven, until al thing
Which he has spoken plain:
By Prophets syns, the first beginning
Restored be again.
For Moses to, the fathers said
The Lord raise up will he:
A Prophet, unto you for aid
Much like even unto me.
Him shall ye hear, and not control
But in his words rejoice:
The time will come, that every soul
Which will not hear his voice
Shall Be destroyed, without all dout
Which time will not be long:
That all such shall, be clean throune out
The people from among.
The Prophets all, syns Samuel
And thence forth has always:
Told of the truth, right passing well
And eke spoke of these days.
The Prophets children, all are you
That by the covenant came:
To our fathers, which God did vou
And said to Abraham.
In thy sede shall, the kynredes all
On earth be blessed in us:
First unto you, God did up call
His only son Jesus.
And him he has, sent unto you
Each one of you to bless:
That every one, of you should now
Turn from his wickedness.
THE Apostles, were in prison cast
They were to preach forbod:
But they took them, to prayer fast
Renouncing men for God.

And they laid hands, on the^ straight way
And put them all aside:
In prison fast, till the next day
For it was then euentyde.
But those that heard, the word even then
Believed out of hand:
The number then, of those won men
Was well nigh five thousand.
And it chanced, the next day was
Each ruler and Elder:
The Scribes Annas, and eke Cayphas
John and Allexander.
And eke all those, that were with them
There of the hye Priests kyn:
Then gathered at, Jerusalem
Where they were then brought in.
And when they stood, before the same
They axed them saying:
Show by whose power, or in whose name
That you have done this thing.
Peter full of, the holy ghost
Said unto them right well:
Ye rulers all, both lest and most
And chief of Israel.
If we this day, must testify
Of the good deed and dole:
Dealt to the sick, man and eke by
What means he is made whole.
Be it well known, to them that list
And ye that rulers be:
That in the name, of Jesus Christ
Of Nazareth work we.
Whom ye have, crucified and slain
God has from death now raised:
By whom this man, is whole certain
The Lord therefore be praised.
This is the chief stone cast a side
Of you that buylders be:
Which in the chief place shall abide
Of the corners say we.
For neither is there, salvation
In any sauinge he:
Nor other name, there is not one
Wherein made safe we be.
When they beheld, the boldness then
Of Peter and of John:
And knew them both, unlearned men
And lay people each one.
They did much muse, and knew justly
That they were with Jesus:
And did behold, the man stand by
The which was healed new.
Commaundynge them, to stand aside
And from their counsel goo:
Consultinge there, and said provide
With these men what to do.
A wondrus sign, is done by them
And eke is justly known:
To all them in, Jerusalem
The thing abroad is blown.
But that they shall, hence forth therefore
No further noise the same:
Let us charge them, to speak no more
To no man in his name.
They gave to them, commau^dment new
That they should no man aid:
To preach or teach, of their Jesus
But Peter and John said.
If it be right, as ye think it
In sight of God the Lord:
Your words to keep, Gods to omit
Judge ye and so record.
For we will speak, the truth even so
Whereof we know the ground:
They thretened them, and let them go
No faut in them was found.
The people also, praised God
The lame away went round:
Who was of age, full forty and od
Which was made whole and sound
As soon as they, were then let go
They to their fellows went:
Expressing their, great pain and woe
And eke imprisonment.
By the hye Priests, and Elders all
And what to them they said:
When they heard that, they loud did call
And gave God thanks for aid.
And said thou Lord: thou God of blys
Madst heaven and earth for us:
The sea and all, that there in is
By whom David said thus.
Why did the heathen, fume and fret
What rage in them now sprynges
Why did the Iuishe, people set
Their minds upon vain things.
The Kings and Rulers, did persist
In wicked council long:
Against the Lord, and his son Christ
Which he sent us among.
For of a truth, against the Lord
Whom thou anointed have:
Herod, Pilate, with one accord
Held with the Gentyls fast.
The people eke, of Israel
Increased more and more:
To do what thy, hands and council
Determined before.
Now Lord behold, their threatnynge sword
And grant to thy elect:

Good Lord do us protect.
So that thine hand, stretche forth yt same
Healyng and signs to us:
That we do wonders in the name
Of thy dear son Jesus.
As soon as they, had prayed anon
The place began to shake:
They were full of, the holy one
The word boldly they spoke.
The multitude, that did believe
Were of one sprit and heart:
Each one to other still did give
In commen they did part.
And with great power, they did witness
The resurreccion all:
Of Jesus Christ, yea and doutles
Great grace on them did fall.
Not one among, them all did lack
For who had house and land:
Sold all and did, keep nothing back
To have in his own hand.
They laid all down, at the fete than
Of thappostles in deed:
Distributynge to every man
According to his need.
Ioses who was, of an old won
Of thappostles each one:
Called Barnabas, which is the son
Of Consolacion.
A Leuite borne, would not do ill
Had land and eke sold it:
And laid the price, down with good will
At the Apostles feet.

A Certain man, who was named
Ananias truly:
With Saphira his wife framed
Unto the Lord a lie.
Who selling then, a piece of land
Kept back part of the price:
The which his wife, did understand
They wrought with one aduyce.
The other part, then laid down was
At the Apostles fit:
And Peter said, Ananias
By what means chances it.
That Satan has, filled thine heart
To cause thee thus to lie:
Unto the holy, ghost and part
Of thy lyuelode deny.
Pertayned it not, to thee that hour
And after it was sold:
Was not the part, in thine own power
That thou do now witholde.
How chau^ceth it, that thou should then
Thus bring thy self to woe:
Thou have not lied, only to men
But unto God also.
And when he was, truly thus tried
His doyinges was abhorde:
He straight gave up, the ghost and dyed
For trifling with the Lord.
Great fear then came, upon each head
That this did hear and see:
The young men rose, up and him leed
Where he should buryd be.
And it chanced, within the space
Of three hours this was done:
His wife not knowing came in place
Appearing there right soon.
And Peter said, to her tell me
Sold ye the land for this:
And she right soon, to him said ye
I have said as it is:
Then Peter said, I will record
That ye did both consent.
To tempt the sprit, of God the Lord
As it is euydent.
Behold the fete, of them that have
Buryd thy make this day:
Be redye to, put thee in grave
Then she fell dead straight way.
The young men then, came in and found
Her dead lyinge at hand:
They bare her forth, and in the ground
Laid her by her husband.
And therewith came, on them great fear
That saw this done of right:
Even on all those, that then were there
To see that fearful sight.
By the Apostles hands was wrought
Right strange and wondrus things
Among the people, which then sought
To hear their good tidings.
With one accord, they all were gone
To praise their Lord and King:
With in the porche, of Solomon
And that with thanks geuynge.
Of the other sort, there was not one
Durst join him self them to:
And yet of them, some long had gone
To learn the best to do.
The number of, those men that did
Believe the Lord his lore:
Men and women, God be praised
Increased more and more.
That in so much, they brought bedsteades
For sick in to the streets:
And some were laid, in standing beds
And eke some in palletes.
That at the least, Peter might come
Nigh to them that lay there:
When he came by, to shadow some
Of them that sore sick were.
There came also, a multitude
From cities round about:
To Jerusalem, to seclude
Sycknes from them through out.
And such as were, vexed even there
With unclean sprites each one:
Were brought to them, then every where
And were made whole anon.
The chief priest then, rose up certes
And all that with him were:
Which is the sect, of Saduces
Who then did stamp and steare.
Of thappostles, not one went quight
In prison they were set:
The angel of, the Lord by night
Them out of prison let.
And brought them forth, and eke said than
Go step forth and speak ryfe:
With in the Temple, to every man
The words now of this life.
When they heard yt, they with good will
Into the temple went:
Soon in the morn, for to fulfill
The Lords commandment.
The chief priest came, and they that were
With him in that forenone:
And called council, to them there
To know what might be done.
Then of the children, of Israel
The elders were also:
Of them that sat, there in council
And bade some for them goo.
When they then went, to them that had
The prison then in cure:
They did return, as men nigh mad
Shut was the prison sure.
The kepers standing at the door
To wayt upon their charge:
And yet of them, they had no pore
God had set them at large.
When the chief priest, and he that is
Even of the temple chief:
And eke the hye pristes, heard of this
They mused with much grefe.
Then came one forth, and said behold
Those that in prison were:
Stand in the church, and are full bold
To teach the people there.
The ruler went, with dilygence
And ministers of trust:
Which brought them with, out violence
For they feared the worst.
Lest that the people, should them stone
And so their purpose fail.
They brought them secretly alone
Before the whole counsel.
The chief priest said, to them at large
Be ye not worthy blame:
Sith that we did, you strayghtly charge
Not to teach in this name.
Behold he said, then unto them
The Lord of your Jesus:
Has filled all, Jerusalem
To bring his blood on us.
Peter and John, they could not stay
But boldly said even then:
We ought of right, God to obaye
Before you that are men.
The God of our, fathers raised
Jesus our help to be:
Whom ye have slain, and eke hanged
Uniustly on a tree.
God raised him, with his right hand
To save such as repent:
That Israel, might understand
His mercy to them sent.
And we be records of this cost
Concerning our comfort:
And eke also, the holy ghost
Given to the loyal sort.
They hearing that, their wrath did swel
And sought means them to sley:
Then stood up one, of their council
An ancient pharisey.
Who was named, Gamaliell
A doctor of the law:
Among them all, he did excel
Of whom they stood in awe.
He* did command, to put aside
Thapostles then straight way:
That none of them, should there abide
To hear what he would say.
Ye men of Israel, take heed
Beware what ye entende:
Against these men, or ye proceed
Mark what will be the end.
Before these days, one Theudas
Arose with brag and boste:
Four hundred men, then slain there was
There gathered in his host.
And all the rest, that there abode
That unto him had sought:
Were scatred here, and there abroad
And straight way brought to naught.
And after that, arose a man
Judas of Galile:
When tribute first, with them began
Men thinking to be fre.
So that much people to him drew
Which was to their decay:
For death to him, did then enseu
He slain they fled away.
And now I say, refrain you then
And let these men alone:
For if their counsel, be of men
It will decay anon.
But if it be, of God certain
Ye can it not deface:
But shall be found, to strive in vain
And fight against Gods grace.
And then to him, they did agree
And called the apostles all:
They beat them all, none did escape free
Such chance to them did fall.
And gave to them, commandment new
When they had beat them so:
To speak no more, of their Jesus
And then they let them go.
From that council, they did depart
Reioysynge in the same:
That they might bide, such pain and smart
Only for Christ his name.
And in the temple, the did teach
The truth plain to discus:
In every house, still they preach
The Lord, and Christ Jesus,
DEACONS appointed, to the board
To minister at their need:
And the Apostles, to the word
Steven was accused in deed.

Wherefore brethren, among you seek
Seven men of honest fame:
Full of the sprit, and wisdom eke
To take in hand the same.
But we our selves, will still apply
Not carynge for the board:
To pray and preach, continuallye
And minister the word.
Unto these words, of good effect
Agred both lest and most:
And faithful Steven, was then elect
Full of the holy Ghost.
Philip Prochor, and Permenas
With Nican did approach:
So did Simon, and Nicolas
Convert of Antioche.
Before thappostles in their state
Not wayed by goods or lands:
But after prayer, were approbate
By laying on of hands.
The word of God, increased wyed
The number then was such:
That the dysciples multiplied
With in Jerusalem much.
Their foremer life, they did repent
And so did many, a prist:
Which then became, obedient
Unto the faith of Christ.
And Steven then full, of faith and power
Great wonders showed he:
So that the people every hour
Strange miracles might se.
Out of the synagoge did lepe
Some sects of hypocrites:
The lybertins, one sect we clepe
Another Syrenyttes.
Likewise of Alexandria
And men both more and even:
Of Cilice and of Asia
Disputed still with Steven.
The sprite they could, not overcome
So God did him advance:
With great knowledge, and high wisdom
Such was then his vttraunce.
They sent in men, his words to try
Which came and said doutles:
We heard him speak, blasphemuslye
Against God and Moses.
And they did move, the people there
The Scribes and elder sort:
With force to bring, him in danger
By means of false report.
Before the council, they him brought
And matters did deuyse:
As false witness, had then out sought
Which was nothing but lyse.
And said this man, will not refrain
Blasphemus words to sound:
This holy place, he does disdain
Our law thus confound.
Thus he in effects, with poison breathe
Our faith for to deface:
And says Jesus, of Nazarethe
Shall soon destroy this place:
And so shall change, the ordinance
That Moses gave to us:
Which is to us, no small greuance
By means of this Jesus.
The council then, in that their rage
Did vewe him in their sight:
And did behold, his fair visage
Most like an Angel bright.

Out of the land, then of Caldey
Returned he with speed:
The Lords commandment to obey
Dwelt in Carran in deed.
Soon after ye, shall understand
As his father was dead:
He brought him then, into the land
Where now your life ye lead.
He gave him none, inheritance
Not one foot breadth by name:
But promised, he would advance
Him to possess the same.
Beside all this, yet nevertheless
A promise he made fre:
Unto his seed, that to possess
When yet no child had he.
God without dout, spoke on this wise
His seed should dwell and sleep:
With strangers, that should them despise
And them in bondage keep.
And so to scourge, them cruellye
Four hundred years with rod:
But yet those people, soon will I
Judge says the living God.
And after that, I will them plant
To serve me every where:
And then he gave, him the covenant
Of circumcision there.
And he begat, I sake right soon
And did him circumcise:
At the eight day, it was so done
And I sake in likewise.
Begat Jacob, all this is sure
And right well known of clerks:
How that Jacob, by the scripture
Begat twelve Patriarchs.
The Patriarks, then in their rage
Joseph to Egypt sold:
From all distres, in that viage
God did him then with hold.
And gave him grace, and great wisdom
In Pharos sight the Ring:
Who did appoint, him in great rome
To rule in every thing.
Then came a derth, in all the land
Egypt and Canaan:
Thereof the grief, could not withstand
Lacking the food of man.
Our fathers in, their scarsyte
Having no sustinaunce:
In Egypt heard, that corn should be
Jacob made puruiaunce.
And first sent out, even his sons own
The second time also:
To his brethren, Joseph was known
And they eke to Pharo.
Then Joseph would, his father dear
As he had well foresene:
And all his kyn, to be brought nere
Three score souls and fyftene.
Joseph to Egypt descended
And our fathers even them:
Which died and were, all translated
Each one into Sichem.
And were put in, the sepulcor
That Abraham bought fre:
For coin of the, sons of Emor
In Sichem laid to be.
And when the time, of promise drew
Nigh which that God had sworn:
To Abraham, the people grew
In Egypt that were borne.
Untyll another King arose
Which not of Iosephe knew
Full craftily, the same did gloss
Our kynred to subdue.
And did entreat, our fathers ill
And made them cast out plain:
Their children young, their lives to spyll
That none should there remain:
And in that time, borne was Moses
A fair child in Gods sight:
Which in his fathers, house doutles
Three months was fed a right.
And then cast on, the water deep
The daughter of Pharo:
Did take him up, and did him keep
For her own son also.
He was well seen, in the wisdom
Of the Egyptians gyse:
Right strong in deeds, he did become
And in his words right wise.
When he of age, was fourtye year
Then in his heart did dwell:
A love to seek, his brethren dear
Children of Israel.
And when he saw, one suffer wrong
Even of his brethren dear:
Him to defend, he bode not long
As ye shall after here.
He did Thegipcian overthrow
That did his brother smyght:
Thinkyng his brethren, well to know
And understand a right.
That God the Lord, even by his hand
Their saftye should prepare:
Which none of them, did understand
The storye does declare.
The next day then, he did asspire
To stay them in their strife:
To make them friends, was his desire
In love to lead their life.
And said to them, with words right wise
Sith each is others brother:
The fonder is, the enterprise
For one to hurt another.
But he that did, his neighbor wrong
Thrust him away saying:
Who made thee ruler, us among
To rule in every thing.
I well perceive, thou wylt me kill
As thou dydst yester day:
The Egypcian, his blood to spyll
And so make me away.
At those words Moses, fled anon
As he thought best to do:
Into the land, of Madion
Where begat sons two.
When forty years were past away
An Angel did record:
In wyldernes, of mount Sinaye
To him from God the Lord.
With in a flame, of burning fire
Which lyghted in a bushe:
And caused Moses, to draw nere
To see that fyrye flushe.
And as he drue, nigh to behold
The voice of God down came:
Which said to him, with words full bold
Thy fathers God I am.
I am the God, of Abraham
The Lord unto him said:
Isacke and Jacobs, God I am
Which Moses sore desmayd
He trembled and, durst not draw nere
Such fear on him did fall:
Then said the Lord, now Moses here
And mark what say I shall.
Put of thy shoese, even out of hand
Let it be done with speed:
The ground whereon, thy fete do stand
Is holy ground in deed.
Right perfectlye, I do now see
The heaviness appear:
Of my flock that, in Egypt be
And eke their gronynge chere.
And I am come, them to defend
And save for ever more:
Wherefore behold, I do thee send
Into Egypt therefore.
This is Moses, to whom they said
Who made the here a ruler:
The same God sent, to them for aid
To rule and eke deliver.
Even by the hands, of the Angel
Which in the bushe did light:
The same brought them, out passing well
And showed strange things in sight.
In Egypt wonders, did appear
And in the red see flete:
In wilderness, men saw things clear
Full fortye years complete.
This is Moses, the which did tell
And also make report:
To the children, of Israel
These words of much comfort.
A Prophet shall, the Lord for ye
Raise up right good and just
Even of your brethren, like to me
Him shall ye hear and trust.
And in the congregation
This Moses was doutles:
And heard the voice, of God alone
Even in the wyldernes.
Which then did talk, assuredlye
With thangel of the Lord:
Upon mount Sinay, certaynlye
Our fathers does record:
The word of life, received he
To give to us was sent:
Our fathers would, in no wise be
To him obedient.
But thrust him from, them with despyght
Their hearts turned echeone:
Into Egypt, to go with might
And said unto Aron.
Make gods for us, both more and les
For we can not discus:
What is become, of this Moses
That from Egypt brought us.
To make a Calfe, this was their choice
And offered sacrifyce:
Unto the same, and did rejoice
In that their own deuyce.
Then turned God, from them truly
And gave them up with thretes:
To worship stars, with in the sky
Foresaid of the prophets.
O ye the house, of Israel
Gave me your Sacrifyces:
Meat offeryngs fortye years to tell
With in the wilderness.
Soon did ye take, and not defarre
The tabernacle than:
Of Moloch ye, and eke the star
Of your great God Remphan.
Fygures to whom, often ye did vow
And worship them each one:
Wherefore I will, translate all you
Beyond great Babylon.
The tabernacle, our fathers had
Within the wilderness:
As he appointed and them bad
Speaking unto Moses.
That he should make, it according
As he before did see:
The which our fathers receyuynge
Brought in with Iosue.
Into the land, of the gentyls
Which God drove out and chyd:
Before our fathers as exyls.
Till the time of David.
Which favor found, with God ye Lord
Desiring then that he:
Might synde an house, of mete accord
For Jacobs God to be.
An house for him, buylt Solomon
But yet the highest I ken:
Dwelthe not in temples, made of stone
Wrought by the hands of men.
As he declares, by his wrst
The Prophet saying this:
Heaven is my seat, where on I sit
The earth my footstool is.
What house then will, ye me behest
Says God tell you I shall:
Which is the place, then of my rest
Has not my hand made all.
Ye styffe neckte all, both least and most
With hearts and ears ye seek:
Still to resist, the holy Ghost
As did your fathers eke.
The prophets all, your fathers lore
Needs persecute them must:
And eke slew them, which taught before
The coming of the just.
Whose murderers, and traitors now
Ye are and to them knit:
The Angels gave, the law to you*
And ye have not kept it.
When they heard this, great was their grefe
Their hearts did cleave in two:
Gnashynge on him, even with their tethe
And knew not what to do:
He was full of, the holy ghost
His eyes to heaven did stand:
Which saw the glory, of the Lord
And Christ on his right hand.
And said behold, the heavens I se
Appear for my lyuelod:
And eke the son, of man to be
At the right hand of God.
Then they cryde out, with rorynge voice
And stopped their ears and brethe:
Thus in their rage, they took their choice
And stoned him to death
The witnesses, their clothes down laid
Then at a man's fete even:
Whose name was Saul, which then assayde
With them to stone good Steven.
Which cryde and said, Lord Christ Jesus
Receive my sprite this day:
He kneled down, all this is true
And on this wise did say.
Lay not this sin, Lord to their charge
Thus he did call and clepe:
Of that their sin, them to discharge
And so he fell a sleep.

Of whom stones brake each lym:
Besides their oyntmentes, to him given
They did weep over him.
But of the congregation than
Saul spared no man's life:
But sought the house, of every man
And drew out man and wife.
In prison fast, he did them place
But those that went about:
Did preach the word, of life and grace
Even as they went throughout.
And Philippe came, a city to
Which was of Samarye:
And preached Christ, as he to do
Had power given from an hye.
The people then, with one accord
His words right well out sought:
In that they saw, that God the Lord
Strange things by him had wrought.
For unclean sprites, with corynge voice
Came out of sundry men:
That were possessed, and had no choice
But called on Philip then.
The palseyes he, did heal also
And thereof was not coye:
The halte he heald, that could not go
In whom became great joy.
A certain man, there was whose name
Was Simon truth to tell:
Which here tofore, the very same
In witchcrafte did excel.
Uvho the people, bewycht to fore
That dwelt in Samarye:
And eke report, he could do more
Great things miraculouslye.
He was had in, great reverence
Of all that there abode:
Which said no dout, he does commence
The mighty power of God.
Because of his, continuance
By him they set much bye:
He mocked them, and did advance
Him self with sorcerye.
When Philipes words, they did well view
Who taught of Gods kingdom:
And in the name, of Christ Jesus
Baptized they did become.
Simon him self, did then believe
And baptized was also:
Abiding still, by Philipes sleue
And would not from him go.
But wondered much, then to behold
The signs that he did see:
And miracles, so manifold
By Philip done to be.
Thapostles hearing, that were glad
Then at Jerusalem:
That Samarye, received had
The word of God to them.
And sent Peter, and John aryght
To them in to that cost:
Who when they came, prayde that they might
Receive the holy Ghost.
Which was as yet, on them not come
That should them all renew:
Baptized they were, both all and some
Only in Christ Jesus.
Then did they lay, their hands right soon
On them both lest and most:
And each man did, when that was done
Receive the holy ghost.
When Simon did, behold and se
By hands that they did lay:
The holy ghost, receive might he
He offered them money.
And said also, give me this power
On whom my hands shall lie:
He may receive, even in that hour
The holy ghost there by.
Then Peter said, whose words abhorde
Thy goods now peryshe with the:
That think the gifts, of God the Lord
With goods well gotten he.
Thou have no part, nor fellowship
In this our busynes:
Thy heart away, from God does slyp
Repent thy wyckednes.
And pray to God, thy thoughts may fall
That in thy heart now be:
For thou art full, of bitter gall
Wrapped in iniquite.
Then Simon said, for this my mis
Lift up your hearts with me:
And pray to God, that none of this
Unto my charge laid be.
And when that they, had testifyde
And taught the word to them:
They did return, that time and tide
Unto Jerusalem.
And they did preach, the Gospel still
In Cities as they went:
Through Samarye, as was the will
Of him that had them sent.
The angel of, the Lord did say
To Philyp and him led:
Arise and go, toward myddaye
Unto the way with speed.
That gothe down from, Jerusalem
To Gaza in desert:
And he arose, and went on then
Even with a loving heart.
And now behold, a man certain
Of Ethiopia:
Which was a noble Chamberlayne
Then coming from Gaza.
He had the rule, of great Substans
Even with the Queen Candace:
Queen of the Ethiopians
Her tresorer he was.
Jerusalem feign he would get
Only therein to pray
He homewarde red, in his Charet
Of the prophet Esaye.
The sprit of God, to Philip said
Go nere to yonder man:
And join thy self, to him for aid
And Philip to him ran.
He saw the book, then in his hand
And heard him on it read:
And said doste thou, now understand
What thou doste read in deed.
The Chamberlayne, the truth did tell
And said he well espyde:
He could not understand it well
Except he had a gyde.
Of Philyp then, full feign he wext
And would him to draw nere:
And sit with him, to plain the text
That he of him did here.
The Tenor of, the text certain
Was this that he did say:
He as a sheep, led to be slain:
And as a Lamb down lay.
Before his sherer, with meknes,
His mouth not once vnsparde:
Because of that, his humblenes
They did him not regard.
Who shall declare, and eke exspound
His generation plain:
His life is taken, from the ground,
Then said the Chamberlayne.
I pray the friend, be thou content
To open if thou can:
The prophets words, by him self mean
Or by sum other man.
Philip opened, his mouth so pure
The truth then to discus:
And did begin, the same scripture
And taught him Christ Jesus.
And as they went, still on their way
A water he did spy:
The Chamberlayne, to him did say
Se here this water bye.
What shall me let, baptized to be
Then Philip to him said:
If thou believe, with heart right fre
Thou may not be denayde.
He answered him, I do believe
That Christ is God his son:
Willing the Charet, not to meue,
Till that good work were done.
They with good will, went down both twain
And in the water were:
Both Philip and, the Chamberlayne
Whom Philip baptized there.
This done they did, come out again
The sprite of Godly lore:
Took Philip from, the chamberlayne
He could see him no more.
Then on his way, he passed thus
Reioysynge in his heart.
And Philip was found, at Azotus
The people to conuart.
And he did walk, the country still
Preaching continuallye:
In all their cytyes, taught until
He came to Cesarye.

The Sinagoges about.
To find such as, on Christ beleues
Man or woman of them:
That he might bring, the^ bound as thieves
Unto Jerusalem.
But as he went, and was come nigh
Damasco for this thing:
He was beset, then sodaynlye
With light from heaven shynynge.
And straight unto, the earth fell he
And heard a voice record:
Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me
He said what art thou Lord.
Then said the Lord, Jesus I am
Whom thou do toss and torn:
It will be hard, for thee mad man
Against the prycke to sporne.
He trembling then, said on this wise
Lord what wylt thou I do:
And then the Lord, bad him arise
The city go in to.
And there it shall, be told to thee
Men hearing there this noyce:
Amassed were, that no man see
But heard a certain voice.
And Saul arose, then from the ground
His eyes he then opened:
And saw no man, but heard the sound
Of such as him then led.
Who brought him then, to Damasco
Three days his sight was blancke:
He saw no light, great was his woe
He neither eat nor drancke.
A certain disciple, there was
That at Damasco lay:
Who was named, Ananias
The Lord to him did say.
Ananias, work mine advice
Here Lord he did repeat
And then the Lord, bad him arise
And go into the streate.
Which streate is called straight in deed
And further more, do thus
In Judas house, look thou with speed
For one Saul of Tharsus
Behold he prayth, and he has seen
A vision brought to pas:
Wherein appeard, as it had been
The man Ananias.
Who as he thought, to him drew nere
To help his heavy plyght:
And by his hands, as might appear
He should receive his sight,
Then answered he, the Lord direct
And made of Saul complayntes:
How he had dealt, with his elect
In Jury that were saynctes.
And here he has, authorite
From the hye priests to stay:
And bind all those, that call on thee
The Lord to him did say.
Go on thy ways, and do these things
For he is given to me:
To bear my name, before all kings
And where the Gentyls be.
And eke children, of Israel
For I will him betake
To suffer great things, passing well
Only for my names sake.
Ananias, went on his way
And unto Saul drew nere:
And eke his hands, on him did lay
And said Saul brother dear.
The Lord that did, appear to thee
In the hye ways so bright:
Has sent me now, to make thee see
Wherefore receive thy sight.
The holy ghost, shall thee suffies
And fill thee with good tales:
And the^ fell things, down from his eyes
Like as they had been scales.
He did receive, his sight certain
So did he then baptym:
And eke did eat, his meat again
Which did well comfort him.
And certain days, Saul would not go
But kept with the elect:
Which then abode, at Damasco
The faith there to erect.
Saul preached Christ, with heart right fre
The sinagoges did use:
Anouchynge Christ, Gods son to be
That all much did muse.
Some said is not, this man the same
That latelye spoiled them:
Which then did call, on Christ his name
Even at Jerusalem.
And also came, for this intent
If any such he found:
Before thygh priest, them to convent
And eke to bring them bound.
But Saul in strength, increased so
The Jews he did resist:
Which then did dwell, at Damasco
Affirminge very Christ.
Within a while, Saul preaching still
Whose words abroad were blown:
The Jews took, council him to kill
The which to Saul was known.
They did lay wait, both day and night
And on the gates did watch:
Full cruelly, against all right
His life then to dispatche.
But the disciples, knowing all
Their purpose then to tell:
By night they put, him through yt wall
Down in a great basket.
When he came to, Jerusalem
Disciples being theare:
He said to join, him self to them
But they did him much fear.
And scarsly would, believe that God
This thing in him had wrought:
But Barnabas that there abod
Him to thappostles brought.
And did declare, to them also
That seen the Lord he had:
In the hye way, as he did go
And what the Lord him bad.
And how he had, right boldly done
The synagoges throughout:
In preaching Christ, to be Gods son
Damasco round about.
And then he had, the company
Of them with right good will:
And in the city, taught boldly
The name of Jesus still.
And he did speak, and eke dispute
Even with the Greeks certain:
He stoutly stood, them to confute
And they would him have slain.
But when the brethren did espy
They would have slain him thus:
They brought him unto Cesarye
And sent him to Tharsus.
Then did the congregation lie
Through Iewry al at rest:
And Galile, and Samarye
Were edified and blessed.
The fear of God, they did support
In each country and cost:
They multiplyd, in the comfort
Even of the holy ghost.
And it chanced, as Peter went
And of all countries felt:
The Lord unto, the saints him sent
Which then at Lidda dwelt.
A man he found, of heavy there
Whose name was Eneas:
The which had kept, his bed.viii. year
Sick of the Paulsye was.
Eneas then, did Peter say
Christ Jesus comfort thee:
Arise and make, thy bed straight way
And then arise did he.
And al Lidda, and Assaron
Of this does bear record:
Which saw the man, and there upon
Did turn unto the Lord.
There was a woman, at Ioppa
A disciple she was:
Whose name was called, Tabitha
Which is to say Dorcas.
Full of good worckes, she was always
And eke in alms tried:
It chanced so, even in those days
That she was sick and dyed.
When they had washed, her certaynlye
And in her Chamber laid:
Because Lidda, was Ioppa nigh
Then the disciples said.
That Peter was, then at Lidda
And sent one to report:
That their desire, was to Ioppa
He should to them resort.
Peter arose, and quicklye sought
For them that Dorcas kept:
Into the Chamber, they him brought
Where all the wydowes wept.
And showed such coats, as she did make
And also did convert:
Unto their use, for Christ his sake
And Peter said depart.
He kneled down, and eke did pray
And on the dead did cry:
Tabytha now, arise I say
And she lift up her eye.
And when she saw, Peter th^re stand
Her self she did up raise:
And then he took, her by the hand
And lift her up straight wayse.
Unto the saynctes, and widows then
A live he brought her out:
And it was known, unto all men
In Ioppa round about.
And many that, were them among
Believed then each where:
And he abode, in Ioppa long
With Simon Tanner there.

Unto his sight, God did bewraye
His angel glorius:
About the nynth, hour of the day
Which said Cornelius.
Who looked up, him to behold
And was afraid certain:
He said how Lord, may I behold
To know the matter plain.
The angel said, then in that place
Thine alms and prayers all:
Did come before, the throne of grace
When thou to God dydst call.
Wherefore to Ioppa, send anon
Some trustye messenger:
And bid him call, for one Simon
Whose surname is Peter.
In Simon tanners, house he is
Lodged by the sea side:
Who shall thee teach, the word of blis
Wherein thou shall abide.
And when the angel, that spoke thus
Departed was and gone:
Then strayt way did, Cornelius
Two servants call upon.
And eke a devout, sougyer
On him that did attend:
He told his mind, and for Peter
To Ioppa did them send.
Then on the morn, they rose right soon
And went fast on their way:
But Peter went, about high noone
Up in a loft to pray.
When hunger did, move him to eat
Wishynge for sustenance:
While they for him, prepared meat
He fell into a trance.
And saw ye heaven, then cleave in twain
A vessel down did glyde:
And to his sight, appeared plain*
A shete both large and wide.
The corners knyt, having therein
Fourfoted beasts full fair:
Worms of each sort, also vermyn
And eke fowls of the air.
There came a voice, to him and said
Rise Peter kill and eat:
But Peter then, as one dismayde
Began thus to entreat.
And said no Lord, that I refuse
It were sin as I mean:
For I in meat, did never use
Things common or unclean.
The voice then spoke, the second time
And said of this be sure:
What God does cleanse, is void of crime
Make thou it not vnpure.
This was done thryse, in his presens
The truth to tell you plain:
The vessel then, did vanyshe thens
Up in to heaven again.
When Peter thus, was in great dout
What this should signify:
Behold the men, that were sent out
From captain Cornelye.
Enquired where, Simon did dwell
Before the door standing:
Desiring one, to them to tell
Where was Peter's lodging.
While Peter in, his mind did muse
What this strange sight might be
The sprite to him, these words did use
Behold these men seek thee.
Arise and do, thy self prepare
To go with them an end:
And have no dout, nor yet no fear
For I to thee them send.
Then Peter to, the men down went
And said lo I am he:
Has any man, you to me sent
What is your will with me.
They said captain, Cornelius
A just man without blame:
Which fears God, most gracius
Of good report and fame.
Among the people, of the Iues
Was warned by an angel:
To send for thee, to hear good news
Of Gods most holy Gospel.
Into the house, with good intent
He did them lead to hostage:
The next day then, forth Peter went
With them even in their vyage.
And certain brethren, of Ioppaye
Did bear him company:
So did they all, on the third day
Come unto Cesarye.
Cornelius then, with his kynred
And friends especial:
Whom he together had called
Waited for Peter all.
And as Peter, by chance came in
The Captain did him mete:
In presence of his, friends and kin
Fell down at Peter's fete.
To worship him, then at a brayde
Cornelius then began:
But Peter took, him up and said
Stand up I am a man.
So Peter led, him forth with talk
Untyl he entered in:
Where he did find, much people walk
And then he did begin.
And said to them, ye know before
That heavy is the danger:
For us the Iues, by Moses lore
To join with a stranger.
But yet the Lord, has showed to me
That I should call no more:
No man unclean, what so he be
I douted not therefore:
To come as soon, as you did send
To know what it might be:
I ask you now, therefore the end
And cause ye sent for me.
It is now said, Cornelius
About four days a go:
Since that I was, much desyrus
To fast and pray also.
Then in my house, at the nynth houer
As I was there prayinge:
Behold one stood, of mighty power
By me in bright clothing.
He said to me, Cornelius
Thy prayer is accept:
Thy alms deeds, are precius
And in remembrance kept.
Before the face, of God always
Which is our God alone:
Therefore with speed, send to Ioppaye
And call for one Simone.
Whose surname, is called Peter
At Inn he does abide:
And lodge with Simon the tanner
Not far from the sea side.
When he comes, he shall plainly
Do thee to understand:
What is my will, and then did I
Send for thee out of hand.
It is well done, that thou art come
For we are here present:
Before the Lord, both all and some
To hear his commaundment.
With open mouth, Peter said then
From truth I will not wave:
Before the Lord no sorts of men
Preeminence can have.
But all such as, fears his grace
And works ryghtwisenes:
With his mereye, he does embrace
Acceptyng more and les.
The word that God, to Israel
Through Jesus Christ did send
He is the Lord, ye know right well
In every coast and end.
How it was than, bruted among
The Iues in each country:
But first of all, how that it spronge
Even out of Galile.
After John's Baptyme, and preaching
God with his holy brethe:
And strength anointed priest and King
Jesus of Nazarethe.
Which went about, and much good did
To those that were in pain:
From Satan's force, he did them ryd
God was with him certain.
Of all he did, the Iues until
And in their chief Cite:
We witness are, whom they did kill
And hanged upon a tree.
Whom God did raise, ye third day next
And show him openly-
Not to all men, as says the text
But unto us only.
Whom God did chose, to bear witness
Which fead with meat and bread:
And drank with him, alive doutles
Arisen from the dead.
And us to preach, commanded he
And to enstruct each head:
That God appointed, him to be
A judge of quick and dead.
The Prophets all, witness with fame
That all beleuers wynnes:
Through his merits, and holy name
Remission of their sins.
While Peter yet, these words did tell
That God did him afforde:
The holy ghost, on them all fell
That hearkened to the word.
The faithful people, of the Jews
Which Peter with him led:
Amassed were, sore at those news
When that Gods sprite was shed.
And powered on, the heathen sort
Whom they without delay:
With diverse tongues, heard make report
Of Gods high praise always
At that time Peter did answer
May any man us let:
Or else forbid, but that watere
Among us may be fet.
To baptize these, both lest and most
Which here in presence be:
Endewde now with, the holy ghost
To grace as well as we.
And to prepare, these to Baptym
He charged them straight ways
Then in Gods name, they moved him
To tarry there few days.
AND Peter does, declare the cause
Why he to the heathen went:
Paul Barnabas, does preach the lause
Of him that then them sent.

And said of late, thou wenst into
Thuncircumsyde in deed:
With them to eat, which thing to do
Our law has not decrede.
Peter began, then to debate
The things as they did chance
And said I was, in Ioppa late
Prayinge and in a trance.
As I in deed, playnelye had seen
A vessel descendynge:
A large white cloth, as it had been
From heaven then down coming
Let down it was, by corners four
And so it came to me:
Within the which, when it came lower
Mine eyes plainly might se.
Fourfoted beasts, that seemed fair
Uermen and worms there laid:
And also fowls, out of the air
A voice to me then said.
Peter arise, slay thou and eat
And I said Lord, God shylde:
For in my mouth, came never meat
Then common or yet defylde.
And then the voice, did answer me
From heaven with good accord:
Count not those things, unclean to be
That cleansed has the Lord.
Three times this thing, was brought about
As I have showed you plain:
And all things was, without all dout
Up take to heaven again.
And then behold, immediatlye
There came to me three men:
The which were sent, from Cesarye
Only to seek me then.
And then the sprite, to me did say
Do thou thy self prepare:
To go with them, forth on their way
And have thereof no fear.
Moreover then, six brethren went
In company of us:
Unto the house, of him that sent
Which was Cornelius:
How he had seen, he showed to us
The aungel of the Lord:
Which said to him, Cornelius
To Ioppa send thou word.
To Simon Peter, one of mine
Who shall tell words to thee:
Whereby that thou, and eke all thine
No dout shall saved be.
And then as I, began to preach
The sprite on them fell thus:
As did on us, when we did teach
The Lord and Christ Jesus.
Then in my head, I did record
Great things that I then wayde:
Which were the words, of God ye Lord
That he in deed had said.
John with water, he did baptyse
But ye shall baptized be:
Even with the sprite, that is right wise
Within few days trust me.
Then forasmuch as God did give
To them as unto us:
When we did first, preach and believe
The Lord and Christ Jesus.
What was I then, that I should seace
And eke the Lord deny:
When they heard yt, they held their peace
And God did glorifye.
And said also, that God had sent
The Gentiles even the same:
Their former life, then to repent
Beleuyng in his name.
Those that before, abroad were driven
Through persecution strong:
The which arose, about good Steven
From place to place went long.
Untyll they came, to Phenices
Cipers and Antioche:
Unto the Jews, both more and les
Only they did approach.
And eke of Cipers there were some
And of Sirene also:
To Antioche, when they were come
Unto the Greeks did go.
And preached then, the Lord Jesus
Whose hand with them abod:
A great number, believed us
And turned unto God.
Of these things tydinges came anon
Unto the ears of them:
That were the congregation
Then at Jerusalem.
And they sent forth, one Barnabas
To Antioche in peace:
When he came there, right glad he was
To see the faith increase
Exhorting them, not once to start
Since God had them restorde:
Unto his grace, that they with heart
Should cleave unto the Lord.
Right good he was, even from his youth
Full of the sprite and faith:
Much people he, unto the truth
Did win the storye says.
Then Barnabas, to Tharsus sought
To see Saul there approach:
Upon whose sight, right soon he brought
Him unto Antioche.
And it chanced, that one whole year
They kept together still:
Even with the, congregation there
And taught the Lord his will.
That in so much, thelect that were
At Antioche even then:
Were those in deed, that first did bear
The name of Christen men.
In those days from, Jerusalem
The Prophets came to us:
To Antioche, and one of them
Was named Agabus.
Which by the sprite, then signified
Great dearth should then succeed:
And that throughout, the world so wide
Which came to pass in deed.
In Claudius days, the Emperor
Thelect them selves did bind:
Each man according to his power
Some succor then to send.
Unto the brethren, in Iurye
Which thing they brought to pas
And sent unto, the Elders bye
Saul and eke Barnabas.

ANd in that time, Herod the king
He did his hands let slyppe:
To trouble men, of good living
And godly felowshyppe.
He did slaye James, John's brother dear
Even with the swearde in deed:
Because the Jews, well pleased were
He further did proceed.
It was the days, then of sweet bread
And he caught Peter fast:
With violence, void of all dread
In prison did him cast.
Delyuerynge him, a charge gave he
Unto quarternions four:
Of soldiers there, then kept to be
Till that the feast were over.
Entendynge then, once easter past
That out he should be brought
But Peter was, in prison fast
Till God for him had wrought
Then prayer was made, without ceasyng
Of all the godly men:
Unto the Lord, out him to bring
Of that foul filthy den.
When Herod would, have had him seen
And brought before the route:
The same night Peter, slept between
Two soldiers stowre and stout.
Bound with two chains, in lodginge pore
And so he fell a sleep:
The kepers standing at the door
The prison fast to keep.
Behold the Aungel, of the Lord
Was present in that tide:
The lodge to light, he then restorde
And smote on Peter's side:
And styrred him, who lay in bands
And said arise vnbewrayde:
And then the chains, fell from his hands
The Angel to him said:
Gyrde thou thy self, and have no dread
Thy Sandales bind on thee:
Thy mantell cast, on thee with speed
And then come follow me.
He followed him, and made no dene
And wylt not what done was:
But as a vision, he had seen
Which thaungel brought to pas
When they the first, watch did frustrate
The second watch also:
They came unto, the iron gate
That goth the city unto.
Which opened by, the own accord
They passing through by night:
And then the Angel, of the Lord
From Peter vanished quyght.
When Peter to, him self came well
He said I know and see:
That God has sent, me his Angel
Which has delyuerd me.
Out of the hands, of king Herod
And all his whole counsel:
And from the Jews, I thank my God
That never did me fail.
And as he thought, this thing upon
To Mary's house did go:
Which was the mother, of one John
And called Mark also.
Where diverse were, gathered to pray
There Peter knocked with speed:
A damsel came forth, to hear say
Named Rhoda in deed.
And when that she, knew Peter's voice
The door she did let pas:
She ran in fast, and did rejoice
To tell where Peter was.
Declarynge plain, that heard she had
Him speak in the enter:
And then they said, that she was mad
But she said it was he.
Then said they all, it may betyde
His Aungel there to be:
But Peter still, did there abide
And eke still knocked he.
And when they had, opend the door
Where Peter then did stand:
They were astonished, rich and pore
But he held up his hand.
And wylled them, to hold their peace
And showed them what was past*
How that the Lord, did him releace
Where he in chains lay fast.
And he said then, go show this thing
To James and, brethren eke:
And he went thence, before day spring
Another place to seek.
As Soon as it, was fair light day
The soldiers made great moan:
Each one to other, began to say
How is this man thus gone.
When Herod then, for him did call
And naught of him heard say:
He did examine, the kepers all
Commaundynge them away:
And he descended, from Iewrye
To Cesarye anon:
With them of Tire, he was angrye
And with them of Sidon:
And they came all, then to obtain
By intercession than:
To Bassus made, his chamberlayne
Desiring peace each man.
Because their country, where they fed
Chiefly by him did stand:
And they and theirs, were norishedde
Only by Herodes land.
Upon a day, appointed well
Herod him self made neat:
In fine and royal, apparel
And set him on his seat.
To them gay words, then spoke Herod
The people then did shoute:
And said he speaks, more like a God
Then like a man no doubt.
The angel then, immediatlye
Did strycke him with Gods rod:
Because he did, not give the glory
Unto the living God.
The worms of him, took their repast
And he gave up the ghost:
The word also increased fast
And grew in every coost.
Then Barnabas, and Paul went soon
Unto Jerusalem:
When they their office, had well done
And took John Mark with them.

The Tetracks nurs, fellow was there
Whose name was Manahene.
And also Saul, was there in place
Who as they ministered:
And eke did fast, and pray for grace
Gods sprite on them was shed.
Which did command, and to them said
Send Barnabas and Saul:
To work the work, before them laid
Whereto I did them caul.
Then did they fast, and also pray
As they were wont to do:
And eke their hands, on them did lay
And then they let them go.
And by Gods sprite, when they were sent
They came to Seleucye:
From thence did sail, so that they went
To Ciprus directlye.
And when they came, to Salomine
In the church of the Jews:
Their hearts and mynds, they did incline
To preach them there good news.
To serve with them, there for a while
They had one John by name:
And when they had, gone through the isle
To Paphos then they came.
A sorcerer there, of them was found
A false prophet a Iue:
Whose teaching was, not sure ne sound
His name was Bariesu.
With Sergius Paul, a man prudent
Which ruled the whole country:
With all his train, he did frequent
Familier then to be.
The same ruler, to him did caul
And willed to come nere:
Both Barnabas, and also Paul
Of them gods word to here.
But Elymas, the sorcerer
So they declare his name:
Did will the ruler, to forbere
To faith him self to frame.
Saul named Paul, then in that cost
Full fervent at a brayde:
Who was full of, the holy Ghost
Beheld him then and said.
O full of all, subtylitye
And eke disceytfulnes:
The deuyls child, and enemy
To grace and ryghtwysenes.
Thou do not cease, still to peruart
By damnable discord:
But do always pluck from man's heart
The straight ways of the Lord.
And now behold, thou man unkind
The Lords hand is on thee:
And for a time, thou shall be blind
The Sun thou shall not se.
Immediatlye, then for his pride
Upon his eyes did stand:
A mist that made, him seek a gyde
To lead him by the hand.
The ruler then, did see the case
And not thereat repyne:
But mused much, and did embrace
The Lord and his doctrine.
When Paul from Paphus, took shippyng
And all his company:
Forth on their way, they went saylyng
To Perge of Phamphilye.
To see his friends, John was right feign
And did depart from them:
And so returned, whom again
Unto Jerusalem.
They wandryng there, went from Perga
And soon they did approach:
The land then of, Pisydia
And came to Antioche.
Into the sinagoge they went
Upon the Sabbothes day:
And sat them down, with good intent
No man did say them nay.
But when the lecture, of the law
And prophets there were done.
The ruler then, which there them saw
Said unto them right sone.
Good brethren now, we do you pray
The people to exhort:
If any sermon, ye can say
To them for their comfort.
Then Paul stood up, there in presens
And beckned with his hand:
He prayde them all, to keep sylens
Gods word to understand.
He said ye men, of Israel
And ye that God do fear:
And all that here, among you dwell
I pray you give good care.
God of this people, did elect
Our fathers us beforne:
Auancynge them, that were reject
As forreners far borne.
In Egypt land, both day and night
In bondage they did dwell:
The Lord then with, his arm of might
Did bring them out right well.
And fourtye years, he did them spare
In all their wyckednes:
To punish them, he did forbear
With in the wyldernes.
Seven nations then, in Canaan
He wasted well I wot:
Partynge the land, to every man
According to his lot.
Then to the time, of Samuel
The judges gave truly:
Among them there, years for to dwell
Four hundredth and fyftye.
And after that, a king to crave
They would not cease ne blyn:
The son of Cis, Saul God them gave
Of the tribe of Beniamyn.
Twice twentye years, he ware ye crown
No longer raygned he:
For God the Lord, did put him down
And his posterite.
He set up David, to be king
And ruler in his place:
And did report, of him saying
David I do enbrace.
One Iesses son, whom I have found
A man Ientell and kind:
He is to me, both sure and sound
To fulfill all my mind.
Of this man's sede, a savior
The promise thus does tell:
God has brought forth, Jesus the flour
And king of Israel.
But after John, had run his race
He said I am not he:
I mean Messiah, full of grace
Whom ye take me to be.
But lo one does, come after me
Whose shoes upon his fete:
Of such hyghnes, and dignite
To lose I am unmeet:
Ye men brethren, and children all
Of Abraham by descent:
To you that fear, God great and small
This word of life is sent.
The dwellers in, Jerusalem
The rulers well I wot:
And all such then, as were with them
In deed they knew him not.
The prophets voice, that were red
Each Saboth them among:
With such blyndnes, then were they led,
They could take then but wrong.
And though of death, they found no cause
In him most innocent:
The Prophecyes, in every clause
Were ended as they meant.
In denying him, to mortal fate
They did them all fulfill:
When they made suit, to Pons Pilate,
This innocent to kill.
Then all things done, in each degree
As scripture would it have:
They took his body, from the tree
And laid it in the grave.
God raised him, on the third day
From death to life certain:
He showed him self, without delay,
When he was risen again.
And many times, appeared he
Full lyuelye unto them:
That went with him, from Galile
Unto Jerusalem.
Which are his witness, to each sort
Appointed of the Lord:
And we also, to your comfort
Gods promise do record.
Which to our fathers, he did frame
How God to their ofsprynge:
Fulfilled has, in Christ the same
From death him reuiuynge.
The second Psalm, records plain
Thou art my son says he:
The father says, this day certain
I have begotten thee.
In that he raised, him anon
From death nothing dismayde
No more to se, corruption
On this wise then he said.
The favor grace, and eke good will
That I David did vow:
Full faythfullye, I shall fulfill
And parforme it to you.
Therefore he says, in the like place
Thy son the holy on:
Thou shall not suffer, in no case
To see corruption.
As for David, his time did keep
To serve gods will truly:
And after that, falling a sleep
Was laid his father bye.
His Cors did waste, and putrefye
But God his son did he:
Make quick again, and certaynlye
Did no corrupcyon se.
Know ye therefore, ye brethren all
Through him ye may purchase:
Which is preached, to great and small
Forgeuenes of trespace.
And from all things, full sure to be
Acquitted and made sure:
Which Moses law, in no degree
Could cleanse be ye right sure.
But who so that, will give credence
And in the faith abide:
Through him is clear, from all offense
And also justified.
Beware therefore, I do you read
And keep ye from the lake:
Lest those things fall, upon your head
Whereof the prophets spoke.
Ye dispisers, behold and muse
At your destruction now:
For in your time, a work defuse
I work even unto you.
Which in no wise, ye shall believe
Who so of it you tell:
The which is wrought, you for to grieve
Because ye do rebel.
When that the Iues, were all forth gone
Out of their holy place:
The Gentyles them, besought anon
To preach the word of grace.
And them to teach, through out the weke
Between the Saboth days:
What means and ways, that they might
To please the Lord always.
Their holy congregation then
So ended Luke recytes:
On them did wait, there many men
Both Iues and Procelytes.
To these good men, that did abide
Spoke Paul and Barnabas
Exortynge them, not once to slide
From God ne from his grace.
The Saboth day, then next following
The city whole well near:
Together came, much desiring
Gods holy word to hear.
But when the Jews, saw such a route
They were full wrath I deem:
Reuilyng Paul, with words fulstoute
Beginning to blaspheme.
But Barnabas, and Paul was bold
And said it does behoue:
Gods word to you, first to be told
Which sent is from above,
But sith ye do, it now deny
Avoiding it with strife:
And think your selves, now unworthy
Of everlasting life.
And eke the word, so precious
Ye take for craft and gyles:
Lo here the Lord, has wylled us
To turn unto the Gentyles.
I have set thee, to be a light
The Gentyles for to gyde
And them to save, as I behyght
Throughout the earth so wide.
The Gentyles then, offered this grace
Of it they were full feign:
Gods word with thanks, they did embrace
Beleuynge it certain.
And those that God, had ordained
To everlasting life:
Abode in faith, the word did spread
Throughout the country ryfe.
Wherefore the Jews, them did abhore
And moved without pytye:
The women of, worship and honor
The chief men of the city.
Against poor Paul, and Barnabas
And would without offense:
A persecution brought to pas.
Expellynge them from thence.
Out of that coast, when they needs must
To go they made them mete:
And for a witness, shoke the dust
Against them of their fete.
And they came to, Iconium
Accept of least and most:
And Gods elect, were all becum
Full of the holy ghost.

But then the Iues, of unbelief
The Gentyles on did call:
And styrde their minds, to much mischefe
Against the brethren all.
And they long time, did there persist
Gods word still to record:
And quit them selves, boldly in Christ
By help of God the Lord.
Which then, gave testimonye unto
The word even of his grace:
And caused them, great things to do
Which by their hands took place.
The people did, them selves deuyde
As they were then affect:
Sum from the Iues, would never slide
Nor sum from Christ's elect.
When yt the Jews, and gentyles would
Assault make them upon:
Their rulers wrought, all yt they could
By counsel them to ston.
Whose counsel known, they made no host
But fled unto Lystra:
And Derba cytyes, of the cost
Of Licaonia.
And eke unto, the region
That lies there round about:
And preached Christ, to every one
And his Gospel through out.
There sat a man, of little mirth
At Lystra, lame of fete:
A trepell was, even from his birth
And never walked yet.
Who heard Paul preach, ye story says
And Paul beheld the man:
And did perceive, that he had faith
To be made whole even then.
Paul said to him, with chereful voice
Upon thy fete up stand:
And he start up, and did rejoice
And walked out of hand.
And when the people, did behold
What Paul had done that day:
With mighty voice, they were full bold
To brute these things and say.
Now in the speech, of our country
Gods are come down us to:
In likeness now, of men ye se
And what strange things they do.
And Barnabas, they called thus
The name of Jupiter:
And called Paul, Mercurius
Because he was preacher.
And then the priest, of Jupiter
Bystyrd both fete and hands:
Which dwelt before, the City there
Brought oxen and garlandes.
To the church porche, and did advise
The people and them caul:
With him then to, do Sacrifyce
To Barnabas and Paul.
But wha^ Thappostles, herd their knackes
They might it not abide:
But rent their clothes, the^ on their backs
And ran with them to chyde.
They cried and said, unto them then
Why have ye done thus now:
For we are both, but mortal men
In all points like to you.
And we do preach, you verytyes,
That lies might be abhorde
To turn you from, these vanytyes,
Unto the living Lord.
Who made the heavens, and eke ye lands
That they should still be his:
He made the sea, even with his hands
And all that in them is.
Which in times past, even in those days
Did suffer and permit:
Each man to walk, in his own ways
Given up to his own wit.
Nevertheless, his heavenly wits
Left witness to declare:
In that he showed his benefyttes
From heaven rain to prepare.
And frutfull seasons, gave at will
To us both more and les:
And in the end, our hearts did fill
With food and great gladness.
And all these words, would scarce entyse
The people to forbear:
But that they would, do Sacrifyce
Unto them both even there.
And certainly, Iues did there approach
The which did even then cum:
Immediatlye, from Antioche
And from Iconium.
And got the people, to consent
With stones Paul's blood to shed
And through the city, they him rent
Thinking he had been deed.
And yet as the, disciples stood
About him to lament:
He did arise, and for his fode
Into the city went.
And he abode, there all that night
Even unto the next day:
Then Barnabas, and he a right
To Darby took the way.
And in that City, they did preach
While they did there soiorne:
To all men Jesus, Christ did teach
And then they did return.
To Lystra and, Iconium
To Antioche and there:
Strengthened the souls, of all and sum
That there disciples were.
Exhorting them, not to relent
But in the faith remain:
Affirmynge that, through much torment
We must to heaven attain.
And they then by, election
Ordained elders there:
In every, congregation
By fasting and prayer.
That God to the^, his grace might se^de
To work his will most Just
And thus to God, did them commend
In whom they put their trust
And they went through, Pisidia
And taught the people still:
And came unto, Pamphilia
Their calling to fulfill.
And when they had, declared plain
Gods word then in Perca:
They did descend, forth with again
Into Attalia.
From thence by ship, they all sailed
To Antioche a pace:
From whence they were, delivered
To God and to his grace.
Who had them long, preserved still
From cruel men and mad:
Even by his grace, to work his will
Which they fulfilled had.
When they were come, and to one stead
The congregation brought:
There was rehearst by each man's head
That God by them had wrought.
How he the door, of faith vntyde
The Gentyls in to call:
And there long time, they did abide
With the disciples all.
