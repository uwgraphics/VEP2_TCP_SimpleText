FINIS.
The preface of Alexander Barclay priest / unto the right hye and mighty
prince: Thomas duke of Northfolke.


RIght mighty hye / and magnificent prince: mine humble service / due unto your
grace. And the vehement affection which I have unto your honor and perpetual
fame / impelleth me often times to deuyse / and reuolue in mind: what service
or pleasur my simpleness might do / convenient and acceptable unto your
highness: thereby to testify the honor / the love / and obsequy: which I
knowledge my self to owe unto your magnifice^ce. But when I consider and
compare my symplenesse and impotence with your preemine^t dignite: I find
myself greatly insufficie^t to parforme or attempt any business or warke which
I may condynglie present unto your honorable presence. Nevertheless after many
co^syderacio^s: the gracious regard of benynge grauite which I behold in your
countenance: and the evident signs of humilite which outwardly apereth
radica^e in your noble heart: reconforteth mine insufficience and inboldeth my
spirits / some thing to write my custom which I may present into your
gracious hands: as a perpetual memorial: an and evident testimony of my devout
service / and amorous affection against your magnificent hyghnes. In this
consyderacion I have reuolued many and diverse volumes / studyeng of which one:
the tra^slacion: might correspond with your noble estat. But at last I have
remembered that a mercyal matter is most co^gruent unto a marcial and victorious
prince. Wherefore I have attempted to translate into our maternal langage the
ancient cronicle and famous history of the war: and diverse batayls which
the romans did against the tyran Iugurth: usurper of the kingdom of Numidy.
Which history is written in latin by the ronowmed romayne Salust: whose words
in latin I have also added unto the marge of this my tra^slacion to the intent
that such as shall dysdayne to read my translation in english: may read this
history more co^pendyously and more obscurely written in laten. Which history:
parauenture shall apere more clear and plain unto them in many places by help
of this my translation. Which shall not be tedyous to such as be learned and
vndestande latin: but unto many noble gentylmen which understand not latin
tongue perfetly I dout not but that this my labor shall be both pleasure and
profet. For by the same they shall have some help toward the understanding of
latin: which at this time is almost conte^ned of gentylmen. And also they shall
understand a right fruytful history: both pleasant / profitable / and right
necessary unto every degree: but specially to gentylmen / which coueyt to
attain to clear fame and honor: by glorious deeds of chyualry. But I dout
not: but that some calumnyous detractours shall malign against this my besynes
and profitable labor / saying that to a priest and man professed to obserua^ce
of religion: it is far contrary and dysagreynge to intermyt himself with
warfare: or to intermyt with things of battle: outher by deeds / counsel / or
writynge. But to stop the mouths of such calumniatours: most sovereign
prince: mesemeth right and convenient in this place: somewhat to write as well
concerning the commodities and lauds of hystories: as apertenent unto mine
own excusacion. And first I knowledge it much more convenient: a priest to arm
himself with constance / holy scripture / pureness of life / and radyant
virtues: and with such socours and armor defended: boldly / and valia^tly /
to bid battle against vyc^s: to pursue the obstinate sinners of this world.
And to co^tende also against the temptacio^s of his carnal co^cupisce^ces /
against these mundayne blandime^tes and delectacions: and against his gostely
ennemies suggestyo^s. For under this manner (as affermeth the holy man Job)
man's life upon yerth is but a warfare / and a very mase of miseries: an
in^ricate circuit of vary able / and inevitable errors. For certain I deny
not: but that such ought to be the warfare of a man within holy orders: auowed
and submyt unto ye holy minysteries and auters of god. But this other temperal
war is permytted unto wordely lyuers: and may not be omytted: namely in this
world oppressed with tyranny of iniuryous and odyous exactors and oppressors:
whose obstinate presumpcions / assautes / and invasions can not otherwise be
repressed: than by violence / armor / and battle: under ministracion of good
and ryghtwyse princes defenders and mayntayners of the commen well. Than it is
lauful: a priest to write such acts for example of our posterite: for
perpetual remembrance of the lauds of good princes / which have been here in
earth the scourges of god to correct tyrannes and sinners. But great is the
laud and many be the commodities and vtilities of hystories. An hystore is the
recorder of times passed: the light of verite: the maistres of man's lyueng:
the presydent of memory: the messanger of antiquite. And (as Titus Liuius
records in his prologue) the knowledge of hystories among other things is
most wholesome / necessary / and profitable. For every good example which in them
is written: is set for a warnyng and monycion unto princes and governors thereby
to rule and order themself: and a common well. And every example of miserable
fortune of tyrannes / is set as a monicion for the same governors not to be of
tyrannous behauour / lest at last they may fall i^to like miserable ruin and
calamite. And also (as says Cicero) a man to know nothing of that which was
done before his time and remembrance: that is as who says always to be a
child. But it is a thing very comely: and necessary before other: to know
these chronicles and noble acts of ancient time and remembrance to keep in
mind the order and courses of antiquite: and to have in mind the knowledge of
exemples for every matter and purpose. For in likewise as unto aged men is more
credence and auctorite given / than to young men: because of experience of many
things. So such noble and dilligent minds as delyteth in redynge hystories:
may have knowledge not only of the deeds of one man's life: but also of the
deeds most famous of al times sith creation of the world. Wherefore (as says
Dyodorus) it is a comely and fair thing / much necessary and commendable: a
man to refourme and amend his life / by example of an other man's fautes and
da^mages. Wherefore Demetrius Phalerus the great philosopher: often warned and
counseled the king Ptolomy to exercise himself in often redyng of books of
hystories. For in so doing: princes shall find written in books before their
eyes right many things concerning their well / honor / and fame: which their
friends dare not be bold to tell them for dread of dysplesure: fathermore
without the knowledge of hystories never man could become good orator. For (as
affermeth Quintilian) hystories be of such might and effect that they may
norisshe the speech of an orator withsoft and sweet lycour. These premises
with otherlyke considered: most magnificent prince: me thinks it thing not
inconvenient a priest to write of hystories of war: and also me think both
pleasant and profitable to noble men to exercise themself in redyng the same.
For brefely to speak by ryghtwysie batel: the laws of god and man be
mentayned: vice and vicious men corrected: virtue / and good men rewarded and
exalted. Our faith against infideles defended: rebellers and tyrannes subdued:
and finally all things directed and to due order reduced. Fathermore the same
redyng of hystores seems to avail not a little to the knowledge and contempt
of this transytorie pleasure mundayne and mysery of this uncertain life. For
when hystories represe^t before our sight the valyant and bold herted knights
shyning in armor: and richely aparelled: on comely coursers ^arded and trapped
with gold and silver: the goodly order and ordynance of a great army of armed
m^n shyning in harness: fyers / and prepared ready to battle: the trumpettes
soun^ing: the golden stremers and standerdes blasyng and glisteryng against the
son: and brefely all the ground ouercouerd with men and riches. What else is
all this: but a vain oste^tation of yertly opulence: and caduke glory
prepared besely / assembled laboriously / and exposed folysshly and furiously
unto destruction and perdicion. But again anon after: when we read and se in
the same hystories the valiau^t men's bodies prostrate: the carkases of kings
/ dukes / earls / knights / and pages mengled all together: all pride and
contencion abated. The bright harness dyed with blood: the wounded coursers
drawing after them the deed bodies of their lords: the men cryeng: the tents
and towns brennyng. What is all this sight with otherlyke? Forsooth naught else
but an evident spectacle of man's brutall crudelite: and an example of
mundayne vanite: declarynge the immoderat and insaciable desire of dominion of
yerthely princes: and proving that unto man wealth is intolerable / and
confounded by his own folly. These manyfolde and wholesome examples: represented
before our sight by reding of chronicles: has moved my mind to translate this
present history forth of latin into our maternal langage. But among all other
noble men of this region: most hye and mighty prince: ye seem unto me most
worthy and convenient: to whose grace I should decycat this history: both for
mine own duty to be observed anenst your magnifycence: and also for the
excellent worthynesse of your merits and great polycie of chyualry / which
lately have apered in you^ while ye not with less wysdo^e / than valyantyse
have vaynquysshed the inuasour and violent ennemy of the common well of
England. In which noble and glorious act ye have proved your self like unto
mighty Marius. But this I omytte: as thing evidently known to every man: lest
I might seem rather to recou^t these your strong deeds for adulacion: than for
true relation. Wherefore most mighty and magnifycent prince: pleas it your
highness of gracious beniuolence to accept this small present / translated by
yor beedman to pleasure and profet of al gentylmen of this region: but namely
of your hyghnes and of the noble men of your progeny and affynite. But to
the intent that this my small gift somewhat may be augmented: my self / my
service / and prayer: I offer withal unto your hygnes.

Thus ends the preface of this present cronycle: by Alexander Barclay priest
/ dyrect unto the right hye and mighty prince Thomas duke of Northfolke.
Here begins a compendyous extracte / contaynyng breffely the effect and
process of this present cronycle / compyled in latin by the famous Romayn
Salust. And translated into english by Alexander Barcley priest / at
commandment of the right high and mighty prince Thomas duke of Northfolke.
IN this present cronycle or hystory of Rome: is written the battle / which
the Romans had with Iugurth / usurper of the kingdom of Numydy. The land of
Numydy is part of the country of Affryke. In which raygned sometime a king
named Massinissa: fellow and friend to the empire of Rhome. This Massinissa had
three sons thus named: Micipsa / Manastabal / and Galussa. But after the death
of Manastabal and Galussa: the first brother named Micipsa / obtained the
kingdom of Numydy alone / without partyner. For after the custom of Numydy /
heritages are wont to be divided among brethern by equal porcions / after
dyscease of their parents / of whom such heritage issues. This Micipsa so
crowned king of hole Numydy had two sons / the first called Adherbal / the
second Hiempsall. But his brother Manastabal which was departed before / left
behind him one bastard son named Iugurth: to whom his grandfather
Massinissa bequethed none heritage / but left him private without land or
lyuelodde / for asmoche as he was unlawfully borne. The king Micipsa was moved
with pity and compassyon against this Iugurth: and co^sideryng that he was his
brothers son / and without conforte / received him into his house / and
cherisshed him in all things / as he did his own sons. This Iugurth as he
grew in stature / so grew he in all gifts belonging to nature / and became
a right strong and hardy knight / and also more excellent in wisdom / than in
courage or might / and was much elder than the two sons of Micispa: named
Adher ball and Hiempsall. What time Micipsa co^sydered the ^^ouryng age
manlynes / and wisdom of Iugurth. And on the other part / when he remembered
the feeble yongth and inexpert of his own two sons in this aduiseme^t his
mind was sore troubled with dread: ^est after his death / the same Iugurth might
invade and usurp unto himself the kingdom of Numydy his own two sons
being not of power to defend themself. Micipsa after these things co^sydred:
determined to object this Iugurth unto paryll of war / and by such means to
assay if it might fortune him to be slain in batell. Therefore what time ye
romans having Scipio for their captain / beseged the cite of Numance: this
Micipsa sent unto the romans to ye same battle great socours both of horsemen
and of fotemen. And made Iugurthe captayn over them. This did he trusting
that it was possible and lykely enough that this Iugurth a knight young / lusty
/ and desirous of honor / might by some chance of fortune be slain in
battle / as I said before. But at conclusion it fortuned much contrary. For
the boldness and strength of Iugurthe in that war was well proved and
known. For many noble and valiant acts of chyualry did he: whereby he wanne
much laud and glory / with great love and favor / not only of Scipio the
captain / but also of all the noblest men of the Romayne army. Insomoche that
after this war was fynisshed: and the cite of Numance distroyed the captain
Scipio assembled his hole army: and before them all with magnificent and
favorable words commended Iugurth with merueylous lauds. This done he
rewarded him with many and rich gifts of chyualry. And sent him again to the
king Micipsa with letters / wherein also he commended this Iugurth with great
laud and praysyng. By instigacion of which things it so befell: that where
as the king Micipsa / not long before desired nothing more than ye death of
Iugurth: now he coueted naught somoche as conseruacion of his life and health.
So that not long after he adopted him as his son / and ordained in his
testament him to be one of his heirs and partiner of his kingdom with his two
other natural sons. Which ordinance he never changed / but at his
departing increased his favor and benefits against ye same Iugurth / leaving
him not only partiner of his kingdom / but also of all his treasours. And
beside this decryed him to be protector of his two natural sons / and of
their porcions of the kingdom. Sone after this ordinance the king Micipsa
departed from life. But when ye three princes Adherball / Hiempsall / and
Iugurth determined among them the time when the treasoure should be divided
and the bounds of the kingdom lymited to them each one his part. At this
assemble grew a dissencion between Hiempsall and Iugurth / by occasyon whereof
Iugurth shortly after slew Hiempsall by treason and gyle. After this
Hiempsall was slain Iugurthe fixed his mind to possess the hole kingdom of
Numidy. Wherefore he prepared a great and strong army against the other brother
Adherball / and at last when both met in battle the army of Adherball was
overthrown / and himself put to flight. Adherball thus overcome and spoiled
of his kingdom fledd unto Rome / and there before the senators declared the
tyrannous cruelte of Iugurth against him committed / and against his brother
Hiempsall cruelly murdered: desiryng socours of the same senators / with pytefull
words and lamentable complayntes. At conclusion it was decreed of the
senators / that.x. noble men of Rome should be sent ambassadors to Numydy /
to deuyde the kingdom between Adherball and Iugurth indifferently. The same
ambassadors hasted them to Numydy / and did the commandment of the senate
to them enjoined: but more to the favor of Iugurth / than Adherball. When the
kingdom was departed and divided / and the said ambassadors were also
departed from Affr^ke toward Rome: Iugurth set his mind yet ones again to
invade and usurp the part of ye kingdom which belonged to Ad / herball / by
assigneme^t of the ambassadors. Wherefore he assembled a new army / and with
the same i^nuaded his kingdom: Adherball compelled by necessite assembled also
an other army for his part / and proceeded forth and met with Iugurth. But
anon after they joined battle / Iugurth ouerthrewe the host of Adherball and
put him to ^^yght / co^strainyng him to fle with a few horsemen about him into
a walled town nere by / named Cyrtha. Iugurth anon beseged the town on all
parts. In the mean time Adherball by letters certified ye senators of Rome
in what state Iugurth had brought him. How he was bereft of his kingdom by
cruelty and ambicion of Iugurthe: how he was brought to extremite by hunger
and force of arms / not able to abide the besegynge any longer: how it appeared
evidently that Iugurth set little by the decrees and ordinance of the
senators / And at conclusion of the same letters he humbly besought the senate
of aid and socours in this his extremite. When these letters were read before
the senators assembled: many of them were: which iuged it thing expedient and
convenient: to socour Adherball. And anon to send an army into Affrike
against Iugurthe. But his friends whom he had bought for money at Rome: made
such resistance that no such ordinance could come to effect / nor pass
forth against him. Nevertheless new ambassadors were sent ones again to
Iugurth / and that men ancient and of great authorite: to compel and
command him in name of the senators to desyst from his entreprise and
cruelty in pain of their hye displeasure. Iugurth blinded these imbassadours
with fair words and rewards / till they were departed again from Numidy to
Rome / without any thing brought to end. When this was known at Cirtha ^ where
Adherball lay beseged: they which were with Adherball within the town
counseled him to yield up the town to Iugurth / upon condition only to have
his life pardoned unto him. Adherball constrained by famine and other
necessities condiscended to this counsel. But anon after the town was yielded
/ Iugurth contrary to his faith and promise which he had made to Adherbal: slew
him with grievous and horrible tourme^t. When this deed was known at Rome: the
senators were sore moved against him. And took his demeanoure and deeds
inhumayne grievously. Wherefore by commen assent of the senators and commens of
Rome: one named Licius Calphurnius that time consul of Rome / was sent with a
strong army into Numidy against Iugurth. But with in short season this
Calphurnius corrupted and accloyed with money by Iugurth made a foul bond of
peace with him to great dishonor and shame both of himself ^ and of all the
empire of Rome: for which deed the senators and commens of Rome were grievously
displeased. Wherefore Calphurnius was called home again to Rome with great
dishonor and rebuke. After this Calphurnius / an other romayn named Albinus
was elect consul and dyrect with new suppleme^t of warriors into Numidy
against Iugurth. But this Iugurth drove him forth under hope and color as if
he would yield himself to the said Al^inus: so long till at last the time
approached of election of new consuls. Wherefore Albinus of necessite
constrained: and as decrees of the romans commanded: returned again to Rome
to be at the said election (as he was bound) without any deed laudably done in
Numidy. And at his departinge left behind him in Numidy his brother named
Aulus: to be captayn in his stead / and ruler of his army / and also of the
province where the same army soiourned till the winter were over passed. What
time Albinus was departed toward Rome: this Aulus blinded by rasshenes and
folly / behaved himself right indiscreetly in his rowme. In somoche that he
called the army unto viage / and warfare forth of their tents in the month of
January: in coldest and sharpest season of winter This did he: other because
he trusted to end the battle in his time: and so thereby to win thank and
worship: or else to thente^t to get money of Iugurh by grau^tyng unto him
peace and rest for his time. And so to co^strayne him to bye his peace. When
Iugurth perceived this vnexpertnes and rasshe folly of Aulus: he sent unto him
ambassadors as if he were a ferde: by dissimulacion to require of him peace.
And in the mean time the same Iugurth led his army among hills and wodes
fainyng as if he fled from Aulus for dread. Aulus understanding this /
persued and followed him more egarly and hastily / without aduisment / ord^r /
or provision. When Iugurth saw that he had attised and drawn the Romans into
a place to fight for his advantage: anon he assailed them and embatayled with
them fyersly / in which battle he overcame the romans and put them to
flight. On the next morn after / Iugurth and Aulus came together in
communicacion. And at last trewes was stryken between both parties / in this
manner and by such co^dicions: that all the romans should pass under a spear in
sign of subieccion / and that they were overcome without more hurt. And
afterward within ten days all should depart out of Numidy / and so was it
done. When tidings hereof were brought to rome: all the city was troubled with
dread and displeasure. After this shameful trewes of Aulus and disconfiture
and flight of the romayne army / a noble man named Metellus was creat consul of
Rome / and by common assent send unto Numidi against Iugurth. This Metellus
behaved himself as a noble captain and valiant warrior: and perceiving
that the residue of the army which was escaped / was disolute and out of order
/ by over much liberty. And by fault of the captains / which were before / he
first of all reduced the sowdiours to good rule and order / acordynge to the
ancient ordinances of chyualry: and than in time convenient after his army
was brought to order / he assailed Iugurth fyersly. And after certain sharp
and grievous batayles / he diminished his riches / his might and power and
brought him almost to extremite. After this Metellus: one named Marius last of
all was creat consul / and the province and war of Numidy decreed and
committed to him. This Marius anon pursued Iugurthe in battle most sharply
and fiersly of all other / insomoche / that finally he utterly brought him to
extremite: his friends / his riches and power / brought all to naught. And at
conclusion by treason / and betrayeng of one Bocchus / king of the Mauriens:
Iugurthe was deliuerd to the same Marius as prisoner: whom he led bound to
Rome with great glory and triumph. At last this Iugurth was thrown into
prison / where at conclusion he ended his miserable life / in dolors and
captivity. This is the argument and process of all this hystory and cronicle:
in which the redar / of whatso ever condition and degree he be: shall find
both profit and pleasure: if he read it attentyfly and with good aduertens.
And most namely gentylmen apt to attain to glorious fame and honor by fayt
of chyualry: shall find both pleasant and profitable pastime / in redyng this
hystory: unto whose example / profit / and pleasure I chefely have translated
the same.

The prologue of this present cronycle compyled in laten by the famous romayn
Salust: and translated into english by Alexander Barcley priest.
Mankind wrongfully complayneth of his natural dysposicion: saying / that his
feeble and frail life of short co^tinuaunce of time / is rather ruled by
chau^ces of fortune: than by provision of strength or virtue. But if man well
consider his natural i^clinacion: contrary to such opinion: he shall find that
nothing longing to mankind / may be found and proved greater / better / or
more preemine^t than his natural inclinacion: and yt his own diligence and
exercise / rather fails him / than outher might or long continuau^ce of life
time. But in this opinion to judge indifferently: let man understand that the
mind is ordained / gyder / ruler and captain of man's life: which mind:
when it valyantly inte^deth to attain / to worship and dignite / by way of
virtue: it is excellent enough mighty and clear of it self: so that it needs
not to force of fortune / nor to care for her uncertain gifts: but to dyspise
her as not able to give to any man honesty / diligence or other good and
virtuous exercises: nor able to deprive man again of the same gifts: after he
has obtained ye same. But on the other part if this mind of man / taken and
blinded with froward pleasurs be subdued unto slouthe and bodyly lusts: after
it has exercised and occupied such ieoperdous pleasure by a little season: and
after that by cowardous sloth / both the strength / the time and the wit ar
vanisshed away and decayed: than anon the infirmite and fel^ylnes of nature is
accused and put in blame. And thus / all such slothful doers tra^spose and
lay away the fault which in themself is culpable / unto the difficulte of such
besynesses / as they have omitted by negligence. But if it were so: that men
had as great cure and affeccion of things good and profitable / as they have
desire and pleasure in sekyng and following things contrary unto them and
nothing profitable ye: and also much perylous and hurtful: than should not they
be more ruled by ye chau^ces of fortune / than they should rule ye said
chau^ces. And thus should they attain and proceed unto so great excellence:
that where they be mortal of nature they should be made i^mortall by glory and
renowned fame. For in likewise as man is composed and made of.ii. things (that
is to say of the body and soul) right so all things / all besynesses and
exercises / to mankind belongyng / follows / some ye nature of the body: to
decay brefely and to be mortal: as it is / some other follow ye nature of the
soul / to be eternal and i^mortall: as it is. Which thing forther to prove by
example: we daily se that ye goodly beauty of ye visage and shape of mankind /
great abondau^ce of riches / and also the strength of the body / with all other
such things and semblable / decays and vanyssheth away within short time.
But co^trarely ye excellent and worthy acts: belongyng to man's wit: be
i^mortall and everlasting: as the soul is i^mortall. And finally in lykwyse as
ye beginning of ye gifts corperall or natural / and of the gifts of fortune
is caduke / vain and uncertain: right so is the end of ye same mutable and
tra^sitory. And all things which be borne and sprygyng: again decays and
approaches to death: and when these same be grown and increased to the hegth of
their perfeccion: again they begyne to decay and consume by age and debilite.
But the mind and soul being incorrupt / eternal and gouernoure of mankind
/ rules and weldeth all things: but it self can not be violently ruled nor
compelled by any thing erthly / co^syderyng the frewyll / which it optayneth
of his creator. For which consyderacion the froward iniquite of them is more
to be marueyled: which subdued to the joys and pleasures of the body / pass
forth the time of their life / in carnal lusts and ydelnes. But towchyng
their wit (which is the best gift and grettest treasure granted to mankind)
that suffer they to slomber and to sleep without exercise / in slouthe and
ydelnes: whose dulnes surely is somoche more to be blamed: namely sith so many
and diverse noble exercises and occupacions of the mind be: by whom most clear
nobles and fame undefiled may be optayned. But of such diverse exercises
concerning the mind some are better refused: than procured in troublous times
and inquiet. And namely in this time turbulent and season unquiet: great
offices / lordshyppes / rowmes to command and rule: and brefely to speak. All
manner cure concerning the administracion of things apparteynyng to the commen
well: seems unto me not at all to be couyted or desired of any wise man. For
neither is honor given unto virtue / as condign reward and worthy thereto
belongyng nether such as have gotten jurisdiction and honor / by ^^aude and
unlawful means (in like case) can not be more sure nor more honest / by mean
of such honor so unright wysly obtained. For certainly a man to rule his
country and kynred by might and violence: all if he have power so to do / and
also though he right wysly correct ye crimes of tra^sgressours and misdoers.
Nevertheless: so to do it is vnbehouefull and inexpedient. And often at
conclusion more perilous and dangerous: than it is sure or profitable / and
that namely / sith all mutacions of things / and chaunges of governors
pretend and thretten slaughter / of some exile or wylfull flight /
imprisonment with otherlyke cruelties more longyng to enemies of a common well
/ than to defe^ders of the same. Than forthermore: a man to labor to ye
uttermost of his power / and all in vain. And in weryenge himself to get
naught else but euylwyll and hatred: it is a point of extreme and utter madness /
except perchance it be such one / which has a dishonest / a foul and
perilous pleasure to cast away for naught his own worship and liberty for
pleasure of a few mighty men usurpers of dominion and lordshyp. But among all
other besinesse / which are exercised by man's wit / the redyng of hystories
and the reducyng of the same to memory: is much more necessary and profitable
to all degrees beryng rule of a common well / but most namely unto princes. Of
power / profet / and co^modite whereof: I purpose at this time to pass over with
silence / because many other authors have written of the same before my time.
And also that no man should suppose my self by pride or insole^ce: to bost
mine own study vainly laudyng ye same. But much contrary I believe rather yt
some envious maligners shall be herafter which shall object and ascribe a name of
sloth and negligence to this my labor. How great and profitable so ever it
be: and that because I have determined to lead my life solitarely: far from
medlyng with the common well. Certainly (as I suppose) they only shall impute
and ascribe such name to me and to this my labor: which thinks it a most
great and singular craft or practiced wisdom to win beniuolence / by
salutyng the common people / and by dyssimulate reverence done to every man
passing by them / or else to get favor by festyng and flateryng the commenty.
Which envious maligners: if they would consider both in what manner seasons
and in what ieopardous times I have obtained offices and rowmes of auctorite
and what men would gladly / and yet might not obtain such rowmes Moreover if
they call to mind what manner of men afterward came into the order of
senators For certain if my wyllers consider inediffere^tly these premises:
than shall they think that I have changed the purpose of my mind: more for
cause reasonable: and by good aduiseme^t / than for sloth and cowardice / and
they shall find / that more profet shall come to the commen wale by this my
study (which they count but ydelnes and time misspent) than of the labor and
besynes which other men take upon them fayntly and iniustly administryng the
commen well. And they shall find that my writing shall prove itself more
laudable and profitable to the co^mente / than their indiscreet governance.
For often have I herd of the famous princes Quintus Maximus / and Publius
Scipio / and beside these of many other right famous and worthy men of the
city of Rome / which when they beheld the images of their forefathers made of
stone / of wax / or of metal / and erect into hye trones in memorial of the
valiant and magnificent acts by them done for the commen well: the said
princes in aduisynge such images were wont to say unto such as stood nere by
them: that their minds were greatly kyndeled to virtue and nobles in
co^templyng of the same. The case is plain: yt such figures of metal / stone
/ or wax had not such operacion nor might within themself. But such high
courage and flame was kyndeled and increased in the hardy hertes of such noble
men and valiant warrious / by remembrance of the glorious deeds of their
forfathers in their life time / done and represe^ted to their memory by such
images / insomoche that this flame kyndled in their hertes to virtue could never
be slaked nor saciate in them / till time that they were equal with their
forefathers in virtue / fame / and glory. Than how much more ought the clear
descripcion of hystores to kyndell unto boldness and virtue / the minds of noble
men by redyng of the same. But much contrary / if we aduert the world as it
is now among all men which live / and conform themself to the manners used
now adays / where shall we find one: but that will strive and contend with
their forefathers to overcome them / other in couetise and superfluous riches /
or else in prodigalite and wastfull expenses / and not in honest and laudable
life / good excercices and diligence? And moreover gentylmen of ye first heed /
which were wont to prevent ancient noblemen and ascend unto virtue and nobles
/ by virtuous manners: such labor now to lordshyp / honor and authorite / by
fraud and falshode: rather than by very virtue or good means and laudable.
After such manner as if the office of a hye Judge / of a Tresourer / a Co^sull /
a Provost / and all such other great offices / were noble and excellent of
themself. And not in manner as if such offices should be counted of worthynes
and dignite: after as the virtue and honor is / of such as rule in the same
offices and hy rowmes. But plainly affirmyng the treuth: the man makes the
office noble and worshypfull: if his manners shine by virtue. But if his
conversation be contrary / no office / no rowme / can make him noble nor
worshypfull. But this omittynge I have proceeded in this prologue with over
far circu^staunce / and also with somewhat to much liberty of words / more
than in a preface is requisite: for that it pyteeth me of these tedious manners
of this our cite of Rome. But now will I come to my matter purposed / and
first interpryse begone.

Of what matter Salust intends to treat in process of this book / and what
causes moves him of such matter to write. The first chapter.
IN this warke I purpose to write of the war / which the Romans had and
executed against the tyranne Iugurth / wrongfully usurping the name of a king
/ over the land of Numidy. Many causes moves me by writynge to commend this
war to perpetual memory. First for that in the same was foughten at many
times with great multitude of men on either party / with much cruel murdre
and variable victory: the Romans sometime / sometime the Iugurthins preuaylyng
in victory. Forthermore because that first at this battle: and from thens
forward the commen people of Rome matched with the princes / resistynge their
pride. For where as before this time the noble men of Rome oppressed and
subdued the commens with unreasonable rigor / the commens elect one named
Marius a man of basse birth to be co^sull of Rome / and captain in this
battle: which after he had obtained victory over Iugurth with great glory /
triumph / and favor of the commontie / he supported them in such wise against
the noble men: that of the same rose a civil bataile and grievous discord /
between the noble men and co^mens of Rome: Marius maintenyng the co^mens party
/ and Silla susteyning ye party of the noble men. Insomoch yt finally between
these two perties and captayns of ye same was foughten an unkind / unnatural
/ and cruel batel: to ye grievous ruin of ye Romayne empire / and subuercion of
the common well. Which co^tencion and variaunce confounded both the laws of
god and man / and by the same were all good ordinances disordred. And this
same furious debate and folly proceeded at last to so unreasonable madness and
excecate fury / that it never desisted / nor this variaunce and discencion
between the noble men and commens never ceased: till time that cruel and
mortal battle foughten between both parties / and till time that also
destruction of the land of Italy compelled both parties at last to consider
their own blind folly and cruel furor: and so finally to mittigate and
fynisshe their debate and unreasonable dyssencion. But first or I begin to write
of this batell I shall repeat and declare a few things done before this war
began: to thentent that all things most chief / worthy and expedient to be
known / may be more evident / open / and clear / to the reders.

How the king Massinissa came into the favor of the Romans / and how the
land of Numydy was committed unto him. The second chapter.
THe Romans had three notable and famous batayls against the Carthagine^ces /
in which the same Romans had great damage. Howbeit in conclusion of every
battle they wanne victory of their enemies: in the second of these batayles
what time Hanyball duke and captain of the Carthagine^ces wasted the wealth and
riches of Italy more than any other ennemy had ever done before / after the
Romans began^e to have any great name and to delate their dominion: A famous
prince named Massinissa king of the land of Numydy was received into
frendshyppe and favor of the Romans: by one Publius Scipio captain of the
said Romans / which Scipio afterward for his manhood was named Scipio
Affrycan / because he overcame and subdued the land of Affrike. This
Massinissa so received into favor of the Romans in the foresaid battle did
many noble and famous acts of chyualry / with high valiantise and courage. For
which deeds: after the Romans had overcome ye Carthaginencis and their cite:
and after they had taken prisoner the king Sciphar / which had in Affrike a
worthy / great / and large impire the people of Rome gave freely unto the same
king Massinissa / all such cities and lands as they had taken and wone in
battle. For which benefits so magnifice^t and ample Massinissa continued unto
them in profitable and faithful frendshyp his life induryng: but at last his
life ended / and the wealth of his empire decayed also with him. This king
departing left behind him three sons: whose names were Micipsa / Manastabal /
and Galussa: of whom Micipsa succeeded his father / and alone obtained the
kingdom: after that this other two brethern Manastabal and Galussa / were
departed from this life by sickness. This Micipsa had two sons named
Adherball and Hiempsall. But Manastabal his brother which departed (as said
is) left behind him one son not laufully borne / but a bastard / begoten of
his co^cubine: wherefore departing he left him orbate without land or lyuelode.
This co^sydering Micipsa suffered him not to fault nor decay: but forasmoche as
he was his brothers son^e / received him into his court / and him cherysshed in
likewise as he did his own sons / Adherball and Hiempsall. This Iugurth
after that he was a little grown up to age: was mighty in strength comely /
and fair of face: but most of all / excellent of wit and wisdom. Nor he gave
not himself to be corrupt with lust nor incrafty slouthe: but as is the
custom and manner of the people of Numidy himself he exercised / sometime in
rydyng / sometime in castyng the dart and iustyng / and sometime in ronnyng and
wrestlyng / with his companyons of like age. And not withstanding / that in
laud and praise he passed all his perys: yet none envied him but he was derely
beloved / cherysshed / and lauded of all men. Moreover he passed much of his
time in huntyng of wild bestes which in that land habounded: he was the
first / or one among the first which durst assail and stryke the lion / and
other cruel and wild bestes: he did much: and little said or bosted of
himself. For such demeanor his uncle Micipsa at first beginning was glad
and ioyefull: supposing that in time to come the manly behauour and strength
of Iugurth should be glory and honor to all his kingdom. But afterward in
process of time when he co^sydred and understood his life approchynge fast to
end his natural sons young / and inexpert. And this young man Iugurth in
honor and favor daily encreasyng more and more he reuolued many things in
mind greatly moved with such solicitude and business. Forthermore he
consydred / that all men of kind be naturally inclined to desire / to rule /
and command by lordeshyppe: rather than to be ruled and subject. And how man
is prone and hedlynge inclined to fulfill the desyers of his mind dredynge no
dangers: nor suspectynge no peril / while he is e^cecate by ambicion and
desire of lordshyp. Moreover aduisyng the oportunite of his own age / and of
the age of his children which for yongh were not able to resyst any power or
violence: which oportunite is wont to be not small confort / audacite and
courage / not only to bold herres / but also to mean men and cowardes
intendyng to conspyre against their princes in hope of pray and promocions.
Such consyderacyons feared sore the mind of Micipsa / beside these his dread
and dolor was more augmented: when he beheld the favor and hertes of all his
subgettes of the land of Numidy utterly inclyned to Iugurth: wherefore to put
to death the same Iugurth by any gyle (as his purpose was to do) he drad most
of all: dowtyng list thereof might succeed between him and his subgettes some
insurrexion or battle. Micipsa compased on every side with these difficulties
/ was sore troubled in mind. And when he saw that another by strength nor gyle
he might distroy a man so well beloved of the commens / (as was Iugurth) at
last he devised an other way to ryd him: and that without danger or suspeccion
/ wherefore Micipsa aduertyng that Iugurth was ready of hand to stryke /
aue^^erous and much desirous of honor and laud of chyualry / he concluded
with himself to object him to danger and peril of war: and by that mean
to assay the fortune of battle. Now at the same season the Romans warred
against a cite of Hispayne named Numance: unto which war diverse kings to
the commens associate sent unto them socours against the same cite. Among
whom Micipsa also sent a fair company of horsemen and fotemen: over whom he
made Iugurth captain: and sent him forth with them into Hispayne / trustyng
that there he lightly should be overthrown and slain in battle: other in
showing his manhod and strength / or else by fyersnes and cruelty of his
enemies. But this thing for / tuned much contrary to his opinion. For Iugurth
was of mind and courage valiant and bold / and of wit quick and ready / so
that after he had parceyued the disposicion / behauour and manners of Publius
Scipio: at that time captain of the romans / and when he had consydred also
the manners of his enemies / he behaved himself in such wise with much labor
/ besynes and cure / in obeyng his captain with so good manner and often times
countryng his enemies without dread of peril. Insomoch that within short time
he came to so great fame and worship / that unto the romans he was
marvelous dear and well beloved / and of the Numantines drade as death: and
certainly / among the chefyst he was worthy and valiant in battle: and also
good of counsel / of wisdom pregnaunt and circumspect. Which two things be
much hard to be in one man both together: for wysdom is often wont to make men
a ferde and to dread many peryls because of providence. But boldness and
audacite causes men to be rasshe and folehardy / because of haut courage. But
his wisdom directed his strength / and his strength was obedient to wisdom.
Wherefore Scipio the captain did almost every ieopardous and wyghty thing by
hand and counsel of Iugurth: him countyng among his chief friends and daily
cherysshed him more and more and no marueyle / for there was no counsel / nor
interprise begone of Iugurth frustrate or in vain / but al came to good effect.
Beside these gifts above said he was curtes of mind lyberall / and of wit
right discrete and prudent: by which gifts he adjoined unto him many of ye
romans in familier frendeshyp. At that same season in the army of Rome were
right many new: and also ancient gentylmen / which set more by riches than
goodness or honest. At home in Rome were they sowers of dyscorde and debatfull
/ great in fame among the friends of the romans. But more famous by worship
and rowme / than by honest conversation. These kyndled the mind of Iugurth not
a little promisyng often times and saying to set his courage on fire: that if
the king Micipsa discessed the time should come that Iugurth alone should
enjoy the hole kingdom of Numidy without any partyner. For in him (they said)
was great virtue / great manhood / strength and audacite with wisdom / able to
govern such a kingdom: and nothing was so iniust and false but that might
be justified at Rome for gold / and all things were there to be sold by
couetyse of noble men.

How Publius Scipio counseled Iugurth at his departing after the cite of
Numance was dystroyed. The third chapter.
THus continued Iugurth in the romans army in Hispayne with great favor of ye
romans and namely of Scipio the captain: till at last the army of Rome had
distroyed the said cite of Numance. Than Publius Scipio concluded to return
again to Rome: and to congye and license such socours as were sent unto him
from other kings: among all other he called Iugurth unto him: and before the
multitude of all the army assembled / lauded and commended him magnificently
recitynge his glorious acts and manly deeds of chyualry. And after that
worthily and rychely rewarded him for his labors. This done: he conveyed him
into the captains tent: and there secretly warned him that he should continue
and worship the frendshyppe of the people of Rome rather hole together and
commenly / than privately leanyng to any singular rulers. Moreover adding
these monicions: that he should not rather reward and be liberal to a few
privately: than to a hole co^mente / saying that it was a perilous thing to bye
that: of a few persons: which belong unto many in commen. If he would
persevere and continue in so noble conditions as he had begone: he should
shortly come to great honor / glory and dignite royal / more than he would
desire. But if he would proceed and labor to ascend over hastily / than should
both he and his riches fall heedlynge to ruin and decay. After Scipio had said
these words with such like: he licensed Iugurth to depart / and sent him unto
his uncle Micipsa again into the land of Numidy with letters direct unto the
same king Micipsa: of which letters the tenure and sentence hereafter ensues:
and was such.

The sentence of the letter dyrect from Publius Scipio captain of the roman
army in Hispayne unto Micipsa king of Numidy. The fourth chapter.
PVblius Scipio captain of the romain army in Hispayne sends health and
salutacion to Micipsa king of Numidy friend and fellow of the empire of Rome.
The virtue / strength and noblenes of your neuewe Iugurth whom ye sent unto
our socours has been proved in this war of Numance / far excellent above
any other warrior of our retynue / which thing I know for certain is to your
great pleasure and gladness. For his worthy merytes he is right dear and well
beloved unto us. And we shall deuoyr us to the best of our power that he may be
like dear and well beloved of all the senators and people of Rome. I am surely
right ioyefull on your behalf of this your treasoure Iugurth: thau^cient amyte
between you and me: byndeth me to be glad of this your commodite. For
certaynely lo here have ye a man of Iugurth worthy to discende of such noble
stock as ye ar and as his grandfather Massinissa was in his days: whom he
follows in all points of virtue and magnanimite.

How the king Micipsa adopted Iugurth unto his son. The fyfte chapter.
WIth these letters of Scipio Iugurth returned into Numydy unto his uncle
Micipsa: where he was worthily and ioyefully received of the co^mentie. But
after that the king Micipsa understood by these letters of commendacion of the
captain Scipio: that the valiau^t and noble acts of Iugurth were true: which
long before he had hard by report of the commen fame: than what for the
nobles of Iugurthe and favor both of his deeds and commendacion of Scipio he
moved his mind changed from his foresaid purpose / and not forther intended
to oppress Iugurth by malice nor envy. But concluded to attempt to overcome
him with benefits and kyndnesse: to thentent that he so overcome / should not
in time to come find in his heart for pity to indommage him nor his heirs. And
soon after this purpose the same Micipsa adopted Iugurth unto his son: and
farthermore decreed and ordained in his testament that Iugurth should be one of
his heirs: and partener in possession of his kingdom together with his two
natural sons / Adherball and Hiempsall. But a few years after this
ordinance Micipsa what by age / what by sykenesse / drew nere unto his end
of life / and was consumed by age and disease: wherefore considering his death so
fast approchyng it is said that he called Iugurth before him and than before
many of his friends and kynsmen: also in presence of his two natural sons
Adherball and Hiempsall / he had to the same Iugurth such words as herafter
ensue and follow.

The exhortacion which the king Micipsa a little before his death had to
Iugurth. The sixth chapter.
MIdere son Iugurthe / I know it is not out of your remembrance: how after
that ye had lost your father my brother I charitably and louyngly received you
young and of tender age into my kingdom: what time ye were without riches /
without confort: and without any hope of confort or riches / but very lykely to
have been cast away. This did I / thynkyng that for these my benefits and
kyndnesse I should be unto you not less intyerly beloved than of mine own
natural children with my body begotten. Nor certainly this my has not
dysceyued me. For why to ouerpasse your other great / magnificent and excellent
deeds of you valyauntly done before: specially now last of all coming from the
war of Numance ye greatly adourned and inhaunced to honor and glory / both
of mine own person and this my kingdom. And where as the romans in fore
times were friends unto us: by your virtue and manly acts ye have establysshed
that amytie: and of friends made them much more friends. So that in Hispayne
the name and glory of our household by your manhood is renouate and renewed.
Thus finally: ye have overcome the envy of your ylwyllers only by your
glorious acts and valiau^t interprises: which is one of the most hardyest
things to be done among mankind and of most difficulty. Wherefore now my
son Iugurth: sithe it is so: that nature has nere concluded the end of my
life: I admonest charge and exhort you by the faith of your right hand: and by
the faith and fidelite which ye owe to this my kingdom I obtest and require
you / that ye love / mentayne and cherysshe these my two sons Adherball and
Hiempsall: which of kynred be nere to you / and by my benefit and kyndnes are
brethren unto you. Forthermore I exhort you that ye cou^tenat leferre and
more pleasure to acquaynt and co^ioyne unto you forayns or strangers / rather
than to retain such as be joined to you by natural blood and kynred. For
neither is a great army of men nor habundance of treasours: ye ch^fe socours or
defense of a kingdom: but much rather trusty and faithful friends: whom a
man can neither compelle^ by force of arms: nor yet bye with gold nor silver
to parseuer in steadfast amyte: but they be o^tayned and kept by kyndnesse /
good deeds / fidelite and faythfulnesse. But among all friends: who can be more
friendly and steadfast in amyte than brother to brother. Certainly none ought to
be more loving of natural inclinacion. Or what stranger shall ye find
faithful and trusty to you: if ye show yourselfe ennemy to your own kynsmen?
For sothe if ye co^tynue together honest / good and loving in agreeable concord
between yourselfe: thanne this kingdom which I commit and g^ue unto you
shall continue sure and steadfast: as it is now. But co^trarely if ye be ill
and disagreynge among yourselfe / ye shall in short season make it right poor
/ feeble and incertayne. For by love / peace and concord: small riches / small
lordshyppes / and generally all small things increase and multiply: by
discord the grettest things of the world decay and fall utterly to ruin.
But you my son Iugurthe because ye pass these mine other two natural son^es
in age and wisdom / therefore it seems you so much more than them: to make
such wise provision both for yourselfe and for them also that nothing happen
otherwise than well. For in every stryffe and debate: how be it he which is
myghtyer and rycher often suffers injury. Nevertheless it seems more that he
does wrong thanne suffers: because that he is more of power and might thanne
his feeble adversary. But ye my dear sons Adherball and Hiempsall se that ye
worship and love this Iugurth your worthy uncle. And bewarre that ye not
offend nor dysplease him: but follow his virtue and manly behauour. And do your
deuoir to the best of your power after his example behauynge yourselfe / so
discretely and so wisely that it be not hereafter reported by me / that I have
takenne unto me by adoption / better children thanne I have begotten. Thus
concluded the king Micipsa his words. How beit Iugurth well perceived the
kings words: but feigned and spoken against his heart: if any other remedy
might have been found: nevertheless he answered benygnely for the time / all if
he thought and reuoulued in his mind much otherwise / and contrary to his
humble and mylde answer.

How the king Micipsa departed from life / and of the first cause of
dissencion and discord between Iugurth / Adherball and Hiempsall. The.vii.
chapter.
Not long after the king Micipsa decessed whose death was dolourous and sore
bewailed of all his subgettes: but most of all to his natural sons it was to
be lamented: and not without great cause as the process of this history shall
afterward declare. But after the kings funeral exequies were magnificently
ended as apertayned to his state royal. The three princes that is to say
Adherball / Hiempsall / and Iugurth anon assembled to the intent to commen and
treat of busynesses of the royalme / concerning particion and separation of
the same: and all other things convenient. But when they should sytte and take
their places in order: Hiempsall youngest of the three was somwat fyers of nature
/ and disposed to statelynesse. And in mind long before this time he
disdayned the ignobilite of Iugurth / for asmoche as he was unlike unto them of
birth towchynge his mothers side / and a bastard borne: as is said before.
Wherefore he dysdayned that the same Iugurthe should have the place of most
honor among them / which were natural sons of a king / and also laufully
borne: and so in contempt of Iugurth he set him self down on the right hand
of his brother Adherball: to thyntent that Iugurthe should not sit in the
mids between them: which rowme the Numydyens count of most honor. And
afterward howbeit his brother Adherbal required him often to give place to
Iugurth because of his age: yet uneaths could be with much pain induce him
thereto: but at last fatygate by requests of his brother and of other noble
men of the realm: he changed his place and set him upon the other side with
countenance declaryng his mind not contented. And thus at last satte Iugurth
for his age in the mids between them both / as in place of most honor.
When the three princes were thus set and had communed of many things
concerning the adminystracion of the kingdom: among many and diverse other
things Iugurth said / that all the statutes and ordynaunces which the king
Micipsa had made five years before his death / ought of congruence to be
adnulled as of none effect. For in that season (as said he) his wit what for
age / what for syckenesse was feeble / dull and of small valor. And therefore
such things as he had in that space enacted were done without wisdom or
reason. When Hiempsall herd Iugurth thus speak: he answered / saying that
it pleased him right well that it should so be done. For within the same three
years (said he) our father Micipsa has adopted you to his son / and in his
testament ordained you to be partiner of his kingdom: which was the worst and
most unadvised deed that ever he did young or old. Wherefore Iugurth according
to your own ordinance this must first of all be adnulled and broken / which
done / my brother and I shall not greatly contend for the remenant. These
words of Hiempsall pearsed the heart of Iugurth more profou^dely thanne any man
there thought or suspected. Wherefore from that time forward: what for wrath
of these words / and for dread of loss of his porcyon of the kingdom / his
mind was in great trouble and anguysshe. In somoche that from thens forth: he
went about / ymagyned / ordained / and only reuoulued in his mind: by what
gyle or treason Hiempsall might be caught in his danger. But when his
purpose proceeded but slowly forward / consydrynge that the froward desire and
vnrefrenable appeti^e of his mind could not be mytigated nor pacyfied: he
concluded to bring his enterprise to effect by any manner means outher by preuy
treason and gyle: or else by euydent and open violence and force of arms. But
to return again where I left. In this first assemble of the three princes of
which I spoke before: it pleased them all that the treasours of king Micipsa
should be divided among them because of this dyssencion. And also that the
marches and bounds of each of their dominions / severally should be assigned
to each of them his portion. Wherefore the time was appointed and prefixed when
both should be done: but the time to depart the treasoures was sonner
assigned than to deuyde and limitte the bounds of their dominions. This
apoynteme^t made: the princes departed company: the mind of Iugurth not a
little inquyeted for the said check of Hiempsall: for which cause he awayted
his time to revenge him.

How Iugurth by treason murdered Hiempsall the younger son of king Micipsa.
The eight chapter.
When the three princes were departed in sonder: as I have said before: they
soiourned in sundry places / and that nere to the tower where the treasours
lay. Hiempsall drew him to a town named Thirmyda not far distant. In which
town he had a dwelling place: than as happened in the same town was a man of
the guard longing to Iugurth of his lord right derely beloved / and with him
greatly in favor. This servant of Iugurth was much conuersaunt and familyer
in the house of Hiempsall / when Iugurth by chance remembered this oportunite
to his myscheuous purpose: he called secretly unto him his said servant. And
after many words spoken to search his mind: at last by promise of large
rewards he induced him to consent to go as if ^t were to visyte the house of
Hiempsall: as he had often done before time: and by some means and craft to
counterfayte the kayes of the gates and bring them unto him. For the right
kayes: after the gates were locked: nyghly were delyuerd unto Hiempsall
himself: so might they not be vnmyssed the space of a night. When Iugurth had
induced the Numidian to consent to this deed: he promised himself wtin short
time after to come to the said lodgyng of Hiempsal what time ye case should
require: with great power of armed men. The Numydyan in short time performed
the commandment of Iugurth / insomoche that he brought unto him the
counterfayted kayes: as he had appointed. Iugurth hereof was glad in mind:
and anon prepared secretly a great company of armed men: whom he commanded
to bring unto him the heed of Hiempsall trenched from the body: and in
executynge of this deed he commanded them all to be ruled by the Numydyan
which had counterfayted the keys. This done the said Numydyan conuayed these
armed men preuyly by night into the house of Hiempsall / like as he was
infourmed by Iugurth. When this treatoure satellyte was entered with his company
and had broken into the inward edifices: diverse of them serched for the prince
Hiempsall: some murdered his servants as they lay slepynge in their beddys
suspectynge no such treason: some other a wakened with the dynne stert up and
met their enemies defending themself but all in vain: for they had no
leyser to arm themself. And therefore were they slain anon unarmed of men
armed and appointed to myschefe: when the treatours had long sought Hiempsall
and might not find him: than serched they more nerely every hyd corner / and
secret close places they brast open: all was full of dynne mengled with noise
and clamor: So much they sought and so nerely: that at last they found out
Hiempsall / hyd in the cotage of a poor seruyng woman to which place he had
fled at begynnyg of this affray: as a man astonyed for dread and ignorant of
the place. Anon as the Numidyans had found him they slew him without any
mercy. And as they were commanded cut of his heed and brought the same to
Iugurth: but shortly after: the fame of this cruel and tyrannous deed was
diuulgate and over spread all the lands of Affrike: Adherball and all they
which were under subieccion of Micepsa while he lived: were sore troubled and
abashed with fere for this tyrannous cruelty of Iugurth. The Numidyans anon
divided themself into two part^es. The most part drew and leaned to
Adherball / but such as were most manly and best to battle drew them to the
other party: and leaned to Iugurth. Wherefore he made ready as great an army as
he might ioynynge unto him and bryngyng under his subieccion the towns and
cities of Numidy: some by violence / and some other by their own volu^tary
will. In somoch that finally he kept under his subieccion and bondage the hole
land of Numidy. But not withstanding that Adherbal had sent ambassadors to
Rome: to certify the senators of ye death of his brother how cowardly he was
murdered / and also to inform them of his own miserable fortune and in what
case he was: nevertheless he made himself ready to fight with Iugurth as he
which had trust and confidence in multitude of his sowdyours assembled ready to
battle.

How Iugurth overcame Adherball in battle and put him to flight: how
Adherball fled to Rome to compain to the senators: and how Iugurthe
accloyed with rewards many of the rulers of Rome: by whose favor his cruelte
was defended. The.ix. chapter.
NOw had Iugurth assembled his host ready unto battle: not like in multitude
to the company of Adherbal: but as I said before much bolder better expert and
exercised in war. On the other party Adherball had his people ready appointed
/ and both the armies approached together. But when they joined battle / and
when it came to byckerynge: that the matter must be tried with strokes. Anon
Adherball was vanquesshed: and to save his life fled from the battle into a
province marchynge on the land of Numidy: and from thens with all have spedde
him unto Rome to complain his miserable fortune / and to require socours / as
I shall afterward declare. But than Iugurth when he had all the land of
Numydy at his pleasure / counseled with his friends of many things. At
conclusion: when he consydred by himself that he had slain Hiempsall and
chased Adherball out of his kingdom: when he was idle and at rest: he often
secretly reuoulued in mind his own cruelty: sore dredynge what punysshement
the Romans would ordain against the same. Nor against the ire and displeasure
of the Romans had he none other hope nor confort / save in the couetyse of the
noble men of Rome / and in thabundaunce of his treasours: wherewith he trusted
to corrupt the rulers of Rome to be favorable to him. This consydred within
few days after he sent to Rome ambassadors with much gold and silver to
whom he gave in commandment: that first of all they should satisfy his old
friends with rewards and money / and than to spare no gifts to get unto him
mo new friends. And brefely that they should not spare nor tarry to procure unto
him favorers and mainterners of his part: and all things for his advantage by
gifts and promysses. But after these ambassadors were come to Rome: according
to the commandment of their king: they gave and sent to his acquayntaunce and
friends / and to such as among the senators: at that time had most
authorite: large and great rewards. Insomoche that anon among them was so
great a change: that the marvelous envy / hatred and evil will: which they had
against Iugurthe was all changed into favor and grace among the noble men.
Of whom some were so induced by gifts received: and some other by hope of
brybes in time to come: that they went about among the senators from one to
one / labourynge and intretyng that at that season nothing should be extremely
nor grievously determined against Iugurth. Thus after the ambassadors of
Iugurth had confidence and trust enough in their cause they labored to have a
day appointed to apere in court. The day of appearance was granted as well to
them as to Adherball: to Adherball as playntife: and to the ambassadors as
defendentes for Iugurth: when the day assigned was come both the parties
appeared in court before the senators / than after audience granted /
Adherball began to speak under form following / for complaint and declaracion
of his injuries and oppression.

Here insueth the oracyon of Adherball: devised in form deliberatiue: in
which he exhorts the senators to command socours and aid to be assigned
unto him / proving the same to be profitable / honest and easy to the Romans
to do: profita: ble: that he might co^tynue a friend unto the empire of Rome:
honest: for his father and grandfather had so deserved: easy to be done: for
the Romans at that time had none other war else where. The.x. chapter.
Most dyscrete chosen fathers and noble senators: Micipsa my father at hour
of his death commanded me that I should think naught else of the land of
Numidy to apertayne to me: save only the rule and administracion of the same:
affirmynge that the title of possession and empire of the same belonged to you
and to the people of Rome. Moreover he gave me in commandment to do my
deuoyr: to be unto you seruiable above all things: both in place and in war.
And that I should count you unto me in place of kynsmen: and nerest friends of
alyaunce. Saying that if I so did: than by your amite and frendshyppe I should
find socours / riches / and defense of the kingdom of Numydy / and of me and
mine in all times of need: which precepts of my father: while I kest in mind
to observe: suddenly Iugurth the most cruel and cursed of all men whom the
ground susteyneth / dyspisyng your empire: has driven me from your kingdom
and from all my other goods of fortune: nothing regarding that I am neuew of
Massinissa / and by mine auncetry a fellow and friend of the empire and people
of Rome. But certainly worthy and chosen fathers: sith I am come to that misery
that necessite co^strayneth me to desire your aid and socours: I would much
rather that I might call for your help: for mine own merytes against you
done: than for the merits of my forefathers: and that by such means of mine
own deseruynge / your benefits and socours were due unto me / which would god
that I neded not at all: but if this your socours might so of you be desired by
my merits and deseruyng: than should I call boldly to you: and use your
socours of duty as mine auncetry have done in times passed. But now sith it
is so / that honest life and innocence: in this world fyndeth little surenesse
by themself without proteccion of some other. Moreover sith it was not in my
power to mitigate nor to withstand this tyrannous injury of Iugurth. Therefore
chosen fathers I am now fled unto you as to my chief refuge / coarted to
necessity to require your socours and constrained to put you to besynes and
charge: before I have done any pleasure or profet unto you: which thing grieved
me most of all / and is one of my gretest miseries. Right worthy senators
other kings have been received into yor frendshyppe and favor / after ye have
overcome them in battle / or else perceiving themself in danger and in
doubtful chau^ches of fortune: they have coueyted and desired your felowshyppe
and favor / rather for their own well than for yours. But much contrarely:
our forefathers and rote of our lynage Massinissa confederated himself with
the people of Rome in the second battle of Carthage: what time was more
faythfulnes to be trusted in them and their good will / than of wealth or riches
to be optayned of the romans / being at that time assailed with war on
every side: their riches and treasours consumed by often batayles. Thus it is
evident that our auncetry confederat not themself to your fellowship for their
own defense: in hope of riches: in hope of dominion: nor for any other private
profet / but only for favor and love which they had unto your empire.
Wherefore noble senators suffer not the progeny and branches of this stock to
be distroyed. Suffer not me which am neuewe of your trusty friend Massinissa
to ask of you help and socours in vain. But prudent fathers: if it were so
that I had none other cause to demand socours of you / save only this
miserable fortune wherewith I am oppressed: that I which was lately a king by
lineall dyscent: mighty of auncetry: excellent and clear of fame: habundau^t in
riches and of men of arms / and now dysformed by miserable calamite / poor
and nedy / so that I am constrained to seek help and socours of other men: if
I had none other matter whereof to complain / save this miserable fortune only.
Nevertheless it longs and is convenient to the magesty of the people of Rome
/ to prohibit and to withstand injury. And not to suffer ye kingdom or
dominion of any man to rise and increase by falshode and myscheuous tyranny.
And the right heirs against right / against justice / and against reason / to
be excluded from their true heritage. But verily I am excluded and cast forth
of that country / which the romans in time passed gave unto my forefathers:
out of the which country my father and grandfather accompanied with your army
and help: have chased ye king Siphax / and also the Carthaginences / both
most violent enmyes to the empire of Rome. Your benefits be spoiled fro me:
In this mine injury be ye dispysed. Woe is me miserable exulate: Alas my dear
father Micipsa / ar your good deeds and kyndnes anenst Iugurth come to this
point and conclusion: that he before all other should namely be dystroyer of
your lynage and children: whom ye have made fellow with your own son^es: and
also partyner of yor kingdom: alas: than shall our stock and household neruer
be quiet? Shall we always betossed and turned in effusion of blood / in battle
/ in exyle and in chasing from our country. While the Carthaginences raygned
in prosperity / we suffered and that pacie^tly / and not undeserved all cruelte
and vexacion For them were our ennemies on every side of us: our friends in
whom we should have found socour at time of need were far disioyned and
separate from us. Thus all our hope: all our trust was in our strength and
armor. But now after that pestilent dystruction of the Carthaginences is
chased and casten out of Affrike we continued a time joyful and quiet:
passing our life in peace and tra^quilite / for why we had no ennemy: except
paradue^ture for any injury done against you ye would commau^de us to take your
enmy for ours also / as reason and right required. But now suddenly and
unawarely to us: this Iugurth exalting himself by his intolerable audacite /
by cruelte and pride has first slain my brother and his own nere kynsmam
Hiempsall: and in augmentynge his myschefe has usurped to him as in pray my
brothers part and portion of the kingdom of Numydy / and after: seeing that he
might not take me like manner of train as he had done my brother / what time I
douted nothing less than any violence or battle in the kingdom which I
hold of you / he has chased me (as ye may se) out of your kingdom / and has
made me as an abject outlawe: chased from my country: and dwe^yng place /
oppressed with poverty / and laded with miseryes. In so much that I may be in
more suerty and save guard in any place of the world / than in my own natyfe
country and kingdom / which I hold of you. Forsothe worthy senators: I
have ever thought in like manner as I have oftentimes herd my father Micipsa
openly report with sadness: saying that they which should diligently co^tynue
in your frendshyp by their merits / must take great labors at many times upon
themself in your causes: but of all men they were most sure from injury of any
man: And sothely all my lynage has done asmoche as in them was at your
desires: And ever has been ready in all batayls and needs to assyst you.
Wherefore if ye follow the precepts of gratitude: if ye bear in remembrance
these merits of mine auncetry / it is both right and honesty that in this
mine extreme necessite / ye aid and socour me and restore me again to
quyetnes: while ye have none other busynesses in hand / which may be to you
i^pedime^t i^ this enterprise. Most discret fathers: more brefely and clerly
to declare unto you my complaint and my mysery: And also to certify your
excellence more plainly of mine unnatural and unkind kynsman Iugurth: and of
his cruelte. It is not unknown unto yor mageste: that my father Micipsa after
his departing: left behind him us two brethern his natural and laufull
son^es: supposyng that by his benefytes and merits Iugurth should be joined
with us / as third brother. But alas: much contrary the one of us is murdered by
this cruel Iugurth / blinded by insaciable ambicion and desire of dominion.
And I my self the second brother skarsly and with great difficulte have
escaped his cruel and unmercifully hands: what may I do? or whether shall I
rathest fle for confort unhappy exulate thus desolate and unfortunate as I am?
All the socours all ye comfort / of my stock and kynred is extinct by death my
grandfather Massinissa / and my father Micipsa: as necessite has constrained
them: have paid ye general tribute of nature: delivered from these mu^dayne
vexacio^s by natural death. My nere kynsman Iugurth: much otherwise than it be
came him to do: has cursedly bereft my brother of his life by tyranny and
myscheuous couetise of dominion: mine other kynsmen by co^sanguynite and
affinite: withal mine other friends by his cruelte ben also oppressed or put
to death / some by one means and some by other: some of him be taken captyue:
some put to shameful death of gybet / galous / or cross / with most cruel
tourment: some be casten to wild and rapinous beestes to be de^oured of them.
A few which ar left with their lives / are closed in dongyons and darkness:
passing their miserable lives with mournyng and waylyng more grievous than death.
Thus ^m I inuyroned with anguysshe on every side. But if it were so: that all
these socours which I have lost by cruelte of Iugurth: or if all things which
be turned to me: from prosperity to aduersite / remained to this hour hole
without detrime^t or damage like as they were in my best estate: yet certainly
noble senators: if any ill or mysfortune unprovided should happen unto me: I
durst be bold to call your aid and confort. Because it seems you to have
cure of right and wrong belongyng to every man: co^sydryng the excellent
magnitude and gretnes of your empire / and to suffer no virtue unrewarded nor
vice unpunished / and finally no wretch oppressed to continue undefended. But
now most of all sithe I am exulate from my natyf country / from the kingdom
which my father ruled under you: and from my own house and dwelling place /
also nedy and poor of all things belonging to mine estate / and alone
without company or defense: to whom or to what place may I resort: or in
whom may I call for aid or conforte in these my manyfolde miseries. Shall I
resort or call for socours of nations / or of kings adjacent and about the
land of Numydy: alas I should little prevail or naught at all. Sith all they
for your amyte joined with you: be mortal ennemyse to us and to our lynage:
may I resort to any country about us: but that I should find there many tokens
of cruelte of war: which my fathers have done in their times passed in your
causes. Whyther shall any of them which have been our old ennemis / have mercy
or co^passyon on us now in this our extremite. But finally most noble
senators / my father Micipsa thus ordered us at his departing: and gave us in
commandment that we should observe nor mentayne the frendshyppe of none other
king nor people / save only of the people of Rome: and that we should seek no
new fellowship / nor new confederacions or bonds of co^corde saying that in
your frendshyp and help: we should find great socours and aid and that
largely. But if it should fortune that ye wealth of this your empire should fall
into ruin or change from this excelle^ce (which the gods defend) than:
said he that we and our kingdom of necessite should also decay together with
you. But now lauded be the gods by whose help and favor / and by your own
strength and virtue: ye be at this time mighty and rich: all thing to you is
prosperous and to your commandment obeyng. Wherefore it is somoch more laufull
/ easy and convenient to you to take cure and charge in redressyng thin iuries
done to yor friends and fellows. I am only in dread and dout of this one
thing lest the frendshyp and singulier favor of Iugurth: not parfetly known
as he is worthy: do induce the minds of some to parcialite against Justice and
right. I here and understand that such labor withal their might for favor
of Iugurth going about from man to man / prayng and intreatyng with much
solicitude many of you a part by one and one / desirynge and requiryng you to
determine no thing against Iugurth while he is absent: and the matter and cause
not known perfetly: I here such persons corrupt with parcialite and favor
obiectyng secretly against me / and saying that I feign and ymagyn these words
to accuse Iugurth vndeseruyngly / and yt I feign to be chased forth of my land
by him: where as I might surely enough have remained within the kingdom of
Numidy. That would god I might se ones the cursed and unkind kynsman of mine
Iugurth / by whose unmercifully and cruel deeds I am casten in these miseries /
in such case: that he were faynyng the same things under like manner as I feign
them at this time: and would god I might ones se him as truly without faynyng
driven out of ye land of Numidy / as I am now chased from the same by his
cruelty: and would god yt at last other ye or else the immortal gods would so
care for ye busynesses and troubles of us miserable men in earth: that ye same
Iugurth which now bears himself proud of his sinful deeds showing himself
and countyng him noble only because he escapes vnpunyss^ed for his syn^e and
cruelte: might therefore suffer grievous punysshme^t wtall my miseries and other
myscheues and yls / acordyng to his deseruynge: for his unmercifully cruelte
showed against our father Micipsa / in murdryng of my dear brother Hiempsall /
and chasyng me forth of my natyfe country: thus oppressed with all miseries in
extreme necessite. O my brother my brother Hiempsall / most dear to my heart of
all creatures: howbeit now thy life is bereft the in thy flouryng youth /
long before thy natural hour of death: and yt by cruelte of him / whom it
seemed not of all men so to have done: nevertheless me thinks in my mind this
chance of thy death more to be joined of: than to be sorowed. For thou have not
only lost thy life and thy kingdom: but also thou have escaped this chasynge
/ this flight / this exyle / this need / this poverty withal other
wretchednesses and miseries / which oppresses me without comfort or socours.
But I unhappy and miserable exulate thus thrown down from my fathers kingdom
into so many yls and so great myseries / may welbe an example and spectacle to
al ye world of the mutable courses wherein fortune turns mankind. O my dear
brother uncertain am I what I do: whyther I thus distitute of socour and aid:
may persecute and reueng thy injuries and thy death / or else whether I may
provide and seek socours for recoueryng of the land of Numidy. I am in that
case: that my life and death depends in the socour of other men. Would god I
were deed out of hand: if death might be an honest conclusion of these my
miserable misfortunes: rather than to be counted as content and pleased to live
in rebuke and shame / as an exulate weryed and ouercom with injuries: and
gyueng place to the iniust cruelte of tyrannous persecucion / and as not able
nor bold to resist the same. But now certainly it is against my will that I
live / for in my life I have no lyking nor pleasure / and yet can I not dye
without dishonor. Wherefore most prudent fathers and noble senators: these
premises consydred: I obtest and humbly require you: in honor of the gods
immortal: for thauncie^t amyte between you and my forefathers: for the
natural love which ye have against your children and parents and by the
mageste of the people of Rome: and this your most excellent empire: have pity
of my manyfolde calamitees and socour this my misery. Resist this tyrannous
dealyng and injury of Iugurth committed not only against my wretched person:
but also against you and your empire. Suffer not the kingdom of Numidy: which
is your own: to decay and be distroyed by cruel tyranny of Iugurth / and by
the effusion of blood and murdre of the lineage of Massinissa / sometime most
faithful and constant friend of this your empire.

How the ambassadors of Iugurth replied against these words of Adherball:
and what dyreccion was taken for both parties of the senators of Rome.
The.xi. chapter.
AFter that Adherball / in form above written had ended his complaynt: anon
the ambassadors of Iugurth arose and answered brefely in few words: as they
which had more trust and confidence in their great gifts given before to many
of the rulers of Rome: than in any right of their cause and thus they replied
in effect: saying before the senators that Hiempsall was slain of the
Numidyans for his own hastines and cruelte / and not by knowledge of Iugurth:
and as touching Adherball: he began war against Iugurth of his own froward
mind without any occasion: but after he was overcome in battle / because he
was not able to reueng him self / nor to make his party good / he fled unto
Rome to complain him to the senators of Iugurth: where as all ye fault was in
himself and in none other / concerning the party of Iugurth: they required
the senators in his behalf in his absence to count him none other / than he
was proved and known in the war of Numance: and that they would not set more
by the words of his ennemy / than by his deeds magnificently proved. This
said: anon after: both parties deperted in sonder from the court. Immediately
the senators took counsel what best was to be done in the cause. The
favorers of Iugurth and of his ambassadors / and more over a great part of
the senators were corrupt before by parcialite / favor / and rewards of
Iugurth / and so deprauat: that they contemned and set at naught ye words of
Adherball / exaltyng and co^mendyng the manhood of Iugurth: with laud / favor
/ countenance / voice / and all other signs: And so finally they labored by
all manner of means for an others myscheuous vice and cruel crime to defend
the same: as if it had been in defense of their own honor / worship / and
honest. But on the other part were a few other / which set more by justice
and honest / than by false gotten riches: these counseled to socour Adherball
and sharply to punysshe and revenge the death of Hie^psal. But among all other
of this opinion: was one named Emilius Scaurus a man of noble birth ready to
disturb every busynes / debatful and besy: desirous of power / of authorite /
of honor and of riches: but crafty in clokyng of these his fautes. After this
Emilius Scaurus saw his gyueng of brybes of Iugurth so shamfully and openly
known: he fered l^st ye corrupcion of the senators and heed rulers of Rome
might inge^der envy / debate and slaughter between them and the co^mens / like
as in such cases often had fortuned i^ times before. Wherefore in this
co^sideracion / he refrayned his mind at this time from his accustomed
unlawful lusts. Nevertheless among ye senators in this counsel the worst part
prevailed: and yt part which set more by favor and rewards than by right and
equite / ouercam ye other part / which lab^ured to sustain ye right without any
favor or parcialite. And so the favorers of Iugurth optayned their purpose /
and his cruelte had no punysshme^t. Nevertheless it was concluded and decreed
that.x. ambassadors should be sent into Numidy to divide ye kingdom which
longed to Micipsa between Iugurth and Adherbal. The principal of this embassade
was one named Lucius Opimius a man of noble fame / of great authorite and power
among the senators in those days: what time Caius Gracchus and Marcus Fuluius
great favorers of the co^mens: were slain of the noble men of Rome for ye
same cause: After victory of the noble men against the co^mens and the same two
princes: this Lucius Opimius enraged grievously with rigorous and sharp
inquisicions and examinacio^s against the poor co^mente: And was one of the
chief oppressers of them. What time this Lucius Opimius with his company was come
to Numidy: Iugurth prepared to attempt his old crafts: And howbeit he had
found the same Lucius for one of his ennemies at Rome / nevertheless he
received him worshypfully and with great diligence. And with gyueng and promisyng
many things he brought his purpose so to effect / that this Lucius at
conclusion preferred the favor and profet of Iugurth before his own good name
and fidelite: and brefely: before all things belongyng to himself. This
brought to pass: anon he went in hand with the other of ye ambassadors after
the same way: and many of the^ he wan and ouerca^e with gifts. very few of
them were which set more by their faith and treuth than by money and rewards
of Iugurth. Wherefore wha^ it was come to limitacion and separacion of the land
of Numidy / between Adherball and Iugurth as the said ambassadors were
commanded of the senators: that part of the kingdom which marched toward
Mauritany / or the land of the Mauriens being most opulent and plentyfull of
fruitful fyldes and of men / was given to Iugurth: but the other part / which
was more pleasant than profitable as ornate without hauyn towns and fair
edifyces: was committed to possession of Adherball.

Now for asmoche as in this hystory before and most of all in sequel and
process of the same / has and shall be made mention of many places and towns
of Affrike: to the intent that thystory may be more clear and evident / me
thinks it requisite and convenient brefely to describe the sytuacion of
Affrike: and a little to touch those peoples and countries / which with the
romans had at any time amite or frenshyp / other peace or war. But such
places and nations which for heat and wyldernes be little frequented of people
/ or not inhabited: of them it is not easy to describe nor declare the truth:
for by difficulte of the places / few or none resorteth thither perfetly to
know the same. But the other parts frequented of people I shall as brefely
declare as can be touched.

The descripcion of the habitable parties of the country of Affrike / namely
of such nations as had amyte or war with the Romans. The.xii. chapter.
IN division of the circle of the world the opinion of most writers is: that
it is divided into three parts / Europe / Asy / and Affrike. A few other
authors hold opinion: that it is divided only into two parts / that is to
say Asy and Europe: so that under climate of ye part which is called Europe:
the third part named Affrike is co^prehe^ded. But this last opinion is leest
allowed. This country of Affrike has his bonds on the sea of Italy on the
West part / and on the occean see it abordeth partly on the same side: on the
Est part thereof is a declinyng and pendant valey tyght ample and large.
Thinhabytau^tes of this valey call it Cathabathmon in their affrike langage:
that is to say in englyssh / a dependa^t valey. On this Est side: the sea is
outragyous / cruel / perilous and without any sure haven: but the fyldes and
soil on this part ar plentyfull of corn / and for all manner beestes is good
pasture / but the soil is not apt to trees beryng fruit: of water is scarcite
/ both of rain water / and of water springyng of the earth. The disposicion of
the people is wholesome of body / swyft / and may well endure labor. Insomoche
that the most part dye for extreme age / save such as be slain with wepyn / or
devoured of wild beestes. For it is not often seen ye corruption of humors
ingendring any infirmite brings to death. In this country be also many
rauynous beestes and of diverse kinds / devouring all thing which they may
overcome. But this omityng I will now brefely declare what manner people first
of all inhabited this country of Affrike / and what people thither resorted to
inhabit next after them. And how the same peoples were myngled together.
Howebeit that which I shall write is much diverse from the commen fame and
opinion of many men: nevertheless / I shall follow the books written in Affrike
langage / which (as it is said) belonged to the young prince Hiempsall: whom
Iugurth murdered: of the same books I shall follow the true interpretacion in
this matter / and like as the inhabitauntes of the same country afferme to be
true. But touching the very credence of the treuth of the matter I report that
to the authors.

The first people which inhabited the country of Affrike were named Getulians
and Lybea^s / a people hard / sharp and vnmanerd. These lived of flesh of
wyld beestes / and fed upon ye ground as beestes unreasonable. And were not
ruled by any manners / but lived without lord or laws / as vagabu^des and rouers.
They had no certain byding places / but where as ye night took the^: there they
rested for ye time. But after yt Hercules dyed in Hispayne / as the Affrica^s
say: his army which was assembled of diverse nations / when their captain and
heed was lost: dispersed themself abroad anon after his death / and came to
diverse places of the world to seek their fortune / where they might obtain
any habitacion or lordshyppe. Of which company / the Medeans / Perseans / and
Armenyans arrived with their ships in that coost of Affrike / which was
nerest to the empire of Rome / and long time after occupied those costs. But
the Persyans inhabited themself more inward in the country toward the
occean see: and instead of houses they turned their ships botomes upward
and dwelled under the same. And no maruayle / for in the country about them
grew no timber nor other stuff mete for building / nor of the Spanyardes
which inhabited next to them / neither might they bye nor borowe. For the sea
was so great and tempestous between them / and their langages so diverse and
unknown to either people / that by these two i^pedime^tes they were let
from the cors of marcha^dise or excha^ges between the^. These Persiens by mean
of marriages by little and little mengled the Getulyans with them / and because
they proved oftentimes the co^modite of their ground and feldes by often
co^mutacions and chaungynges one with other / at last they named themself
Numidya^s / that is to say herdmen divided. And to this present day the
cotages or tylmens houses be made long with crooked sides or couertures bowyng
inward as if they were helyes of ships tra^suersed or turned up set down.
Towchyng ye Medeans and Armenyns they joined themself with the Libye^s. For
these Medeans and Armenie^s dwelled before more nere to the sea of Affrike. The
Getulyans inhabited more nere to ye son^e rising: not far from the fervent
country of Inde and this people anon had rowmes and dwelling places / for the sea between them and Hispayne was but narowe / wherefore they agreed with the
Hispaniardes to make exchanges and bartynges of marcha^dyse with them. The
Lybiens corrupted their name by little and little changyng the same / and at
last instead of Medyans named themself Maurie^s by barbarike pronunciacion of
their langage. But the wealth and riches of the Persiens in short time increased
and multiplied. In somoch that after they had named themself Numidyans / they
increased in so great multitude: that their first country was not able to
norysshe them all: So that afterward many of the young and lusty people
departed in sonder from their friends and last their country / resorting to a
country nere the cite of Carthage / vacant at that time: In which country
the inhabited them self and named it Numidy after their name. Shortly after
this: both they which remained still in their first country and these which
removed thens / assisted one an other withal manner of help and socours.
Insomoche that what by strength and what by fear they brought under their
subieccion and dominion such other nations as marched nere them: so that
within short time they much inhaunced and augmented their name and glory /
but most namely they which inhabited that part of Affrike / which is over
against Italy and nere the Italyan see / these most increased in wealth and
honor. For the Lybiens were not so good men of war as the Getulians or
Numydyans. And so all the inward part of Affrike was for the most part in
possession of the Numidyans / and so much did they: that all the nations of
them subdued were called Numidyans after the name of ouercomers. Now have we
declared how the Getulians and Lybia^s were first inhabitau^tes of Affrike:
and how the Perseans / Medeans / and Armenyens came afterward and joined with
them. How the Perseans named themself Numidyans. And the Medeans and
Armenyens by corrupcion of langage were called Mauriens.

And now consequently I shall declare what other people came afterward and
inhabited the same land of Affrike. After all these nations before rehearsed:
out of ye land of Phenyce came much people to inhabit themself in Affrike.
Some because their own country was not sufficient to sustain so great a
multitude as were of them. And other some great men of birth and desirous of
lordshyp raised up and assembled the nedy common people and left their own
country: in hope to find some other greater dominion else where / and in
process of time aryued at ye land of Affrike: and there builded three cities
upon the sea coost named Hippona / Adrumentum and Leptis: with other diverse
cities: but not so great and famous as these were. These cities in short time
were so augme^ted and increased that some of them were honor / and some
socoure and aid to their original countries. But of the cite of Carthage
which also by them was builded / and afterward became the heed cite of
Affrike: me think it is better to pass over with scilence: than of it to speak
a little and than to leave the matter in the mids vnparfet / and also this my
busynes proceeds to an other purpose. Nevertheless somewhat shall I touch the
first foundation of this cite of Carthage / not following mine author Salust:
which writes nothing thereof: but following the opinion of Vergil as he
writes in the first book of Eneas. The queen Dydo daughter of Belus king of
the land of Cypre and wife to Sycheus king of Phenyce: fled with her ships
laded with gold and other riches out of her own country: dredyng ye cruelte
of her brother Pygmalion: which blinded by couetyse and ambicyon had slain her
husband Sicheus by treason. This Dido at last aryued wit her ships and
company at the coost of Affricke / where rayned a king named Hierbas: which
moved with beauty of Dido desired her to wife. But for love which she had to
her first husband Sicheus she would not consent thereto by any means: but
desired to bye of the same king Hierbas as much ground as might be compassed
about with hyde of a bull. And after that it was granted / she cut the hyde of
a bull so small / that with the same she compassed three mile of ground in
compass. In which space and circuit she bylded a cite: which first was named
Byrsa. After in process of time it was called Tyros: and last of all Carthage /
under which name by long continuance so amply it increased in fame and wealth:
that it contained.xxiiii. miles in compass. But when it was in most excellence
it was utterly distroied by the romans Publius Scipio Affricane that time
being captain of the romayne army. Touching the foundation of this famous
cite of Carthage / somoche have I written more than mine author Salust. But
now will I return to mine institute and purpose concerning the dyscripcion of
Affrike / and brefely bring it to conclusion. The valey of whom I spoke before
named in Affrike la^gage Cathabathmon / divided the country of Affrike from
Egypt on that side save that an arm of the sea is between the first cite or
habitacion of Affrike toward this valey / and is called Cyrene. And nere to
the same be other two cites / the one named Tolonia / ye other Thercon: beyond
these three cities be two quicksa^des / and between both ye sa^des a cite named
Leptis. Beyond this cite of Leptis / is a place named of the romans Phylenorum
are in english: the auters of two brethren called Philenis / because these
two brethern suffered themself to be quick buried in the same place for the
common well of their country: whereof thy story herafter shall be written at more
oportunite. This place divides the dominion of Carthage from Egypt on that
side. After this place on the side costs be other cities belonging to the
dominyon of Punike. All the places from thens forth to Mauritany or land of
the Mauriens / be under subieccion of the Numydyans. The Mauriens have their
habytacyon nere to Hispayne. But as we read: the Getulyans have their
habitacion beyond the Numidya^s: some in poor lodgys: and some other more
vylely without habitacion wandrynge as vagabu^des. Beyond these Getulyans is
the land of Ethyope: and from thens forth be countries so brent with fervor
of the son that they be inhabitable. But during this war between the
romans and Iugurth: the romans had in their possession many towns of Punike
and much of the costs of thempyre of Carthage: and ruled the same by officers
under them thereto assigned. A great part of Numydy and of the Getulyans unto a
flodde named Mulucham: was under the dominion of Iugurth. Over all the Maurians
raygned one king named Bocchus: of whom the romans had no knowledge save of
his name only. And before this battle: he was another in peace nor in war
acquaynted / nor known of the romans. Of Affrike and of thinhabitau^tes of
the same: enough is spoken and as much as is requysite of necessite to the
process of this hystory. Now will I make regression and prosecute my first
purposed matter insuyng mine author Salust.

How Iugurth invaded the kingdom of Adherball yet ones again: and how
Adherball again was overcome in battle: and put to flight. The.xiii. chapter.
AFter the ambassadors of Rome: of whom I have spoken before: had divided the
realm of Numidy between Adherball and Iugurth / and were departed out of
Affrike toward Rome: anon Iugurth reuoulued in mind how he had escaped
unpunished for his cruelty otherwise tha^ his mind feared before: And how instead of punysshement: for his syn^e: he was rewarded with ye better part of
the land of Numidy. Now he consydred that all was true which his friends had
told him before while he was in Hispayne with the romayne army in the war of
Numance: that is to say. That nothing was so false and iniust: but that might
be justified at Rome for money / for all thing might be bought therefore money.
This consideracion inhaunced his mind unto esperance and that not a little.
Forthermore he was inflamed with the large promesses of them: whom he had
acloyed before with gifts and rewards at Rome: In somoche that again of new
he fixed his mind to invade and usurp the kingdom of Adherball / and by some
point of prodicion to take him in trap as he had done Hiempsall his brother.
This Iugurth was fires / sharp / and apt to war well inured with the same and
expert i^ feats thereof: but co^trarely Adherbal: whom he assailed and
pursued: was a mete man and oportune to take injury / more ferefull and dredyng
other / than to be drad of other. Wherefore suddenly / and without any provision
on party of Adherball: Iugurth invaded the marches of his kingdom / with a
great power and multitude of men of arms / many of thinhabitantes he murdered /
and many took he prisoners with beestes and all other manner of prays / robbyng
and spoiling every where: as far as his army dispersed / towns / castles and
other edifyces he brent and beat down: and many other places he assailed and
invaded more inwardly in the country by excourses of his horsemen. This done
he returned into his country with all his multitude / prays and prisoners:
supposing that Adherball moved with anger and displeasure would revenge these
injuries / and that thing should be cause and occasion of open war between
them. But Adherball advised himself well: by remembrance of his first battle
had with Iugurth that he was not able to contend with him in battle nor with
force of arms: and more over ^ he had more confidence and trust in frendshyp
of the Romans / than in the inconsta^t Numidyans / which leaned more to his
ennemy than to him. These things consydred: he send ambassadors to Iugurth to
complain of these injuries: But these ambassadors had naught else of him but
contumelious / proud and hasty words. And so despised of Iugurth returned
again to their lord Adherball: though such answers might have moved any
coragious heart: nevertheless Adherball determined in mind: to suffer all
things and to take many injuries patiently: rather than again to begin battle
with Iugurth. For (as said is) the battle foughten before between them was
both to dishonor and also great damage. But for all this suffrance of
Adherball: the mind of Iugurth was not more pacified / nor lessed of his
cruelte. The patience of Adherball abated not the Ire of Iugurth: but it
augme^ted: For all ready he had concluded in mind to invade ye hole kyngdo^e of
Numidy. Therefore he began again of new: not as before with a company of reuers
/ but with a mighty and great army assembled together demeanyng open war / and
chalangyng openly the hole empire of Numidy / and with such power proceeded into
the land of Adherball: wastyng the towns and fyldes on every side / dryuing
away prays of catell and other riches: and increasyng courage to his men / and
dread to his ennemis. When Adherball saw it was come to that point that he
must needs other abandon and give over his kingdom / or else maintain it with
force of arms / as he which was constrained by extreme necessite: he assembled
and empareyled an army as well as he might / and with the same proceeded forth to
mete Iugurth. At last the two hoostes of Adherball and of Iugurth approached and
rested nere together / beside a town named Cirtha / not far distant from the
seecoost / and for asmoch as the day drew nere to night: the battle was not
anon begone: but either party remained in their tents. Anon after much of the
night was ouerpassed / and the star light somewhat dymmed with obscurite of
clouds. The soudiours of Iugurth raised by the sound of tru^pettes unwarily
and suddenly invaded and assailed the tents and field of Adherball: some they
murdered half slepynge: and some other they flewe while they were in hand to
arm themself. On part of Adherball was petefull murdre: and on side of
Iugurth no mercy / but abstinat persecucion and vengeance: and so fiersly
fought Iugurth and his company that shortly Adherbal fled to the town of
Cirtha / aco^panyed with a few horsemen. But Iugurth pursued him so nerely /
that if the inhabitants of the town of Cirtha in have and with great
multitude had not received Adherball / and with force of arms defended the
walls / and kept forth the soudyours of Iugurth which persued Adherball: the
battle between them both should have begone and ended that one same day / and
that to destruction of Adherball. But Iugurth perceyuyng the enter into the
town denied to him / anon beseged it on every side with all manner ingynes
inuasyue to his ennemies / and defensive to his company: he caused hastily to
be framed large pauayses and towers of tymbre to be driven upon whelis toward
the walls of the town. And with these and all manner other ingynes went in
hand fiersly to assail the town: and somoch more hastily he sped him / to
thinte^t to bring his purpose to effect / before any ambassadors should come
from Rome to resyst his enterprise. For asmoche as before this battle he had
herd that Adherball had send ambassadors to Rome to certify the senators of
his miserable state.

How the favorers of Iugurth at Rome labored so in his cause / that three
young men inexpert and without policy were send ambassadors into Affrike to cesse
this strife between the two kings: and how these ambassadors returned to
Rome without any thing done The.xiiii. chapter.
But after the senators at Rome herd tidings of this battle / they send into
Affrike three young gentylmen in embassade / co^maundyng them to go to both the
kings / and to command them in behalf of the senators and of the hole
people of Rome to cesse their war / and to show them that the senate and
Romans wylled and utterly commanded them so to do. And so doing / they should
do as it seemed them: and as of co^gruence they ought to do both for pleasure of
the Romans and for their own honor and profet. The ambassadors with such
commandment hasted them and came unto Affrike / the senators had commanded
them to make somoche more expedicion in their journey / because tidings were
brought to Rome / when these ambassadors prepared themself forward: how the
battle was done between Adherball and Iugurth / and how Iugurth kept Adherball
beseged straytly within the town of Cirtha. But this rumor was somewhat alayed
and kept secret by favorers of Iugurth / after these ambassadors were come to
Numidy: they expressed to Iugurth theffect of their embassade / in form as the
senators had commanded them. When Iugurth understood the pleasur of the
senators by their words and embassade: he answered benignely / saying that he
counted no erthly thing more great / nor excellent / nor more dear unto him
than the authorite of the senators and people of Rome / and that from his
yougth to that time he had ever so endeavored to order himself that every good
and worshypfull man commended and allowed him for his virtue and manhood / and
not for malice nor mysdemeanour. And for the same manlynes and not for
malicious deeds / nor for disordred manners his company and conversation was
accept and pleasour unto the right high and worthy captain Publius Scipio.
Moreover: for the same co^uersacion and good manners and not for fault of
children natural / his uncle Micipsa had adopted him for his son^e: and made
him inheritour of his kingdom / partiner with his own natural sons: and for
asmoch as he had demeaned himself right well and worthily / in executynge of
many high and glorious interprises: somoch the less could he suffer injury
done unto him unrevenged. As touching Adherball Iugurth alleged for himself
that this Adherball by gyle and treason lay in wayt to slay him: which thing
perceived: he made resystence against the same to the best of his power / as
any man was bound to do for sauegard of his own life. And if the romans
would prohybit and deny that unto him / which Justice permytted to every man
(that is / with violence to resyst and repel violence) than should they
neither do well nor right wisely in that behalf. When Iugurth had answered the
ambassadors after this manner: than said he for conclusion that shortly after
he would send ambassadors to certify the senators of all other things
concerning this busynes: and on this point Iugurth and the ambassadors
departed in sonder. Thus Adherball (...) had no confort nor license to reply
against the words of Iugurth / nor sight or co^municacion with the
ambassadors: all only was it granted unto him to appelle to ye court of Rome
/ for of these ambassadors could he have / no justice / nor dyreccion / in his
injuries and persecucion. When Iugurth thought that thembassadours were passed
forth of Affrike / toward Rome / and when he saw yt with force of arms he
coud not win the town of Cirtha / because of natural sytuacion and
difficulte of the place. Anon he besiged the town again of new and all
difficultes not withsta^dyng / he made a profounde and deep trench round about
the town with sharp stakes and payles stycked on highest part of the same
trenches with sharp pykes on their upper ends. This did Iugurth for many
co^syderacions: first to the intent that the inhabita^tes should not break forth
of the town suddenly at any side upon any part of his soudyours which besiged
them. Secondly to the intent yt on no part any vitayles should be brought into
them. Thirdly that the men of war within the town should not thrust forth
without ye town the multitude of poor commens in time of famyne and scarcite
of vitayls. And fourthly: that no socours should enter into them to rescue the
town nor to supply their garyson. When this trenche was made and fynisshed
Iugurth moreover made strong bulwarks and towers of timber without the town /
and strengthed the same with garyson of wight and bold men of arms. Bysyde
all these ordinances he left nothing unassayed / another spared he to attempt
every thing by strength nor by treason and gyle. Sometime he proved ye watchmen
and defenders of ye walls with gifts excityng them to betray the town. When
his rewards auayled naught than he thretned them with fires and sharp words:
he inhaunced by exortacions the minds and courages of his own men to manlynes
and audacite. And so he aplyed his business that nothing he omytted wont or
possible to be done in such a case / nor no ingyne of war laft he unprovided
which i^ those days was co^triued or found: but rather beside all old
inuencyons he ymagined and devised new ingynes and ordinances of war not
seen before that time / and all for distruccion of the town of Cirtha / and of
Adherball whom he besyged within the same. But what time Adherball consydred
his fortune come to extremite on all parts / he kest many things in mind. On
the one side he perceived his ennemy Iugurth violent against him / and no trust
of comfort of socours. On the other side he co^sydred well / that for penury
and want of soudyours and other things necessary he was not able another to
fight with his ennemy / nor to drive forth or prolong the battle: and for
fault of vytayle he might not long defend the town. These things with many
mo well reuoulued in mind / he chose forth two which were most diligent and
trusty of that company which had fled with him into Cirtha. To them he woefully
be wayled his misfortune: and made so large promysses of rewards unto them:
that at last he induced them to go forth of the town by night privily / and
if they might escape their ennemis / to resort to the next hauyn town: and
from thens to have them to Rome with letters which he had devised and written
to be delyuerd to the senators. These messangers were trusty and faithful /
within few days without any dysturbance: they fulfilled the commandment of
their soueraygne / and delyuerd the letters of Adherball unto the senators.
Which letters anon were read in the counselhous before the senators and
rulers of Rome: of which letters the sentence hereafter insueth and was such.

The sentence of the letters sent from Adherball unto the senators of Rome:
what time he lay beseged by Iugurth within the town of Cirtha. The.xv. chapter.
Most worthy fathers it is not througth my fault that I send so often to you
requiryng your socours / and co^playnyng mine iniuryes: but the violence and
rygour of Iugurth / co^pelleth me thereto. Whose mind is filled with so great a
lust and desire to beraue my life: yt neither has he in mind the dread of
gods punysshme^t / nor fear of your displeasur. My blood he coueyteth more
than all things: In somoche that now is the.v. month since I am kept closed /
and besiged with armed men / by tyranny of Iugurth. He nothing regardyng that I
am co^federate fellow and friend of the people of Rome. Neither can prevail
nor help ye great benefits of my fader Micipsa done to this Iugurth / nor
your authorite nor ordynaunces or decrees. I am uncertain whyther I am
constraned and oppressed more grievously by force of arms or by hunger / for
both inuolueth me on all sides / I would write unto you much more touching the
tyrannous cruelte of Iugurth but my miserable fortune moves me contrary: and
moreover I have often perceived before this time: that small credence is given
to such as ar oppressed with misery: Save this I perceive clearly that the
mind of Iugurth coueyteth greater thing than my death or kingdom. And if by
your sufferance: he shall subdue me and beraue me kingdom / at last he shall
rise and rebel against your empire. Wherefore if ye list not to defend and
socour my life: at leest: defend your kingdom of Numidy / and prevent the
usurper of your empire. Suffer not this tyran to enjoy the kingdom of Numidy
/ and your good will withal. But truly ye may well perceive that he looks not
after your favor / after he shall have usurped the realm of Numidy. But whyder
he sets less by loss of your frenshyp and favor / or of the dominion of
Numidy: none is so blind but that may evidently perceive the troth. For his
deeds declare: that he counts less grievous to have your high displeasur /
than to lose his fires purpose to fle me / and than to ocupy the hole land of
Numidy. For this has he proved and made manifest by his unnatural and cruel
deeds: first of all he has slain my brother Hiempsall: which deed he durst
not have done if he had feared your displeasur: next that: he drove me forth of
my country and fathers kingdom. But these injuries for certain / were done
against my brother and me / and nothing they longed to you. But now he
conspyreth hyer inuadyng / vsurpyng / and wastyng the hole land of Numidy with
force of arms. And where as ye set me as your lewtenant under you to govern a
part of Numidy. This Iugurth now has driven me from my liberte into the town
of Cirtha / and besegeth me with men of arms closed on all sides with outward
dread and inward famine: So that my peryls may plainly declare how little he
sets by the words of your ambassadors. Certainly I can se nothing
remaynyng able to remove his violence / nor that can socour this my misery /
save only your power and violence. I would right gladly: that these things
which now I write to you / and all those things which I have complained
before in the counselhouse were but feigned and false / rather than this my
evident misery should prove them true and credible unto you. But since I was
borne in that hour / and my desteny is such that Iugurth most manifest his
cursed cruelte by me / therefore now my request nor prayer is not that I may
escape the sharpnes and cruelte of miserable death / which I behold instant
and inevitable / but only my prayer is that I may escape the long subieccion
and bondage of my ennemy: and prolonged tourmentes of my miserable body. But
worthy fathers: touching the kyndome of Numidy / which apertayneth to you:
provide you for the same as it lyketh you / and if it be your pleasure: ryd and
deliver me from the cruel and unmercifully hands of Iugurth my mortal enmy
for the honor and mageste of your empire / and for the fidelite of all
frenshyp / if any remembrance of my grandfather Massinissa remains yet among
you.

How the senators se^de new ambassadors to Iugurth / commaundynge him to
desyst from persecucion of Adherball: and how they prevailed nothing: how the
town of Cyrtha was yielded to Iugurth: and how he slew Adherball. The.xvi.
chapter.
AFter these foresaid letters were openly red and recyted before ye senators:
many of them were: which cou^sayled to send an army into Affrike / and in all
have convenient to socour and help Adherball. And in ye mean time they would
take counsel and advise touching Iugurth what should be done to him: because he
had not obeyed their ambassadors. When the favorers of Iugurth herd of this
they labored withal their might: that no such decre should be made nor
proceed to effect. And thus ye common well was overcome and subdued by pryuate
profet and parciall favor: as in many other busynesses is daily wont to
happen. Not withstandyng this parcialite: at last it was so determined: that
other new ambassadors were sent yet ones again into Affrike / not young men and
inexpert as before: but well aged men of grauite and discression which were of
great dignite: and had borne great and worshypfull offices i^ time past in the
cite of Rome. Among which ambassadors was one named Marcus Emilius Scaurus /
of whom we have made mention before. This Scaurus was a man by riches and fame
counted able to be cou^sellour of Rome: and also at that time a mighty prince
and great doer among the senators / and in manner ruler of them all. For asmoch
as all men for the most part were displeased with Iugurth and sore murmured
against his cruelte and against ye parciall favor showed to him at Rome: and
also for that ye messa^gers of Iugurth besought the ambassadors to have them to
Numidy / therefore ye third day after their commission they deperted from Italy
/ and took shyppyng and in short time after aryued in Affrike / at a cite named
Vtica in a province subject to the romans. As Soon as they were aryued they
send letters unto Iugurth chargyng him in all have to come to the said
province to know the pleasure of the senators of Rome which had send them
thither for the nonys with certain commandments dyrect unto him. of al their
counsels and busynesses. And howbeit at beginning this same Scaurus strongly
resisted the party of Iugurth: what time many other of his sect were corrupt
and accloyed with bribes long before this: nevertheless now at last his mind was
abstract like other mo from the defense of goodness and honesty unto his old
vice of insaciable and execrable couetyse by mean of habundance of gold and
great rewards of Iugurth. But at first beginning this Iugurth redeemed of
Calphurnius / but only delayng and deferryng of the war: trustyng that in
mean time he should bring about somewhat of his purpose at Rome other by price
/ prayer / or favor. But now after he had won Scaurus to be partiner of his
busynes and favorer of his cause also with Calphurnius: he was brought into a
very great trust fully to recover his peace at Rome: and concluded while both
Calphurnius and Scaurus were there present together to take aduiseme^t and treat
presently with them of all apoyntme^t and things necessary to be done for
perfourmyng of his purpose. Howbeit he trusted not Calphurnius so much that he
would come to his army / except some hostages of the Romans were left within
some strong town of his: and in ward of his people whereby he might trust
without damage sauely to be remitted again to his army. Calphurnius to avoid
this dougth of Iugurth and to put him in more assurance send the treasourer of
the Romayne army named Sextius / unto one of the chief towns belongyng to
Iugurth called Vacca / faynyng among the army that he sent the said treasourer
thither for provision of whete and other vitayls necessary to his host. And
the same commandment to provide vitayls the captayn Calphurnius gave to his
treasourer openly in common audience: to thinte^t that no man should suspect his
false purpose: saying to his treasourer that him neded not to be in dout of
Iugurth / for asmoch as trues were taken between both parties till a certain
day prefixed. The treasourer Sextius went to the said cite of Vacca at
commandment of Calphurnius his captain. Wherefore anon after Iugurth (like
as he appointed before) came to the army of Calphurnius / and there in presence
of the rulers and counsel of the Romans / spoke a little of his purgacion /
concerning the displeasure / envy / and hatredde / which the senate and
commens of Rome had taken against him for his deeds: saying that he had naught
done but provoked of his ennemies / and for his own defense: with violence to
resyst violence. How beit he said that he was contented to yield and submit
him self unto the Romans clemence and mercy. Somoch spoke he openly before
all the chief counsel of the army. But all the remenaunt he concluded and did
secretly with Calphurnius and Scaurus at more leasoure / and thus ended ye
co^municacion of this day. On the next day after insuynge the captain and the
counsel of the army / and also Iugurth assembled together again to common of
the same matter concerning peace to be granted to Iugurth. Now was it so that
at Rome was decreed an ordinance long before this time named among the romans
the Satyr law / which law commanded that the captain of every army should
ask advise of all the wise counsel of his host when he went about any weythy
matter concerning the common well. Wherefore Colphurnius thought so to order
himself that he should not be counted a brecare of this law: And desired
counsel and advise of all the noble and wise men of his host. This did he to
thynte^t that if the peace granted to Iugurth should be afterward dysalowed at
Rome (as it was) he might avoid the fault from himself into the common
counsel. But at conclusion / when Calphurnius acordyng to the said law had
required advise of the common counsel: every man consented that peace should
be granted to Iugurth: upon condition and co^uenaunt that he should deliver
unto the romans thertie Elyphantes with much other catell and many horses
with a great sum of gold. To which ordinance Iugurth acorded and soon
after delivered the same Elyphantes / catell / and horses and gold unto the
tresourer of the Romayne host. This done ye consul Calphurnius departed to
Rome to require the senators and other rulers to co^ferme this peace and
co^corde which they had made with Iugurth. In mean time over all Numydy and
also in the Romayne army was peace and co^corde in abydyng the answer of the
senate and rulers at Rome.

How the rulers of Rome for the most part were grievously displeased for
grauntyng of this-peace: and disalowed the same. And how Memmius inflamed the
common people against the favorers of Iugurth. The.xviii. Chapter.
But after it was known at Rhome in what manner the consul had behaved
himself in Affrike with Iugurth: in every place about Rome / and among every
company within Rome it was co^myned of the deed of Calphurnius. In somoche that
among the co^menty was raised grievous hatered and displeasure against him. The
senators were sore troubled and were in doubt whyther they might co^ferme and
allow this foul and shameful deed of the consul / or else abrogate and annull
the same. In this perplexite they were long time uncertain: And most of all
the might and power of Scaurus (because he was a doer and fellow with the
consul in the said deed) let them from discussyng of the right. But while the
senators in such wise prolonged the time. In this dubitacion Memmius (of
whose conditions / promptnes of wit / and hatered: which he had against the
power of the estates and noble men we have written before) at diverse times he
assembled the common people / exhortyng and inflamyng them to revenge the
cruelte of Iugurth / and parcialite of his favorers / and warnyng them not to
forsake the defense of their common wayle and liberty of their cite. He
rehearsed unto them the pride / the cruelte / and manyfolde unlawful deeds of
the senators and of other estates at many times done to disworshyp and
oppression of the common well. And utterly at conclusion so he behaved himself
that he kyndled the minds of the universal co^mentie to resyst the parcialyte
of the estates / and to se the cruelte of Iugurth extremely punysshed. But
because the eloquence of this Memmius at that season was at Rome notable and
much set by / dyscrete and of great authorite: I have intended of so many
exhortacions as he had to the people: to commit one to remembrance by
writynge: And specially before all other I will write that exhortacion which
after returnyng of Calphurnius from Affrike the said Me^mius spoke before the
common people in form following.

The orison of Memmius had before the commen people of Rome. In which orison
he induces them to defend their lyberte: And to repress and persecute with
hatered the noble men of Rome. The.xix. Chapter.
RIght worthy cetyzins many things should withdraw me from defense of you and
from charge and medlyng with your busynesses were not the great love and favor
which I have to the commen well: that causes me to set a side all such
impedimentes / and utterly to take upon me the defense of your lyberte against
these corrupt estates. More plainly to ascertayne you: the things which might
withdraw me from defense of your cause be these. First the power of them which
are begy^ners of this variau^ce: that is to say of Calphurnius and Scaurus.
Secondly your patience which is easy to be subdued of cruelty: since ye be
disposed to endure this wrong. And thyrdly the infeccion of Justice which is
no where here among us / but clean eryled from our ci^e. And principally this
lets me for that I se you so innocent / so feeble minded / and so simple that
in every place ye ar sure of all the peril / of all the labor / and of all
the pain: but these estates which do naught that is commendable have all the
honor / auantage / and worship. And sothely: it greueth me to speak to you
of the injury that now of late has been done to you: how much ye have been had
in skorne / derision / and in dysdayne: to the power and pride of a few
estates. And also it greueth to recount how unrevenged many of your defenders
by them have shamefully ben put to death for your sake within these fyftene
years. And to se how your minds be corrupt with cowardyse and negligence that
ye would never socoure them which in your quarrel and defense have subdued
themself to death. What intend ye? will ye still be subgette unto these estates
your enemies. It is surely time at the last to arise and defend your liberty
/ ye do dread them: whom it seems to dout and to dread you / consyderyng your
true querell / and their ungoodly mysdemeanour. But not withstandyng that ye be
thus disposed to lose your liberty and in mysery to pass forth ye resydue of
your lives / nevertheless the good will / which I have to you and to the commen
well causes and dryueth my mind to resyst this false favor and parcialyte of
these proud and unjust lords. Certesse I shall assay and prove how I can
defend the liberty which my father left me: but whyther I shall so do to
advantage or else in vain that lies hole in your hands and power. Surely
worthy citezins I do not exhort you to withstand these wrongs and oppressions
with force of arms as our forefathers have often done. To resyst and repel
this wrong needs no violence no deuydynge of you from the senators as your
elders have done before time. It must needs be that these great men co^federat
in malice at last shall come to decay by their own conditions and insolent
behauour.

Were not sharp inquisicions and grievous examinacions had against the common
people of Rome / after that Tiberius Graccus was slain for the defense of the
laws belonging to the commentie: whom his evil wylles accused as usurper of
kingdom over the commen people. And moreover after that Caius Graccus and
Marcus Fuluius / were put to death for defendyng of your lyberte / were not many
of your order and behauoure that is to say of the commentie put to death or
murdered in prison: And at both the seasons the estates made none end of their
cruelty against you after the law / but after their immoderate pleasure. Well
forsothe I grant that it be reputed for treason and usurpation of a kingdom
to defend the laws and the right of the commentie: and I grant also that
what thing can not be co^dygnely punysshed without effusyon of blood of many
citezins: that the same punisshement be executed according to law and right
upon a few such as were begynners of the trespass. Within these few years
passed ye dysdayned and murmured secretly among your self that the said lords
spoiled the commen treasoure without your consent: And that kings and nations
contrybutory to Rome / paid their trybutes to a few private estates / and not
general to the universal cite in commen: and ye grutched that these estates
had all the most dignite and all the richesse and treasoure / also in their
hands. Nevertheless they counted but a small thing to escape unpunished for
these so great offenses. Wherefore now are they become so bold / so fires / and
proud: by your sufferance that at last they have betrayed and put in hands of
your ennemies / your laws / your dignite / your mageste / withal other
things both humayne and divine to your liberty belonging. So that in
pardonyng of these inhumayne and cruel offenses of Iugurth they have polluted
and betrayed the laws both of god and man. And how beit that such is their
demeanor it nothing repents them: nor they be naught asshamedde thereof. But
daily iette before your faces solemly and pompously bostyng them self: Some of
their dignities / their lordshyppes / and offices. And other some crakyng of
their triumphs and victories / as who says that they attained the same by
honor / and not by falsehodde and robbery. Have ye not daily experience
seeing that simple bondmen bought and sold for money will not suffer nor endure
the unjust commandments of their lords or masters. But co^trarywyse ye
gentylmen: freborne cetezyns ar contented to suffer with meke minds this
bondage wherein ye are holden subgette by the power of these lords. But I pray
you what manner of men be these which thus subdue you / and presume thus long
to occupy the commen wayle at this season? Forsothe they be men most vicious /
with bloddy hands infected / with the blood of innocents. Men of immoderate
and insac^able couetyse: noysom and grievous to every god man. Whose pride
incredyble no man can comprehend / which for money have sold and daily are
ready for to sell for lucre: their fidelite / their worship / their devotion /
and good name: And brefely all things honest and dishonest are they ready to do
for auantage. Whereby it apereth evidently that all their joy and felicite
rests in couetyse. Some of them count themself more assured because they
have slain the protectours of the commentie to the intent that other may dread
them so much more: And other some of them in wrong examinacions and inquisions
had against you rejoice and count them self hardye and surer thereby: And many
other thinks their defense and auauncement in murdring of you bostyng them
self of the same: and thus how much wors that each of them does: the more
sure he is and more set by. In somoch that where they ought to fere you for
their misdeeds: they transpose that fear unto you / and cause you by your
cowardyse to fear and dread them: which are conjoined all together against you
i^ one manner desire of ill / in one manner couetyse / in one hateredde of good /
and in one manner fere of your auau^ceme^t: but among good men to be all of one
mind under this manner one not withstanding an other it is to be counted for
amyte and frendshyppe. Among ill men such agreyng of manners is but a knotte
of discord and causes sedycion / variau^ce / and debate. But verily if ye had
so great desire and care to recover your lyberte (which is lost) as they have
to increase their lordshyppe: than should not the co^menwele be oppressed and
wasted as it is now: and than should the offices / maistershyppes / and
dignitees of Rome (which ar your benefits to give where lyketh you) be in the
hands of good and virtuous men / and not in the hands of bold bosters and
iniust men confederate in myschefe. The co^mentie of Rome your forefathers
before this time have armed themself and forsaken the senators two sundry
times and keep themself together upon the hill of Aduentyne / only because the
would have a law decreed and inacted for them: And masters or officers elect
for them which should be their protectours against the injury and extorcion of
the estates when need should require / which thing at last was granted to
them and many other lyberties also. Than should not ye labor much more
withal your might for conseruacion of the same lyberties which they have left
unto you as hole as ever they had them: And specially for this cause ought ye
to defend your privileges for that it is more shame and rebuke to lose the
privilege and liberty gotten than never to have optayned them: And specially
what shame is it to you nothing to augment nor increase that authorite /
which your elders and forefathers have left to you: but to suffer ye same by
your cowardyse by little and little to dekay: and at last utterly to be lost
and come to naught? But any of you may than require of me what is yor mind /
what will ye that we do? I will forsothe and counsel that punysshment be taken
upon them which have betrayed the honor of the commen well unto your ennemy
Iugurth / without advise of the senators or of the co^menty: but this my
counsel is not to punysshe them violently with your power in battle / for
certesse that were more dyshonoure unto you to do than to them to suffer the
same. Not withstanding that they be worthy so to be dealt withal. But this
thing may be best done by inquysition / examinacion and confession of Iugurth
himself / and by his accusacion of these treatours / which Iugurth surely
will be obedient to come hither to Rome at your commandment if it be true
that he has yielded himself. But if he dyspice your commandments than may
ye well think and consider what peace or yeldynge he has made by the which
yeldyng he is unpunished and pardoned of his detestable and shameful deeds /
and these estates laded with richesse and treasoure. But curcite and welthe of
the co^menty is come to loss / damage / and utter shame and disworshyp* Thus
must ye do / such examinacions must ye make without ye think that these great
men have not yet sufficient lordshyppe and power in their hands or else without
ye show outward that ye were better pleased and content with that season when
kingdoms / provinces / justices / laws / iugementes / battle / peace / and
finally every thing both divine and humayne were in hands of a few estates.
Than ye be now pleased with the season and time that now is when your liberty
is given to you which ye are able to maintain if ye so be disposed. But in
that season passed / how beit ye were vnouercome of your ennemies / masters /
and emperors ^ over the most part of the world: yet had ye enough to do to
defend your own life from the cruelty of these few mighty men. For of you
all who was so bold to withsta^de their subieccion and bondage. Wherefore if ye
entend to endure and suffer the destruction of your liberty as ye begin tha^
truly ye time which is to come shall be much more cruel to you than the time
passed. But as for me not withsta^dyng that I understand the great offense and
abominable of this wicked Iugurth is suffered unpunished: yet would I suffer
patiently that ye should forgive and pardon the wicked doers of this deed men
most ungracious because they be citezins. If it were not so / that such mercy
and forgyuenes should turn to our dystruction and ruin of our empire. For ye
may se how great oportunite and sufferance they have in somoche that they
count but a small thing to do unhappily without punysshment. Wherefore they now
daily increase their cruelty against you / if ye do not herafter take from them
the power and authorite thereof. And specially co^tynuall busynes without end
shall remain unto you wha^ ye se plainly that outher ye must be servants or
bondemen: or else ye must retaygne and defend your liberty by strength of your
hands. For what hope or trust is there of faithfulness or of concord between
you and them* None surely. For their mind is utterly set to be lords over
you: and ye on the other part will needs be fre and at liberte. They be
extremely inclined and disposed to do wrong and injury unto you. And ye labor
to withstand the^ utterly. And brefely to speak they take the friends and
fellows of our empire for ennemies. But our mortal ennemies they take for
their fellows and friends. But ye would withstand this cursed and unkind
behauour. Wherefore can ye suppose that peace / love / or frendshyppe can be
among people so contrary of minds and disposicion. For these co^syderacio^s I
warn and exhort you that ye suffer not so great myschefe to escape
unpunished. This offense is nothing like to the robbyng of the common
treasour / nor to ye spoylyng of money by extorcion from the fellows and
friends of our empire. Which deeds (howbeit they be grievous and in manner
intolerable) nevertheless by custo^e and use of the same they are reputed for
small fautes and for naught. But this deed is much more grievous and utterly
intolerable. For the authorite of the senate is betrayed to our most cruel
and fires ennemy Iugurth / your empire is falsely betrayed to other men's
hands and possession. The common well has been put to sale to Iugurth by ye
senators both at home in our cite / and also in our army by Calphurnius the
co^sull: Insomoch that if examinacion be not made hereof: and if they be not
punysshed which be culpable and fautie herin. What thing shall remain unto us
but that we must pass our life under obedience and bondage of them which thus
have done / and us shall they keep in subjection as if they were kings? For
what thing longs to a king / save to parfourme his will and pleasur / be it
good or ill without any resystence or punysshment of any man. Do not these
estates thus without any co^tradiction / not withsta^dyng that it is in your
power to withstand the^ if ye will. Nor certes worthy citezins I do not thus
exhort you to coueyt rather that your citezins should do ill than well. But I
speak to thinte^t / that ye should not so favor and forbere a few iniust and
ill disposed men: that the utter destruction of all good men should proceed of
such indiscrete favor: And also namely in a cite or a common wayle it is much
better and more tolerable to forgete the reward of good deeds / than the
punysshment of ill deeds. For a good man seeing his goodness not rewarded nor
set by he does but only withdraw his own kyndnes: but an ill man not
punysshed / is the more bold and cursed: And moreover if such as be mysdoers be
punysshed / at the last their nombre shall be abated and decresed / and if there
be few unjust men / the less wrong is done. And he to whom no wrong is done
needs not to call for socour nor help. Thus it is better to leave a good deed
unrewarded / than an ill deed unpunished.

How Memmius induced the people of Rome by the said orison: so that Cassius
was sent for Iugurthe to bring him to Rome to declare and accuse the
supporters of his deeds. The.xx. chapyter.
MEmmius cou^sellyng and inducynge often times by these words and other like
at last did somoch that Lucius Cassius / one of the chief.x. judges of Rome
should be send to Iugurth and assure him of his life / and to come and return
in save guard upon promise and faith of all the hole co^menty of Rome. And upon
this promise to bring him to Rome to thinten that by his own words and
confession of the treuth / the falshode and couetyse of Calphurnius the consul
/ of Scaurus and of other which had been corrupted by him before by money and
rewards might be euydently proved and known.

Of the behauour of the soudyours and other which were laft in Numidy while
Scaurus the consul was at Rome. The.xxi. chap.
While these things were in hand and done at Rome / in mean time the chief of
ye soudyours / which Calphurnius had left behynd him in Numidy followed the
manners and behauour of their captain and did many ungoodly and myscheuous
deeds. Some of them were so corrupt with gold that they delyuerd again to
Iugurth the olyphantes / which he had given to Calphurnius what time ye peace
was granted and trues / first taken between them. Some other sold to Iugurth
the traitors which had fled from him unto the romans army: And other some
spoiled and robbed the people of Numidy / which had all ready peace with the
Romans / and had yielded themself. So great and shameful was the violence of
couetyse which had infected their minds as if it had been an universal
contagion of pest^^ence. But now will I return to my matter where I left
before concerning Cassius the judge and his vyage to Numidy for to bring
Iugurth unto Rome.

How Iugurth came to Rome with Cassius and how he behaved himself there.
The.xxii. chapyter.
CAyus Memmius in name of all the co^mens gave commandment to Cassius
(according to the ordinance inacted) to speed him toward Numidy / and to
bydde Iugurth come to Rome under suerte and condition before rehearsed. When the
estates which knew themself culpable understood of this they were maruelusly
abassed. But wham Cassius was come to Iugurth / not withstandyng that he was
^ereful of his part / and had no confidence in his cause for asmoche as he
knew himself fauty in his own conscience: yet Cassius aduysed him and
induced him: because he had yielded himself to come unto Rome: without he would
rather prove the Romans strength and violence than their mercy and pity: and
moreover the said Cassius promised also his own faith and troth that if he
would come to Rome and answer truly to all such things as there should be
demanded of him / he should safely go and come without any impediment. Cassius
had so good a name at that time that Iugurth had asmoche confidence in his
faith and promise alone as in the promise or assurance of the hole cite. And so
at last Iugurth consented to go to Rome with Cassius. Wherefore to enduce the
romans to the more pity he arrayed himself in rude aparell against his honor
royal much vile and miserable: and so with Cassius came to Rome not as a king
/ but poorly and with a small company. And not withstandyng that his mind was
much confermed / assured / and bolded: by the confort of them which he had
corrupted with rewards before / under whose defense and supportacion he had
committed so much cruelty: yet he behaved him so with his gifts of new
as soon as he was come to Rome / that by his great rewards be induced a lord
of Rome named Caius Bebius / one of the protectours of the co^menty to be
supporter and mayntener of his cause among the other mo* By whose dishonest and
unmeasurable couetise he trusted assuredly to be defended / against law / from
all punysshmentes due unto his demerites. But the co^menty of Rome was
violently and sore wrath against Iugurth / some commanded to have him to
prison and there to keep him in bands: And other some would that acordyng to
the law punysshment of death should by taken of him as of their mortal ennemy
/ if he would not shortly confess and discover the fellows / partiners / and
supporters of his cruel deeds. Caius Me^mius heryng hereof called together the
co^menty and alayed the mocyon and wrath of their minds apeasyng their
unadvised rancour. And requirynge them to keep the faith and troth of the cite
(which they had promised to Iugurthe) clear / inuiolate / and undefiled. Thus
did Memmius exhort them as he which more regarded and set more by the
conseruacion of the dignite of Rome / than by the parfourmynge and satisfyeng
the wrath and ire of the rude co^mens. But when silence was made among all the
assemble: anon Iugurth was brought forth before them all. Memmius than began
to speak to him demurely rehersyng and openly recountyng how he had corrupt the
estates of Rome with his treasure / and cruelly against right had done many
abhomynable deeds at Rome / and also in Numidy against the king Micipsa and his
sons / as slain Adherball and Hiempsall falsely dysceyued the king Micipsa:
and wasted ye kingdom of Numidy. And howebeit (said Memmius) that the Romans
knew well his supporters yet they would most of all that Iugurth should openly
discover and accuse them himself. Wherefore he desired him truly to confess
the names of them by whose supportacion he was so bold to commit so many
i^moderate and cruel deeds. Sayng that if he would so do and confess and
disclose the troth than might he have great trust and confydence in ye favor
/ cleme^ce / and mercy of the people of Rome. But if he would not so do / he
should do no profet by his silence to the noble men of Rome which had supported
him: And also he should be dystruction and undoing of himself / and of his
riches also. On this point Memmius ceased his words and held him still.
Anon Iugurth was commanded of the commente to make answer. But when he was
reddy to have spoken Caius Bebius whom he had corrupted with treasour (as I
have made mention before) commanded him to hold his pease. In somoche that
howebeit the people sore moved with displeasure put him in fear with
exclamacion against him with angry countenances* and often violently rennynge
upon him / and with other tokens of ire and dyspleasure. Nevertheless for all
this the froward counsel of Bebius overcame their thretnyng / insomoche that
Iugurth would nothing speak nor dysclose. And thus the people had in derision
and abused / departed from the congregation and assemble. So the minds of
Iugurthe / of Calphurnius / and of other their partyners were than inhansed and
increased in boldness: which were troubled and much ferefull before / when
Iugurth was first send for and brought to be examined.

How Iugurth increased his cruelty at Rome and renewed his murdre in sleayng an
other noble man of the stock of Micipsa by occasion whereof he was constrained
to depart from Rome / and the battle renewed again of hole. The.xxiii.
chapyter.
AT the same season was a gentleman at Rome named Massiua / borne of the
country of Numidy / which was the son^e of Galussa / and neuewe to ye good
king Massinissa. This Massiua was against Iugurth in the strife and disce^cion
between Adherball and him / when the town of Cirtha was yielded and Adherball
slain. Whefore he trusted not Iugurth / but to save himself fled from Numidy
unto Rome. Now was a lord at Rome named Albinus / which was creat consul
with an other partyng fellow named Minucius / the next year after Calphurnius.
This Albinus came to Massiua and cou^sayled him (because he was of the stock
of Massinissa) to grieve Iugurth / asmoch as he could / with envy / fear / and
displeasure for his offenses and cruelte: And by peticion to desire of the
senators the administracion of the kingdom of Numidy. Albinus gave to him
this counsel / for asmoch as he himself was desirous of battle. Wherefore he
would much rather that every thing were moved with trouble / than pacified or at
rest. Than was a custom at Rome / that the consul should have a partyng fellow
/ and between them the provinces belongyng to Rome should be divided. Thus in
departing of the provinces / the country of Numidy fell to Albinus / and the
country of Macidony to his fellow Minutius. Shortly after Massiua began to
move the matter to the senators touching administracion of the kingdom of
Numidy. Iugurth hering of this had not so great trust i^ his matter nor to his
friends as he had before: For some of them with drew their self for knowledge
of their fautes / and other some for fear of ill name and fame or rumor of
the people. Wherefore Iugurth consyderyng this required Bomilchar / one of his
most nere and trusty friends to provide and to hyer by gifts and rewards a
company to sle the said Massiua / and that as privily as could be done. But if
it coud not privily be done than to slay him openly by one mean or other
Bomilchar shortly went about the commandment of Iugurth / and anon provided
men and hy^ed such as were mete for such a deed: and commanded them to espy
and search his ways / his goynges and co^mynges / and to wayet a season and
place convenient to parforme their enterprise. But afterward when he saw his
time he prepared to execute this treason. Wherefore one of them which were
ordained and assigned to this murdre / assailed Massiua rasshely / with small
prouisyon or auysement / and slew him unware. But he which did the deed
anon was taken and brought before the judges. The people in great nombre
desired and at last constrained him to tell by whose counsel he did that
myscheuous deed / and specially Albinus the consul coarted him thereto. The
murderer anon confessed the treuthe and declared how he had done it at the
instigacion and counsel of Bomilchar: And not withsta^dyng that the same
Bomilchar came to Rome / under the sauegarde and assurance of the faith of the
commente as did Iugurth / yet he was judged gyltie of the deed / co^sideryng
that he was cou^selloure thereto / and not according to the common law / but
after very equite and good conscience. But Iugurth co^syderyng himself
culpable in the same fault / yet would by no mean confess nor knowledge
himself fautie / till time that he understood and saw that the envy and
displeasure which was taken against this deed passed all his favor and
rewards which he had given at Rome / so yt at last in his gifts he found no
socoures nor aid. But howebeit in the first accion or accuseme^t which was
laid against him / he had brought in and laid.l. suerties of his friends for
him and all other of his retynue that he should purge himself of every thing
which was or should be laid against him / yet thought he better to provide for
the proteccion of his kingdom than for the health of his pledges or suerties.
And this co^sydring he privily sent Bomilchar away from Rome unto Numidy /
dredynge that if condyng and worthy punysshement were taken of Bomylchar at
Rome / le^t the other commentie of his realm at home would dread to be
obedient to him. And anon after Bomilchar was departed Iugurth himself fled
also from Rome after him commanded of the senators to depart from Italy as
ennemy to the romans and their empire. But when he was departed a little
without Rome: it is said that he looked often backewarde behind him spekyng
secretly to himself / but at the last he spoke plainly in audience that they
which were assystent might here him and said. O noble and famous city corrupt
and accloyed with infect citezins / whose couetyse is so insaciable that they
will profer the forth to sale / and shortly thou should be sold and perysshe
/ if thy rulers could find any man that would bye the / and give money for the.

How Albynus consul of Rome renewed the war agayng Iugurthe / and at last
returned again to Rome leaving his brother Aulus in Numidy / with the army in
his rowme. The.xxiiii. chapyter.
IN the mean season Albinus which was create consul next after Calphurnius
renewed the war against Iugurth and without taryeng^ causes vytayls / wages
and all other things necessary / expedient / and belonging to soudyours: to
be conveyed spedely into Affrike. And he anon himself in all have took his
vyage thyderwarde also / and so forth to Numidy. In which vyage he made more
hasty expedicion to the intent to fynisshe the war with Iugurth / other by
force of arms / or else co^strayning him to yield himself / or by some other
means what so ever might be found namely before the time of election of new
consuls / which time was not long to come. But contrary wise Iugurth
prolonged every thing by one cause or other. As fast as Albinus went forward /
so fast Iugurth found impedimentes / sometime he promised to yield himself /
and sometime feigned himself afraid. One while he fled from the army of Albinus
when it was nere hand to him: And anon after lest his men should mystrust by
dysconfort or despair / he boldly withstode and defended himself manly. And
thus in prolongyng the time: sometime with war and sometime with peace / he
abused and mocked the consul / wherefore some were which suspected that Albinus
was not ignorant of the counsel of Iugurth / but co^sentyng to him by favor:
And for asmoche as at the beginning he was so fires / hasty / and diligent: it
was suspected that he drove forth the time now rather by craft than cowardyse.
But after the time was passed and the day of election of new consules aproched
and came fast on. The consul Albinus ordained his brother named Aulus / to
remain in his stead as captain and ruler in the army: and he himself
departed toward Rome / to be at election of the new consuls / as the law
required.

How Aulus and the romayne army were disconfyted of Iugurth: and how peace was
granted to him by Aulus: and to what shame the Romans were put by rasshe folly
of the same capytayne Aulus. The.xxv. chapyter.
IN the same season was the commen wayle at Rome much troubled with variaunce
and debate / between the protectours of the commentie. For of them one named
Lucullus and an other Annius labored to continue and keep still their office
and against the ordinance of the law to continue more than one year. Wherefore
the other which were pertyngfelowes i^ office with them labored with all
their might the contrary to resyst them and to maintain the old constitucion
/ ordinance and custom. This dyscencion and debate let the election of the
new consuls all that year. Aulus whom Albinus had left with the army in Numidy
as his lewtenant herd of this prolongyng of the time and was brought in great
hope to win great honor or treasour. Wherefore in the cold month of January
he called the soudyours forth of their tents to execute the battle with
Iugurth without more delay. Outher did he thus shortly to make an end of the
battle in his time / and thereby to win honor or else with his army to put
Iugurth in fear (so that to have peace) he should redeem the same of Aulus
with great treasoure. Aulus concludynge on this purpose / spedde him so fast
with his soudyours making daily great iournayes (not withsta^dyng the
sharpness of winter) that at last he came to a town in Numidy / named
Suthull: in which town the treasours of Iugurth were laid. This town with
walls / waters / and mou^taygnes of nature was strongly defended: for without
the walls builded on the heyght of a mountaygne broken on the forefronte was a
great plain fenne / or marrayse ground: all ouercouered with mudde / and
standing winter water. Insomoche that what for the sharpness of the winter
season: and what for natural defense of the place / this town could by no
means bewell besyged nor taken: yet this not wtstandyng Aulus to increase fere
to Iugurth / and for the blind desire which he had to win the town in manner
of dissimulacion assailed the same and made pauayses about the walls of
sheldes conjoined like vynes / wherunder his men might fight with less damage
or paryll. Than made he a dyche or trenche round about the town with great
hepes of earth casten upon the sides of the same / to the intent that no socours
should enter into them / nor they escape forth at their pleasurs. And finally
he made ready every thing which belonged or was necessary to besegyng of such
a town. But Iugurth anon perceived the vain and folysshe behauoure of Aulus
/ and craftily increased by polycy the madness of him / sending often
ambassadors unto him to require in derysion that he would desyst and leave
besyginge of the town / and intreatyng him of peace mekely. But in the mean
time Iugurth himself in manner as if he would not intermell with Aulus / led
his army by wodes / forestes / by streat passages / by hyls and dales / and by
bacways: causynge Aulus to suspect that he was a dradde of him: And finally he
enduced Aulus to trust after some apointement. And thus Iugurth with his men
fleyng always into deserts and hid places gave confort to Aulus and increased
his courage by such avoiding. Insomoch that at last Aulus gave up the segyng of
the town of Suthull: And with his hole power hastily pursued Iugurth as
fleing from him for dread into places unknown to him and his men. Thus was
the treason of Iugurth more hid from Aulus / wherefore he made the less
provision therefore. In the mean season Iugurth by subtle messangers attempted
the romayne army day and night inducyng them to consent to betray their fellows
/ the capytayns / and vndercaptayns: anon for lucre consented to him. Some in
time of battle to forsake and betray their own company and to fight on the
part of Iugurth. And other which would not grant to so foul a deed / as to
fight against their own company / he exhorted and induced them when the
trumpettes should blow to battle to leave their places and array: And depart
from their company without stroke on one side or other. When every thing was
brought to his purpose and accorded to his requests: Than about mydnyght he
stale privily toward the tents of the romans: and suddenly with a great
company of Numidyans / compassed them about on every side and assailed them
fiersly. The romayne soudyours which were with Aulus / thus unwarily invaded:
were meruelously abashed and amassed / for ye unwont and sodayn fear of this
treason. Some of the most noble hertes: with great courage drew to them their
harnes / and resysted their ennemies valyantly: fully assured and prefyxed to
dye like men: if fortune should grant them none other means to escape that
instant danger. Some other as cowardes hid themself in caves and other
secret places / if they might any find. The boldest and most used to such
chances conforted their fellows which were ferefull and inexpert of such
chances of war. Howbeit none of them all was so bold nor so well assured of
himself / but that he was both in great dread and danger. And no maruayle /
for in every place and on all sides about them they were environed in compass
with great violence and plentious nombre of their ennemies hyd under darkness of
the night and clouds which utterly obscured the sterres light. Their paryll
was indifere^t and doutfull whyther they fled or abode the battle. For death
was instant and depended over their hedes every way: and other hope nor
esperau^ce was none / save death inevitable. So that finally it was uncertain
unto them whether it was better ormore sure to fle or to abide to their
aue^ture. But of that company wihich Iugurth had corrupted with rewards as we
have said before one bend or cohort of lombardes and tow turmes that is to
say.lx. thraciens and a few rude and common soudyours betrayed the romans and
went over to Iugurth. Also the Centurion which was assigned to be captain
over them / which were committed to fight about the first standard of the
third legion drew him and his company aside and suffered their ennemies to
enter into the mids of the host on that side which they had taken to defend.
Thus all ye Numidye^s brake in on that side without any resystence. And at
conclusion the romans had a foul flight and a shameful disconfiture /
insomoche that they trusted more to their fete than to their hands or armor:
And many of them to ren lyghter / thrue away their armor and harnes / and took
the top of an hill which was nere thereby and there tarried. The company of
Iugurth / what for spoylinge of the romans tents and darkness of the night had
les honor of victory and suffered many of the romans to escape. On the next
day after Iugurth and Aulus came to communication together. Than said Iugurth to
Aulus that not withstandyng that he had him and his army which were letf alive
sure enough compassed and enuyroned with wepen and hunger so that they could
not escape him: and howebeit it was in his power to oppres him and all his.
Nevertheless he remembered well enough the incertayn chances of man's business
and would not be to him cruel nor vncurres so that he would make with him a bond
of peace and no more contend against him in battle / on this condition / that
all the soudyours of Aulus should do obesance unto him and pass under a spear
in token of subiectyon and so without more damage depart out of the country of
Numidy within the space of.x. days next after. But howbeit this composicion
and conditions were hard / grievous / and full of shame and misery: and worthy
to be punysshed of the senators if Aulus agreed to them. Nevertheless their
minds so wauered for dread of death that at last the composicion and agreement
was concluded and agreed at the will and pleasure of Iugurth upon the said
conditions.

what sorrow and heaviness was at Rome: and how they demeaned themself in the
cite after that tidings hereof were brought thither. The.xxvi. chapyter.
When the Romans understood of this at Rome / all the cite was filled with
dread / sorrow / lame^tacion and mournyng. Some bewailed the worship of
t^empire as lost by that shameful co^posicion: And other uncustomed to such
business of battle: and not knowing nor co^sydryng the variable mutabilite of
chau^ces of wary fered the loss of their liberty / of their cite / and of all
their empire. They all were wroth and utterly displeased with Aulus cause of
this subjection and shameful co^posicion. But namely they which had been good
warryours in their days were displeased with him most of all: when they
co^sydred that he being armed and well appointed to battle rather sought means
to escape from death by such shameful and bond co^posicion than manly abiding
the ex^remite of battle to have delivered himself and his company: or else
valyantly to have dyed with honor. But the co^sull Albinus / himself dreded
sore for this things co^sydring that for his brothers fault in time to come he
should not avoid the displeasure of the senators and co^mens of Rome. For as
he coniectured all his brothers deeds should redou^de to his dishonor and
paryll / because he had lymitted him in Numidy in his sted to be captain of
the army in his abse^ce. Wherefore (these things duly aduysed) he went to the
senators desyringe them to take counsel and aduiseme^t whyther they would
approbate and allow the said co^posicion between his brother Aulus and
Iugurth: or else not. But he knew right well that the senators would not
co^ferme the same. Wherefore (in mean time while they were cou^selling) he elect
soudyors for supplime^t to fulffyll and parforme again the army which was in
Affrike / and sore diminisshed. For many of them were slain by Iugurth and his
company. Wherefore Albinus raised up socours of such as were nere to the costs
of Rome / and friends to thempire: as Latinians and Italians with other
nations. Of these he raised as many as he might / and assembled them together by
all means which he could deuyse to fournysshe and augmente his army. At
conclusion the senators decreed in their counsel that no bond of peace nor
composicion might be confirmed without their consent and without the advise and
commandment of the common people also: as right and reason required. And thus
was the said co^posicion of Aulus abrogate / as thing presumed without consent
or commandment of the senators or commens. But when the consul Albinus had
ordained and prepared supplement of his army (as said is) he was prohybet and
let by the protectours of the co^menty: Insomoche that he was not suffered by
them to convey such company as he had raised into Affrike / with him as he
intended to repair and tornysshe the army which there remained. Wherefore he
spedde himself forth into Affrike disapoynted of his purpose with a small
company of men / of his own retynue. The army of the romans which he before
had committed to Aulus his brother: according to the opoyntment with Iugurth /
was departed forth of Numidy. And to pasforth the winter / tarried in a province
of Affrike which was subget to thempire of Rome. When Albinus the consul was
arrived and come thither: his mind ardently was kyndled with desire to pursue:
Iugurth / and to remedy the ill wy^l and displeasure which the commens at Rome
had against Aulus his brother. Nevertheless when he knew the manners and ill
behauour of the soudyours: of whom some were fled treyterously to Iugurth (as
is said before) and some by sufferaunce of their captain were infected and
corrupted with ouermoch pleasure / dissolute liberty / and voluptuous living:
this consydring he concluded (as the case required) to do nothing for a season:
and to attempt no maistry: but to pass forth the winter with his army without
remouynge or puttyng himself in ieopardy or paryll.

In the mean season while Albinus and his army soiourned in the province of
Affrike till the winter were ouerpassed. At Rome was one named Caius Manlius
elect and lymitted proiectour of the common people which anon after he was
se^ in authorite: assembled the co^mens: and desired and cou^sayled them that
inquisicion might be made of all such by whose supportacion and counsel
Iugurth had dyspised and set a^ naught the ordinances decreed of the
senators. And against them which had restored again to Iugurth the
elyphantes which Iugurth had delyuerd to Calphurnius at the first composicion
and apoyntment which was made with him. And also against them which had
received any money or other rewards of Iugurth while they were ambassadors or
captains of armies against him: send forth by the romans. And finally the same
inquisicion also was extended against all such as had made any pactions /
apoyntmentes / or promises of peace or of war with ennemies of thempire
without general consent of the senators or commens.

When this inquire was moved: many of the senators and noble men of Rome knew
themself culpable in the foresaid articles. And other some douted sore of
paryls for to come because of the ylwyll and malice which the party of the
co^mens confederat had against them. Wherefore sith the same noble men might not
well resyst the examinacion of these articles openly: but of necessite they
must agree thereto: other else knowledge themself (by their resystence) gylte in
the same: therefore they prepared impediment privily against such inquisicions
by their friends: but specially by ye fellows of thempire which were
co^federate with the romans / as Italyans and Latinia^s. The princes of these
nations and such other like gave counsel to the senators which were not
fauty in the premysses / and also to the co^menty: that in such a troublous /
besy / and peryllous season no such examinacions should be made nor proceed
forward to effect: for dread of many inconveniences which of the same might
rise between the noble men and the co^mens. But (this not withstandyng) it is a
merueylous thing and in manner incredible to speak of: how besy and diligent the
commens were to have the same inquisicion to proceed / and to be brought to
effect: and that rather for hatered which they had against the noble men
(against whom the said inquisicion was ordained) tha^ for any good will or
favor / which they had to the common well. So great pleasure and desire of
varia^ce was among them. Wherefore while the remenant of the noble men were sore
troubled with fere and dread. Marcus Scaurus which was before sent into Affrike
with Calphurnius (as I have said) provided for himself in crafty manner as I
shall now declare. While the co^menty was merry and ioyeous of this examinacion
and many of the company of Scaurus that knew themself fauty fled for fear.
And the hole cite was in much dread and Manlius obtained his peticion and will
of the commenty. In somoche that anon were ordained three noble men
commisioners to examine the three articles before rehearsed and here insuyng of
whom the first was of them which counseled Iugurth to despise the decreis of
the senators and that took money or rewards of him. The second was of them
that sold again to Iugurth the foresaid elyphantes and the Numidiens that left
Iugurth coming on the romans side. And the third examinacion was of them
which had made any apointement of peace or war with the ennemies of Rome as
was Iugurth. But not withstanding that Calphurnius was culpable in the same
asmoche as any other of the noble men. Nevertheless he shyfted so for himself
that he was elect to be one of the examinours or commyssioners to make
inquisicion of these three points rehearsed. The inquisicion proceeded to effect
and was handled and put in execucion with much violence and sharply after the
commen rumor and pleasure of the co^menty. Thus the people seeing their
pleasure fulfilled / at that time began to be proud and statly thereof in
likewise as the estates had been in foretyme of their power and lordshyp. But
here will I make a small dygression fro my purpose and tell whereof this
variance and discord between the co^mens and noble men first proceeded.

whereof the dyscorde and taking of parties between the noble men and co^mens of
Rome / had first beginning. The.xxvii. chapyter.
THis manner of deuisyon of the commente from the estates of Rome: This discord
and taking of parties between them: and this inordinate custom of all other
inco^uenyences / began among the^ but a few years before this time by mean of
over much rest ad ydlenes: by superfluous habundance of richesse /
voluptuosite / and of other worldely delectacions: which many count and
repute for most chief pleasures of this life. For before the dystruction of
Carthage / the senators and co^menty of Rome treated and governed the
co^menwele between them peasably in love and concord. So that among the
citezins was no strife nor debate / for laud / excellence / for dignite / nor
for great dominion. The dread which they had of their ennemis made them war
and kept them in good manners causyng them to govern their cite with good and
virtues institutes / without variance / without robbery / without oppression /
without slaughter nor other like cruel tyrannies. But when Carthage was
overcome anon was expulsed fere from their minds: and voluptuosite /
wantonness / and pride (which are greatly loved in wealth and prosperity) anon
entered their minds: so that they desired peace wha^ they had war. But wha^
the war was ended: and that they had peace and ydlenes after their own
desire: their peace and rest was more sharp / more bitter / more intolerable
/ and more perilous to them tha^ the war was before. For the estates began
to turn their dignite and worship / into immoderate affection of great
lordshyppe and dominacion. And the common people began to turn their liberty
into lust and pleasure. Every man provided and drew to himself robbynge and
reauynge without measure / from the common well. Thus was the commentie
abstract and divided from the lords. So was the cite divided into two parts.
And the common well which was in ye mids between the^ on every side was
pylled / robbed / and utterly wasted of them both: on both sides. But the power
of the noble men and of their party was more mighty than the power of ye
co^mens. For all the estates were all together assembled / conjoined / and
united. But the co^mens were dispersed and spredde abroad into diverse places
and companyes getting their lyueng with labor of their hands and swet of
their bodies. So euerythyng was governed in peace and in war at pleasure and
advise of a few private noble men. The common treasoure / the prouynces /
maistershyppes / offices / tributes / worship / tryumphes / and all other
things longyng to honor or aua^tage were only in hands and possession of
the same few noble men. But the simple common people was weryed and oppressed
with poverty / with battle / and warfare. Ever in ieopardy / and never in
auantage nor lucre. For the captayns with a few other noble men pulled such
prays as were taken in battle only to their singular auantage and behofe.
But in the mean season the parents and small children of the soudyors were
driven from their dwelling places and possessions by the said noble men: echone
of them by that lord unto whom they dwelled nerest. And so the might and power
of such noble men co^ioyned with immoderate couetyse assailed / defiled /
wasted / and dystroyed every thing without good manner without measure or
moderacion: having no respect nor co^syderacion of any thing belongyng to
goodness or virtue: till they had so farforth proceeded that at conclusion they
were dystroyed and overthrown by their own obstinate pride and tyranny. But
at last as soon as euersome of the estates were found which remembryng and
consydryng themself: set more by true and laudable glory / than by iniust
power and dignite. And were moved in minds by compassion to show mercy and
pity against the co^mente and to socour their misery than began the cite to be
troubled and moved grievously for the courage of the co^mens was reuyued by
supportacion of such noble men: by means whereof discord and deuysion began to
rise in the cite / as it were dry dust of the ground raised in a great and
tempestyous wind. For after that Tiberius Gracchus / and Caius Gracchus (whose
progenitors much increased the common wayle in many batayls / but namely in
the battle of Carthage) began to restore the comme^tie into their old
liberty / and to detect the cruel misdeeds of the few injurious estates.
Than all the lords co^federate: and after manner chafed with ire assembled
their fellows / as Latynians and some knights of Rome / which in hope of
promocion left the co^mens party and held with the noble men. All these with
such as were to them lenyng of other nations began to withstand the
accuseme^tes of both the said Gaccus / which were favorers of the co^menty:
and first of all they slew Tiberius Graccus. And after that within a few
years they slew the other brother named Caius Graccus / while he was
protector of the co^menty: because that he acordyng to law and right divided
among the poor co^mente such lands as they had won in battle of their
ennemies. And at the same season the estates put to death also a lord named
Marcus Faccus / because he defended the co^mens liberte against their
extorcion. But touching the two brethern Tiberius / and Caius Graccus: sothly
their minds were greatly immoderate and unmeasurable in their desire to
overcome the states. Nevertheless it had be much better to the states to have
suffered them in their ryghtwyse tytell / and somewhat to have inclyned to their
minds than to have overcome them so violently and slain them so iniuryously /
how beit that they were over hasty and besy. But when the states had the
victory of them after their desire and pleasure than put they to death the
co^menty without nombre / and many they exiled and drove out of the cite. In
somoch that from thens forth they rather increased their cruelty and fear to
the commens / than their own honor or power. By which means many worthy
citees have often times ben dystroyed while the estates and commens contend
the one / to overcome the other / by one mean or other. And while the party
vyctoure will punysshe over grievously that party which is overcome. But if I
would prepare to write of the business and deeds of both the parties seriatly
and dystincly. And if I should touch all the manners of the cite acordyng to
the gretnesse of the matter and as it requires: othely the time should fail me
rather than the matter. Wherefore I will omyt this superfluous and infenite
besynes / and return to my first matter and purpose touching this cronycle of
this tyranne Iugurth.

How Metellus was creat consul and send by the Romans to war against
Iugurthe: and of the wise and dyscrete behauour of the same Metellus.
The.xxviii. chapyter.
AFter the truse and composicion of Aulus before said made with Iugurth / and
the foul and shamkfull flight of the romayne army: Quintus Metellus / and
Marcus Sillanus / were creat and proclaimed consuls of Rome / which acordyng to
the old custom parted and divided the prouynces belongyng to Rome between
them both. The country of Numidy fell and happened to Metellus. This Metellus
was a fierce man and a noble and a worthy warryour. And howbeit he favored the
party of the noble men and was contrary to the party of the co^mens:
nevertheless he was of fame undefiled and vnuiolat / and counted of good name
indifferently on both parties. As Soon as ever this Metellus entered in his
office and dignite / he thought that every thing apartayning to his rowm and
charge belo^ged as well to his partyng fellow as to himself / save the war of
Numidy: which only belonged to himself and to his particular charge:
Wherefore he committed all other charges to Sillanus / and only set his mind
to make prouysion for ye war against Iugurth. But because he mistrusted the
old army which was in Numidy with Albinus and Aulus / and had no co^fydence
in the minds of these soudyors corrupted with ydelnes and many other vices:
therefore he elected and assembled new soudyours. And of all such as were
fellows and friends confederate to the Romans / he called for help and
socours. He prepared and made ready armoure / wepyn / horse harnes / and all
other ordinance expedient to warfare. And also he ordained abundau^ce of
vytayls. And shortly to speak all things he ordained which are wont to be
necessary and profitable to the variable chances and incertayne accidents /
and ieopardies of war / which requires reparacion of many things and
chargeable. But such as were fellows of the empire of Rome at instau^ce and
request of the senators: and by their authorite and by the Latinians and many
other strange kings of their own frewyll sent socours to Metellus to auaunce
him in his enterprise: And shortly to speak the hole city labored withal
their might to socoure and aid Metellus in his business. Thus at last when
every thing was provided and set in order after his pleasure and intent:
than took he his iournay into Numidy / with great hope of all the cytezins of
Rome that for his good manners: and specially for that his mind was vnouerco^e
with richesse or coueryse that he should do more honor to the empire than his
predecessors had in the war of Numidy. For before his departing the wealth of
Numidy (by coueryse of the officers of Rome) was augme^ted: but the wealth of
the Romans wasted and deminisshed. When Metellus was come to Affrike / the
army was delivered unto him by Albinus: which army was vncrafty / sluggysshe /
and feeble nouther able to endure paryll nor labor / of tunge more ready / fires
/ and hardy than of hand: which was wont to rob / and pyll from fellows and
friends of the empire. But it self endured by cowardice to be robbed and
spoiled of ennemies of the empire / as a lawless and dysordred company of men
ungoverned and without authorite or manners. Wherefore Metellus the new
capytayne had much more thought and business / for such corrupt and
vicious manners of a company so far out of order / than he had help or good
hope of confort in the multitude of them. Thus how beit he saw the time of
election of new co^suls draw nere. And all if he also understood that the
Romans daily looked after some end of the war. These causes not withstandyng
yet he concluded / not to begin the war till he had excercysed and used the
soudyors with business and labor aft the instruction and custom of old
captayns / used before his time. For why Albinus was so astonyed with the
aduersite and myschaunce of his brother Aulus and for murdre of his host: that
after he purposed not to depart out of the romans province which was in
Affrike / he kept the soudyors always ydell in their tents as long as the
somer season lasted and as long as he was in authorite in somoche that they
changed no place except the corrupt sauoure of the place / or else necessite of
vitayle constrained them to remove. Nor according to the custom and manner of
warryours among them was no watch: but every man came and went at his own
pleasure / and absented themself from their standards when it lyked them. The
scolyons and pages wandered day and night mengled among the horsemen and chief
of the soudyours without any order: And many other as rouers dyspersed abroad
destroyed the country / fighting against the small villages / and not against
citees nor towns. They carried away from the said villages prays of catell:
and the inhabita^tes led away also with them as prisoners with other prays
stryuyng together who might have most / and than after changed the said
roberies with merchants for delycious and strong wynes carried from other
strange countries / where better wine grew than in that country: and for
other such delycious things. They sold away the where and other vitayles
which was delivered of their capytayns among them in common and daily they
bought their bread. And finally what ever shame or rebuke longyng to couetyse
or lechery: could outher be said / done / or ymagined of any man: all was used
in that host. And among some: more shameful deeds than ought to be named. But
Metellus hehaued him self as a mighty and wise man / not less this
difficulty and hardness / than if it had been in a battle foughte^ against
his enne^mies as he which in mids of so great couetyse / voluptuesite / and
cruelty was syngulerly endued with te^peraunce: and merueylous good manner used
he / in coartynge the same fautes. Wherefore at the first beginning he
withdrewe and avoided from the army at his commandment and ordinance: the
occasyons which styred the soudyours to such sloth / cowardyse / and
voluptuosite. For he commanded under great pain that no person should be so
hardy to sell among the soudyours nouther bread nor other vitayle all reddy
dressed save the common prouisyon: that the pages / waterlaggers and scolyons
should not come nere the army / nor follow the same. That none of the common and
simple sodyours should keep or mentayne servant nor be in their tents nor
vyage / while they moved fro place to place. These inconuenyences first of all
he redressed and reformed. After these amended: all other fautes he mesured by
his wisdom / craft / and policy: refourmynge them by little and little. This
done (to have his soudyours occupied) he moved daily from place to place: and
that not in ways common and used / but by hard and unoccupied ways. He
caused them daily to cast dychesse and trenches about the army / to the intent
that they should not wax slothful / nor vicious by ouermoch rest and
idleness. He ordained often watch among them every night: and he himself
acompanyed with his under captayns and heed officers often serched if the
watches were truly kept / co^passyng about the army on every side. While they
removed and changed places: sometime he was in the forward and among the
first: sometime in the rerewarde or hinder part / and anon in the mids
ouerseynge their order to the intent that none should pass out of order / array
/ and place to them assigned. But keep thick together every man and company
about their own standerdes: and also he ordained that among themself they
should convey and carry their own vitayles and armoure. And thus in short time
he confermed and set the army in good order rather with fair words / or
rebukyng and blamyng their fautes: and prohybityng their dysorder: than in
chastisyng or punysshyng their offenses with rygour or cruelty.

Of the behauour of Iugurth against Metellus: and how he send ambassadors to
Metellus requyring unfeignedly to yield up the kingdom of Numidy to the empire
of Rome: And how Metellus behaved himself against the same ambassadors.
The.xxix. chapyter.
IN the mean season when Iugurthe understood by messangers and espyes of this
behauour of Metellus: and also wha^ he remembered that which was infourmed to
him at Rome of the integryte and undefiled name of Metellus / which would not
be corrupt with money nor accloyed with brybes like other before: he began to
mystruste his matters and to have less confydence in his cause / thanne ever
he had before. In somoche that than he began to labor to yield himself
unfeignedly / and to make a true composytion with Metellus / and the Romans
without any fyction / gyle / or disceyt. Wherefore he send ambassadors with
supplicacions and peticions / requyring humbly of Metellus to grant to him his
own life: and the life of his children only: and concerning all other things
he would yield them into hands of the romans. But Metellus knew well enough
long before this time by often experience and proof yt the Numidians of
natural disposicion were unfaithful / mouable / and unstable of minds:
newfangled and much desirous of new business and newelties. Wherefore he
began with the ambassadors of Iugurth / tastyng and prouyng the mind of each
of them / by little and little: and separatly one by one. And when he knew
that they somewhat inclined to his purpose: he than promised to them great
gifts and promocion so that they would do some pleasure for him and for the
senators and people of Rome. Than at last he counsayled and desired them to
deliver Iugurth to him alive specially if it might be brought about: and if
they could not so / than to deliver him outher quick or deed. But when he had
made this apoyntement secretly with thembassadours divided in sonder one by
one: than openly (that every man might here) he showed to them all together
other things as his pleasure was that they should certyfie their king Iugurth
concerning their embassade. After this within few days when he saw his
host most ready and contrary to Iugurth he removed his tents and so addressed
him with his army ready in array and went forward into Numidy: where contrary to
any similitude of war the vyllages and cotages were full of men / the feldes
full of beestes and tylmen: and every where was much plenty of people young
and old namely rude people and tyllers of the ground / which had still fled
before the army in foretyme for fear / but at the last when they saw no
defense nor socoure / the kings lewtenantes and all other left their towns /
villages / and lodges / and went forth to mete Metellus withal humilite /
honor / and service submittyng themself to him / and ready to give to him
whete and other corn such as they had. And to carry vitayles after his host
to ease the soudyours and to do and parfourme all other things what ever they
were commanded. But for all this: Metellus was not less diligent nor
circumspect in orderyng of his host / but proceeded forward together with his
army i^ array ready in armoure / and defended as if their ennemies had been nere
at hand searching the country abroad on every side by his espyes doutynge
treason and thynkyng that all these tokens of subjection were but for a face or
cloak to cover the treason and gyle of Iugurth. And so by such dyscet to wayt
a time to execute his treason. Wherefore Metellus thus mysdemynge kept himself
in the forward of the host with an elect and chosen company of archers /
slyngers / and other like soudyours appointed in light harnes. His under
captain Caius Marius had rule and charge of the rerewarde among the horsemen
and on both the wings of his host he ordained horsemen and other soudyours
for supplement / subsidy / and socouts of the forward if need should require /
and among them to expel their ennemies on what side so ever they should come
/ were mengled bowmen and other light harnysed fotemen with darts / pykes /
and iauelyns to trouble the horsemen of their ennemies. For in Iugurth was so
much gyle so great experience and knowledge of the country / and also so
great practyse of chyualrie: that a man could not well know whether he were
more to be douted or more grievous in peace or i^ ware or while he was absent or
present.

Not far from that way which Metellus held with his army was a town of the
Numidyans much acustomed and frequented of marchantes of Italy and other
strange countries: and the princypall market town of all the kingdom of
Numidy. This town was named Vacca / Metellus drew him and his army thither /
and set garnyson into the same town. This did he to prove the minds of the
inhabytantes: for if they had kept forth the garnyson / thanne should they
euydently have declared themself ennemies of the romans. And also he led a
garnyson thither to the intent to have taken the town by force of arms / if the
inhabytauntes would not have admytted the same garnyson. Also he commanded
vytayls / and all other things necessary or expedyent to war for to be
brought thither thinking (as the case required) that the concours of marchantes
resortyng thither. And his good provision of vytayls should be great defense and
conseruacyon for him and his army both in war and in peace. But when the
citezins saw such purueyance as he made of vitels considring that he should
not hurt nor disprouyde them while he had vytell enough of his own prouysion:
anon they opened the gates and suffered him to enter withal his garnyson and
retynue. But in the mean time Iugurth again send his ambassadors to Metellus
more diligently and instau^tly than he had done before / mekely besechyng and
requyring him of peace: And yeldyng unto him every thing / only reserved his
own life: and the life of his children. Metellus send these ambassadors home
again attysed to the prodycion of their master Iugurth as he had done to the
other ambassadors which were sent before. But concerning ye peace which they
desired in their masters name: nouther he granted nor utterly denied it. And
in this prolongynge of time he looked always after parfourmynge of the promise
of the other ambassadors / which before had granted to the betrayeng of
Iugurth. But when Iugurth consydred and pondered together the words and deeds
of Metellus / and when he parceyued in mind himself assailed with his own
crafts of subtylte: and that Metellus used such crafts against him / as he
himself had used against other: than was his mind grieved most of all. For
Metellus feigned peace / but in very deed he showed sharp war. Iugurth thus
co^sydred also: that his greattest town named Vacca / was alienate and lost
from him: his ennemies by long continuance and exercise knew the coostes of
his country of Numidy. The minds of his lords and co^mens were provoked and
moved against him. When he aduysed these difficulties with other mo contrary to
him he concluded and fully determined at last to resyst and withstane Metellus
in battle / with strength and force of arms and no farther to meke nor
submit himself by peticion.

How Iugurth prepared and addressed himself again to war: and what
ordinance and policy he used against the new consul Metellus. The.xxx.
chapyter.
Wherefore Iugurth thus determyninge to assail Metellus cause his ways to be
espied / having hope of victory by auauncement and advantage of some place:
where he intended of the place and country: and anon prepared the greattest
army yt he could of all sorts of people. This done / he did so much that by
hills / narowe passages and by paths he prevented an ouerpassed the host of
Metellus.

In that part of Numidy which before in deuysion of the kingdom was assigned
in possessyon to Adherball: was a flodde named Muthull / rennyng from the
meridyonall part of the country. A certain hill hy and long was nere to this
water / so that at any place the hill was about.xx. mile from the streme and of
equal dystance in length. The ground of this hill was of such nature that
ever it was barayne / wherefore it was not apt to men's habitacion but desert.
About the mids and pendant of it was an other hill smaller of quantite: but
of an unmeasurable heght covered and all ouergrowen with wild olyue trees /
with myr trees / and other sorts of trees wont to grow naturally on dry and
sandy ground. The plain between the hills and the water was desert and
uninhabitable for lack of water: save such places of the plain as were nere to
ye flodd of Muthull which part was grown with small trees and occupied with
men and beestes. Iugurth came to the said small hill which descended from the
penda^t of the hill greatter overthwart the valey. And there took place with his
army not together but dispersed abroad among the trees by companyes and bendes
/ he made his friend Bomilchar captain and governor of his oliphantes / and
of part of his army of fotemen and infourmed him parfitely how he should
behave himself and govern them whom he had committed to him both before the
battle / and also in the battle when it came to the point. But he himself
drew nerer to the great hill withal the horsemen and many of the fotemen
which were elect and chosen men / and set them in order and array with much
policy and wisdom. This done: he himself went about and compassed every
company / cohort / and bend syngulerly: and one by one warning and requyringe
them to call to their minds their old strengthes nobles / and victory: and
there by to defend themself and their country of Numidy from the immoderate
couetyse of the romans / which were not content nor tatisfied with the
possession of the most part of the world / saying fathermore that they should
fight but with such as they before had auercome and subdued. And how beit
they had changed their capytayne: the cowardice of their hertes was not
changed: Also he rehearsed and declared to the^ that he had made all provision
for them which a captain mygh or ought to make for his army. He declared how
he had taken for them the upper place: that they were crafty in battle and
many in nombre: and should fight with a few vncrafty cowardes. Wherefore he
desired and exhorted them when time should come that than they would be ready to
assail the Romans manly at sound of the trumpettes / for that one same day
said he should outher establisshe all their labors / victories / and
besynesses: or else it* should be the heed and beginning of their most great
myschyefe / and dystruccion. Moreover through out all his army he put them in
remembrance man by man of ye benefits which he had done to them before for
their manly deeds of chyualry: as such as for their worthynes he had rewarded
with dignite / money / offices / or other worship: and showed such unto other
common soudyours saying that if they would so demean themself manly: so
should they be promoted and auanced to worship and riches. And thus he
conforted them all every man after his manners and co^dicions / some with gifts
/ some with promesses / some with thretnynges / and other like ways acordynge
to the disposicion of their minds and nature. While Iugurth thus exhorted his
soudyours Metellus naught knowing of his ennemies apered with his company
dysce^dyng down the pendant of the great hill which at first seeing but few
men much marueyled what it might signify / for he suspected nothing less
than battle: but in beholding more inte^tyfly toward the top of the small
hill before him he espied among the young trees both horse and men which were
not fully hyd / because of the lowness of the trees. yet was he incertayne
what it might be. For what by secretnes of the place: and what by gyle of
Iugurth / their baners and the most part of the soudyours were obscured and hyd
lyeng down upon the ground. But anon after when he parceyued this gyle and
treason: by little and little / he set his army in array procedynge forward
still / as he did before / faynynge himself ignorant of the treason. But he
changed the order of his soudyours: and on the right wynge which was next to
the Numidyens his ennemies / he ordained as it were a forward enforced with a
threfolde subsidy or socoures that is to say with three bendes of proved
soudyours to rescue and help them when need should be. The archers such as
which slings should cast against their enmis plu^mettes of led and iron / and
all other which were of light harnes: all these he divided among the
standerdes of other soudyours as the case required: where as after the right
ordinance of battle / such soudyours by them self divided should begin the
battle / but in this battle the sytuacion of the place not so required. All
the hole company of his horsemen he ordered in the extremitees and corners of the
forefront of the battle. This done as the breuyte of the time suffered he made
a short exhortacion unto his soudyors / and so proceeded forth with his host
set in array in manner beforesayd: but because Iugurth was on the small hill
before him and by that mean on the hyer ground he thought to remedy that
inco^modite and led forth his host on the side half not toward Iugurth / but
alonge on the hill toward the flodde of Muthull / into the plain which was
between the hill and the flood. But when he saw the Numidyens quyed and that
they departed not from the hill which they had taken he co^sydred the hete and
feruentnes of the somer season. And list his army might perysshe for lack or
scarcite of water: he sent before one of his capitayns named Rutilius with a
company of light harnessed soudyours and part of his horsemen unto the flodde
named Muthull for to take up a place wherein they might set their tents in time
of need: thynkyng that his en^emies wyllyng to continue long in that place by
often assau^es and scarmysshes should disturb the romans while they resorted
to the water. And for asmoche as the Numidiens trusted not much in their
strength and armoure. He thought that they purposed and intended to trouble his
sodyors with werynes and thurst. When Rutilius was gone toward the water /
Metellus descended procedyng forth withal by little and little as the matter
and place required: he commanded one named Marius / with his company to keep
in the rerewarde. But Metellus himself with the horsemen kept him in the lift
wyng of the forward of the battle / which always removed forward first of
all his army.

Of the first battle foughten between Metellus and Iugurth. The.xxxi. chapyter.
But when Iugurth saw that the rereward of Metellus was passed his forward:
he be set the hill from which Metellus dyscended with two thousand fotemen by
which garnyson if Metellus would again take socour of the same hill / he should
be prohibyted and driven bacwarde again into the hands of Iugurth. This done:
suddenly he did the tru^petes to be blown and anon withal / invaded and set
upon the company of Metellus on every side. The Numidyens assailed and beat
down the romans / some on the rereward and other some did their deuoyre to
break the array on both sides: both on the right and lift wyng / withal their
might assaylyng the romans / and auaunsyng themself on every side to break
their array and ordinance. And after their power to trouble / dystourbe / and
deuyde them. The romans which were most stable and bold of minds in metyng
their ennemies were abused and dysceyued with the uncertain battle. For their
ordinance and array was set and strengthed only but on one side. But their
ennemies assailed them on every side: so that sometime they were stryken and
wounded of their ennemies from far of / but by no means could they stryke
their ennemies again nor join with them. For Iugurth had taught his Numidiens
on horsbake before the battle that when they should begin to assail the
romans: they should not keep themself together / nor nere / but asmoche
dyspersed as they could / and in diverse places: one company here and and other
there. And where the soudyours of Iugurth could not auoyed nor repel the
romans which assailed them / because they were mo in nombre: thefore they
compassed and trapped them behind or on the sides betyn of: and dysioyned from
their company. And where it fortuned any of them to fle the Numidyans had more
auantage than the romans. For where they fled into the feldes: they assailed
the romans on the back half or else on both sides in diverse companyes. But
where they saw it was more avail and expedient to fle again to the hill
where they set first their ordinance. They had also auantage thereby for their
horses were acustomed to mountains and combred ways / wherefore they mounted
with less difficulty / but in contrary wise the romans for the sharpnes of
the hills and lack of use could not follow them in their asse^dyng without
much difficulte / pain / and paryll. But not withstanding that Iugurth and
his men had the most auantage of the country and ground / yet the battle on
both sides was variable / uncertain / ungoodly / and miserable to behold: for
the best men sonest were slain and in most ieopardy. For the courage and
valyant minds and bold hertes of the romans: was worth the gyle and treason
of the Iugurthyns: and so on both sides he which was boldest and most
auau^ced himself was sonest overthrown. Some which were divided from their
own company and in hands of their ennemies / gave place to them and yielded
themself. And again some followed and chased their ennemies fleyng: where they
might make theirperty good: there resysted either party manly. None of both
parties kept under their standerdes: nor followed not the order of battle: nor
kept none order nor array / but every man resysted and defended himself there
where most ieopardy and paryll was laid to him: and endeuoyred himself to
withstand the vyolence of his ennemis with hye valyantise. And so the armor
defensyfs / darts / me^ horse / Romans / Numidyans / soudyours / and pages
were all confounded and mengledde together: without orde or ordinance observed.
Nothing was done with dyscression of the soudyours nor with counsel of the
captayns: unadvised fortune and chance governed all the bysynesse of that day:
so unstable was the battle. All was committed to rule of fortune / And thus
passed forth much of the day in great murder and slaughter / yet still was the
end of the battle uncertain and none knew whytherpartye should have the
vyctorye. At last both parties with labor and heat began to languysshe and
become weary. Metellus understanding that the Numidyans less resysted
infyghtyng than they did before assembled and gathered together again his
soudyours by little and little / and without tarry restored the array and set
them again in order. And.iiii. cohortes taken forth of the legyons he set
against the fotemen of his ennemies. But before Metellus had thus assembled his
company: a great part of them oppressed with wounds and werynesse / withdrewe
the^self to the hill before named and to the hyer places from the battle there
to refresshe and rest themself. But when Metellus (as said is) had reasembled
them again: he began infewe words to pray and exhort them in such manner.

O worthy and trusty soudyours and companyons dyscourage not your self in this
battle / nor let not your old nobleness now fail you: suffer not your
ennemies wont to put their trust in flight / now to overcome you by your
ferefull minds. Remember well: if ye be dysposed cowardly to fle: ye have no
tents / no cities / no towns / no castles / nor no manner places of defense:
whereto ye may run for refuge and save your self. your health / your hope /
and defense is only in your armoure and strength: and specially in your bold
hertes. Wherefore dear friends remember your old worship: and suffer not the
hole empire of Rome to suffer dysworshyp by your temerous and cowardes minds.
Remember it worthyer to die in battle like men than to fle / and than to be
taken and murdered like beestes / or to dye in prison. With these words and
such like Metellus reco^forted the hertes of his soudyours. But in mean time
Iugurth for his part was not idle / quiet nor less provident: but compassed
and went about his men co^fortyng and exhortyng them also and praising their
deeds. He renewed the battle also for his part: and among the mids of his
elect soudyours he fought and proved thextremite of every thing: and assayd all
means whereby any auantage might be won co^forting and socourynge his men
with words / deeds / and example. He boldly fought and assailed such of the
romans as were in fear or dout: and such as he knew and proved bold and
steadfast / he kept them of with arowes / iauelyns / and darts that they could
not approach to their fellows to auaunce them nor to be socoured of them. Thus
two worthy men noble and exelcent captayns fought and co^tended together between
themself. They themself like in strength / courage / wisdom / and policy:
but of things longyng to chyualry unlike of provision. For Metellus had
strength of soudyours sufficiently: but the auantage of the country and place
was much contrary to him. But Iugurth had every thing necessary and expedyent
/ save company of men of arms which he wanted. At last the romans when they
understood that there was no sure place whereto they might fle: and also that
they could find no means to fight with their ennemies indifferently hand to
hand. And that the night was come upon them: at last they ascended upon the
top of an hill which was over against them like as Metellus their captain
commanded them to do. For the Numidyans had lost that place and were fled
and spredde a broad dyspersed / but few of them were slain. For they were
swyfte: and the country was not well known to the Romans to pursue them:
whereby many of the Numidyans were defended: and so by flight escapedde. But
Iugurth with his horsemen of guard for his body: fledd also from the batell
when he had long foughten and saw none avail nor auantage.

How Bomylchar vndercaptayne of Iugurth and his company were dysconfited by
Rutilyus vndercaptayne of Metellus. The.xxxii. chapyter.
IN the mean season Bomylchar / who^ Iugurth had made master of his elyphantes
/ and of a part of the fotemen (as I have written before) as soon as he saw
that Rutilius (which Metellus had sent unto the flodde of Muthull to provide a
place for their tents) was ouerpassed his company: by little and little he
conuayed and led down his company into a plain. And while this Rutilius
hasted him toward the flodde as he was commanded of Metellus. Bomilchar set
his company in order and array still and quietly as the matter and case
required. And in mean time he forgot not to search by espies what Metellus did
/ and what way Rutilius took toward the said flodde: and in what manner he
behaved himself and gyded his army. Wherefore after he understood by his espyes
that Rutilius with his company had taken their place by the said flodde where
he would abide: and was void of besynes / quiet / and doutyng no paryll. And on
the other side when he understood that the cry of the battle between Iugurth
and Metellus increased: he feared lest Rutilius (if he understood thereof) would
leave his place by the flodde: and return to the battle to socour his fellows
which were in ieopardy. In this consideracion Bomilchar: where as before he had
ordered his army nere together by craft and that because he mystrusted the
courage of his men: and in their boldness had no great confidence. Therefore
now again he divided them a broad much larger than they were before: and so
proceed toward the tents of Rutilyus / to the intent to let him and his
company on every side / if they prepared toward rescous of Metellus. Rutilyus
and his company suspectynge no peril sodaynlie of unware aduysed great
vyolence of smoke and duste styred up and raised by mouynge of the ground: but
what it might be they could not parceyue by any mean because of the thickness
of the young trees that grew on all the ground between them which let
their sight. First of all they thought it had proceeded of drines of the ground
by mouyng of the wind. But afterward when they saw the same smoke and dust
continue still after one manner: and that the same approached always nerer and
nerer likewise as the company of their ennemies moved and drew toward them.
Than they parceyued and knew the matter as it was: and in all have every man
took to him his harness: and stood ready before the defense of their te^res as
their captain Rutilyus had ordered and commanded them every man ready at
defense and in array. After when their ennemies approached nerer with an horrible
noise and cry / they ran together on both parties. The Numidyens did but
only co^tynue the skirmysshe abiding and lokyng after their elypha^tes in
help of whom was all their trust. But when they saw that their elypha^tes
were stopped and let with thyckenesse of the bows of the treis: and so
tarried and kept from their socours by the co^passyng of the romans so that in
them was no trust of socours. Than all they took them to flight with all their
power. But many of the^ (leuyng their armor behind them) escaped without
wound by help of the hills which were about the place: which they could
better and quicklyer ascend than the romans. And also by socour of the
darkness of the night (which than was at hand) many of them escaped hole and
sound and saved themself. Four of the elyphantes were taken and all the
remena^t (forty in nombre) were slain. When this was done: the company of
Rutilius / not withstanding that they were fatigate and weryed with great
iourneis before / and also with much labor in orderyng of their tents: and
with the said battle or skirmysshe: nevertheless when they saw that Metellus
their chief captain tarried longer than they thought he would have done if all
thing had happened well with him / they ordered themself ready and diligently
went backwarde again to mete him. For the falshode and gyle of Iugurth and of
the Numidyans caused them to be besy / dilligent / and circumspect in every
thing for sauegard of their lives / and suffered them to do nothing slouly nor
with delayeng. But when they were in their journey in the darkness of the
night the companyes on both parties were not fare in sondre the one from the
other: and both parties approached together not knowing each other as if they
had been ennemies. The one against the other making noise and clamor each one
increasyng fear to other as warryours ar wont to do at beginning of a battle.
Insomoch that a miserable dystruction and murdre had almost ben committed
between them by their imprude^t negligence / if the espyes and horsemen which
were sent between them on both sides had not with more diligence and wyselyer
espied the treuth of the matter. But when the parties knew each other / their
sadness and fear turned to great joy and gladness. The soudyours joyfully
anon met together one salutyng and welcomy^g other. One showed to other their
acts done on both parties: and joyous they were to here on both sides every
man commendyng and exaltyng their own deeds / and also the deeds of other unto
heaven with myrthe and gladness. And that as well such as were worthy men as
unworthy cowardys ascrybed to themself worthynesse. And certes in such
business it often happens / that on that side which has the victory: such
as be but cowardes / rude and vncrafty / exalts them / enjoys / and may
bost themself on other men's deeds and worthynesse. But in contrary wise on
that party which is ouercom though many be good warryours / noble and worthy
men: yet ar they reputed for cowardes without policy / because of other men's
cowardyse and aduersyte of fortune. Thus fares it in skirmysshes of battle.
But when Metellus and Rutilius (as I have said before) were met together and
rehearsed their acts one to other Metellus hasted him withal his army to the
flodd of Muthull / and tarried in the places and tents which Rutilius had
prepared and seiourned there the space of four days. In this season he was
besy in refresshyng and healyng his soudyours which were wounded / such as
manly had behaved themself in the battle he worthily rewarded them / he
called them together all into one company and greatly landed and commended them:
thankyng and much praysyng them for the great dilyge^ce / pain / and labors:
which they had taken in defense of the honor and dignite of their empire with
such words. O worthy soudyours ye se now that the hardest of our labor is
ouerpassed by your boldness and manhood: wherefore I exhort you: be ye of like
courage in the resydue of our business / which shall be but light and easy in
comparyson of this which is ouerpassed. The beginning and first brunt of every
business is hardest. Which shall be but light unto bold and circu^spect
begynners and constant folowers of their enterprises. But this beginning ye
have manly overcome by constant labor as thing most easy. enough have we
foughten all ready for the glory of victory: for that have we optayned in this
first co^flyer. If we labor or fight any more it shall be but only for prays
and robberies of our ennemies: whereby we shall be enryched in substance: like as
we now be inhaunced with glory of victory. Wherefore my dear fellows and most
constant friends of the common wealth now I exhort you for co^plement of all
your honorable fame: to remember your old and acustomed worthynesse. And
suffer not this excellent honor and glory which ye have now optayned by
boldness: to be quenched and decay again by ignomynious cowardyse.

With such words and many other like Metellus reconforted his company: and
maruelously kyndled their courage to the desire of honor by valyant feats of
arms. But in ye mean season the known gyle of Iugurth went not from his
mind: and therefore to exclude all danger of treason he sent forth certain of
the Numidiens / which betraynge Iugurth had forsaken him and fled to the
romans: and also with the^ he sent forth diverse other of his own company
which were expert of the country / and oportune to such business to search
and espy among what people or in what place Iugurth held himself: and wherein
he was ocupyed. Whyther he kept him with a small company: or whyther he had an
army reassembled for a new battle / and how he behaved himself and where
about he went sith he was overcome. But Iugurth had conuayed himself into such
places as were full of dychesse / valeis / hills / treis / busshes / and dales
defended of nature. And there had he assembled again a new army of men / mo
in no^bre than he had before. But they were but vncraftie / inerpert / and dull
to batell: and could better till the ground and keep beestes / than excercyse
the deeds of chiualry. For thereto had they never ben used before: but in the
other seruyle ocupacio^s and business had they ben ocupyed all their lyftyme
without intermixtion of other ocupacion. It fortuned that Iugurth had none
other soudyours / but such rural people about him at this time namely for
this cause. For when he fled from the battle foughten before with Metellus /
none of all his soudyours followed him / except the horsemen of his guard. For
all the other soudyours departed where it lyked them best. Nor this is not
counted nor reputed for any fault or rebuke among the Numidyens soudyours. For
such is the custom of the country: when the captain flees the host
forsakes him.

what wast and dystruction Metellus made in the land of Numidy after this
first battle and flight of Iugurth: and of the gyle of Iugurth against
Metellus. The.xxxiii. chapter.
WHa^ Metellus understood by his espyes that the mind of Iugurth continued yet
still in his old fyersnesse and cruelty though he was lately overcome in
battle. And when Metellus saw that Iugurth renewed the war again and
prepared a new battle which could not be done but at pleasure of Iugurth /
because he had taken such a place to abide in that no man could conveniently
co^tende with him for dyfficultie thereof. Metellus thus knowing advised
himself of many things. Namely he consydred that they were not in different
and egall on both parties in executyng thereof. For all if that he had the
upper hand over Iugurth and had put him to flight: yet lost he mo men and had
more damage in ouercomyng him / than Iugurth had which was overcome. For this
consyderacion Metellus purposed no more to contend with him in plain feldes
nor in ordered battle / but by an other manner to execute the war with him
from thensforthe. This determined: Metellus with his hole host and ordinance
went forth into the most rich and plentyfull places of all Numidy / and there
wasted and dystroyed the feldes and country on every side. He took without any
resystence castles and towns / not strongly defended with walls / dychesse /
nor garnyson. And brent and beat them down to the ground. All such as came
in his way and were able to bear harness: full grown of age or apt to
battle: he slew and ryd out of hand. Thinking that the mo he slew the
fewer adversaries and ennemies should he have to contend against him. He
commanded his soudyors to spare no robbery nor prays: but gave althyng to
havoc among his soudyours. For fear of this cruelty many of the Numidyens
yielded themself to the romans: and gave unto them hostages / vytayls /
sodyours / and all other things necessary abunda^tly. Insome towns which
were taken: Metellus set defense and garnyson where need required and
fortified them sufficiently. This business troubled the mind of Iugurth much
more than the battle that was foughten before to his great damage and
disconfort of his men. For he lost more people by this way than by any other
mean before. Thus Iugurth which before put all his hope and trust in his
flight: was now of necessite compelled to follow and pursue his ennemies: and
he which could not defend his own places which still remained in his
possession: was constrained now to war in those coostes / which Metellus had
won of him to recover them if fortune would suffer him. Nevertheless of such
poor shyft and counsel as ^e had he took the best which could be taken by his
advise in such extreme necessite. He commanded his army for the most part to
remain still in the same place where they were. And he himself with a company
of horsemen which were bold and chosen men ensued Metellus privily / making
his iouneis by night time by / by ways and secret valeis. And at last suddenly
of vnwa^s he fell upon a part of the romans which were dispersed a broad from
the host in foragynge and spoylinge. Many of them without armoure were slain
/ and many taken. None of them all escaped clean nor fre without damage / but
outher were s^ayne orels sore wounded. When Iugurth had done this skyrmisshe
anon he withdrue himself and his company into the hills and mountains next
to them: before any socours or rescous might come from Metellus to revenge
their treason and death of the romans.

Of the great joy which was demeaned at Rome for this worthy behauour of
Metellus: and how he gyded himself and his army to continue and augment this
honor which he had gotten. The.xxxiiii. chapyter.
While Metellus and Iugurth stryued thus together: the one with manhood /
wisdom and strength: the other with treason / craft / and gyle: Tidings were
brought to Rome of this noble behauour of Metellus. Over all the cite was
demeaned great joy and gladness for that Metellus behaved himself and gyded
his army acordyng to ye manner and ordinance of old noble capitayns of the
romans before his days. And howbeit he was in place aduers and contrary to him
yet had he the upper hand of his ennemies as victory over them. And by his
strength and manhood he had in possession the country of his ennemies: and had
driven them from place to place. All these things co^sydred: they much
rejoiced and greatly commended Metellus: namely for that he had caused Iugurth
to put his trust of health only in fleyng into the mou^tayns and wilderness /
which before was magnificent and proud by the fear and cowardyse of Aulus
predecessor of Metellus. Wherefore for these fortunat and glorious deeds of
Metellus / the senators decreed and commanded over all the cite sacrifices
and suffrages to be done to their ydolles. The citezyns which before were
ferefull and sore troubled doutyng the unsure chance and incertayne fortu^e of
the end of this war: demened now among them myrthe and gladness ouerall.
The honor and fame of Metellus was recou^ted very noble / excellent / and
glorious in every man's mouth. Wherefore he somoche was the more dyligent and
labored more besely toward the vyctore laboringe and hastynge to finysshe the
war by all means and ways so it might be to his honor and confusion of
Iugurth. But nevertheless he was well ware from puttyng himself in danger of
his ennemies: and was ware exchuynge oportunite of their gyle in every place
where he went. He remembered well and co^sydred that often after laud and
glory follows envy and evil will. And therefore how much more noble that he
was reputed: the more besy and dilygent he was to mentayne his fame and honor
/ and in dread to lose this worthy fame which he had optayned. Nor after the
foresaid gyle of Iugurth he suffered not his host to divide nor to depart
themself dysparsed one from other: nor to make excourses to forage or spoil
in diverse places far dystant in sondre. But when they had need outher of man's
meat or horsemeate: all the horsemen with great co^panyes of the fotemen /
went forth and kept them nere about such as were send forth to make
provision to defend and socour them: if need should require. Metellus himself
divided his host in two parts: the one part he kept with himself: and the
other he committed to a noble warrior of his host named Marius / between them
both they dystroyd and wasted the country on every side / but rather with fire
than with robbry or prays. Metellus and Marius set their tents in two places
not far dista^t in sondre. But when any perylous or nedy business was to be
done with Iugurth or his company which required great might: than anon Metellus
and Marius were ready together: but they kept themself thus in sonder in diverse
places to trouble the Numidie^s / and increase their fear more largely in
every co^st: and to make them fle and avoid fer abroad in compass for fear.
At this season Iugurth ensued by the hills and desert places sekyng and
espyeng a convenient season or place to make some skyrmysshe with the romans
(that is to say) if he coud espy any parcel of them sekyng forth fountayns of
water for the army of the which was much penury in those costs. If he might
any such espy than anon would he break down from the hills upon them. Sometime
he showed himself to Metellus / sometime to Marius / sometime he would assemble
his company together in a bend as if he would fight with the romans to attempt
them / and anon aft would he return again unto the mountains. And
afterward suddenly appear again thretnyng now the one company of the romans
/ and now the other. yet would be neither aue^ture battle nor suffer neither
the romans to be idle or in rest / nor yet himself. His mind was only set
to keep his ennemies from their beginning and purpose of distroyeng of the
country which they intended.

How Metellus besyeged Samam one of the strongest towns of Numidy: and how
Marius under captain of Metellus escaped the danger of Iugurth. The.xxxv.
chapter.
When Metellus saw him self so weryed with the gyles and crafts of Iugurth /
and that by no policy he could have faculty or time to fight with him in plain
battle: at last he concluded to besyge and assail a great town named zamam /
which was the most chief and strongest hold of all the realm of Numidy in
that part of the land where it was builded. And so sped him thither withal his
army and ordinance where the said hold was (thynkyng as the matter required)
that Iugurth would draw thither for defense of his chife town and for socour
and relefe of his people and so should the battle be there foughten between
them. But wha^ Metellus was in his journey thyderwarde / anon were certain of
his army which fled to Iugurth and certified him of this provision and
interprise of Metellus. When Iugurth hereof was certified he hasted him by great
iourneis so that he ouerpassed the company of Metellus and came to the town of
zamam before him: and there exhorted the inhabitants boldly to defend the
walls. And farthermore assigned to socour and help them all such as had fled
from the romans / and had brought him those tidings. These treatours were the
surest men which Iugurth had. For they could not dysceyue him / but if they
would yield them again to the romans whom they had forsaken and betrayed
which thing was not sure to them to do. When Iugurth had joined these soudyours
to the garnison and socours of the town and castle / and had ordered and
appointed all other things acordynge to his mind: than he promised to be there
again with them with all his hole army in time of need. This done he departed
from the town into the most preuy and secret places which he knew in his
country thereby But when Metellus was in his journey toward zaman / he send
Marius for provision of whete and other corn and vitayle for the army unto a
town named Sicca / which was the first town that forsook Iugurth and was
yielded to Marius after the battle late foughten with Iugurth to his great
damage. When Iugurth had knowledge hereof he went thither by night privily with
his elect soudyors so that when Marius had sped his matters and was ready to
depart forth of the town: Iugurth was ready at the gates to assail the
romans cruelly cryeng with a hye voice to them of the town and exhorting
them to assail the romans also on the back half: saying that fortune had
offered to them the chance of a noble act / of an excellent and glorious deed:
so that (if they would follow his desire) they should restore him again into
his kingdom and themself into their liberty and from thensforth pass their
time without peril / without danger or dread. And certaynely if Marius had not
boldly and strongly broken out of the town with his standerdes and men of
arms through the thickest of his ennemies which were in the gates. All they
of the town or the most part would have broken their oath and promise / which
they had made before to Metellus when they first yielded themself and the cite
is him. The minds of the Numidiens be so unsteadfast and mouable. But Iugurth
so conforted his soudyours that they resysted the romans a little season. But
wha^ Marius and his company began to increase their violence against the
Iugurthyns and more fiercely to prease upon them. Anon some were slain and
the resydue fled with their master Iugurth. This danger ouerpassed: Marius
departed thens toward the town of zaman / and at the last came thither safe
with all his company and business sped wherefore he was sent.

This Samam was a town bylded in the plain ground without hills or waters
nere it defended rather by ye warke of man's hand / than by nature of the
place. In it failed nothing necessary to battle. For it was well garnissed
both with men / ordinance / vitayls / and armor. Anon when Marius was come:
Metellus acordynge to the time and place made ready all things necessary and
compassed the walls on every side with his army: assignynge to every one of his
vndercapitayns a separate place of the town to assail and there to do his
deuoyre and show his manhood. When every thing was thus ordered Metellus
commanded to sound to the assaut with trumpettes and cla^yons. The romans
immediately assailed the town on every side with horrible noise and clamoure. The
Numidiens thereof were not a drad at all: but abode still and kept them self in
silence as if they had not ben displeased nor provoked to battle: howebeit
they kept the walls every man on the part to him assigned and all were ready to
resyst and to assail the romans. Anon the battle was begone. The romans
exercysed and occupied themself every man with such wepyn as he coud best
handell and was most expert in: some with slings thrue plummettes of leed /
and some stones from a far into the cite / and at them which defended the
walls / some assailed the town nerer inuadyng the same / and couetyng to have
enter and undermining the walls / some boldly escaled walls desirynge to come
so nere that they might fight hand to hand. On the othersyde thinhabitauntes
of the town and garnyson resysted manly. Some rolled down and ouertourned
great and weyghty stones on such as were nerest to them / and that undermined
the walls. Some pytched down upon them darts / iauelyns / pykes /
firebrandes: and also great brennynge polles / faggottes / and blockys
ouercouered with pytche and bre^stone ardenly flaming. Some boldly ouertourned
the scalyng ladders and slew and ouerthrue such as scaled the walls But some
other which were farther from the town and for prease could not approach nere
to the walls in the mean season were another fearful nor ydell. For there was
no manner instrument of battle which could be thrown with hand / or with any
other ingyne of battle: but that they thrue it into the town / wherewith they
wounded and slew many of the inhabitants and of the defenders of the walls.
The darts and crosbowes on both parties were not unoccupied. Artellery nor
gonnes had they none. For at that time was no mention of them nor they were not
yet invent. The romans which were farthest of all from the walls escaped not
fre: but with darts were overthrown in great nombre. How beit their
cowardous and fearful minds caused them to draw themself aloufe behind all
other for to save themself / yet could they not avoid the paryll. Thus were
the w^rthy and unworthy of the romans in like ieopardy and paryll: but their
glory and fame was much unlike.

How Iugurth assailed and invaded the tents of the romans in the meantyme
while Metellus gave assaut to the town of zammam. The.xxxvi. chapyter.
While the assaut continued thus at zammam / with great murdre and destruction
on both perties: Iugurth suddenly and of unware stale down from the mountains
where he was hyd / and with a great power of men assailed and invaded the
romans tents while the soudyours whom Metellus had assygned to the ward and
defense of them were within the same at their rest: and suspecting nothing
less than any such assaut. Wherefore Iugurth brake in upon them unprovided.
The romans were sore abashed of that soden fear. And every man provided for
himself / acordynge to his manners and dysposycion. Some which were cowardes
fled withal their might / some other valiant and bold herted men drew to
their harnes and manly withstode their ennemies. Nevertheless the most part
of them all were / outher wounded or slain. But among all the company and of
all the multitude of them were no more but.xl. men which abode. These.lx.
acompanyed themself together remembryng the worship of the empire of Rome / and
took a place a little above their ennemies: which place they defended so manly
that they could not be driven from it by much violence of their ennemies /
against whom they thrue darts from a far. And such darts as their ennemies
thrue at them: they thrue ye same again. So they being but a few against so
many did nothing in vain. For they could throw no dart / but that it lyghted
among the thyckest of them. But so could not their ennemies do against them.
For they were so few: so nere together: and on so sure a place that their
enmies might little thing prevail against them. But when the Numidie^s
approached nerer to them: than specially these.xl. valiant romans showed and
bestowed their manhood and strength with most excellent courage assayling their
enmies: ouerthrowyng and chasyng them backwarde by very force and strength. In
the mean time while Metellus was most of all ocupyed and besyed in the foresaid
assaut of zamam: suddenly he herd behind him a great clamor and noise of
people. Anon he refrayned his horse: and in tournyng back parceyued great
co^panyes of men rennynge toward him: whereby he well knew that they were of
his own people and company. But wha^ he understood all the chance which was
be fallen. Anon in all have he sent all the hole company of his horsemen unto
his tents: and soon after he sent thither also his chife vndercaptayne Caius
Marius with his retynue and company to him assigned. And sore weeping he
obtested exhorted / and besaught him for all love and frendshyp: and for honor
of ye common wayle / that he would not suffer any disworshyp or co^tumely
remain in the romans that day which euerthytherto had been victorious and
ouercomers with great laud and honor: and that he would not suffer their
ennemy Iugurth and his company to depart away unrevenged. Marius did the
commandment of Metellus and that shortly. But in the mean season Iugurth
perceived many of the kepers of the tents fallen into the dyches that were
made about the same for defense: so that for have to run away they hurt
themself more / than he did. Iugurth aduysing their danger co^sydred that
himself was lyckely to be let under the same manner if he auentured over far.
And therefore he departed betyme into the surest places that he could deuyse
nere by leaving many of his men behind: outher deed or mortally wounded. Thus
was Marius frustrat of his labor: for Iugurth was fled before he came to the
tents. But Metellus (without any thing brought to end at zama^) wha^ the
night drew nere: returned with his host into his tents. On the next morn
after / before he returned again to the assaut of zaman: he commanded all
the company of his horsemen to course up and down before their tents on that
side where they supposed Iugurth would come to socour his people. The entres
into the tents and places nere to them he committed and divided to ward of
his under capitayns. After that he returned again to the town and fiersly
assaylyd the walls in like manner as he had done the day before.

In the mean season Iugurth again suddenly stale upon the romans: and
specially on them which coursed before the tents: they which were next him and
who^e he encou^tred first of all were a little time sore troubled and abashed:
but the remenant of the romans lightly assembled their socours. And so
valyantly behaved themself that the Numidie^s should not long have continued
the skyrmysshe: if their fotemen myngled with the romans horsemen had not in
the mydell committed great myschefe and dystruction. For the horsemen of
Iugurth trustyng to ye help of these fotemen which were myngled among them: did
not first proceed forward auau^cing themself and than return back again
as the use is in a battle of spear men. But they ran in making incourses
among the thyckest of the romans overthwart and sydelinges: infoldyng and
dowblyng their courses: and co^tendyng to trouble and dysorder the array and
order of the forward and wings of the romayne host. Insomoche that what with
the Numidyens on horseback and with them on foot it lacked but little: but the
romans were confounded and overcome in that grievous conflict.

But here will I leave the horsemen of the romans fightyng for their lives and
honor against Iugurth and his speremen. And now shall I declare how Metellus
the chief capitayn of the romans behaved himself with his host in the assaut
of zammam.

How Metellus behaved himself for his part and of the great co^flyct which the
romans had against the Numidyans: Metellus with his fotme^ assaylinge the
town of za^mam for the one part: and Iugurth fiersly fighting with the romans
speremen for the other part. The.xxxvii. chap.
IN the same time while this skirmysshe continued between the romans horsemen
and the Numidye^s / which were with Iugurth: the assaut also against the town
of zammam endured with much strength / violence and murder. And specially
where as Metellus had assigned his under captayns on every side of the town (as
I have said before) there co^tynued the assaut most sharply. One of them put
not his trust nor hope in other: but euey man in his own deeds and in
himself. Under the same manner did the garnyson and inhabitants of the town
behave themself: they fought manly again and also ordained all things
convenient for their defense in every place of the town. Both the parties
were redyer and more besye one to stryke and wound other than to defend
themself. The clamoure and noise was myxt with exhortacion and confort of some
/ and the joy of the quellars and murderers was mingled with the wayling of
them which were quelled and murdered. The sound of the armoure / horrious and
strokes mounted to the air. The sky was darked with darts fleyng on either
side. And the walls and dychesse were dyed with blood: and filled with deed
corses pytefull to se. But when the Numidiens were somewhat at layser / and when
the romans a little abated and remitted the assaut: than they which defended
the walls of the town looked out a far and intentifely beheld the battle
of the horsemen which still continued. There might one have seen them sometime
merry and joyous / sometime full of dolor and heaviness after as they saw the
case of the part of Iugurthe went forward or bacwarde. And as well as they
could be seen and herd of their fellows which were with their king Iugurth:
some warned them to audacite / some exhorted them to courage / other they gave
them signs with their hands or with the iesture of their bodies and co^tenances
mouyng and excityng them to boldness. If they saw a romayne stryke a
Numidyan: they moved and withdrue their bodies avoiding the stroke as if it had been themself which had been stricken. And if they saw a Numidyen cast a dart
against a romayn: they moved their bodies also as they had cast it themself.
Thus took they so intentife head to the battle that they forgate themself
where they were / and it seemed them that they had been with their fellows in
battle. When Marius which besyged the town on that side: understood this
manner and behauour of the inhabitau^tes and garyson: he abated his fiersnes for
policy and was more slow in besyegyng of the town than before fayning that he
had no trust nor confidence to win it and suffered the Numidyens within the
town to behold the battle of their king / for a while without any
resystence or business. But wha^ he saw them most intentifely beholding the
battle / and most amassed for the business of their fellows and country men:
than suddenly withal his power he gave assaut to the walls so that many of the
romans with ladders and other ingynes / had almost mounted unto the highest
part of them. Thynhabitantes seeing this expelled their amasednes remembryng
themself: and ran manly against them with resystence throwyng upon them stones
/ fire / and all manner darts of battle. The romans at beginning resysted
valiantly / defendyng themself and auancyng them to the walls. But when
thinhabitantes had first overthrown and broken one ladder / and than
ouertourned an other. They which abode last were maimed or slain. Anon the
remenant departed and gave over the walls under the best manner that they could
a few or none hole. For a great part of them withdrewe themself transfired
with mortal wondes. Anon after the night fell upon them which caused both
the parties to desyst / and leave of the battle.

How Metellus removed the siege from zammam: and how Bomylchar so persuaded
Iugurth that he yielded himself / his kingdom / and all other things / to
mercy and grace of the romans. And how Iugurth after loss of his men /
treasour / elephantes / armor / and horse: changed his mind again.
The.xxxviii. chapyter.
But when Metellus saw his purpose and labor all in vain: and that he could
not win the town. and also that Iugurthe did naught / but by gyle and
falshode / nor would not fight but if it were in places for his profet and
great auantage. And also wha^ he perceived that the somer was passed: he
departed from the siege of za^mam: and in such towns as he had won of Iugurth
which were strongly defended with walls and water: he set garnyson and
soudyours of his company to defend them. But the remenant of his army he
co^uayed and ordered in the next province unto Numidy / which was subget to the
romans: to remain there till the sharpness of the winter were passed. N^r in
the mean time he suffered not them / nor himself to be corrupted wc
superfluous wealth / rest / nor lechery: after the manner of other before him.
But because the war proceeded forward but little with armor or strength: he
began to prove and prepare treason against a treatour / dysceyt against a
dysceyuer: and gyle against gyle of Iugurth: and this thought he to prove by
such as were most chief friends of Iugurth and most familyer about him. So
that he purposed to use the falshode and treason of them against their master:
instead of armor and battle. Wherefore first of all he began to prove the
mind of Bomilchar which had been before at Rome with Iugurth: and (as I have
said before) fled privily from thens for the death of Massiua / leuyng his
sureties behind i^ danger for his cause. Metellus consydred that this
Bomilchar (by cause of the great frendshyppe and familiarite which he had with
Iugurth) sonest might dysceyue and betray him. Wherefore (as I have said before)
he began and went in hand with him first of all by promisyng of great
rewards. And first of all he did somoch: that this Bomilchar came privily to
Metellus and spoke with him. Metellus anon promised him on faith and treuth to
do so for him: that the senators should pardon him of all things past / and of
his life and goods. So that he would betray or deliver unto him Iugurth other
quycke or deed: lightly he persuaded the numidyan. For anon Bomilchar agreed
thereto: what for his treaterous and false mind which he had of nature. And
what for that he douted if any peace or composicion after that should be made
between Iugurth and the romans himself should be delyuerd by co^dycion to the
romans to be punisshed for ye death of Massiua whom he caused to be slain at
Rome. This Bomilchar when he saw his time took leave of Metellus on this
apoyntement: and sone after came to Iugurth whom he found doutefull in care
and bewayling his aduers and miserable fortunes with profunde syghes and
heaviness / and doutyng what way was most expedient to be taken. Bomilchar
after many words began to counsel and warn him / praynge / and obtestyng
him / pyteously weeping and wayling: and requyring that at last he would make
some provision for the sauegarde and socours of himself / of his children and
friends: and for the people of Numidy which well had deserved agnenst him to be
provided for and better seen to. Bomilchar also objected to Iugurth how he and
his men were overcome in every battle / and his people also diminisshed or
alyenate from him / his feldes and towns wasted and distroyd or else in
possession of his ennemies / his men some taken and in prison. Some slain: and
many wounded and maimed / the richesse of his realm dyminisshed and wasted.
Bomilchar alleged also to him that he had proved the strength of his soudyours
and favor of fortune sufficiently enough / wherefore it were better for him to
se some remedy and provision for all these ylles and other mo / and to beware
lest while he prolonged the time and douted: the people of the country should
provide for themself without his advise or counsel. With these words and
other like Bomilchar induced the kings mind to make some co^posicion or else
to yield himself / and all other things to mercy and grace of the romans.
Anon ambassadors were send to Metellus to certify him that Iugurth was ready
to do what ever he would desire or command him: and that he would commit and
yield both himself and his kingdom to the faith and grace of Metellus: and
of the romans without any pactyon / conuenaunt / or exception: saving only as
it pleased them to deal with him. Metellus heryng of this mind of Iugurth was
very glade: and commanded all the most wise / noble / and worthy men of his
army anon to be called together unto him from their wyntryng places. When they
were come than took he counsel of them and of other such as he knew wysest
and most discrete touching the embassade of Iugurth. Anon it was concluded
and decreed among the counsel and declared to the ambassadors (acordyng to
the old custom of Rome) that they should command Iugurth to send to
Metellus and the romans two hundred thousand pound weight of silver: all his
elypha^tes which he ocupyed in war: and a certain quantite of armor and a
no^bre of his chife horse. All these things were fulfilled and done of Iugurth
without any tarry or delay. Wherefore anon after Metellus commanded again that
all they which had betrayed his host / forsaken him and fled to Iugurth should
be bounden and so brought to him again. The most part of them were brought as
he commanded: but a few of them when they herd first of this co^posicion
(feryng the same matter) fled unto Bocchus king of the moryens.

When Iugurth after this manner was bereft of his armor of his horse / of his
men / and also of his treasour. Anon after he was called by Metellus to come
to a town called Tysidium there to here what farthermore should be commanded
to him: and to yield himself to thempire of Rome acordynge to his embassade.
But he began than to change and to turn his mind again dredyng for the
knolegyng of his cruel deeds that he should never escape co^digne punyssheme^t
if he were ones i^ the romans hands. Thus he co^tynued many days in douring
what was best to be done. Sometime he volued in mind rather to subdue himself
to any difficulty and to bide all pains than to begin war again: co^sydring
the aduers and unhappy fortune which he had before. Sometime again he called
to mind how grievous a fall it should be to desce^de from a kingdom into
subjection and bondage. But at conclusion when in vain and to none effect he
had lost such great ordinance and help of war as he had lately delivered
to Metellus: as a volage brayned man / he fully determined again to begin and
continue the war with Metellus: rather than to yield him self to death or
captivity.

But during this season at Rome was a counsel among the senators concerning
thassignement of rule and governance of the provinces belonging to thempyre:
in which counsel it was decreed that the country and war of Numidy should
be committed to Metellus / by prorogacion of his authorite for another year
more.

But here will I leave a while to speak of Metellus: and write of the ambicion
of Marius: and how he behaved himself in supplantyng the same Metellus for his
rowme and dignite.

How Marius by ambition labored to be co^sull and to prosecute the war of
Numidy: and how he detracted and suppla^ted the consul Metellus. The.xxxix.
chapyter.
AT the same season the said Marius was in a town named Vtica / and there made
supplicacion and oblacion to the ydolles with much sacricfice to the intent
that it might be his fortune (by help) to have the place of Metellus. A
custom damnable was among the people at those days: when they slew any be
in sacrifice: to look within the intrayles and bowelles of ye same best so
sacrifised. where was showed unto them diverse tokens whyther they should have
any hope to bring that matter to effect: for which they sacrifised or else not.
And often times the wicked spyrites to cause them persevere in their ydolatry:
and to give crede^ce to that blind error showed many tokens to the^ insuch
manner sacrifice: which tokens they often found true. But now to my purpose.
The priest of the ydolles which sacrifysed for Marius showed great and
marvelous tokens unto him: whereby he might greatly trust to come to his intent
and purpose / byddyng him prosecute that thing on which he had set his
mind: and have sure confydence in his gods. Sayng that if he would prove the
extremite of fortune diligently and often: than doutlesse every thing
prosperously should happen to him. But Marius before that time: long season
wonderously desired in his mind the dignite of the consul. And to say truth
he wanted nothing which longed to him / which should have such a dignite save
only antiquite of his progeny and ancient nobleness of birth. For thought
he were but a gentylman of the first heed: nevertheless his co^dicions were
worthy and excellent. In him was great experience of wisdom, much probite /
honesty / and sadness. He had great polycy and connyng in chyualry: in
battle his mind was excellent and bold. But in peace it was low and
moderate. He overcame couetyse and sensualite of his body. He desired nor
coueyted nothing erthly save glory / laud / and worship. This Marius was
borne and brought up by all his chyldhode in the country of Champayne beyond
France in a town named Arpyne. But as soon as he was increased / so that he
might bear harness and bide the hardness of warfare: he concluded to live on
the wages of chyualrie. And in that study he exercysed himself: and not in
eloquence of greek langage or in other study or science: nor yet in the
superfluous aparayle nor carnal lusts of citezins unto which he never subdued
his body. And thus was he endued with good manners: and excercysed among honest
ocupacions and so continued that his hole and undefiled with shortly increased
and exalted himself growyng to honor and virtue. First when this Marius
desired of the co^menty of Rome to have an office: that is to say / to be
ordained protector of the soudyours: many of the citezins knew not his
person: because he was always from the cite in war and battle: but his acts
made his name well known. Wherefore after that the co^menty understood that he
was Marius of whose nobles all Italy much co^muned and talked: anon they
granted his peticion / and proclaimed him protector of the soudyours over all
the provinces and tribes of Italy. In that maistership and office he behaved
himself so well and wisely that after that he obtained an other office of more
worship and authorite: and after that again an other of hyer dignite. And
shortly to speak: in every office and dignite he so behaved himself that every
man thought and counted him worthyer of more dignite and honor than he had.
How beit for all these conditions: as honorable as he was: he durst never
before desire thoffice of consul of Rome till this time when he had such
comfort by his sacrifice. But when he was thus warned and put in hope and
confort / ever after he was hedelyng inclined to ambicion and couetyse of that
dignite.

At this season the co^menty of Rome had all other offices among them or at
their gift and dystribucion. But the estates and noble men kept among them and
in their hands the consulshyp yearly one succedyng other by election. So that
of the commenty was none so noble nor excellent of deeds / but that was reputed
unworthy of that dignite / and as who says vile and polluted. But when Marius
saw and consydred that the words and counsel of the enchauntour and priest
which beheld his sacrifice pretended to the same point and conclusion as the
desire of his mind moved him long before. Anon he came to his captain
Metellus / besechyng him to be dyscharged of the battle till he might go to
Rome to the intent to desire the consulshyppe of the senators. But how beit that
in this Metellus was virtue / glory / worship / and all other things longing
to a good man plentifully enough. Nevertheless of his courage and mind was
he so^what proud / despisyng and dysdaynyng other: which were not come of so
hy lynage as he was. But specially he was stately and proud of mind: which
is a common vice and myschefe among estates and gentylmen. Wherefore Metellus
heryng this interprise of Marius / first of all was moved with the newelty of
his peticion. For at that time were none wont to speak for that dignite / but
if they were come of a noble stock. And so was not Marius. And thus Metellus
marueyled much at his enterprise: and who might counsel him thereto: warning
him as under color of amyte and frendshyppe / not to presume upon so contrary
and unlikely a thing: nor to exalte his mind so hy above fortune convenient
for his state and condition. Sayng also to him that every thing was not to be
coueyted nor desired of every man. And that it became him well by reason to be
contented / pleased and satisfied with that honor which he had and that was
his own / and not to desire things unmeet for his degree. And finally he
exhorted and cou^selled him to beware to desire yt thing of the Romans which
laufully might be denied unto him: co^sydring and having regard to his lynage
and auncet^y. After Metellus had cou^selled Marius with these words and other
like: and that he could not turn nor apease his mind / he answered him at
last that as soon as he could co^uenie^tly (not lettyng the business of the
common well) he would grant his desire and peticion. But after this when
Ma^ius desired the same dyscharge importunely and often: he made him answer
sayng that he should not make so great have to Rome for that purpose for he
should come tymely enough to demand that dignite aco^panyed with the son of
the same Metellus / which son should also go to Rome in time to come to
demand of the senators the same dignite with Marius. This son of Metellus
was at that time in the army of his father Metellus continually exercisyng the
feats of war not withstanding that he was but.xx. year of age. This answer
of Metellus styred Marius against him with grievous ire and wrath / what for the
honor which he desired: and what for the license to depart / which he could
not obtain of him by no prayer nor request at his pleasure. In somoche that he
enraged against Metellus moved by desire of that office and provoked by ire /
which two vices ambicion and ire counseled and impelled this Marius to much
ill against the said Metellus / sparyng nouther word nor deed which might
endamage or hinder him / his honor and name. And that might help or auaunce
himself by ambicion to come to the dignite which he desired. He governed the
soudyours which passed forth the winter under his governance not as he ought
to do: but suffered them to have their pleasure to the intent thereby to obtain
their favor and goodwyll in his enterprise. Also he spoke often in blamyng
Metellus / and proudly co^mendyng and exaltyng himself unto the marchantes of
Rome: of whom was great resort and co^cours to the said cite of Vtica where
Marius soiourned. And often times he boosted saying to them that if the one
half of the army were granted and committed to him within few days he would
behave himself that he would have Iugurth in bonds and subjection. Fathermore
he said to them in auancynge himself that Metellus prolonged the battle for
the nonest / for a craft because he was a man pompous and desirous of glory
and worship / utterly reioysinge in authorite and given to pride and affection
of dignite: and because he knew well that while the battle continued he should
be reputed in manner as a king / therefore he did his deuoyre the more to
prolonge the war to the end that in the mean time he might exalte and magnify
himself. The words of Marius seemed to the said marcha^tes certain and true /
and also as they thought (by such informacion) most expedient to the commen
wayle that some new captain were chosen / which shortly would finysshe that
war. For by long contynuance of the same war: many of the said marchantes
had wasted and spent much of their substance and richesse. And also to such
desyrefull minds as they had / nothing could to fast be hasted or brought to
end.

Moreover at this season was in company of the romayne army a certain Numidyan
named Gauda / which was son of Manastaball: and neuewe unto Massinissa.
Micipsa in his testament ordained that this Gauda should be second heir of
Numidy / after the death of his two sons and of Iugurth. This Gauda was sore
enfebled with dyseases and syckenesse: and for that cause his mind was a
little endulled and private of reason and memory. While this Gauda (as said
is) was in the romans army: he required of Metellus to suffer him to have his
seat and siege next unto him after the use of kings of Numidy. Also after that
because of defense and guard of his body: he desired that a company of
soudyours of the romans might be granted and assigned to him. But Metellus
extremely denied both his peticions saying for the first: that such honor
longed only to them whom the romans took and named for kings. And also for
ye second peticion he said that it were an unadvised and injurious ordinance if
the romayne soudyours were given or assigned to the guard and service of a
Numidyan / which was no king but a soudyour like many mo hired for stypende.
While Gauda was displeased and angry with Metellus for denyeng of these his
peticions: Marius came to him and provoked him to revenge the displeasure and
injury which the captain had done to him with his help and auaunceme^t. This
Gauda (as I have said before) was of feeble and unstable mind: and the men's
wit was of little valor by means of diseases which long had holden him.
Wherefore Marius with his elegant / fair / and flateryng words at his own
pleasure induced him and exalted his mind saying that he was a king an
excellent and great man: and also neuewe to the worthy and noble king
Massinissa. Wherefore (said he) if Iugurth were outher slain or taken prisoner
it were lickely to come to that point: that the kingdom of Numidy should be
assigned and committed to him of the senators without any tarry or resystence:
which thing should shortly be brought to pass if Marius himself were creat
consul in place of Metellus and than assigned to execute and finysshe the
war with Iugurth. Under this manner Marius counseled and induced both the
said Gauda / the romayne knights / the common soudyours / and also the
merchants and occupyers which were in the town at that season with many other
whom he impelled with his words so: that some of them for love which they
had to Marius: And other some for great hope and desire which they had to have
peace and co^corde wrote to Rome to their kynsmen and friends of the battle of
Numidy and that very sharply against Metellus desyring and besechyng them to
labor at Rome withal their might that Marius might be elect consul and
assigned to execute the war of Numidy. And thus at Rome was the consulshyp
desired by many men with great favor and very honest peticions for Marius.
Also at that time had the said Marius this advantage. For the co^mentie at that
season deposed many of the states: and eralted such as were new gentylmen
after the law of one named Manlius which before had been protector of the
co^me^tie. This Manlius ordained and inacted a law / that if any thing were
ungoodly done and against right of the states being in any office or dignite:
than he which so had done should be deposed of his office: and in his place
some new gentle or actyue man of the co^mentie set and deputed and so
exalted. This law at those days was kept in effect and executed at Rome:
wherefore every thing proceeded prosperously to the purpose and profet of Marius.
For (as I have said before) in him was no nobleness of ancient lynage nor
birth.

But here will I leave to speak of the ambicion of Marius and return to write
of Iugurth: and how he behaved himself against Metellus.

How Iugurth renewed the war against Metellus / and how the numidyans
inhabyters of the town of Vacca by treason murdered the garnyson of romans
which Metellus had set in the same town. The.xl. chapyter.
IN the mean time when Iugurth had broken the co^posicion which he had before
made with Metellus by counsel of Bomilchar / and had concluded again to
begyne the war: than anon he prepared all things necessary to war with
great diligence. And with great have he assembled an army. Moreover he daily
troubled with thretnynges / or fear / or else with great rewards: such citees
and towns as before had forsaken him and yielded themself to Metellus. So that
he spared no polycie to make them to render themself again to him. In such
holds and towns as were in his possession: he set garnyson and defense of men
of war. He renewed and bought again armor and wepyn / and all other things
which he had lost before: or delyuerd to Metellus in hope of peace. He attysed
unto him many of the romans subgettes and bondemen: by promisyng to them their
liberty. He also proved and attempted with rewards them: whom Metellus had set
and assigned in garnyson / guard and defense of such places as he had won in
Numidy: so that utterly be suffered nothing to be left quiet nor unassayed: but
by all manner means made prouysion for himself mouyng and puttyng in proof
every thing. But among all other thinhabitantes of the cite called Vacca (in
which Metellus at begynynge had set his garnison: when Iugurth first sought
his peace of Metellus) were desired often of Iugurth and with great and
importune instance exited to treason. In somoche that at last they assented to
him to conspire against the romans. Thinhabitantes of the cite did not yield
themself from Iugurth with their own goodwyll: and namely thestates and
rulers thereof did never yield them to Metellus save faynedly. Wherefore
specially they were the first that conspired against him secretly among
themself. For why as it often happened the commentie and specially of the
Numidiens were unstable of mind / utterly inclined to sedicion and discord
covetous of new things and changes: and contrary to rest and quietness. But
(as I have said before) when the chyfe of this cite had secretly concluded and
appointed their matter and treason among themself: against the third day they
ordained that the same third day next after should be commanded solemn / holy
/ and worshypped over all the country of Affrike / and Numidy. Which day
showed and pretended by all similytude mirth / game / and sport: rather than
any dread to the romans which were in guard and gernison of the cite. But the
Numidyens full of prodicion and treason when they saw their time called unto
their houses all the chief captayns and master soudyours of the romans which
were in the town. And also one named Turpilius: whom Metellus had ordained to
be his lyeutenant / provost and chife captain of the town: they enuited and
called as if it had been to chere and feast them / one to one house / an other
to an other. But this there was such as the Scorpyon is wont to make: which
while she makes glad semblant with her mouth mortally styngeth with the
tail: so this feast was a cloak to mortal treason. For while the romans were
in mids of their daynties unarmed suspectynge no paryll. All the Numidiens at
a tokens given and at one hour appointed before / slew each one his geest
which dyned with him without favor: so that among them all escaped not one
/ except the said Turpilius heed captain or lyeutenant of the town. This
done: all the Numidyens together set upon the remenant of the common soudyours
which wandered and strayed abroad in the town and in the streets / dispersed
abroad without any armor: as is wont on such a day without order / feryng nor
doutyng no danger. Some of the co^mens when thestates had made them pryue of
this treason came also to help them / and some other ignorant of the matter
saving that / that they had desire and pleasure in such murder invaded the
romans also. For though they were ignorant of the counsel of this deed: yet
the noise or skirmysshe and newelty of the matter pleased them enough. The
romayn soudyours were ignorant and incertayne of this unprovided fear and
cruel murder doutynge what was best to be done. Their ennemies co^pasynge them
on every side let them to go to the castle of the town where their armoure
and wepyn was: and the gates of the town were shet on every side before this
skyrmysshe began / whereby they were prohibyted to avoid the town. Moreover
women and children thrue down upon them stones / and other things that came
next to hand from the wyndowes and highest parts of their houses: stryuyng who
might throw first and most. Thus this doutfull and unprovided mychefe could
not be eschued: nor they which were right worthy and strong soudyours were not
able to resyst the very cowardyse and feebleness of women and children / which
thrue down upon them. Thus both good and ill / worthy / and unworthy / strong
/ and feeble: were all slain without difference. In this so great ieopardy: the
Numidyens being mad and cruel in murdre / and the gates shette on every side:
of all the romans / or Italyens: only Turpilius the captain escaped without
hurt of his body. Whyther it so happed by the favor of his host which called
him to banquet: or by some apoyntment of treason: or else by some other chance:
it was not known for certain. But this was known that ever after as long as
he lived he was reputed for a vile and a wretched cowarde and without crede^ce*
because that in so great loss and myschefe he counted it better to escape: and
after to live / and dye in shame and rebuke: than manly to have dyed in defense
of the town. And ever after to have had an honorable name of a worthy
captain.

How Metellus destroyed the town of Vacca and slew all the inhabitauntes / in
reuengynge their treason. And how Tupilius lyeutenaunt or captain of town /
was beheded at commandment of Metellus. The.xli. chap.
When Metellus understood of this lamentable chance / and treason down at the
town of Vacca: his mind was meruaylously grieved / abashed / and sad
withal. But to the intent that none should parceyue his heaviness / he withdrue
himself from company a little time: but after when he had satisfied his mind
with tears / and secret lamentacion. And when his dolor was myxed with wrath
and displeasure against that cruel deed: than hasted he himself with great
cure and diligence to go revenge this injurious and cruel treason. Anon he
called forth a legion of soudyors which passed forth the winter with him: and
with them also as many horsemen of the Numidyens as he might assemble which had
forsaken Iugurth and fled to him: whom he thought most trusty. His legion he
arrayed in light harness and easy armor to thinte^t to speed the way more
redely. And by cause he intended to go about this matter secretly: therefore
privily even with the son going down / he took his iournay and proceeded
forward toward Vacca: and labored so that on the next day after about the
third hour he came with his company into a certain plain a little closed or
co^pased about with small downys not much hyer than the extremitees of the
valey. There called he together his soudyours which were weary for the great
labor of their journey: and long way which they had gone. Insomoch that they
refusyd to proceed any farther. But Metellus conforted them saying that the
town of Vacca was no more but one mile thens. Wherefore he desired them to
suffer and endure the remena^t of their labor with pacyent minds / but only
till revenged the death of the citezins and their fellows which were strong and
worthy men: and very miserably murdered. Moreover he showed to them benygnely
the great pray which was ready for them / if they would manly proceed. Thus were
their minds exalted / comforted / and enbolded with his words. Metellus
seynst that: was glad and anon commanded the horsemen to proceed in the
forward these horsemen were numidyens. And the fotemen he commanded to keep
secret their standerdes / conysances / and badges: and to go behind under the
shadow of the horsemen as nere together as they might: and so proceeded he
toward the town. When the citezyns saw an army approach and move toward
them: at the beginning they thought it had been Metellus (as it was in deed)
and onone shytte the gates of the town against him. But afterward when they
aduysed them well: and saw that the company which approached made no
deuastacion nor destruction by the feldes nor country as they went. And also
wha^ they parceyued that the horsemen which were in the forward were
Numidyens: again they thought that it was Iugurth with his company. Wherefore
with great joy they issued forth of the town to mete him. Metellus anon
parceyued their ignorance and gave a token to his people to assail them. The
horsemen and fotemen knowing the will of their captain by blast of the
tru^pettes assailed and ouerthrue the co^mentie which came out of the cite
against them dispersed over the feldes. Some of the romans ran to the gates of
the town and entered without resistance: and some took and invaded the towers
of the walls maugre the kepars. Thus the dispeasure and ire which the romans
had for death of their fellows: and the hope of prays of the town overcame and
excluded their werynes which they had in their iournay thyderwarde. Thus the
inhabitants of Vacca enjoyed their treason but only two days. For only the
space of two days continued their falshode and cruelty unrevenged. For that
great and rich cite was all given to havoc and murdre utterly distroyed of
the romans: so that no creature escaped alive to boost of their treason before
committed against the romans whom they had so traitorously slain within
their cite. Turpilius lyetenant or captain of the town which (as I have said
before) escaped only with his life: was called before Metellus and commanded
to answer for himself by what way or means he escaped / whyther by treason
done to the town / or by any other policy. But because he could but simply
excuse nor pourge himself of that which was laid against him / he first was
scourged and beaten: and after that his heed stryken of from his sholders / for
that it was thought that if he had not betrayed the cite he could not have
escaped more than any other. Farthermore that great dystruction of the romans
was ascribed to his negligence or treason. If this Turpilius had been a romayn
he should not have put to death. For the law of Porcius prohibyted any citezine
of Rome to be slain: but if they committed any great offense / the extreme
punysshement by the law was to commit them to exyle. But this Turpilius
inioyed not the priuyleges of this law: for asmoche as he was no citezyne of
Rome / but an Italyan of the town of Collace.

How Bomylchar conspyred treason against Iugurth and by what means this
treason was discovered and Bomilchar with certain other put to death for the
same. The.xlii. chap.
AT the same time Bomilchar (by whose counsel and mocyon Iugurth before had
begone the co^posicion with Metellus / which he omitted and brake again for
fear) was co^uersant with Iugurth / which alytell suspected this Bomilchar of
treason. Wherefore he suspectyng him again ymagyned new policy against Iugurth
daily seeking and deuysing some gyle to his dystruction and death / so that in
diverse deuyses there about his mind wandered and was weryed both day and
night. But when he had assayed many ways and that nothing came to purpose: he
adjoined unto him an other co^panyon named Nabdalsa / a noble man exalted and
enhaunced with great richesse: and much beloved of his co^mentie and people of
whom he had rule. This Nabdalsa was so well beloved with Iugurth / that often
times he committed to him an army and power by himself to execute all other
things which longed to mean business while Iugurth himself was weryed or
let with other gretter things: whereby the said Nabdalsa had optayned great
honor and gathered great richesse. Thus at conclusion: by apoynteme^t and
counsel both of Bomilchar and of Nabdalsa a day was prefixed between them to
execute their treason against Iugurth. And in the mean time they provided
every thing to that purpose as the matter and case required. This apoyntme^t
made: they both departed in sonder. Nabdalsa went to the army which Iugurth
had committed to him for to tarry with the same nere to those places where the
romans wyntred: to the intent that if the romans wasted or distroyed the
country. Nabdalsa with his company should other prohibet them: or else so
dystourbe them that they should not escape unrevenged. But when the time
appointed drew nere: than was Nabdalsa so abashed for the gretnesse of the
deed that he met not with Bomilchar at the day and time assigned. This his
great fear let all the matter. But wha^ Bomilchar was thus disapoynted of
his partyng fellow he was greatly abashed: nevertheless his mind was much
desirous to perform his enterprise. But again he was doutfull for this
cowardouse fere of his co^panyon: lest he would omytte their first apoyntment
and counsel / and begin some other new apoyntme^t. Wherefore he se^^ letters
unto him by trusty friends / and partyners of the same treason. In which
letters he sharply blamed the pacyence / delayeng / and cowardyse of Nabdalsa
/ and unstableness of his mind obtestyng and calling unto wytnes the gods
by whom he had sworn to perform the said treason. Moreover he warned him
that he should not turn to their dystruction and co^fusyon: the great
rewards which they both might have of Metellus. Which thing truly should
fortune if Metellus him self should bring Iugurth into captiuyte. Farthermore
Bomylchar in the same letters gave monicion to Nabdalsa that the end of Iugurth
was nere come: and that it was not possible that he might long contynewe all
things co^sydred. But than was the matter in hand whyther he should be
destroyed by them or else by Metellus. Wherefore he exhorted him well to consider
in mind whyther he had lever betray him / and thereby obtain great favor and
rewards: or else to leave of till Metellus overcame him: and than to be put to
death also with him.

These exhortacions with other like were contained in the letters of Bomilchar
dyrected unto Nabdalsa. But when these letters were delyuerd: as chance was:
Nabdalsa lay on his bed to recreate and refresshe his body weryed with labor
and business / which he had taken before. When Nabdalsa had red these letters
and understood the mind of Bomilchar: first many deuyses entered his mind and
much cure he had in musyng what was most expedient to be done in the cause.
But while he was in this study: suddenly he fell in a slombre and his weary
members desyring rest moved him to fall in sleep. This Nabdalsa had a servant
longing to him whom he much loved and trusted: in somoche that no business
nor counsel he hydd nor kept secret from him: this counsel of betrayng of
Iugurth only except. When this servant understood that the said letters were
brought to his lord he thought that he had need of his counsel as he was wont
and acustomed to have in other matters: and anon entered in to the tent where
his master lay. And seeing him fast in sleep he took the letters which
Nabdalsa had unwisely laid above his heed upon the pyllowe: and seeing by the
superscripcion that the letter came from Bomilchar he redd it to the end. But
when he understood the treason: in all have he addressed him with the same
letter to Iugurth. Nabdalsa not long after awakenyd and myssed the letter /
wherefore anon he inquired who had been there in his tent. But in short season
came diverse of his lovers from Iugurth / which certifyed him of all the matter
as it was done. Nabdalsa first of all intended to pursue his accuser: but when
he perceived that it was but in vain so to do / consydring that he was all
ready in the company of Iugurth: he went unto Iugurth himself to the intent to
pacify and mytigate his displeasure and wrath. And said unto him that when the
said letters were first delyuerd unto him he had fully purposed not to keep
them secret: but himself to have disclosed them to Iugurth. But while he was
slepyng his false servant (in hope to be aduansed thereby) had prevented him his
purpose and done the same thing which he himself had fully purposed to do.
Farthermore weeping he besought and required him for all amyte and love which
had been between them and for all the faithful service which he had done to
him in foretyme not to have him suspected in so cruel a deed. Iugurth answered
to these requests of Nabdalsa myldly and soberly lest any gretter variance
might rise thereof: but much contrary to the disposicion of his mind. For he
thought otherwise than he answered: how beit he had well refrayned and alayed
his wrath before with the death of Bomilchar / and of many other whom he knew
first deuisours and partynge fellows of that treason whom he had caused to be
put to death before the coming of Nabdalsa: lest some battle or other
insurrection should have proceeded of ye besinesse if they had lived any longer.
From this day forward Iugurth was never quiet day nor night: so that he
trusted nouther place / another man / nor time: but suspected and mystrusted
every thing. His ennemies and his own subgettes he dreded and suspected both
in like and after one manner. He sherched and espied every place for dread of
treason doutyng and suspectyng every sound or noise that he herd. He rested
and lay some night in one place and some night in an other / and that in abject
and secret places against the honor of his estate royal. Sometime he rose
from his bed in his sleep in mids of the night and armed himself cryng /
enragyng / and violently smyting against the walls of the chamber: as if he
had been in battle. So that for the great dread of treason which he had / he
took no rest another slepyng nor wakyng: but was violently vexed and fered like
a mad man without reason or discression.

How Metellus renewed the war against Iugurth: and how Marius was creat
consul and assigned to execute the war of Numidy at pleasure of the co^mens
against the will of all the noble men of Rome. The.xliii. chapyter.
When Metellus by such as fled bitwene the two parties understood of the chance
of Bomilchar and of this treason disclosed / he began than again to co^tende
with Iugurth: with open war and thereto hasted all thing necessary and
expedient. And considryng that Marius was continually cryeng on him for the
said license and congy to depart to Rome and also grievous / hateful / and
contrary to him: aduysynge him not much necessary but little mete i^ so sharp
a besynes. And seeing him ill wyllyng to every thing he granted him lyce^ce at
last: to depart toward Rome as he before had often required and demanded by
peticion.

But as I have said long before / the letters which were send to Rome to the
co^mens by favorers of Marius were well accepted. For when the co^mentie had
ouersene them / and by them understood the praysyng of Marius / and the
dispraysyng of Metellus. They were all inclined utterly to the auau^ceme^t of
Marius and detraccion of the other. The noblenes of Metellus the captain
which was before to his great worship and honor turned now to envy and
hatered against him. But the lownes and vnnoblenes of Marius increased to him
favor specially of the co^mentie which were come of unnoble blood / as he was.
But the diligence and favor of both the parties (that is to say of thestates
which held with Metellus: and of the co^mens that held with Marius) did
measure and gyde every thing rather than the good or ill disposicions of the
two adversaries Metellus or Marius. For the commens to die for it / concluded to
exalte Marius. And the estates in the same manner labored to keep him under
because he was unnoble borne / and to exalte none save them which were come of
noble progeny. Farthermore the masters and heed officers of the co^mentie
which loved debate at every assemble and congregation of the co^menssore blamed
Metellus and despised his deeds desyring of the co^mens that Metellus might be
put to the punysshe of his heed / sayng that he was so worthy: for that he
prolonged the war in Numidy against Iugurth more than need was. But in
dispisyng and accusyng Metellus they forgot not to commend Marius / and exalt
him with words some what to much: and more than he was worthy in many points.
In somoche that the people were so greatly enclyned to him with their favor:
that all the crafty men and laborers of the cite: and also of the country
which had no living save in the labor of their hands left their warke and
b^synesse and followed Marius / frequentyng and resortyng to his company. And
set more by his auauncement and honor than by their own profet or
advantage / trustyng that after if he optayned the said honor: they should
have their lyuenge by him. And thus shortly to speak the estates and noble men
of Rome being sore astonyed / the consulshyp was committed to Marius a new
gentylmen whose predecessors before him to such dignite could never attain
and were counted unworthy. Thus that thing which many years before that time
could never be done nor brought about: was now brought to effect: that is to
say the consulshyp which was the most excellent dignite of Rome was now in
hands of the commentie and committed to a man of basse birth. Shortly after
this: the protector of the co^mentie named Lucius Manlius inquired and
demanded of the people whom it would please them to send into Numidy to
finysshe the war with Iugurgth. The most part of the co^mentie answered that
Marius should have that office and business: how beit a little before that
time the senators had assigned by their ordinance the province of Numidy to
Metellus for his worthy deeds: wherefore now this ordinance was frustrate and
void. For the co^mentie would have their statutes executed and fulfilled.

Of the second batell foughten between Metellus and Iugurth: and how Iugurth
lost the battle and also one of his chief towns named Thala. The.xliiii.
chapyter.
IN the mean time while the interprise of Marius proceeded thus forward at
Rome: Iugurth was sore troubled i^ his mind for many co^sideracions. First he
consydred the loss of many whom he reputed for his friends till before he
knew their treason of whom he had many put to death and many other had fled
from him for fear / some to the romans / and other some to Bocchus king of
the mauriens. He called also to his mind that without ministers an men of
war he was not able to execute the war: and more over he thought it
ieopardous after so great falshode and treason of his old f^endes to prove or
assay the fidelite of new. For these causes and mo like (as I have said
before) his mind was driven to and fro / variable and incertayne in diverse
opynions. Insomoch that there was no manner thing / no counsel nor no manner
man: that could sufficiently satisfy nor please his mind. He changed his
iournayes and ways every day into sundry places for fear of treson. Sometime
he addressed him toward his ennemies: and anon after returned into wodes and
wyldernesses. Often times he had trust and confidence in flight: and anon
after put his trust in armor and battle. He douted whyther he might less
trust to strength or truth of his men which were with him: so that what ever
he purposed to do: or whyther so ever he intended / every thing was contrary
to him. But while Iugurth thus prolonged and tarried: suddenly Metellus with his
army appeared in his sight. Iugurth that parceyuyng: set in order and array his
numidye^s as well as he might aft the short time which he had thereto. And
immidyatly the armies approached: and the battle began. In that part of the
battle where Iugurth himself was: they strove and resysted a little space:
but all the other numidyens at the first brunt / concourse or assaut were put
to flight with violence / and driven backwarde. The romans took some of their
standerdes and armor / which they fleyng away left behind them: but of their
ennemies they took but few. For the Numidiens in that battle and almoost in
all other defended themself better with their fete: tha^ with their hands or
armoure. Iugurth at this time: mystrusted his case much more than at any other
time ever before / for the cowardous withdrawyng of his people. Wherefore he
aco^panyed himself with the romans which had forsaken and betrayed Metellus /
and fled to him. With them / and with a part of his horsemen he fled into the
wyldernesses thereby: and from thens unto a town named Thala / which was a
great town and a rich^: and much of his treasour and of the aparell longyng to
the yongth of his young children was in the same town. But when Metellus
understood that Iugurth was fled to so rich a town / how beit he knew that
between the town and the next flod thereto was.l. mylespace of dry ground void
and without habitacion: nevertheless he took in hand to overcome all
sharpness and difficulty of places: and also to overcome nature / though it
seemed impossible to man's mind. This thing Metellus took in hand in hope to
fynisshe the battle much sooner if he might win that town.

Wherefore he commanded that all the beestes which served for carriage / should
be unladen of all such baggage and burdens as they carried longing to the
soudyours: save only whete and vitayle for the space of.x. days. Also he
commanded some of the beestes to be laded with bottels full of water / and
other vessels mete to be carried with water. Moreover: over all the country he
gathered together as many tame beestes as he could get and them laded with empty
vessels of every sort. Many of them were treen vessel which he had done to be
gathered among the villages of the Numidiens. Farthermore he commanded
thinhabitantes of those marches which after the flight of Iugurth had yielded
them to him that they should make them ready to follow the host every man with
asmoche water as they might bear. And assigned them a day and place / where
they should be ready under pain of death. When Metellus was come to the said
flod which was fyfty mile from the town of Thala and nerest water thereto (as
I have said before) he did all the beestes to be laded of the same water. And
so went toward Thala / his host set in order and array: so that if any
ieopardy apered he was ever ready at defense / but afterward when he was come
to that place where he had appointed the numidiens to mete him with the water
wherewith they were laded and followed the host. And when his tents were
pytched / set / and defended about with trenches / cut trees / bows / and
stakes after the policy of war: suddenly from the heaven descended great
violence and plenty of rain water that it was more than sufficiently to all
the army as well to men as beestes. Moreover their vitels were more ple^tyfull
than they trusted or looked after. For the numidie^s which newly were yielded
were somoche the more seruisable and ready to mynistre every thing necessary
unto the army. And no marvel: for every thing is quycke at the beginning which
often fades at the end. But the soudyours and men of war: were more glad to
ocupy the rain water for devotion / than such water which was brought unto
them in vessels by caryage. For they supposed that their gods loved and
favored them which in so dry a country / and in such a chance sent to
them so great plenty of water beside provision of there captain. This thing
greatly conforted the minds of them all: and encouraged them with boldness /
strength / and diligence: to overcome all difficulties which remained. This
confort kyndlyng their minds: they spedde themself so forward that on the
next day aft they came unto the town of Thala: contrary unto the opinion or
knoledge of Iugurth. Thinhabitantes which thought themself surely defended by
the sharpness and difficulty of the place / were suddenly abashed and
astonyed for that great unwont and unprovided case. Nevertheless they made
provision to battle as quyckely as they might by sufferau^ce of the time. The
romans addressed them in the same manner. But the king Iugurth anon cast in
his mind that to Metellus was nothing unprovided nor unable to be done: as he
that by his craft / diligence / and polycie: had overcome both wepen / armor /
place / and time. And also nature itself: which rules other things longyng
unto men. Iugurth this aduysing and reuoluyng in his mind fled privily by
night forth of the town with his children and a great part of his treasour.
Nor after this time he never tarried in one place past the space of a day or of
one night faynyng that he fled so from one place to an other because of his
present business: but the right cause of his remouynge was for that he feared
treason which he thought best to avoid and eschew by continual chaungyng of
places. For such counsels of treason can not be taken without deliberacion and
process of time / and conueniens or oportunyte of places where princes does
long so iourne and continue.

But when Metellus saw that thinhabitantes were ready to battle / and also
that the town was strongly defended both by craft of man's hands and by
nature of the place. Anon he compased about the town on every side with
profounde dychesse / trenches / and herdels: of sharp stakes the points
upward to thentent that none of thinhabytantes should break out nor escape by
night / as Iugurth had done before: nor that no vitels should be conuayed into
them / whereby they might the lengar resyst him and endure the sege. Afterward
he commanded scaffoldes to be made about the walls specially in such places
as were most convenient: and pentyses of sheldes conjoined in manner of vynes
to be driven to the walls upon wheles. And above the said scaffoldes to be
cast a hepe of gravel and stones: and toures of tymbre and bulwarks set upon
them: and other soudyours he assigned to defend the warke / and them also that
labored thereupon. These scaffoldes / pentyses / and pauases: were made to
thentent that under them the romans might undermine the walls without great
paryll or damage. On the othersyde / the garnyson and inhabitants hastily
labored to resyst the romans and to defend themself and their town
manfully. So that on both parties was nothing forgoten / able to be done
touching their defense. But brefely to speak the romans weryed with much
labor and battle.xl. days after they were come thither: at last wan the
town. But all the pray and riches of the town was distroyed by them which
were within the town in garnyson: of the romans / which had fled from
Metellus to Iugurth: which specially had assigned them to defend the town.
These traitors when they saw the walls undermined and bruised with diverse
ingens of battle: and their fortune was brought to extremite: and no socours
nor hope remained. Than they assembled and carried together all the treasour and
riches of the town / as gold / silver / with other precious ornaments or
jewels into the palace of Iugurth / and there filled themself with wine and
other delycate meats. And at conclusion when they were full saturate and
ingorged: they set fire on the palace and wylfully brent and distroyed the
richesse / the palace / and themself withal. So that such punysshement as
they dreded to suffer of their ennemies they voluntarily suffered the same with
their own hands to avoid the subieccion and danger of their ennemies: by
desperate folly and presumptuous madness.

How Metellus fortified the cite of Leptis and at request of the ambassadors
of the same city send thither garnyson to defend the cite against Iugurth:
and of the sytuacion of the same cite and behauour of thi^habytantes thereof.
The.xlv. cha.
AT the same time when Thala was won of the romans / ambassadors ca^e from
a town of Numidy named Leptis unto Metellus / requirynge him to send thither
socours of garnison and a captain to defend them from the oppression and
injury of a certain noble and debatefull man / which was within that cite
named Amylchar which (as they said) continually labored for new changes
excityng and mouyng the common people to forsake the romans again. In so much
that against the said Amylchar no man was able to resyst nor to prevail: for
he set naught by commandment of their officers and rulers / nor yet by the
ancient laws of their cite At conclusion these ambassadors said to Metellus
for a surete that except he granted their peticion that both their own
health / and also the friends and lovers of thempire which were within that
cite should be in great danger and paryll. These Leptitans at beginning of this
war of Iugurth required frendshyppe with the romans of Calphurnius of whom
is made mention in beginning of this history. And after that they send to
Rome unto all the senators requyryng the same amyte and peace to be confermed
of them: which thing was granted to them gladly. Therefore from thenfforth
they ever continued good and faithful to the romans: and worthily and
substa^cially did every thing which was commanded unto them by Calphurnius /
by Albinus or by Metellus. For this consyderacion they lightly optayned all
their desire of Metellus / which at their request sent forth with them unto
the said town of Leptis: four cohortes of lombardes chosen out of all his
army with whom he sent to be captain over them a noble knight of his army
named Caius Annius / whom he also assigned to be lyeutenant of the town.

This town of Leptis was builded first of all by the Sidonians which (as we
read) fled from their own country for discord and variance which fell among
their cities at home. Which Sidonians came in ships into the coostes of
Affrike: where at last they builded this cite of Leptes / which is situate
between two quickesandes of whom the cite has his name.

For about thextreme parts of Affrike be.ii. breckes of the sea nere together
not like of quantite: but like of nature. Of which two breekes those parts
which be nerest unto the land ar very profounde and deep with hye banks of
sand on every side. But the other places not nere unto the land be sometime
deep: sometime shalowe after the dysposytion of the wether. For when the sea
begins in ragyng to be great and tempestyous by mouynge of the wind than
the waves of ye see draws forth of the same places the slyme / gravel / and
great stones: which in cawine wether were gathered together before in the same
places. And thus the facyon / aspecte / and regard of the same places is
mutable and changed at every tempest and great wind.

The langage of the cite of Leptis is now changed from the langage of Sydom
into numidian langage / by marriages of the numidians. But their laws / their
apparel / and manners (for the most part) still follows the custom of sydoni
/ which they me^tayned and kept still: somoche the more easily: because they
dwelled seperat in the extreme and utter parts of the country far from the
court and frequentacion of kings of numidy. For between this cite of Leptis
and the well inhabited parts of numidy be many places deserte and wyd^
wyldernesses vnhabyted for drienes of the country.

The description of that place of Affrike which is named the Phelen auters: and
for what cause the sa^e place was first so named. The.xlvi. cha.
But for asmoche as by occasyon of this besynes of the cite of Leptes and their
ambassadors / I have made mencyon of their cite and partly discrybed the
sytuacion of ye same. Now me thinks it thing convenient / and not unworthy
to recount an excellent and meruaylous deed done in the same coostes by two
brethern borne of the cite of Carthage and namely because the place is called
the Phylene auters me thinks it requisyte to declare the cause of that
denominacion. For this place of our history so requires. What time the
Carthagine^ses had in possession and were lords over the most part of
Affryke: at the same season the Cirenenses also were great and famous of name:
and abundant of wealth and richesse. Than between the coostes of these two
cities was a great and large field all over spread with sand without division /
perticion / or difference. But between them was neither f^od nor mountain /
which might discern the bounds and marches of both their coostes: which
thing caused continual and long war often and great batayls between both
parties. But after that many armies on both sides were overcome / slain / or
put to flight both by land and by see and when both peoples had somewhat wasted
the one the other by spoylyng and murdre: than began they to perceive their
own folly on both parts feryng lest some other nation anon after should
assail them both the ouercomers and them that were overcome when they were
wasted and weryed with batayls and brought to extremite: Wherefore this
co^sydred: they took truys between them both and to auoyed that long variance
between them: they made agreement and co^uenant that messangers or ambassadors
of both parties should depart out of their cities at one certain day and
hour assigned. And that same place where the messangers of both the cities
should mete together: should be for ever after taken for the bounds and marches
of the country / of both the nations and cities without more contencion or
variance. To bring this apoyntme^t to effect and conclusyon forth of the cite
of Cyren were chosen two for their part and send forth at the day and hour
appointed. And in likewise out of Carthage were send two breterne / each of them
named Phylene which swyftly sped them in their journey. But the Cyrene^ses went
much more slowly whether it so fortuned by negligence or chau^che I know but
little the truth. But this is known for certain that about those coostes
tempeste of wind and weder is wont to let men and prolong their journey in
likewise as upon the sea: and that for this cause. For when by those even
places wide / and bare without any thing growing on them: the wind ryseth and
styreth the small sand from the ground: the same sand moved by great
violence of the wynd is wont to fill the faces / mouths and eyes of such as
passes that way with dust and sand. And thus often by lettyng of their sight:
their iournay is prolonged and hyndred. But after when the Cyrenenses saw
themself somewhat ouerflowe and late in their iournay: they fered punysshement
at their retournynge home for their negligence. And blamyng they accused the
Carthaginenses obiectyng and saying that they had come forth of their cite
before the time assigned: and thus they troubled all the matter and brake the
ordynance. But shortly to speak these Cirenenses concluded rather to suffer
death and to do any thing possible than to return home again ouerco^e.
Wherefore the Carthaginenses desired some other condition or apoyntment to be
made indifferent and equal between both the parties. The Cirene^ses consented
thereto and put the Carthagine^ses in choice whyther they would be quick buried
in that same place which they desired for their marches and bounds: or else
that the Cirenenses under the same condition should proceed forward to that
place which they desired for their marches and there to be quick buried under
the same manner. The.ii. brethren both named Phylene allowed and granted the
condition subduyng and abandonyng their bodies to death for the profet and well
of their country and cite of Carthage: and so were they buried quick. Wherefore
the Carthaginenses in the same place where they were buried raised and
hallowed.ii. auters in worship and remembrance of these two brethern which set
more by encrese of their country: than by their own lives. These auters to
this present day be called the Phylene auts after the name of the.ii. brethern
named Phylenis therunder buried / as said is for well of their country: also
beside this memorial wtin the cite of Carthage were many other things ordained
to ye great honor of them and remembrance of their worthy deed. But now will I
leave this matter and reteurne to my purpose.

How Iugurth assembled a new army of the rude getulyans against the romans:
and how he associated unto him Bocchus king of the Mauriens to strength him
in battle against Metellus. The.xlvii. chapyter.
When Iugurth had lost the city of Thala / one of the strongest cities of his
land (as said is before) than he consydred well that in all his kingdom was
no place strong enough to resyst the might of Metellus. Wherefore he hasted him
with a small company through deserts and great wilderness fleyng from his
own country. And at last he came to the land of Getulians which is a manner
of people rude / wild / and without order or manners: and at that season naught
knowing of the preemyne^t honor and fame of the romayne empire. Of this people
Iugurth assembled a multitude together and by little and little enduced and
taught them by custom and exercise to follow the order of chyualry: to keep
array / to ensue their standerdes / to obey the commandments of their
capitayns / to discern and have knowledge of the signifiaunce of soundes of
trumpettes: and to observe all other points belongyng to warfare and chyualry.
These things with otherlike necessary to battle / Iugurth ceased not to
prepare and ordain with all diligence.

Moreover he provoked unto his favor and fellowship by great rewards and much
gretter promises such as were most nere friends to Bocchus king of the
maurie^s: by whose help he himself went to the king Bocchus and much desired
him in his quarrel with him to war against the romans. To this request of
Iugurth Bocchus agreed somoch the more for asmoche as at first beginning of
the same war: this Bocchus sent unto Rome ambassadors to desire of the
romans amyte and a bond of continual peace between him and them. But not
withstandyng that this peticion and peace was much expedient necessary to the
romans for diverse co^sideracions and namely because of this war. Not the
less it was not granted by mean of a few such as at Rome blinded with
avarice: were wont to sell for money every thing both honest and dishonest.
Also before this time the daughter of Iugurth was spoused to the said Bocchus.
But this bond of frendshyp of affinite among the numidi^es / and mauriens: is
reputed but of effect: because they are wont every man to have diverse and many
wives acordyng to their substance and richesse. Some.x. and some mo: after as
they are of abylite or power to me^tayne. But the kings because they are of most
power and substance: therefore have they mo than an other. Thus is their mind
and favor distract and diversely divided from all their wives for the multitude
of the^: and because they have so many so that they reserve none for their
special bed fellow. Wherefore they all ar reputed vile / and little set by:
after one manner. Thus the affinite between these two kings Iugurth and Bocchus
/ was little set by and small thing auayled in this business. Not
withstanding both they and their hoostes ca^e together in a place appointed
thereto: where after that they had given and taken faith and truth one to other
of fidelite / to be observed between them Iugurth greatly inhau^ced and lyfted
up the mind of Bocchus with his words saying that the romans were iniust
grounded in avarice without suffisance or measure. And common ennemies to every
man and to every country: and that they had asmoch quarrel against Bocchus / as
against him. And one self cause to war against them both: and also against
many other nations / which cause was but only the pleasure of great lordshyp
and riches. So that for the same cause all kingdoms to the^ were aduers and
contrary / and that he himself to them was enmy for the same cause. And not
long before that time the Carthagine^ses: and aftwarde Perses king of Macedony
were subdued and undone by the romans without any just title or cause of
batyle: save only ambicion and envy which the romans had against them. And
that in time to come every nacyon which should have wealth and richesse should
become ennemies to the romans for their inordynat pride / and in saciable
couetyse.

With these words and otherlyke Iugurth moved the mind of Bocchus against the
romans. In somoche that anon a day was appointed between both the kings to
proceed forth together to the town of Cyrtha / and to assail the same with
both their powers conjoined. This town they purposed first of all to besige:
because Metellus had left with in the same town his prays and prisoners which
he had taken of Iugurth. And also much of his own ordinance had he left
there to a void impedyment in his voyage. Thus Iugurth thought most expedient
to do. For if the might win the town by assaut before the rescous of Metellus:
he thought that should be most to his honor and profet. Or else if the romayne
captain Metellus / and his army should come to socours of the town: than
thought he that there both himself and Bocchus should give battle to Metellus.
Iugurth for craft and subtylte hasted hereto somoche the more to tangle Bocchus
in the war before any place should be moved between him and the romans. And
lest the same Bocchus by prolo^gyng of the time might rather incline to peace
than to war after he at leasour should have taken better counsel and
aduisement. For Iugurth suspected at beginning that Metellus in process of
time would desire this Bocchus not to medyll in this war assistyng the part
of Iugurth nor mentayning his cause.

How Metellus used himself herynge that these two kings were confederat
against him and how after he was certifyed that the prouynce of Numidy was
assigned to Marius the new consul: he c^^ssed the war for the nones.
The.xlviii. chapyter.
When Metellus knew that the two kings were associate together: he thought
not to fight with them rasshely without prouisyon: nor in every place for his
advantage or not as he was wont to do often times before after the first time
that he had overcome Iugurth. But within his feldes well and surely defended he
kept himself abydinge the coming of the two kings: and that not far from
the town of Cirtha. This did he thynking it best to know the might / manners /
and co^dicions of the mauriens first or he would fight with them / because they
were but new ennemies and therefore their manners unknown to him. And when he
saw his best auantage than thought he to give them battle.

In the mean time while Metellus tarried the coming of the two kings: letters
were brought unto him from Rome: which certifyed him that the province of
Numidy / was committed and given to Marius the new consul. For he had herd
long before this time that the said Marius was elect co^sull: but this was the
first time that he understood the province of Numidy committed to him. For this
cause was Metellus moved and displeased much more than longed to measure or
honesty. In somoch that he coud neither refrain his eyes from weeping nor
measure his tongue from spekyng ill by Marius. This Metellus was a synguler noble
and worthy man in all other conditions: but the displeasure of his mind he
took over womanly and tenderly to his heart / and namely in this cause. Which
condition: some reputed to proceed of a proud heart of Metellus. And other some
thought it no marvel though his noble heart were moved and kyndled with anger
/ for this injury and wrong done to him. And many said that Metellus took so
great sorrow and displeasure: because the victory which he had almoost
optayned should be pulled out of his hands his self having the labor and
paryll / and an other man the tryumphe and honor. But to be plain in the
matter and indifferently to write: it was not unknown to the wysest romans /
but that the dignite / auauncement / an honor of Marius grieved Metellus: much
more than did his own injury. And that he would not have taken it so heuely if
the province of Numidy which was taken from him had been given to any other
noble men tha^ to Marius. Wherefore Metellus was let from his first business
for the said displeasure so that he purposed not to vex himself from
thensforth with out thank or profet. And also he thought it folly to take in
hand the charge of another man's matter to his own paryll / labor / and
pain. Wherefore he send messangers to the king Bocchus / desyring him not to
become ennemy to the romans without occasion. And saying that he was as yet in
such case that he might adioyne with the romans fellowship love / and amyte:
which should be much better to him and more profitable than battle. And
howbeit he trusted greatly in his power / richesse / and treasour: yet ought he
not to change certain things / for things incertayne. For every battle to
begin is easy and light: but it is ver^ hard thing to end the same when it
is ones begone. The beginning and ending thereof: is not always in the power of
one same man. For war may be / begone of a coward or of any other wretch: but
it can not be left of again / nor ceased but when it pleases him which is
strongest / and is master having the upper hand. And finally he had him
better to provide for himself and for his kingdom than he began to do: and
not to adioyne nor myngle his goods / treasour / and fortune: which were in
estate royal florisshyng with the goods and fortune of Iugurth: which were
lost and distroyed to the uttermost. The ambassadors of Metellus came to king
Bocchus and showed him their capitayns will: as is said before under such
sentence. To the which words of Metellus / Bocchus answered again benignely
and mekely enough sayng that he desired nothing more than peace: save that he
had pity and compassion of the aduers and miserable fortune of Iugurth / but if
the same Iugurth might be suffered also to have frendshyp and amyte with the
romans and forgyuenesse: than said Bocchus that he would gladly agree to every
thing desired of Metellus / and every thing should be accorded between them.
The captain Metellus heryng this answer of Bocchus: again sent messangers
to him replyeng against his requests and saying that some of his peticions
were against justice and reason: also Metellus by these ambassadors desired
many other things of Bocchus / of whom Bocchus granted and allowed some: and
other some of them he denied. After this manner the time ouerpassed and proceeded
forth / massangers often going and coming between them both: so that by
such manner the war and battle remained untouched and depended not meddled
with: as Metellus did greatly coueyt and desire in mind because he would keep
sure that laud which he had won: and also for that to his own paryll and
damage he would not auantage nor auance Marius: in thing which to him
belonged.

But here will I leave to speak of Metellus / and return to speak of Marius
which contrary to the will of all the noble men of Rome was creat consul by
favor of the co^mens: likewise as I have written before.

Of the great ordinance and preparacyon which Marius the new co^sull made
against Iugurth and for the war of Numidy. The.xlix. Chapyter.
But Marius (as I have said before) was elect consul / at great desire and
instau^ce of the common people: which also committed to him the province of
Numidy. Marius seeing himself thus auanced: where he was ever against the noble
men of Rome before / now was he specially fires of mind / and stately. And
besy to displease and hurt the states: some time one by one / and other while
altogyder. He often times boosted and said that he had gotten the consulshyp of
them maugre their will / as if it were a pray or spoylinges gotten of his
ennemies: and of men overcome. Many other boostynge words spoke he to his own
commendacion / and to great displeasure and anger unto the estates of Rome. But
in the mean time he forgot not to prepare every thing necessary to the war:
whereof the charge rested on him to execute the same against Iugurth from
thensforth. He demanded of the senators and co^mens new supplement of
soudyours to repare and restore the army which was in Numidy with Metellus. For
many of them were slain / and many deed of sickness: thus was the army sore
deminisshed. He called also for socors of such nations as marched to thempire.
And of kings which were co^federate and had conjoined fellowship with the
romans. Moreover he raised up in Italy and nere about Rome / as many as were
strongest and bold men's bodies. And namely such as he himself had proved
before in war: and such as in warfare were proved by deeds: and not such as
were boosted by fame. And namely old soudyours which had long haunted the
war and were pardoned thereof. So that it was in the power of no man to
co^strayn them to war without their own fre assent: because that they had
continued still in war the season to them assigned of their captayns. These
treated Marius with so fair flateryng and painted words / that they were ready
to go with him in warfare. And how beit that the senators were contrary to
him: yet durst they nothing deny unto him belongyng to his business: but
gladly and with good will they decreed that he should raise and choose soudyours
to fulfill the nombre of them which were lost in battle in the country of
Numidy. But this did they for no great love which they had to Marius: for they
thought that he should lose outher the execucion of the battle which he
intended with Iugurth: or else the favor of the people which would refuse to go
forth to war. So that if Marius constrained them: their old love might
turn into new malice and hatered against him. But this thing was trusted but
in vain of the senators: for the most part of the co^mens had an inestimable
desire to go to battle with Marius. For every man cast in his mind to be
enriched by prays and spoylynges of war. And that more is: to return home
again victours with much honor and triumph. These things and otherlyke:
they consydred / which caused them gladly to follow Marius / and also Marius
did not a little enbolde and confort their minds with his exhortacion. For
when every thing which he desired of the senators was confermed and decreed by
them. And when Marius should assemble his soudyours: he thought to put them in
confort by exhortacion / and also to trouble and displease the states of Rome
as he was wont to do: and to chafe their minds. Wherefore he assembled and
called together a great company of the commen people / and spoke to them by
exhortacion and confortynge of them as herafter ensues.

The orison or exhortacion of the consul Marius: had to the common people of
Rome before his voyage into Numidy / which exhortacion is demonstratyue
contaynynge the laud and praise of Marius: and dysprayse and blames of the
noble men of Rome. The.l. chapyter.
RIght worthy cytezins / I know well that many of these estates of ancient
name have not themself behaved after one manner of condition in desyring of you
honorable dignities and great offices: and in administracion and gouernynge of
them after they have optayned the same of you. For while they make their
peticions: at beginning they be dyligent / seruiable / meke / and curtayse of
behauoure. But when they have optayned their desire: than pass they their time
in sloth / ydelnes / and pride. But it seems to me in my mind that they
ought to do much contrarely. For of how much more valor the hole common
wayle is: than is the co^sulshyp / thoffice of the hy judge / or any other
great office: with somoche more diligence and charge should the hole common
well be governed / than such dignities or offices desired of you. Nor I am not
ignorant but know right well how great the benefit is that ye have given to
me: and how great charge and business thereto belo^gyng is laid upon me
withal: which besynes I needs must sustain. That is to say: to prepare and
make ready an army / withal other things necessary to battle and to execute
the same: and nevertheless to spare the common treasour. To compel to warfare
and battle: such as a man would not grieve nor displease: that is you the
co^mentie of Rome: whom I would not displease by any means. To take charge
and care for every thing within the cite and without. And to do such things
among envious gentylmen obiectyng and layeng against me in every thing which
I go about / as men full of discord and variance. Verily noble citezins among
such men to take in hand such charges it is more hard and thing of more
dyfficultie / than any man can think or deuyse. And moreover: as for other
co^suls which have been before my time / when they have done any thing amysse:
than their old nobleness / the strong and valyant acts of their predecessors
/ the riches and power of their friends and kynsmen: and their many clyentes
and servants of them retained: all these have supported and mentayned them in
their misdeeds. But all my richesse and help / and trust of confort which I
have / is in my self and not in my kynsmen or other favorers: which aid of
my self I must of necessite defend with my virtue / strenght / and innocence.
For all other things which these ancient noble men have to defend them be
unsure to me for I have them not. Farthermore noble citezins this I understand
that all ye have good trust and confidence in me: and that all such as be
equal / just / and good: have favor unto me. For I knowell that my good deeds
has profited the commen wayle. And nevertheless these noble men seek
occasions against me / inuadyng and assaylyng me with their malice and envy.
Wherefore it stands me in hand of necessite to labor somoche the more besely
and quickly: that neither ye be disceyued in this great trust which ye have
in me: and also that all the purposes of mine ylwyllers and adversaries / may
be frustrate and nothing avail against me. Forsooth I have ever from my
chyldhode unto this age ben of such behauour that I have been acustomed and
exercysed in all manner labors and paryls: which I suffered and took patiently
for the common well without any reward before this your benefit and honor
which ye have now given to me. Wherefore worthy citezins seeing yt ye have now
rewarded me better than I am worthy: I have not purposed to desyst nor leave of
mine old good will anenst ye common well: nor now I / rewarded of you purpose
not to omyt my good deeds which I did freely before unrewarded. But touching
these ancient gentylmen: it is very hard for the^ to temper themself being in
power or dignite which only did but feign themself good and honest before
they optayned promocyon / to the intent to come thereby to honor and dignite.
But where as I have passed all my life in right good occupacio^s by continual
custom it is roted in me to do well: and this custom is turned with me into
nature. Treuth it is: that ye have commanded me to war against Iugurth:
which thing these noble men takes very grievously. I require you consider and
dyscus in your minds and in your inward consideracion / ponder ye: whyther it
be better / more necessary and expedient to change the same your commandment
again: and to send forth some other of that sort of ancient gentilmen unto
this business against Iugurth or else to any other like. Send forth a noble man
of old auncetry: in honor and remembrance of whom many images may be made
and erect or set up on hy. But of polycie of chyualry or warfare is he utterly
ignorant and inexpert. Will ye change your purpose and send forth such one to
warfare at pleasure of these gentylmen / as who says: that is best to be done
for this cause. To the intent that in so great a matter and wighty business:
such a captain more ignorant and ferefull than any of all his soudyours /
shall be chosen of you which anon after shall choose forth again some one of the
commen people to be his master: to inform and teache him in such business as
to his office and charge belongs: himself being ignorant of every thing
necessary to be done. By this mean it often fortuneth: that he whom ye
ordain to be captain and co^maunder of your army: does chose an other to be
captain and commander over himself. In somoche that (if ye indifferently
judge) he: whom ye chose for captain is much more mete to be made a simple
soudyours / than a capitaynr over other. And also worthy citezins: I know some
of these noble men so far out of order that when they have been made consuls:
than have they given themself to redyng of the acts of their elders and
predecessors. And of the greeks precepts of chyualry: which doutlesse may
well be called men without order / for this co^syderacion. For they should by
due order first learn to rule their office before they should take upon them
the charge thereof. But they do contrary. First they take charge of office and
than after learn to rule it by way i^ordinate: howbeit every wyseman will first
learn to govern an office before he desire it or take upon him the rule
thereof. But these estates contrarily demean themself. Thus worthy citezins
compare me a new gentylman with their immoderate pride and take diligent
considercion which is best: to be not gentle of birth and lowly and gentle
of manners: or else to be gentle of blood / and proud and ungentle of manners.
Of such things as they be wont to here and to read: some have I seen / and
some I my self have done. I have learned that by excercyse of chyualrie / which
they have learned by redyng. Now judge and consider ye: whyther is better of
deeds or warkes: of redynge and doing. They dispyce my neweltie of honor and
unnoble lynage: and I dispyce the vncraftynesse and sloth of them. My happy
fortune is objected of them against me as to rebuke: but shame and dishonest
behauour / may be objected and laid against them in rebuke. Is it not truth
that every man is come of one like nature. I consider and know well that one
man is not better nor more noble than an other: but if it be by his wisdom /
good manners / virtue / and strength. And I consider well that every man the more
that he is endued with virtue: the more excellent and noble is he. Thus is the
strongest / wysest / and most virtuous / most excellent in nobleness.

But if the fathers of Albinus / and of Calphurnius: la^e consuls and captayns
in Numidy / to the great dishonor and damage of this empire / were now
lyueng that it might be inquyred of them whether they had lever that I had been
begotten of them: or else the said Albinus and Calphurnius? What think ye they
would answer? Forsooth naught else (as I suppose) but that they would desire and
covet good children and honorable lynage to proceed of their stock and
generation. Thus sith it is so: that these estates dispyseth me: reasonably and
of right let them also dispyce their own predecessors and forefathers / of
whose stock and lynage they proceeded: which came to noblenes and honor: not
by their auncetry: but by their own strength / wisdom / and virtue: likewise
as I have done. They have envy at this mine honor. Than let them also have
envy at my labors taken for defense of the common wayle: let them envy mine
innoce^ce and great peryls / which I have ouerco^e. For by these means I have
obtained and also shall mentayne this honor which they so greatly envy. But
these men corrupt by pride: after ye have promoted them to worship: so pas
forth their time as if they set naught by your offices and honors by you
optayned: but utterly despised them. Thus they desire such dignities of duty:
as if they were worthy and deserved to have them by their honest lyueng and
virtuous conversation. But certainly they be greatly disceyued which looks
after two things contrary both together and at one season. So do these noble
men. For they would have the voluptuous pleasure of sloth and ydelnesse / and
the rewards due unto virtue and laborious dilygence. But when these gentylmen
utter their words before you or speak before the senators: than in the most
part of their speech they exalt and commend their auncetry wenyng to be
counted more noble and excellent by recountyng and reducynge to remembrance the
valiant deeds of their progenitors. But it is nothing so. For how much more
excellent the fame and honor of their progenitour was: somoch more shameful
and reprouable is this cowarde ydelnesse of these gentylmen now lyueyng which
so far go out of kind from the honorable conversation of their progenytours:
as if they had never dyscended of them. And verily this is certain: the
glorious deeds and honorable of forefathers be like an example or luminary unto
their ofspringe or progeny. So that the same light suffers neither the good
deeds nor bad of their progeny to be hyd. For if the progeny vary from the
glorious acts of their progenitors than the honor of both is distayned: but
if they follow them in virtue / than the light and glory of the progenitors
shynneth more radiantly by virtue of their progeny. Of this laud and honor of
my progeny I can not boost me for they were but of base degree. Their deeds can
not auau^ce me nor make me noble. But it is lawful to me to speak of mine own
deeds which laud is much more clear and excellent than to boost of other
men's acts. But now consider ye how vnryghtwyse these gentylmen be to me:
they will not grant me that laud and honor by mine own virtue and acts:
which they usurp and proudely take upon them: by virtue and deeds of other
men. And wherefore think ye do they this? Planely I suppose because I have no
images of my progenitors exalted in remembrance of them as these gentylmen
have: and because my nobleness it but new and springyng. But theirs is
ancient and by their dysorder decaynge. But certainly I count it more better
and honorable to be rote and begynner of nobleness unto all my progeny and to
leave the same unto my branches: than to corrupt and defele nobleness received
of my progeny: as many of these gentylmen do. Forsooth I am not ignorant but
that if these estates were now present and should answer to my words their
speech should be abunda^tly painted / ornate / and elegant enough. But sith they
cease not to blame and reuyle with their lewd words in every place both you
and me for this your great office which ye have given unto me: it has not
pleased me to be still nor to keep secret their fautes: lest some might count
culpable and worthy their rebukes: by reason of mine indyscrete patience and
silence. Nevertheless sothely their words can not grieve nor hurt me: after
the conscience of mine own mind. For if they say truth they can naught say
but good and worship by me: but if they will needs ly on me my manners / my
living / and co^uersacion is such that I shall overcome their words and prove
their iniust accusementes feigned and false. But sith your counsel is blamed of
these noble men because ye have committed to me this great honor and gretter
business: consider ye in your minds diligently and often whyther ye shall
need to repent you of this deed or not. To say truth I can not boost my self
of the images of my progenitors nor I can not recou^t unto you the triumphs or
co^sulshyps of mine auncetry. But if the matter required: I could well show
unto you speres / standerdes / horse / trappers / harness: with many other
rewards of chyualry: some given to me of the emperor / and some of other
captayns for mine acts in battle. And other some which with mine hands I
have won of thennemies of the empire. I could also if it neded show you i^ the
fore part of my body manyfolde scarres of many and large wondes which I have
taken in good worth for defense of our country and common well. These be my
images which I can show. This is my noblenes: not left to me by heritage (as
theirs is to them) but noblenes which I have won and gotten with great and sore
labors of my body and paryll of my life. My words be not ordered in ornate
langage nor my spech ypaynted with rethorike like theirs for I set little
thereby. My virtue shows it self playnelie enough without glosed or painted
words. But these noble men must of necessite have craft for to cover their
shameful and ungoodly deeds / with this eloquent words / their crafty and
rethorike speech. Nor as for me: I never learned the greek letters nor langage /
which thing these estates object against me: as a great faut. But to be
plain: my pleasure was never much to learn such things / which have little
auayled unto the techers or lerners of the same / neither to acquisicion of
virtue nor expulsion of vice. But I have learned and am taught in other things
much better / and more profitable to the common well: as to assail and stryke
mine ennemies: to dispoyle their ordyna^ce and vitayls: to chafe their
garnyson. Nothing to dread nor fear / save an ill name: to endure and take in
good worth the pleasure of the somer and the hardenes of the winter both in
like: to ly upon the ground: to endure hunger and labor both together.
Therefore I shall exhort and inform my soudyours with these precepts: which I
my self have learned / used and assayed. Nor I shall not handell or treat them
by craft to the intent that they may auaunce me with richesse: nor use them
sharply and my self plesa^tly: but i^ every* difficulty I shall be their
example of labor: nor I shall not put the labor to them and take the worship
to me. This order is profitable. Thus ought a captain demean him among his
soudyours and namely among worthy citezins. For when a man lives delicately
himself / and drives his soudiours to the peril of battle by punyssheme^t or
other rygour: he is not to be called a captain or ruler of an army: but rather
a proud lord or tyrannous oppresser of citezins. Our elders worthily
behauynge themself after this manner have made noble and excellent and enriched
this common well: and themself also. But these estates which now lives
trustyng to be honored by the worthynesse of their progenitors / they
the^seffe unlike of co^dicions despice us and have us in disdain which follow
the manners of their progenitors. And every hye office and all honors they
chalange and demand of you not by their merits: but as it were of duty and
heritage. But ^othely the over proud men err much from the truth. For
though their progenitors and auncetry have left unto them every thing which to
them was possible to leave: as riches / patrimony / and their images: for
remembrance and example of them and of their worthy deeds. Nevertheless their
virtue have they not left unto them: nor they could not keep it: for that only
can neither be given unto them in reward nor received of any man. These
gentilmen say that I am a man without manners and uncleanly of behauour. And why?
Forsooth because that I prepare and dress not curyously many delicyous
bankettes so superfluous and deyntyous as they do: and because I have no
iougler nor dysar with me to move sportes and dissolut laughing: nor no more
curyouse coke than one of the vyllage longyng to rural people / which things
to have as these gentylmen have: it pleases me not to knowledge. For I never
had pleasure in such things. For I have herd of my father and of other
incorrupt and well disposed men: that such delyciousnesse and curyosite
belongs unto women. And that labor and business belongs unto men. Every
good man: thinks it more convenient to have plenty of worship than of
richesse. And more honor it is to a good man to have the walls of his house
garnysshed and ouercouered with armor / wherewith he may defend his country /
his friends / and himself than with rich orname^tes of curyous warke of no
profet save only the sight and vain regard thereof. But sith these gentylmen
thus object such matters to me: let them continue always in such vices which
lyketh the^ / and that they have ever reputed so dear. Let them incline to
voluptuosite: as daunsyng / synging / bankettyng / playng / to lechery / to
glotony / and dronkenes. For in such vices have they spend their youth: in
the same let them pas forth their age: utterly subdued to the belly / to sleep /
to ydelnes / and subject to the lusts of the vylest part of the body. Let them
leave the sweet of fyghting / the peril of death / the blyndyng of dust in
battle: and otherlyke paryls unto us / to whom these be more acceptable /
than their feestes and voluptuous bankettes or other vile pleasurs. But they do
not so / they be not so contented. For after that such ungoodly and vile men
have dishonested themself / by their foul deeds: than be they ready to take a
way the rewards of good men unto themself. Thus (against all right) lechery
and sloth most cursed vices does no hurt to such as occupyeth them: but they
be utter destruction to the common wayle / and co^mens which be innocent and
vnculpable.

But sith I have made answer to these dysordred gentylmen: and that moderately
after my custom and condition and not so largely as their cursednesse and
vices ar worthy. I shall speak now a few things touching the commen well.
And first of al have ye good trust and asperance touching the besynes of
Numidy. For ye have now moved and avoided every thing whereby Iugurth was
defended from beginning of the war unto this time: that is to say the
couetyse of Calphurnius / and of Albinus: the vncraftynes and folly of Aulus:
and the pride of Metellus. By these found Iugurth socour hitherto: but all
these be avoided now. Moreover ye have there an army which knows the country
/ but verily it is more noble and manly than fortunate or happy. For a great
part thereof is wasted and spent (and that wors is) infected and corrupted: what
by the avarice and by the vnboldnesse and cowardyse of their captayns. Wherefore
ye which be of lusty age and mete to endure the hardness of war and battle:
now labor ye with me / and take ye in hand the defense of the commen wayle.
Nor let none of you be afraid nor abashed for misfortune of the other
soudyours which have foughten there before this time nor of the pride of their
captayns. For I myself as cou^sellour of your business and fellow of your
peryls shall be present with you in every business both in your iournays and
in your batayls also. So that I shall govern you and my self without
difference / and under one form in every point. And verily by help of the
gods we shall within short season obtain all aua^tages and commodities which
any man may wyn in battle / as prays / victory / with immortal laud and
worship. And certaynlie if these pleasors and auantages were in dout or hard
to obtain (as they be not): Nevertheless it were convenient to every good man
(as ye be) to socour and defend the common wayle of their country fro
distruccion and dishonor. For certaynlie there was never man which obtained
immortal laud nor everlasting name by cowardice or sl^uth. Nor there was
never wise father which would wysshe his children or sons to live ever: but
only that they might live so long as they behaved themself worthily in
goodness and honesty: and so to pass forth their life as natural course
requires. Worthy romans: I would speak more unto you if I understood that
strength could be increased to feeble or fearful men: by words: but it is not
so. Wherefore me seems that I have said enough and abundantly to noble and
bold hearted men: as my trust is to prove you.

How Marius after his exhortacion endyd: anon laded ships with ordynance of
war and send forward with the same one Ma^lyus his imbassadour: and how he
himself anon after followed withal his company. And how he behaved himself
in Numidy at first beginning. The.li. Chapyter.
When Marius had vttred and ended his words under this form: and when he saw
all the minds of the co^mens inclined to the war in trust of victory and
prays. Than anon without more delay he caused ships to be charged with
viteyls / and treasour for the soudyors wages with armor / wepyn / and all
other things necessary to war. And commanded one named Aulus Manlius / which
was assigned ambassadors to him: to depart forward with the same ships so
charged. In the mean season Marius himself remained at Rome a little time: and
chose forth soudyours such as him thought most expedient: and not after the
custom of the old romans his predecessors nor after institucion of the
ancient captayns / which had ordered cartayne manner of people of whom soudyours
should be chosen for warfare in time convenient. But contrary wise Marius
admytted every man indifferently which was any thing lyckely and had pleasure
to go with him. And many such he admytted also which were poor and not
suffered to go warfare before: lest their poverty might have constraned them
rather to fall to robbery than to deeds of chiualry. How beit / it was inacted
of the old romans that such excused of war for cause above said: should
pay a certain sum of money pretaxed toward the wages of such as laufully
were admytted to war. Marius suffered none of these to pay any thing at al:
but elect many of them for his soudyours. Many of the romans surmysed that
Marius elected unto war these abject parsons: for want of other good
soudyours. Some other demed that he so did for favor / ambicion / and
parcialite: because this sort of people assisted and honored him by
auauncement at beginning of his promocion. And also men consydred that unto a
man desirous of dignity and power: the most nedy men be most mete and
behouable. For such nedy wretches be most auenturous: for they have naught to
lose and always trust in auauncement by auenturynge themself. And therefore they
judge every thing which they do: good / honest / and laudable: if any auantage
be thereto appendant. Thus dout they no paryll so that they may come thereby to
promocion. At last Marius departed from Rome with somewhat gretter nombre than
was granted and decreed to him of the senators. Within few days after that:
he took shyppyng and arrived in the province next unto Affrike under the
romans at a town named Vtica. The army which was there with Metellus / was
delivered to him by one Publius Rutilius / which was ambassador with the said
Metellus. For Metellus himself fled the sight of Marius because he would not
se that with his eyes / which he could not endure to here. But when Marius had
restored and fulfilled the legions of his soudyors / and the cohortes for the
subsidyes and rescous. Than went he into a plentyfull place of Numidy which was
full of prays. All that he took there: he gave freely inrewarde to his
soudyours. This done: he assailed such castles and towns which were but febly
defended with men and walls. He had many batayls and light skyrmisshes: and
many other things he did in other places not with much difficulty. In the
mean time the new soudyours were ready manly fyghtyng without fere: and seeing
that they which fled were other taken or slain: therefore they aduysed them well
that the strongest and boldest was most sure of all. They consydred well that it
stood them in hand to defend with wepyn and armor their liberty / their
country / their friends / and all other things longyng to their hel^h and
honor. Thus labored they for glory / laud / and riches which they
optayned: so that within short season the old soudyours and the new increased
together cherisshynge and infourmynge one an other till their virtue and
boldness was like. But when the two kings Iugurth and Bocchus understood of
the coming of Marius: they divided their hoostes and went in sonder into
diverse places where no man could attain to them for difficulty of the places.
This was done by counsel of Iugurth. For it pleased him so to do trustyng that
within short space the romans would be spread abroad in spoylinge and than
thought he to assail them in every place when they were most without fere at
liberty / at large / and unprovided: as men ar wont to be specially when their
ennemies behaueth them as if they were affrayed. Than often be the victour
improuident and less circumspect.

How Metellus the old consul returned to Rome: and of the worthy and
valyant behauour of Marius against Iugurthe and of his great acts at his
beginning. The.lii. Chapyter.
IN the mean time Metellus returned to Rome: which contrary to his opinion was
received with glad minds of the romans and after that the envy which Marius
had moved against him was assuaged and ouerpassed: he was like dear and beloved
both to the co^mens and senators.

But Marius on his part applied and took head to his own business and his
ennemies also: without sloth but with great wisdom. He perceived well and
knew what was good and ill for aua^tage on both sides. He caused the ways and
iournayes of the two kings to be daily serched and espied. He prevented and
interrupted their counsels / prouysions / and gyles. He suffered nothing to be
unprovided and unready on his side: but of the other side and party of his
ennemies: he suffered nothing to be sure or provided: for always he prevented
their provisions and pursued them. Often while Iugurth and the Getulyans
spoiled the Numidyens which had yielded themself to the romans Marius was
ready in their way and valiantly assailed them: and over thrue many of them /
while they were dispersed abroad and fleyng away for fear. And also not far
from the town of Cirtha / he made Iugurth himself so trust in his flight that
for have to ren away: he laft his armor behind him. But when Marius co^sydred
that his acres were only glorious and excellent without any auantage: and that
he might not e^ecute battle with Iugurth for his unsteadfastness and mouyng from
place to place: he consydred in mind and ordained him ready to besyege the
cities of the country one after another. And namely such as outher of men or
of place were necessary and behouable to his ennemies / and contrary or
hurtful to him. This did he thinking: that if Iugurth without dystourbance
suffered him so to do he should other be spoiled and bereft of his cities /
ordynance / socours / and refuge: or else he must abide the fortune of battle
and strive for the maistry in plain feld. Bocchus the king of the mauriens had
often send messangers before unto Marius: saying that he would gladly come
into favor / amyte / and frendshyp of the romans: and byddyng Marius not to
dout him as an ennemy nor to fear any thing longing to an ennemy to be
committed of him against the romans. It is but little known for truth whether
Bocchus feigned this thing to the intent that his coming to battle unknown,
and unproven might be to Marius more grievous: or else whether he was wont by
unstableness of mind to change peace sometime for war: and sometime war for
peace. But Marius the consul (as he had purposed before) drue him unto the
castles and towns which were walled and defended: and fiersly assailed them.
Anon he turned many of them from his ennemies to him* some by strength and
violence / some by fear: and other some by promisyng and gyueng of rewards
and prodicion of their captayns. But at first beginning he meddled but with
mean castles and towns thynking that Iugurth should come to defend and
socour his people and towns: and so come into danger of the romans. But when
Marius herd that Iugurth was far thens and occupied in other besynesses: than
thought he not to lose his time: but to adventure on gretter things wherein was
more hard business and gretter labor and honor. Wherefore he intended to
besiege the cite of Capsa / which was a great cite / strong / and rich.

How Marius wanne the great and rych city named Capsa: and how he utterly
distroyed the same and gave all the richesse thereof to havoc among his
soudyours. The.liii. chapyter.
Among the most wydest and thickest wyldernesses of Numidy was this great and
rich cite named Capsa: which (as men say) was first bylded by that Hercules
which was borne in the land of Libya: and not by Hercules the son of
Iupyter and Alcumena. Thinhabitours of this cite were ruled by Iugurth peasably
and easily put to no charges nor business / and therefore were they most true
and faithful to him. They were defended against al ennemies: not only with
walls / armor / and men: but also with much stronger defense of the
difficulty and hardness of the place and country nere about them. So that it
was in manner impossible that any army could come nere them for want of water
and scarcite of vitels. For except the feldes and places nere to the cite all
the other be void and wast ground and desert without habitacion / vneared /
barayne / and dry without water. All full of serpe^tes: which were somoch more
violent and fires for lack of meat and sustenance / as al other wild beestes
be wont to inrage for hunger. And moreover the myscheuous and perilous nature
of serpents is more kyndled to ragyng and vexed with thyrst / than with any
other thing: which thyrst they could not quench there for want of water.
Wherefore neither man nor be might surely pass by them. Wha^ Marius cast al
these difficulties in his mind: his heart was persed with a merueylous desire
to win this cite / both for that it was much hurtful to him: and profitable to
Iugurth / and also because it was hard to do and much honor might be gotten
in wynninge thereof. And moreover because Metellus the other consul before him
had won the cite of Thala / with great honor and glory: which of sytuacion
was not unlike to this cite: nouther unlike in defense. Save that not far from
the walls of Thala were a few fontayns: but about this cite of Capsa was no
water / well / nor fontayne: save one and that was within the walls of the
city always full of water. All other which dwelled without the walls / as in
the suburbs: occupied but rain water. The inhabitants of that country and of
all the remenant of Affrike / which were far from the sea and rude people could
much the better endure this scarsite of water and thirst: for this cause. For
the most part of them were fed with milk and venyson not lokyng after salt /
sauces / nor other such things as be norisshynges or prouocatiues to glotony.
They took meat and drink only to s^ake their hunger / and to quench their
thirst: and not without measure to provoke themself to pleasure of the flesh
/ as many christenmen do now i^ our days: which make of their belly their god.
And eat not to live: but they live to eat contrary to man's life / and
utterly inclined to bestialite. O cursed glotony let us christe^men learn her
of panyms to eschew the: which wasted the body and goods: damnest the soul:
and art mother and norice of al vices. But to return to my purpose: this
Marius after that he had serched every thing by his espyes / he proceeded in
his interprise and purpose (as men thought) helped of the gods. For against
so many and hard difficulties he could not have made sure provision by
counsel of man nor by his own private wit: as he which had impediment and
was let not only by shapnesse of the country: but also by lack and
scarcite of wheat and of all other corn. For the numidiens inte^deth more / to
norisshe pasture for beasts than to labor or ere the ground for corn. And
also they had brought together all the seed and corn of the year before into
strong holds as their king Iugurth had commanded them and moreover at that
season the feldes on every side were dry and bare without corn: and no
maruale. For it was about the extremite or later end of somer. Not
withstandyng all these difficulties and sharpnesses Marius made provision
enough as the matter required. First he committed all the bestes which he had
taken in pray in foretyme unto the horsemen / which of their own wylfolowed
him to war: or were send to him for help by friends of thempire. Marius
commanded them to take charge to drive forth these beasts. Than sent he Aulus
Manlius ambassador of the host to a town named Laris / and all the cohortes
of his soudyours with him which were fotemen and light harnysed for to keep the
treasour of the soudyours wages and vitayls: which he had left in the same
town. Marius kept his counsel of this interprise so secret that none of all
his company hye nor low knew of his purpose nor when he intended. But when
Manlius and his company should depart toward Laris: Marius dissimuled with
them saying that he would stray abroad in Numidy in rouyng and afterward within
few days: he and his company would come also to the same town of Laris /
laded with prays of his ennemies. This done he deperted toward a flod named
Tana: no creature lively knowing of his purpose. And every day he distribued in
his iournayes among his boost.xlii. heed of oxen for vitayle / which he
commanded to be divided by even portion among them by hunders and half
hunders together: deuidyng vitayls to every company after their nombre. And in
the mean season he charged bottels and bowges to be made of the hydes of the
same beasts and of other ledder in great no^bre. Moreover he eased their
scarcyte wheat and other corn: by wise provision. And without knowledge of
all his company he made good prouisyon of every thing / which might be
necessary unto his army in time of need. At conclusion the syxt day after when
they were come to the said flod of Tana: thither was brought a mighty multitude
of bottels and bowges made of ledder. There pytched they their tents with easy
labor and small defense. Than refresshed they themself with meat and drink:
and eased themself a certain space. This done: Marius commanded them that
every man should be ready to proceed forward even with the son going down
and that every man should only lade himself and his beasts with water in the
said bowges and bottels leaving al other carriage / burdens / and baggage:
there behind them in their tents / under the custody of other soudyours
thereto assigned. After this when he saw his time: he departed forth from his
tents with his company: and lauboured all the night long in his iournay. The
day after following he rested in a secret and covert place. In the same wise
behaved he himself the night next ensuynge: and in the third night much
before the day light / he entered into a fair and large field full of small
hills and downs / no more but two mile space from Capsa. And there he tarried
withal his host in the most priueest manner abidynge the day light. But as soon
as the day began to appear: many numidyens issued forth of the town: some to
dysporte themself: and some about their besynes / naught fearyng nor
suspectyng of their ennemies. When Marius saw that: anon withal haste he sent
all his horsemen to the town / and with them as many fotemen in light harness
as were most swyft and spedy. Whom he commanded to ren withal have and
boldly and valiantly to assail the town: and to besyege the gates. Than
after he himself followed spedely: but with good head and aduisement: not
sufferynge his soudyours in the assaut nor in the way thyderwarde to fall to
robbyng nor prays by spoiling of their ennemies. When thinhabitantes of the
town knew hereof: their case was unsure / their fear great and horrible: for
the sudden chance of them was nothing suspected before / nor provided. Many
of the cetezins which were without the town and were taken and in power and
captivity of the romans their ennemies sent unto them within the town
desyring them for save guard of their lives to yield themself and the cite to
Marius. So was it done at conclusion. Howbeit this not wtstandyng Marius brent
the cite. All the numidyens inhabytantes thereof which were of full age and able
to bear wepen were slain: and the remanent as women / children / and aged men
were taken prisoners and sold for their ransom. The pray and richesse was
divided among the soudyours. This deed against the law of arms was not thus
done by Marius: by couetyse nor any outher cruelty of him: but because the
town and place was profitable / and necessare to Iugurth and to the romans
hard to come to. And the manner of the people proved mouable and unlawful ever
of nature before: and neither refrained from their ill appetite by benefit or
good deed: nor yet with awe or fear of punysshement.

How Marius by fortune more than by strength wanne the strongest castle of
all Numidy / wherein were the tresours of Iugurth. The.liiii. chapyter.
AFter that Marius had brought to end so great and hard an interprise without
any loss or damage to him or any of his people. Though he were reputed noble /
great and excellent before: than began he to be counted more famous and
excellent. Every noble deed: was reputed to be done by strength and wisdom of
Marius: and ascribed to his strength and polycie. And that such things as
were done by good counsel and provision / and also such as hapened by fortune
or chance: and by negligence of their ennemies. The soudiours were so manerly
treated without cruelty or fiersnesse of their captain / and also made rich
and abundant in treasour and jewels: that they exalted and praised his name to
the heaven. And loved him as themself. But in contrarywyse the numidyens feared
him more than any man living. Shortly to speak: both the friends of thempire
and ennemies also thought verily that outher Marius had a godly mind and was a
god himself: or else that he was prive with the gods: and did all his deeds
and business by their advise / counsel / and provision: which showed him
before what should fortune after. But when this chance had fortuned so well at
Capsa: anon Marius drue him to other towns / and took as many as he besyeged.
In some towns the numidyens resysted him to their power: but it could not
avail. In many other towns the dwellers gave them over and left them void
and ran away feryng so to be treated and dealt withal as they of Capsa were:
because their towns were like behouable to Iugurth* and hurtful to Marius.
When Marius came to any such town: destitute and void of dwellers he set fire
in them and brent them ground smothe. The aged men / women and children: took
them to wodes and caves to hyde themself. The young men and lusty which were
taken were slain down right. Thus was every place filled with weeping and
wayling / brennyng and slaughter: one mengled with other. Finally af^ yt Marius
had won into his hands / many towns and castles: and some without resystence
or blood shedyng of his men / he went in hand with an other maistry and
difficulty not so sharp nor hard to come to as was Capsa / but to be won or
besyged it was not les hard nor of les difficulty.

Not far from the flod of Mulucha (which water deuydeth the kingdom of
Iugurth: from the kingdom of Bocchus) was a great rock or mountain of stone
in mids of a plain: open enough to be seen having thereupon bylded a mean
castle of quantite: but of a meruaylous altitude and only one strayet passage
and narowe / left to come thereto. But on every other side the rock of natural
growyng was down right like a wall: as if it had been made for ye nones with
man's hands. Marius purposed with all his might to take this castle: and
namely because the tresours of Iugurth were wtin the same. But this his purpose
at last came to effect / rather by chance of fortune / than by provision or
counsel. For this castle was garnisshed and plentuously instored with men /
wepen / vytels / and withal orther ordynance requisite and necessary to
defense of such a forteres. Moreover win the same was a fountain ple^tyful of
clear water. And beside this the sytuacion thereof was such that without
marvelous difficulty and unmeasurable labor none ennemies might attain or
approach nere thereto their ingynes of battle to frusshe the walls or any
other part thereof. Besyd al these defe^ces the double walls o^ this castle
were garnysshed with towers / bulwarks / and all other defenses and ingynes
which could be ymagined by man's mind: and that rownde about in compass
as well within / as without. The way thereto: by which the inhabitants and
garnison used to go and come / was very strayet and narowe. Insomoch that the
romans entryng by the same way with their ingynes of battle were co^straned
to cut their pauases on both sides and to make them more narowe for
strayetnesse of the passage. And in such manner they proceeded forward under
the same in great paryll and with much difficulty: and at conclusion all in
vain. For when they were come nere to the walls and would have set up and
adjoined the same pauases to the walls to have undermined under them: all
their labor was frastrate. For what with stones and what with fire the
defenders of the castle brake and brent them again down to the ground. Thus
cowde not the soudyors which undermined the walls continue together at their
work and business: for strayetnes and difficulty of the place and importune
violence of them within the castle. Nor other soudyours could not serve them
which made and repared the pauases without great paryll and danger. For
continually as fast as they raised the pauases to cover and defend them self:
they were broken and brent between their hands. In the mean time no soudyour
was so good / strong / nor bold: but that he was outher wounded or beaten done
to death. Than was fear increased to other that were feeble and faint herted.
But after that many days and great labors in this manner were ouerpassed and
spent in vain. Marius was sore angered and vexed in his heart reuoluyng many
things in mind: but specially whyther he might give over his purpose (seeing
his labor frustrate) or else abide the chance of fortune which at many times
before he had found favorable and friendly to him. While Marius chafed and
brennyng in desire reuolued such things in his mind both day and night: it
hapened by chance of fortune that a certain lumbard a simple soudyour / one
of the company which was last send from Rome to Numidy to supply the army
strayed abroad from his company a little way which lumbarde as he wandered found
among the stones many small snayles crepyng on the ground: not far from that
side of the castle which was over against the side which the romans besyged
and assailed. Because this lumbard in his country was acustomed like other of
his country men to eat such snayles prepared after their manner: therefore he
gathered first one and than an other / and after that many: ascendyng up by
little and little: sometime crepyng sometime clymmyng / for no other intent or
purpose save to gather such snayles: and so far he proceeded by little and little
till at last he came almost to the top of the mountain. But when he saw all
that side of the castle desolate and no person steryng: anon he began^e to
have a pleasure and desire in his mind for to work some maistry / as the
property and condition is of every man couetyng to win a name / laud and
riches: and to be spoken of. By chance of fortune in the same place where the
lumbard stood in this aduiseme^t / among the stones grue a great and old oak
tree having the mids a little bowyng down toward the ground: and the
remane^t crokyng upward again with mighty arms and branches ascendyng to the
highest of the walls with the top erect and lyfred up as every herb and tree of
nature is wont to grow upward at the top. This lumbard well advised the same
and adventured to clyme up ward taking his hold sometime by the branches and
bows of this oak: and sometime taking hold and leauyng by the stones which
appeared forth in the wall till at the last he attained unto the very top of the
wall. And when he saw no man styring on that part there stood he still espied
of no man and noted and co^sydred well at his pleasure all the inward part of
the castle and the plain within the walls about the tower. This lumbard had
somoche the more leasour to take so long aduisement vnespyed for all the
numidyens defenders of the castle were on the other side attendyng and gyueng
head to the assaut and defendyng themself and the castle against the romans.
When the lumbard had espied and consydred every thing which he thought might be
aua^tage to his after purpose: than he descended again downewarde by the same
way which he ascended: but not without head nor with so little aduisement as he
ascended upward: but prouyng every way / and lokyng about if it were possible
to bring into the castle any company of men by that side or not. This well
consydred: as soon he descended: anon he went to Marius and informed him of
every thing as he had done exhortyng and requiryng him to put in proof whether
the castle might be won on that side where he had been. Farthermore he promised
himself to be gyde unto such as would undertake that intprise saying that in
the matter was no danger. Marius heryng these words of the lumbard / send
forth with him certain of his men of them which were there present to
understand and know the truth of the matter. When they had been there and
returned to Marius again: some brought him word that the matter was easy to
do: and some other said that it was very hard and perylous. The sentence of
every man was after as their mind gave them. The cowardes thought it hard /
but such as were of bold hertes and desirous of worship thought it easy and
without much peril. Nevertheless the mind of Marius was somwat exalted to
comfort / and good hope: and therefore of all the company of trumpettes / and of
other such mynstrels as be wont to be in battle to give courage and signs to
the fig^ters / he chose forth five which were most swyft and most light and
deliver: and.iiii. hundred men he assigned to assyst and defend the said
tru^pettes. And al them he commanded to obey to the lumbard and to be ruled
and ordered by him in every thing. The day next following was assigned to them to
proceed forth i^ their business. When the time assigned and prefixed by Marius
was come the lumbard with his company had made ready and ordered every thing: and
so went to the place where be had been before. But when they were come thither:
the lumbard their gyde caused them to change their armor / and to make bare
their heedes and their fete: to the intent that they so bare heded the better
might se above them and on every side of them: and that they being bare foot
might labor somoche the better and take better hold in clymming up by the
stones. Their swords were fastened behind at their backs and their buckelers
withal / which were made after the fassion of the numidyens buckelers of
lether: because of lyghter weight and burden. And also to shintent that they
should give less sound or noise / if it happened any stone to smite against
them. This done: the lumbard went up before them / and bound small cords to
the stones and to the old rotes which apered above the stones where he could
espy any such whereby the soudyours sustayning themself and taking hold might
more lightly and with more ease mount and clym upward. And sometime he went
before and helped them up with his hands specially such as for that uncustomed
way were somewhat fereful. Sometime when thascendyng or going up was over hard
and sharp: he put each of them up before him without armor: and than he
himself followed with their armor and wepyn. Such places where most dout was
in: he specially proved and assayd them most of al: and in going and coming
often times up and down by the same most dangerous passages: he increased
audacite and boldness to the remena^t. Thus after they had been sore weryed /
and with long and great labor endeavored themself: at last they came into the
castle / which on that side they found desolate and without defense. For (as
said is before) al they which were with in the castle were occupied in fightyng
/ or ready to fight against the romans: as they were on other days before. But
when Marius understood by messa^gers how the lumbard had done: how beit that all the day before his men had been sore besied and occupied in fightyng: and
assayling the castle. Nevertheless specially at this time he exhorted and
enbolded them: and he himself departing forth from under his pauases caused
his soudyors to adioyne themself nere together / and to hold up their sheldes
above their heedes / so that the co^ioyning of them seemed as it were the frame
of a volt. Marius kept him under the same for his defense / and so approached to
the walls. And both he and his company which were nere about him valiantly
assailed the castle: and also other of his company which stood a far of and
could not come nere the walls for prease: assailed the castle fiersly from a
far and sore vexed and put in fear their ennemies within the castle throwyng
against them plumettes of leed with slings / arowes / darts / and al other
manner engyns of battle wherewith any thing could strongely be thrown into the
castle. But the Numidyens within the castle had often before this time
ouertourned and brent the tents and pauases of the romans and took thereby so
great audacite and boldness that they defended not themself within the castle
walls: but walked up and down without the castle walls both day and night
reuilyng and reprouynge the romans and obiectyng cowardyse against Marius. And
thretnyng that his soudyours should be made subjects and bond men to Iugurth
in time to come / whom they purposed at that time to make bond to them. Thus
while they thought themself sure and their matter in good case: they were hard
and egar enough reuylinge and thretnynge the romans. In the mean space while
the romans and their ennemies were besyest fighting withal their might: the
romans for laud / glory / and lordshyp: and the Numidiens for their health
and saving of their lives. Anon suddenly the lumbard with his company which
were within the castle on the backsyde blewe their trumpettes. First of all the
women and children which went to the walls to se the bykering were al abashed
and fled inward to the castle: and after them all the soudyors which were
without and nerest to the walls and could escape in. And finally they all
both armed and unarmed fled inward. When the romans saw this they assailed
the castle more fiersly: some they slew and ouerthrue: some they wounded
ouerpassynge or standing upon the bodies of them which were slain. Al their
desire was with their hands to win glory and worship. They stryued to ascend
unto the walls every man couetyng to be before other. None of them al tarried
nor was let with spoylinges nor prays. Their great courage suffered them not to
look there after / till by manhood and strength they had won the castle. Thus
was fortune favorable to Marius: so that his first negligence and unwise
boldness to assail a castle inexpugnable / was turned by chance from rebuke
to glory and laud / such was his fortune. But when Marius had won this castle
after estimacion of man not able to be won: than was he lord of the most part
of all the treasour of Iugurth: the castle was given al to murdre and havoc.
And the soudyours of Marius richely rewarded every man after his desert.

How in the mean time while this castle was in winning / a noble man of Rome
named Lucius Sylla: came from Rome to Marius with a great bend of horsemen:
and of the manners and behauour of this Sylla. The.lv. Chapyter.
IN mean time while this fires assaute and victory was concluded at this
castle: a famous lord of Rome named Lucius Sylla / tresourer of the army came
from Rome to Marius with a great bend of horsemen. Whom the same Marius at his
departing from Rome had left there to raise and assemble socours unto the war
among the Italiens and other nations friends and lovers of thempire of Rome.
But forasmoch as the matter moves us to make mention of so worthy a man and of
his disposicion and manners: therefore it seems me convenient in this part
somewhat to write of his behauour and conversation: and that as brefely as I may
conveniently: namely for two causes. The first for that I intend not to make
relacion of his behauour and manners in any other place of this cronycle save
here. Secondly for asmoche as none other author has written sufficyently of
him. For how beit that one hystoriagraph named Lucius Sisenna: wrote most
dyligently and best of his acts of any other before nevertheless me seems that
he spoke little acordynge to truth nor indyfferently. For his tongue nor pen were
not at lyberte for asmoch as he was so^what in danger to ye said Sylla: whereby
he was prohibyted to say or to write / acordyng to ye truth. For what by
favor and what by fere he durst not touch plainly the vices which were in
him. But here I purpose (all favor and fere laid a part) indifferenly to write
of him. This Sylla of progeny: was descended of most noble stock of the
remai^s. Howbeit the name of his auncetry was almost lost and decayed by
dullness / negligence / and sloth of some of his lynage. In greek and in laten
he was of like connyng: and excellently seen in both the langages. His mind
was great / and bold of courage. Of voluptous pleasours he was desirous: but
much more desirous of glory and laud. In vacant leser he was much inclined to
ye lusts of his body. But such pleasure or voluptuousnes did never let nor
withholde him from any business or ocupacion necessary: howbeit such pleasure
so blinded him that he took no wise of birth / manners / and honesty convenient
for his estate. He was much eloquent of speech crafty and subtle enough. He
had the ways easily to get frendshyp / and it was also no maistry to get
fre^dshyp of him: in fayning / dissimulyng / and counterfaytinge of besynesses:
his wit was very hye and excellent. He was a marvelous and incredyble gyuer
of many things / but specially of money: and before the war and victory
which the noble men of Rome: had against the common people: He was so noble and
worthy reputed that it is in manner incredyble: nor his good fortune never
passed the policy of his wit: in somoche that many men were in dout whyther he
was more fortunate than strong. But after the victory of this war: so
ungoodly was his demeanor and so cruel / that verily I know not whyther I may
more be asshamed or grieved to write it or to speak thereof. For after that this
war of Numidy was ended: and both Marius and this Sylla were returned to
Rome: a great discord fell between the lords and co^mens. Marius took part
with the commons: but Sylla took part with the lords and at last drove Marius
forth of the city. After that: an other man of great power called Cynna
which had been five times co^sull of Rome gathered an host of men and took
part with Marius against this Sylla. But at conclusion Sylla overcame him in
battle: and slew him. After this: Sylla cruelly murdered an other noble man of
Rome named Caius ^arbo: and with him young Marius / sone of this Marius which
warred in Numidy. Last of al when this Sylla had won victory over Marius and
his favorers: than became he most cruel of al other: in somoch that he filled
all the city with blod of the citezins. But here will I leave to speak farther
of this Sylla / or of his behauour i^ cruelte: and return to write of his
behauour in this war of Numidy under Marius. After that this Sylla (as I have
said before) was come to Affrike and to the host of Marius with his company of
horsemen: within short season he became most expert in chiualry and crafty
above al other: howbeit before this time he was but rude and ignorant of deeds
of chiualry. And moreover he treted and governed his soudyours with manners and
mekenes. And gave rewards to many: to some which desired him: and to some
other of his own pleasure non desired thereto. But he would take no rewards
nor gifts again / without it were against his will. And if he so did at any
time against his will: than was he more ready to give again that which was given
to him: than to pay that money which he had borrowed of other. He demanded
nothing again of any man though it were due and det to him: but rather he
labored and endeavored himself that many might be in his det / and by such
means to have them bound to him. And how beit that he was one of the grettest
of Rome: yet disdayned he not the company of the most simple soudyours of the
host: but co^muned and acompanyed with them both in sportes and in sadness. In
labors he was always ready. In battle and in watchynges with other besynes of
war he suffered no man to be before him. Nor i^ the mean season he neither
hurt the good name of the co^sul nor of none other good man: which thing men
desirous of worship and honor be often wont to do for in dispraysing of other
they think to obtain great laud to themself. He only labored that none
might pass him neither in counsel nor in might / or manhod of his hands. But
he passed many. By which manners and conditions in short time he became very
dear and well beloved / not only to Marius: but also to all the host.

How Marius prevailed in battle against both the two kings / Iugurth and
Bocchus. The.lvi. chapyter.
But when Iugurth had lost the town of Capsa / as is said before: and diverse
other fortresses and other places defensyues which to him were profitable. And
also a great quantite of his treasour / wherein he most trusted: Anon he sent
messangers to king Bocchus requiryng him in all have to come to Numidy and to
bring his army with him: sayng that it was hye time to make battle with
Marius. But when he understood that Bocchus prolonged the time in ouerlong
taryeng / having diverse co^syderations of peace and war / as he that was in
dout of the chance and fortune of the end thereof. Iugurth again corrupted
the next of his counsel with gifts in lykewse as he had done before: and
promised unto the king Bocchus himself / the third part of the kingdom of
Numidy: if the romans were driven out of Affrike / or if the war should be
brought to end without loss or diminisshyng of his kingdom and marches
thereof. The king Bocchus induced with hope of this reward: with a great
multitude of people came to Iugurth / and adjoined both their armies together in
one. At this time Marius with his company was in his iournay toward the
province which was in the coost of Affrike and apartayned to thempire: where
the said Marius purposed to rest with his company / till the winter were past.
But when he was in his iournay and in leest dout: Iugurth and Bocchus both
together invaded and set upon him and his men when the tenth part of the day
scarsly remained. This did they: thynkinge that the night which was nere come
should to them be great socour and defense if they were overcome: and if they
did overcome the romans: it should be to them no damage nor impediment because
they knew the country and place better than the romans. But on the other side
both these chances: in darkness were hard and contrary to the romans: for
they knew not the coostes of that country. Marius anon had understanding of
the coming of his ennemies by many of his espyes: but it was ouerlate. For
as soon as he had word: his ennemies were even at hand. In somoch that before
the army could be set in order or array: and or they could remove or gather
together their baggage which at that time was abroad: and before they could take
any commandment of their captain by word or sound of trumpettes: The
horsemen of the Maurians and of the Getulians ran together upon them not in
order nor array of battle: but by companyes and bendes together / as it fortuned
them to come together in heaps and clusters. The romans for the most part:
were al amassed and grievously abashed for that sudden and unprovided fear.
Nevertheless they forgate not their old manhood and strength some drue them
to their armor: and other some which were armed already defended their fellows
till they armed themself. Other some mounted on horseback and boldly rode
against their ennemies: and encountered them valyantly. The fight on both
parties was more like a skirmysshe among brigandes and rouers than to any
appointed or ordered battle. For the horsemen and fotemen were mengled together
without standerdes / cognysances / or any ordinance / array / or order. The
Maurians and Numidyans were fierce on their side. Some of the romans they beat
down and ouerthrue. Some they wounded mortally: And many they bereft utterly
of their lives / and slew them in that place. The remenant which sharply and
manly resysted they compased them about on every side: and as well behind as
before assailed them: so that neither manhood / strength / nor armor: was able
sufficiently to defend them: And no marvel for their ennemies were mo in
nombre than they: and compased them about on every side of them. But finally
the romayne soudyours which were both of old and new: and therefore both
strong / bold / and crafty in battle: gathered them as nere together as they
might. And where it fortuned any nombre of them to mete together: they turned
back to back / and joined them round one with an other in manner of a compase
or cercle: and so they saved and defended themself together that on the
backehalfe no man could assail them: but if he brake in through the mids of
them which was in manner impossible. By this manner they sustained the might of
their ennemies: and also saved themself. Nor their captain Marius in this
ieopardous and sharp besynes was not affrayed at al / nor of less courage and
boldness than he was before: but styred about every where in the battle. And
his men of guard about him whom he had chosen rather of the strongest and
boldest men of the host / than of such as were most familier with him. For he
set more by the audacite of them / tha^ by the familiarite of the other: and
namely in such a ieopardous case. Sometime he socoured his soudyours in their
need / or such as he saw in paryl. And sometime he ran in among his ennemies:
where they were thyckest. And not withstandyng their resystence he assailed
them valiantly: and wounded / slew / and ouerthrue them on every side he dyed
his weapen in the reed blood of the black Mauriens and Getuliens. And because
that in so hard a case: and in so great and troublous noise and rumor / he
could not counsel nor confort his soudyours with his tongue / therefore he thought
to counsel / incorage / and confort them with his hand / gyuyng them example
surely to bestow their strokes. Many of his ennemies send he to hell cryeng in
vain upon their ydo^les for help. The darts / iauelyns pykes / plumettes of
leed / stones / with other such instruments of battle were cast so thick on
both parties / that the air therewith was indymed. The strokes were so coursly
charged on the bright helmes and harness / that the fire sprange out on every
side: so that it seemed to be the lyghtnyng: the cry of the men dyeng: the
neyeng of the horses: and the din of the strokes / with the sound of the
trumpettes: was horrible and tedyous to here. Thus continued they till the day
light was passed / and the night come. The numidyans / getulians / and maurians
desysted nor ceased nothing for that. But as both Iugurth and Bocchus before
had warned and commanded them: they continued more sharply than before /
thynking that the darkness of the night should be for their aua^tage. Marius
this understanding took counsel and made best provision for himself and his
men: which he might in such case: and as the matter required. And to the intent
that his people might have some place to resort unto / for refuge and socours:
he provided before and ocupyed two hills nere together of whom the one was
over narowe / and of little ground to receive his hole army and tents: but in
the top thereof was a fair fountain of pure water much necessary. The other
hyl was sufficiently large to receive his hole host and tents: and also very
defensive / for it was of a great altitude and done right on every side.
Insomoche that they which should take that hyl were sure enough without great
defense of themself / for nature had it sufficiently defended. This well
considred: Marius commanded Sylla his vndercapten to take with him all the
horsemen / and to tarry that night about the smaller hyl where the fountain was.
This done: he himself gathered together by little and little the remanent of his
soudyours dispersed abroad: their ennemies being not less troubled than were
they. When Marius had thus assembled again his men together he led them all
with full course up unto the larger hyl. Thus the two kings Iugurth and Bocchus
seeing it in vain to fight with the^ which were on the hyer ground / and also
on so sure a place: were constrained to leave the fight: for difficulty of the
place which the romans had taken. But nevertheless in the mean time they
suffered not their men to depart far thens: but compased both the hills round
about with their hole multitude and there tarried and rested / shed abroad upon
the ground. When they had taken their place in this manner: they made great
fires here and there in many places of their host: and the barbarians after
their custom passed forth the most part of the night in mirth / pleasure / and
gladness / rejoicing / daunsyng: and making great noise and din: rennyng and
going from place to place: and loudly crieng / synging and reuellyng. The
kings themself were also not a little proud and fearse: because they had not
fled from the battle: and counted themself as ouercomers seeing that they
held the romans so besieged which as they thought durst not abide them. On
the other part the romai^s inte^tyfly gave aduerte^s to the demeanor of their
ennemies. And for that the romans were on the hight of the hyl and without
light: therefore more easy from darkness of hyer places they parceyued all the
deeds and behauour of their ennemies which were beneth them: and much more
evidently by light of the fyers. This unwise behauour of the numidiens put the
romans in great confort and was great courage to them. And specially Marius
was greatly confermed in hope seeing their negligence / their folly / and
vncraftinesse: wherefore he commanded his folk to keep silence as still as
might be possible without any noise. In somoche that he suffered not the
tru^petes to sou^de the watch: as warryours ar wont against night. Afterward
when the day began to apere: the numidiens were al weryed with their cryeng /
ouerlate watchyng / and revel: and had given themself to rest a little before
as men without fear or dout of ye romans. But certainly it is a true proverb
which is often said: that after fair wether succedeth te^pestious clouds: and
aft mirth and joy often comes sadness and sorrow. So it hapened to the
numidye^s. For while they ingorged and filled with wynes lay slepyng on the
ground as beestes without fere and without provision: Marius commanded
suddenly all his trumpetes and clarionistes with other mynstrels to sound their
instruments as shyrle as they could altogyder and that al his soudyours should
set up a shout or cry as horribly as they might: and with that invade and break
into the tents of the numidyens. This was shortly done: wherefore the numidyens
/ mauriens / and getuliens astonyed and abashed with that unknown and
horrible noise: were suddenly awakened of sleep: and seeing them thus co^pased
with their ennemies: what for fear of death and of the noise they were so
amassed that they had no power neither to fle nor to draw to them their armor
/ nor utterly to do or prouid any manner socour for themself. Thus they stood
astonyed for this horrible noise and cry as if madnesshe had entered them: none
able to socour himself nor other. The romans always increased to them their
noise and fear assayling / murdring / and woundyng them without any
resystence. Finally al they were outher overthrown / slain / or wounded: or
else fled their armor / standerdes and weapen left behind them: and mo were in
this battle slain: than in all the batels before. For among them al none was
taken prisoner: for with fere and sleep so amassed were they / that few
escaped by flight.

Of the great prouysion and wisdom of Marius after his victory: and of the
second battle which he had against the two kings / in which also he had
great vyctory with laud and honor. The.lvii. Chapyter.
When Marius had gloriously thus over come the most part of his ennemies
except the two kings: he drue him than toward his wyntring places as he had
purposed before. And ordered himself and his men specially in haven towns
because of more easy provision of vytels: but nevertheless: in his iournay
thyderwarde: for all his victory: he becam not negligent / unware / nor proud:
as captayns often ar wont aft victory gotten of their ennemies: but he provided
and went forward with his army quadrat and divided into four parts ordered and
appointed as if his ennemies had been in his sight Sylla was assigned to take
charge of the right wyng of the army and all the spear men with him. And Aulus
Manlius of the lift wyng. And with him the slyngars / archers / and the
cohortes of Lumbardes. The peticapitayns with fotemen of light harness: were
distributed and dyuided in the vantgarde and rerewarde. Of the treatours which
had forsaken Iugurth and came to the romans: such as were best labored and
knew best the country / were chosen forth and sent out to espy the country and
ways of Iugurth and Bocchus. But not withstandyng Marius himself was as
provident / circu^spect / and diligent withal: as if he had committed the
charge to none other. He was mouyng continually from place to place over all
the army: laudyng / co^mendyng / and rewardyng the good soudyors: and blamyng
and rebukyng the bad he him self armed / and diligently prouidyng and
ministryng unto them every thing necessary and expedient: and compelled them
that were froward and ylwillyng to labor. In every place where he set his
tents in his iournay: he ordered defense with deep dyches and trenches round
about his host. And in the entres of the tents he assigned soudyors elect
thereto to keep watch and some to keep scoutwatch about the tents in compass.
Moreover some other he ordered on the casting of the dyches and on outward
bulwarks to defend the remanent if any sudden peril apered. He himself
armed nyghtly went about and serched the watch. Not specially for any fear nor
mystrust of any paryl to come nor for fear that his soudyours would not obey
his commandment. But specially to thentent that the loudyours seeing their
captain not refusyng labor nor paryl: should be also more wylling to follow
the same and to take pain upon themself as ashamed if they did not asmoch as
their captayn. And certainly at this time and at many other during this war
(as I read) Marius constrained his soudyors to labor rather for shame tha^ with
sharpnes or punissheme^t. For shame it is to the servant to be idle wha^ the
master sore laboreth. Howbeit some said that Marius took this labor upon him
for the desire of co^mendacion and worship: because that from his youth he was
ever wont with hardness / hunger / thirst / and labor: and many other things
which the delycate gentylmen of our time count for miseries. But to Marius
were these hardnesses much pleasure and delight for affection which he had
against the commen wayle / as equal persons supposed. But to what ever intent
Marius: treated his army in this wise: it was known that his deeds did asmoche
profet and worship to the commen wayle of Rome: as if he had more rigorously
and sharply treated his soudyours. For all things were ordered well and worthily
for the honor and profet of the commen wayle: as if he had more rigorously
treated his army.

But to return to my purpose: when Marius with such dyligence as said is:
was come not far from the town of Cirtha / at the last the fourth day after
the foresaid battle: the espyes of their ennemies appeared on every side. The
romai^s understood anon thereby that their ennemies were at hand. The espyes
of the romans also which were send forth: brought the same tidings from
every coost of the country. Marius perceived that his ennemies were in diverse
co^panyes and divided: wherefore he was uncertain how he might best order his
host to receive them: And therefore perceiving it unsure: how to order the
forfront of his battle as it ought: he abode his ennemies in the same place no
order changed with his host divided in.iiii. parts (as said is) as he which
was ready and provided for every chance. Thus was Iugurth disceyued and
frustrate of his purpose. For he had divided his host into four parts
trusting to invade some of the romans on the backehalfe with part of his
army: and with an other part to encounter with them / and with the other two
parts to enclose them on both the sides: and so to enuyron them round about.
In the mean time Sylla which first encountered with Iugurth exhorted and
comforted his men as well as he might for breuite of the time. That done: anon
he proceeded with his company by bendes and clustres together / their horses
conjoined in the most thyckest manner: and so fiersly assailed the Maurians.
The remanent of the fotemen which were under Sylla: remained and kept
themself still in their first place: and defended their bodies from the darts
which their ennemies thrue against them from far. But if it chaunsed any of
their ennemies to come between their hands: they hewed them down to decrease
the nombre. While Sylla and his horsemen thus fiersly were fightyng on the right
wyng of the battle: The king Bocchus assembled together the fotemen whom his
son named Volux / had brought thither with him. These fotemen had such
impediment in their iournay thyderwarde that they came ouerlate to the other
battle which was last foughten before this. Wherefore Bocchus: when he had
assembled and inbolded with his words these fresshe fotemen: with them he
assailed fiersly the rerewarde of the romans.

In the mean time Marius himself was occupied in the forward of his host and
there employed his wisdom and strength / as a valyant and worthy captain: and
so stood it him in hand. For in the forward Iugurth himself with his
grettest power and stro^gest company of men inbatayled with him. But after that
Iugurth knew of the coming of Bocchus to the field: anon he turned him with
a small company about him privily unto the fotemen of the romans: and there
with an hye voyse he cried unto them / sayng that they fought but in vain. For
a little before he had slain Marius with his own hands. And in cryeng these
words he lyfted up withal / and showed his sword al ouersprincled and dyed
with blood: which he had so colored in the battle fiersly enough in
murdring the fotemen of the romans. These words Iugurth cried in latin tongue.
For he had learned to speak latin long before in the battle of Numaunce. When
the romans herd these words they were affrayed / but more for cruelty of
the noise: than for any confidence or trust which they had to the messanger.
But on ye other side the minds of the barbariens were bolded and exalted by
these words: by reason whereof more sharply they invaded the romans / seeing
them abashed and astonyed. And now were the romans of the forward at that
point that they were ready to give themself to flight: as men dyscouraged for
the said tidings. When they were at this point: it fortuned so at the same
time that Sylla had beaten and overthrown the mauriens which invaded and
assailed him on the right wyng of the battle: wherefore he returned to his
company and fiersly assailed the fresshe fotemen which were with Bocchus / and
at one side brake in among the thyckest of them. But Bocchus anon turned his
back: and gave himself to flight.

On the othersyde Iugurth which in his part of the battle almost had optayned
vyctory did his diligence to encourage and support his company: and to mentayne
that aua^tage which he had won. And at conclusion al in vain. For while he
labored there about as a worthy captain: the spear men of the romans so
co^pased him and his company about both on ye right side and on the lift: that
al his guard and other which were about him at conclusion were slain. But he
himself glad to save his life / brake forth alone from among ye mids of his
ennemies: and from wepyns and darts with great difficuly. But in the mean
time Marius had overcome and driven away the horsemen which assailed him.
Wherefore anon he returned fiersly to help and socours of his company whom he
understood somewhat put back by violence of their ennemies. But he by his
policy and valiant deeds anon so reconforted his men that none of his ennemies
were able to withstand their violence in any part of that battle.

Thus finally the romans after great labor and many grievous wounds
disconfited their ennemies on every side. But when the battle was ended and
the romans began to pursue the chase: than verily it was a pytefull and
horrible sight to behold in the open feldes and to consider the cruel
spectacle of battle. How some fled: Some pursued / some enraged murdring /
some rored dyeng / some slain / some taken prisoners. The horse and men
mengled together: laboring in the panges of death. The ground ouerspred with
deed corpses mangled / mutulate / and horribly hewyn: inuolued in blood
co^geled. The horse wounded: as mad drew after them the deed carcases of their
masters / their legs hangyng in the styropes / and their spears half
through their bodies trayling after in the dust. The coursers wounded and
fleyng cast up with their fete the dust tempered with blood rennyng over the
deed bodies of their lords. Many of the Numidie^s which were sore wounded
could neither fle: nor be suffered to take rest on the ground. Sometime they
labored to rise and avoid: and anon after for feebleness fell down to the
ground again: each rowlyng and turnyng in other blood. And finally: as far as
any man's sight might extend / all the ground was ouerspred and covered with
armor / wepen / and deed caryons rennyng of blood. And all the ground infect
with the same / horrible to behold.

How Bocchus after that he was thus twyse ouercom in batel / purposed to make
peace with the romans: and how at his request Marius send unto him Sylla and
Manlius to know his mind in that behalf. The.lviii. Chapter.
AFter that this batel was thus ended to the utter damage and destruction of
the Numidyans: and to the laud and honor of the romans. Marius was now
without dout ouercomer and victour and went unto the town of Cirtha as his
iournay and purpose was at first beginning before these two batayls. When
Marius had soiourned there five days aft this battle: there came unto him
ambassadors from king Bocchus. Which in their kings behalf desired of Marius
to send unto him two of the most trusty men which he had: sayng that he would
common and treat with them of diverse besynesses both for his own profet / and
for profet and aua^tage of the romans also. Marius without tarry send forth
Sylla for one: and Aulus Manlius for an other. When they were come to king
Bocchus: howbeit he had send for them to common with them in his matters.
Nevertheless it was concluded between them to speak to him first to thentent to
kyndell and inflame his mind the more against Iugurth: or else seeing him
somewhat desirous and wyllyng to have peace to provoke him with more desire
thereto. Wherefore Sylla (to whom Manlius gave place not for his age / bur for
his eloquence) began and spoke to Bocchus in manner: as follows.

Of the words of Sylla tresourer of the romayne army had before king Bocchus.
The.lix. cha.
KIng Bocchus we have great gladness and joy sith it is so that the gods have
thus admonisshed and enspired you so noble a man that at last ye have reputed
peace better and more acceptable than war: lest ye might dishonest and defyle
your worthynesse by associating yourselfe to the most unhappy tyran Iugurth.
And also we are glad that ye have avoided the occasion and necessite: whereby we
were moved to pursue in battle: you being ignorant of our quarrel: and in the
company of ye said most cursed Iugurth tyran and ennemy to thempyre of Rome.
And certainly ye people of Rome ever sith their poor / simple / and small
beginning have thought it better to win fre^des than servants or bondmen and
also they have thought it a much surer thing to have under their empire such
as wyllingly and of their own mocion would yield themself: than such as they
have constrained thereto against their will. But verily no frendshyp is more
necessary to you than our amyte or frendshyp. At first of al: because we and ye
be far in sonder: whereby we shall have les power to grieve you / or to put you
to any charge: by reason of our frendshyp. But our favor and thanks may be as
ready to you: as if we were nere together: co^sydering the many and great friends
which we have not far from your marches. And also unto thempire of Rome be
obeyers / subgettes and servants abundantly. But as touching lovers and
friends we nor none other can have sufficiently enough. For this consideracion
king Bocchus your fre^dshyp shall be more acceptable unto us. And would god it
had pleased you thus to have done at the beginning of this war. Forsooth if ye
had so done: than should ye before this time have received of the romans mo
co^modites / auantages / and good deeds than ye have now suffered loss /
damages / or hurtes. But while it is so that man's deeds and besynesses (for
the most part) be ruled by fortune: to which fortune it has pleased that ye
should both prove and assay our might and violence in battle: and also our love
and favor in peace: Therefore now syht amytie is proferred to you by
suffraunce of fortune: and sith it is lauful to you to take it: be not slow
from hens forward / but hastily proceed as ye have begone: that ye may prove
the romans friends to you like as ye have proved them ennemies before this
time. Ye have many expedient oportunites and necessary co^modites by whom ye
may make amends with your good deeds for that ye have offended against the
romans and ouerpasse your old fautes with new kyndnesses and benefits: and
finally fix this in your heart that ye or any other shall never overcome the
people of Rome with kyndnes or good deeds. And as touching their hatered / and
of what might they are in battle: yet yourselfe know that by proof and
experience. Wherefore proceed in acquiring of their frendshyp: which gladly
shall be granted unto you / if your merits shall so deserve.

Of the answer of Bocchus made to Sylla: and of the unstableness of mind of
the same Bocchus. The.lx. chapyter.
TO these words of Sylla answered Bocchus myldely and soberly: and a few
words he spoke in excusing his offense done again the romans / saying that
he had not taken armor nor begone war against them as ennemy to do injury or
wrong unto them: but to defend his own kingdom. And that the third part of
Numidy belonged unto him by law of arms: of the which the romans labored to
expel Iugurth. And in that doing they distroyed his part of the country: which
he could not suffer unrevenged. Moreover Bocchus said for himself that he had
send unto Rome before to require amyte and frendshyp of the romans: which
thing unto him was denied. But at conclusion he said: that he would omyt and
lay a part al old malice and that althyng should be done and agreed between
them: if Marius would grant him that his ambassadors might be send to Rome:
for the said friendship to be co^federate with ye romans. Upon this answer
Sylla and his felawe returned to Marius which anon agreed yt the same
ambassadors should be sent to Rome. But shortly after: what time Iugurth
understood of the coming of Sylla and Manlius he feared the same thing /
which was ordend and in hand. And anon with rewards so he corrupted the
friends of Bocchus: that again they changed his mind with their counsel: so
mutable and variable was he of mind.

How Bocchus chan^ged his purpose yet ones again: and send new ambassadors
to Marius to treat of the peace: and how Sylla received and treated them in
absence of Marius. The.lxi. chapyter.
IN the mean time Marius set and ordered his host in their wyntring places and
took with him such men as were of light harness: and also a part of his
horsemen: and with them went into a desert not far thens / to besige a certain
tower belongyng to Iugurth: into which tower the said Iugurth had put for
garnyson and defense: all the treators which had forsaken and fled from the
romans to Iugurth. But in the mean while Bocchus of new again co^sydred in
mind the misfortune which had hapened to him i^ the two batayls before. Or
else by counsel of some other of his friends: whom Iugurth had not corrupted
with rewards: he chose forth among al.v. men whose fidelite and truth he had
well known and often proved before: and whose wisdom was most expert and ready.
Them send he to Marius: and commanded them afterward if the matter required
as ambassadors to take their way to Rome: and committed to them his full
authorite in every thing which was to be done: and to conclude the war by what
ever manner should seem best / and most expedient to their discrecion. These
ambassadors took le^e and spedely took their iournay to the places where the
romans soiourned the winter season. But while they were i^ their iournay
thyderwarde: they were assailed of thieves of the getulians / and robbed and
spoiled of all that they had about them. Thus at last without worship or
apparel: all affrayed and abashed they fled unto Sylla for refuge. This Sylla
was left by Marius in the wynteryng places: to be ruler of the romayne army in
his absence. What time these ambassadors: thus spoiled were come to Sylla for
refuge / he received them not fayntly as vain and unstable ennemies as they
deserved: but curteysly with much gentylnes and liberalite / treating them in all points honorably. By this means these barbaria^s and rude people counted
and supposed that the name of couetyse / which was imputed unto the romans by
common fame was but false and feigned of their ennemies / to distayne their
honor. And also for the much liberalite of Sylla: they counted him as their
special friend. For yet unto that time: the accloyeng of gifts given for
rewards for policy and falshode to ouerco^e covetous or simple minds / was
unknown unto many. No man was liberal i^ gifts: but that he was thought and
counted to be faithful of heart withal. Thus the barbarians reputed the liberte
and rewards of Sylla to be a great and evident token of love which he had to
them: as they demed. But to our purpose: the ambassadors anon opened and
declared to Sylla the will and commandment of Bocchus their king: given to
them to be excuted: And also they required him to be unto them a friendly
favorer and counselor in their business. Farthermore with their words and
spech they commended and exalted the army / the truth / the greatness and
excellence of their king: and al other things which they thought might avail
them to obtain benyuole^ce of the romans. After they remained with Sylla
about the space of xl. days: which granted them al his help and socour and
also in the mean space enfourmed them in what manner they should order their
words when they should speak with Marius / and also before the senators at
Rome.

How Marius hard them bassadours of Bocchus and send them to Rome: and how
they were answered of the senators. The.lxii. chapyter.
IN the mean time Marius which was in assaut of the kings tower could not
perform his enterprise. Wherefore he returned again to Cirtha: anon was he
certified of coming of the imbassadours of Bocchus. Wherefore he commanded
them and Sylla also to come before him: and also he called together all the
most worthy men of his hole host from every place. Before them al presently
he commanded the imbassadours of Bocchus to rehearse the petycion of their king
(which rehearsed and hard) it was granted unto them to go Rome for the same
points. And of Marius was truesse required in the mean time between Bocchus
and him. Sylla with many other noble me^ were pleased withal. A few other
fiersly and sharply cou^selled otherwise: as men without pity and ignorant of
others hard fortune which when it begins to be froward and contrary: it
tourneth every thing to aduersyte.

But when ye mauriens had obtained of Marius al their desire: three of them went
to Rome with one named Octauyus Rufo: whom Marius had assigned to convey the^
thither This Octauyus Rufo was send before from Rome into Affrike to Marius
with wages for the soudyours. The other two imbassadors of Bocchus returned
home again to their king: which of them gladly hard of the good report
which they made of the Romans in every point: and specially of the good will /
lyberalite / and courtesy of Sylla. But when the other three imbassadours were
come to Ro^e they apered before the senators and in the humblest wise yt they
could devise / did their message excusing their king: and confessyng that he
had offended against the empire not by his own sekyng: but by the cursed faut
prouocacion / and instygation of Iugurth: whereof their king sore repented.
Wherefore in his behalf at conclusyon they besought the romans of pardon /
amyte / and peace. Than was it brefely answered to them in this manner.

The senators and people of Rome: is wont to remember both the kyndnesse and
benifytes of their fre^des: and also the iniuryes of their ennemies. But sith
it repe^teth and forthynketh Bocchus of his trespass: grace and pardon of his
offense is granted unto him. Peace and amyte shall be also granted unto him
hereafter / when he shall so deserve.

How Marius sent Sylla again to Bocchus at his desire: and what danger the
same Sylla escaped by help of Volux / son of king Bocchus. The.lxiii. chapyter.
When Bocchus understood al these things: he desired Marius by his letters to
send unto him Sylla: to thentent yt after his advise and discression counsel
might be had of the common business to both parties belo^gyng. Sylla anon
was send forth with a great retynue of fotemen and horsemen: with diverse weapen
and strong defense as archars / slyngars / with otherlike. And to thynte^t to
speed their iournay more hastily: they were al armed with lightest harnes which
could be provided but for all the lightness of their armor it was defe^site
enough against the weapyns of the mauryans: for their wepyns be light in
likewise. But finally when Sylla had passed five days of his iournay: suddenly
Volux the son of Bocchus apered and showed himself to the romans in the open
feldes: with no mo but. M. men which went scatered and dyspersed abroad
neglyge^tly: so that they seemed to Sylla: and al other a greatter nombre than
they were in deed. Sylla and al his company feared them / thinking them
ennemies: wherefore the romans made them ready with armor and weapen: to
defend themself / and to resyst their ennemies: if need should so require. A
little fear was among them: but their hope and confort ouerpassed their fear.
For why? they had the upper hand before: and consydred that they should bycker
with them whom they had often overthrown and overcome before. In the mean
time the horsemen which were sent before of both parties to espy ye truth of
the matter / certified each of them that al thing was quiet and sure enough: as
it was in deed: without treason or paryl. Volux in his metyng called Sylla by
name: and welcomed him benyngely / saying that he was sent from his father
Bocchus to mete the said Sylla for his honor / socour / and defense. And so
proceeded they forthewarde all this day and the next day after in company together
without fear or danger. But after that it was night and their tents pytched:
suddenly the maurian Volux came rennyng to Sylla al pale and quakyng: and said
that he was infourmed of the espyes / that Iugurth was not far thens. And with
that prayed and exhorted him to fle away with him privily by night. Sylla denied
that utterly as fierce and bold of courage / saying that he feared not a
cowarde numidyan: which so often had been overcome before. And that he trusted
well enough to the strength and courage of his men: and finally he gave Volux
this answer. If I knew without dout that our sure destruction were instant:
and that I and mine should be slain in the field / yet would I not fle for any
dread: but rather abide and dye manfully: than cowardely to flee and shame my
people of whom I have charge in sparyng our lives / which be so incertayne
and unsure: and parauenture shortly after this shall fynisshe with some sickness
or disease. Is it not better to dye in a noble quarrel manly / tha^ to live i^
shame cowardly? When Sylla had thus answered: than Volux cou^selled him to
depart from that place and to remove forward by night. Thereto Sylla consented:
and anon commanded his soudyours to refresshe them in their tents with such
vitels as they had / and to make plenty of fires over all the place to the
intent that if their ennemies were nere: in beholding the fires they should
think that they would not remove thens that night. But in the first hour of
the night Sylla commanded al his soudyors to leave their fires brennynge and
so to depart forward in their iournay with scilence: so they did. And went all the night long: and even with the son rysinge they al being weryed: Sylla
pytched his tents again. With that certain horsemen of the mauriens brought
word that Iugurth had taken place to his tents: and rested about the distance
of two mile before them. When these tidings were hard among the romans: a
marvelous and great fear entered the minds of them al. For they thought
themself betrayed of Volux. And so enuyrounde with falshode and treason. Many
aduysed to take punissheme^t of Volux: saying that it was a thing unworthy to
suffer him to escape unpunished for so great a myschefe and treason against
them committed. But howbeit that Sylla was inwardly of the same opynion:
nevertheless he defended the maurian from damage. And exhorted his men to be of
strong and bold minds: saying that often before that time it had been seen
that a few worthy men had won victory of a much multitude of cowardes. And
how much the less that they spared their bodies in battle fro fightyng:
somoch the surer should they be: and that it seemed no man to whom god and
nature had given hands to defend his body: to sick defense in his fete
unarmed by rennyng away. And that in such a ieopardy / a noble soudyour ought
not to turn away his body from his ennemy / though he were naked and unarmed.
When Sylla had exhorted his men with such words: he called unto him Volux:
and called in to witness Iupyter and al his ydols to record the falshode and
treason of Bocchus / father of Volux: which had so betrayed him. Than for
asmoch as Sylla supposed that Volux had brought him by treason into hands of
Iugurth by counsel and commandment of his father Bocchus he commanded Volux
anon to depart from his company sight / Volux pytuously weeping: besought Sylla
not to believe such things in him: and said that certainly by gyle nor by
treason was nothing done of him nor of his father: but rather by Iugurth which
by his subtilte had espied and serched their iournay and ways by his espies
and so known the same. But at conclusion said Volux: sith it is so that
Iugurth has no great company and that his hope / his trust and confort for ye
most part depends on my father: I think that he shall not be so bold to do
any damage to you openly while I am in your company: which may record his
deeds to my father. Wherefore Sylla to thentent that ye may parceyue that no
treason is in me: I shall openly go with you alone by ye mids of the tents of
Iugurth and so sauely convey you: and other se^de my folk before: or else leave
the^ hexe with your company whyther of both shall please you best. This counsel
was allowed of Sylla: and anon without tarry he proceeded forward with all his
company through mids of the tents of Iugurth. And because this was suddenly
done: Iugurth not knowing thereof before / he meruayled much thereat: and douted
long what was to be done. But at last he suffered the romans to pass and to
escape saufe and sou^de for love of Volux / and dread of Bocchus his father.
And within a few days after: Volux and Sylla with their company came to
Bocchus: whether they intended.

Of the metyng and secret apoyntmentes between Bocchus and Sylla: and how
between them both they abused Asper / the imbassadour of Iugurth. The.lxiiii.
chapyter.
AT the same season was with Bocchus a certain numidyan named Asper / send
before Bocchus from Iugurth / by craft and subtylte: to espy his counsel /
as soon as it was hard that Bocchus had send for Sylla. This numidyan was much
and familierly co^uersa^t with Bocchus at that time. Moreover there was an
other named Dabar the son of Massagrade: which of his fathers side was of the
stock of Massinissa. But of his mothers side unlike of birth: for his mother
was borne of a co^cubine. This Dabar (as I have said) was at this season also
in the company of Bocchus: and to him dear and well-beloved for subtel wit and
great acts which he had done before: and namely because that Bocchus had
found and proved him trusty and faithful many times before. Anon Bocchus
send this Dabar to Sylla commaundyng Dabar to show him yt he was ready to do
every thing which ye romans to him would command or assign. And that Sylla
himself should apoynt / and chose a time and place where they might common
together of their matters: and that he should not fere nor dout though the
embassadoure of Iugurth were there with him. For he had reserved all things
touching their counsel hole till coming of Sylla: and of nothing had appointed
/ co^muned / nor concluded with the same imbassadour of Iugurth. Which
imbassadour was called thither to thyntent that their common besynesses might be
done more at liberty and with less suspection of Iugurth: for by other means
they could not resyst nor make provision against his gyles. Such words send
Bocchus to Sylla: by his trusty servant Dabar. But natwtstandynge al these
fair promises of Bocchus it was understand yt he prolonged the romans and
the numidyans in hope of peace / rather for falshode and treason after the
crede^ce of affrycans: than for profet to the romans or troth of such things
as he promised to Sylla. And often times he cast in his mind and douted
whether he might betray Iugurth to ye romans: or else Sylla to Iugurth: the
pleasure and desire of his mind advised / moved / and cou^selled him against
the romans: but the dread which he had of punisshment in time to come: moved
him with ye romans. But to our purpose: Sylla answered to Dabar the messanger
of Bocchus that the would come thither / and first speak a little of the peace
and of such other things in presence of Asper the imbassadour of Iugurth: but
concerning the remenant of the business: he would dyffer that to common
secretly with Bocchus / few or none called to counsel. And also he taught Dabar
what words Bocchus should answer unto him again / when they should come to
co^municacion: and so departed Dabar. But when Sylla saw his time he went to
Bocchus / and said that he was sent from Marius the consul to enquire if he
would lever peace or war: and whereon he would conclude. Than Bocchus (as Dabar
had warned him before) commanded Sylla to return again afterd.x. days: and
tha^ should an answer be given unto him. For at that time nothing was
concluded. That answer well noted and hard Asper the ambassador of Iugurth ^
which was sent to espy the intreatement: and so thought he that nothing should
be treated nor concluded without his knowledge. And thus after this answer
Bocchus and Sylla departed: each to their tents.

Of the second coming together of Bocchus and of Sylla: and of the words of
Bocchus had to Sylla: and replycation and answer of Sylla again to him. And
how Bocchus granted and concluded to betray Iugurth to the romans. The.lxv.
chapyter.
But after that much of the night was ouerpassed: Bocchus privily send for
Sylla none being in their company / save such as on both parties might truly
interprit and declare the sentence and understanding of their words. And also
Dabar the said messanger / was present which solemly swore and promised to be
faithful interpretour of both their sayenges / and sentences. Than Bocchus
anon began his words in this sentence.

I have thought forsooth: that it should never have fortuned that I the
greattest king of al them in these lands: and rychest of al them that I
know: should have been bound a mean and private person. And forsooth Sylla or
ever I hard of you: I have given help and socours to many other men. To some
of mine own voluntary and frewyl. And to some other: required of them: my
self not nedyng help of any man. But now sith I have known you: I have need
of your help and frendshyp of which I am glad: not withstandyng other men ar
wont to be sorry of such fortune. And certainly this need which I have of your
frenshyp is not of me counted damage nor loss: but much profet and pleasure.
For inwardly in my mind nothing is derer / nor more acceptable: which ye may
conveniently prove if it please you: demand and take of me armor / men /
treasour: and finally what ever it pleases you in your mind: and use and
occupy the same as your own. And think ye for certain that while ye live and
I together: I can never render worthy thanks unto your kyndnes: nor condignely
recompense your great humanite: but ever my good will and mind shall be hole and
new against you. And certainly if I may know your mind and will: ye shall
naught need to desire of me: I shall prevent your requests with my benefytes:
so that ye shall coueyt nothing in vain. Verily as I think it is less
reprouable and less dishonor a king to be ouerco^e with armor: than with
liberalite. Wherefore I have concluded in mind that a man shall rather overcome
me in battle with weapen and force of arms: than with liberalite.

But touching your commen wayle (for whose besynes ye be send hither as
procuratour of the same) this is my sentence and mind in few words. Against
the romans / nor against their empire: I never moved nor made war: nor to make
battle against them: it was never i^ my mind by my will. But the boundys of my
marchesse have I endeavored me to defend against the violence of your armed
men. But this I leave and set a side: sith I se that it pleases you to do the
same: execute and continue ye battle with Iugurth as ye will. And as touching
me: I shall not ouerpasse the water of Mulucha / which was bounds between my
marches and Micipsa while he lived. Nor into my country I shall not suffer
Iugurth from hens forth: to enter for socours / as he has done in times
passed. Farthermore if ye desire any thing of me conveniently: which I may
worthily grant / my royalte not distayned: it shall not be denied unto you.
Thus concluded Bocchus his words.

Unto these words Sylla answered for his own part but moderately and with
few words. But touching the peace and business concerning the commen wayle:
he spoke many words / whereof the conclusion was such.

King Bocchus I insure and promise you: that the romans shall not be unkind
to you if ye do some pleasure to them: which may rather long to the^ al holly
in comen: than in me alone. And think ye for certain: that they which have
overcome you in battle: shall likewise overcome you with liberalite / kyndnesse /
and good deeds: if ye so contend with the^: which thing is now ready in your
power to do: consydering that I have Iugurth ready at your will and pleasure.
Therefore among al benefits or pleasurs: ye can do none more acceptable unto
the romans: than to deliver unto them Iugurth. By this means shall they be
much beholden to you: and think ye steadfastly: it shall not be unrewarded on
our behalf. For than shall the Senate grant unto you amyte and peace: and also
a part of numidy which ye do now claim: shul than be granted unto you
unrequired.

Bocchus heryng these words of Sylla: first excused him self by the affinyte
which was between him and Iugurth: and by the long familyarite and
aquayntance which they had together: saying also that a bond of peace was
confyderate and sworn between them. And also that he fered and suspected that
if he so did: his own subgettes should hate him therefore which much loved
Iugurth: and greatly hated the romans. But not withstandyng these words of
Bocchus: Sylla desysted not to attyse and counsel him: till at last he agreed
and consented to his desire / promysing to do every thing as Syl^a required
him. But to thyntent to feign a treaty of peace (of which Iugurth weryed in
war was much desirous) they ordained such craft: as to their purpose seemed
most expedyent. But when they had ymagined and devised al things after their
minds: than both they departed in sonder: and returned again to their rest.

How Bocchus betrayed Iugurth and delivered him bound to Sylla. The.lxvi.
chap.
ON the morrow after Bocchus called to him Asper the imbassadour of Iugurth /
and said to him that he understood of Sylly by the interpretacion of Dabar that
the war might be ^inysshed upon certain co^dicions. Wherefore he bad him go and
inquire the mind and pleasure of his king in yt behalf. Asper of these
tidings was glad and took h^s leave of Bocchus: and departed to the tents of
Iugurth: and certyfied him of the same. Iugurth showed to Asper: al his mind
and pleasure concerning the premises. And within.viii. days aft send him
again to Bocchus. When Asper was returned again to Bocchus: he showed to him
ye will of Iugurth / saying that he coueted to do althyng which should be
commanded to him of Bocchus: but he had but small co^fyde^ce in Marius. For
asmoche as the peace which often before had been conue^ted and appointed of the
romayne captayns had anon after ben frustrate: and broken of the^ again. But
if ye will (said Asper to Bocchus) that peace shall be confermed of the romans
with Iugurth and you also: Iugurth desires and requires you to labor so: that
Sylla / Iugurth / and ye: may come together to co^munycation: as if it were to
treat of peace and that ye will there betraye and deliver Sylla to him. For if
ye may ones bring such a man into power and hands of Iugurth: anon after it
shall fortune without dowte that peace shall be made and granted to him by
common assent of the senators: and co^mens of Rome also. And that: to thynte^t
to recover Sylla again out of the hands of Iugurth. For without dout ye
romans will not suffer so noble a man to be left in hands and danger of their
ennemies. And namely: when they shall understand him taken / not by his own
folly nor cowardyse: but in business belonging to the commen wayle.

Bocchus heryng these words: reuolued and cast long in min / de what he might
answer to the^: but at last he granted thereto But whether he douted so long
before he granted for subtylte or very troth / it is hard to discern. But
this is plainly known yt for the most part in likewise as the wylles and
minds of kings be vehement / immoderat / and hasty: right so be they mouyng /
unsteadfast / and variable: and often aduers and contrary to their own self:
and with themself repugnant. But to our matter: Bocchus assigned to Asper a
place and time: where Sylla and they should common together of the peace. And in
the mean while sometime he co^muned secretly with Sylla: sometime with Asper
ambassador of Iugurth / treatyng them both mekely and courtesly: and promisyng
one self thing unto them both. Wherefore they both were glad: and also each of
them both had good hope in the promysses of Bocchus.

But the nygh before that day: which was assigned to intreatme^t of the peace:
Bocchus called unto him diverse of his friends / as if he would have taken
counsel of them: and than immediately he changed that mind / co^maundyng them
again to avoid from him. And so (none of his counsel about him) he stood al
alone reuoluyng and tourning i^ mind many things by himself / chau^gyng
oftentimes in contenau^ce / and color variable and diverse: aperyng forthward
by tokens of fear conceived in his mind and expressed by outward tokens of
his body. In so much: that al if he expressed not his mind by words:
nevertheless this often changing of cou^tena^ce / declared the secrets of his
heart. But at conclusion: after long co^fly^^ had within himself: at last he
commanded Sylla to be called unto him. And than aft his advise and counsel he
devised and prepared althynges concerning the prodicion of Iugurth.

After this counsel concluded: as soon as the day light apered* tidings were
brought to Bocchus / that Iugurth was not far thens: and coming toward him.
Bocchus this herynge: anon prepared himself and proceeded forth against him
accompanied with a few of his friends / and also with Sylla: fayninge that he
went so forth to mete with Iugurth and to receive him / because of honor. And
thus they proceeded forward: till at last they came to an opyn heyth / where
they might easily se the coming of Iugurth: which place was appointed before
to their treason. For in diverse valeys of the same heyth: were armed men
lyenge in wayt ready and appointed before by Bocchus: for to assail Iugurth and
his company / when signs should be given to them: to issue forth of their
lurkyng places. Anon Iugurth with many of his men about him came to ye same
place al unarmed: as apoyntement was made before. For it was ordained that
Bocchus / Iugurth / and Sylla: should come together to co^municacion: each one
with a small company / and al unarmed.

Anon as Iugurth was come thither: king Bocchus gave a token to his men / which
lay in wayt for Iugurth. Anon as they hard the token: suddenly they bracke
forth and invaded Iugurth and his company: compasynge them about on every side.
Without great labor: all the company of Iugurth were murdered: and he himself
taken and bound hand and foot / and so delyuerd unto Sylla: which without
tarry led him forth and delyuerd him unto Marius: whose heart was replenysshed
and environed / with joy inestimable.

How Marius was received into Rome with triumph: and how Iugurth was cast
into prison: where he continued in miserable captivity till he dyed. The.lxvii.
cha.
AFter that Iugurth thus bound was delivered by Bocchus unto Sylla: and than
to Marius. Anon all the numidyans / submytted and yielded themself to the
romans. Marius with great wisdom set an order among the people / and
garnysshed and fortified the towns: and than with the remanent of his army
took his iournay again to Rome: leadyng Iugurth and his two sons bound with
him: with innumerable other prisoners / great treasour / olyphantes / and
armoure: which he had won in the war of Iugurth. But after that tidings were
brought to Rome: how the war was ended in Numidy: and how Iugurth was led
thyderwarde bound and prisoner. Anon the Senate and commens assembled to
counsel: and Marius was create consul again for the next year: in his absence.
And by decre and ordinance: the province of France was committed unto him to
be recovered.

For the same time while Marius warred in Numidy: and took Iugurth prisoner.
That country of France (whose people that time were named Cymbrians) rebelled
against the empire of Rome. Against whom the romans send forth to repress
their rebellion: a great army with two capitayns: the one named Quintus Scipio
/ the other Marcus Manlyus: which at last with froward fortune had a great
and grievous battle with the same frenchmen Cymbrians. In which both these
romayne capitayns were ouercome^ and twyse lost the field. Of the romans men
of war: were slain.lxxx. thousand: of tylmen / and pages.xl. thousand. Thus
was this battle foughten with so ill fortune unto the romans: that the cite of
Rome / and all the country of Italy trembled for fear thereof. In somoche that
both the romans which lived at that time: and al their progeny which succeeded
them: counted al other nations ready to their obesance: and to win honor by
them: but they thought never to contend in battle with this nation of
frenchmen: to win glory or honor by them: but rather to defend themself
and their liberty: which thing if they might do / they counted themself
fortunate. Wherefore (as I have before recounted) the Senate: and commens of
Rome / decreed this province of France to Marius for to revenge the death of
their men: and to recover the country.

But (to our purpose) when Marius should intre into Rome he was joyfully
received with great glory and triumph: whereof the order was such. Marius
himself was set on hye in a golden chair: which was drawn of four white
palfrayes. Iugurth and his two sons / with many other noble men: whom he
brought captyue from Numidy / proceeded before his chariot: their hands and
arms bound as prisoners. Fathermore for more ample ostentacion of his glory
/ and to declare how much he had inryched the common wayle of Rome: all the
elyphantes / armor / jewels / treasur / and richesse which he had won in
Numidy of Iugurth: were led and borne before him. Than all the senators: all the
officers and noble men of Rome / with an innumerable mult^tude of commens
received him with all honor and joy: and conuayed him unto the prin^ipal
palayes of Rome / named the Capytol: where he made sacrifice with a bull unto
Jupiter: for his victory: after the custom of that time. His sacrifice ended:
than was he conuayed into the Senate house / in his robe triumphal: as never
co^sul was brought before his time. Marius was received at Rome with such
triumph at the kalendes of January. From thensforth all the hop^ of confort /
health / socors / and wealth of the cite of Rome resisted in Marius. Iugurth was
casten into prison: where he ended his wretched life in miserable captiuyte /
and manyfolde calamitees / as to such a murderer unnatural: and t^ran inhumayne
was conuenyent.

FINIS.
Thus ends the famous cronycle of the war which the romans had against
Iugurth usurper of the kingdom of Numidy: which cronycle is co^pyled in laten
by the renowned romayn Salust. And translated into english by sir Alexander
Barclay priest: at commandment of the right hye and mighty prince / Thomas
duke of Northfolke. And imprented at London by Richard Pynson printer unto the
kings noble grace: with priuylege unto him granted by our said sovereign
lord the king.

Pe^inde quasi pretura et co^sulatus atque oi^a alia huiusmodi: per se ipsa

Verum ego liberius al^iusque processi du^ me ciuitatis piget, tedetque. Nunc
ad inceptum opus redeo.

BEllum scripturus sum: quod populus Romanus cu^ Iugurtha rege Numida^um gessit.

Primum quod magnu^ et a^rox variaque victo^^a (...).

Deinde: quia superbiae nobilitatis tum primu^ obu^atum est.

Q^^ia contentio diuina cuncta et humana permiscuit, eoque vecordiae processit,
vt studijs ciuilibus, bellum, atque vastitas Italiae, finem faceret.

Sed priusquam huiuscemo di initium expediam, pauca supra repetam, quo ad
cognoscendum oi^a illustria magis magisque in aperto sint.

Bello punico Secu^do, quo dux Carthagine^sium Ha^nibal post magnitudine^
nominis Romani Italiae opes maxim attriuerat.

Massinissa rex Numidaru^ in amicitiam receptus a Publio Scipione (cui postea
Affricano cognome^ ex virtute fuit) multa, et pre^la ra rei militaris facino ra
fecerat: ob quae victis Carthaginensibus et capto Sciphace (cuius i^ Africa
magnu^ atque latum imperiu^ valuit) populus Romanus quascunque vrbes et agros
man^ ceperat regi dono dedit. Igitur amicitia Massinissae bona atque honesta
nobis perma^sit. Sed imperij vitaeque eius finis ide^ fu^t.

Deinde Micipsa filius regnum solus obtinuit Manastabale et Galussa fratribus
morbo absumptis. Is Adherbalem et Hiempsalem ex se genuit: Iugurtha^que filiu^
Manastabalis que^ Massinissa (quod ortus ex co^cubina erat) priuatu^
reliquerat: eo them cultu quo liberos suos domi habuit. Qui vbi primu^ adoleuit
polle^s viribus, decora facie, sed multo maximo ingenio validus: non se luxui,
neque inertiae corru^pendum dedit, sed vti mos illius est ge^tis: equitare,
iaculari, cursu cum aequalibus certare, et cu^ gloria ante om^es iret: oi^bus
tame^ charus esse: ad hoc pleraque tempora in vena^do agere. Leonem atque alias
feras primus, aut in primis fe^^re, plurimu^ facere: et minimum de se ipse
loqui. Quibus rebus Micipsa tametsi i^ initio laetus fuerat ex^stimans virtutem
Iugurthae regno suo gloriae a f^ore: tamen postquam homine^ adolescentem exacta
aetate sua, et peruis liberis, magis, magis ^ crescere intelligit veheme^ter eo
negocio permotus in animo multa voluebat.

Terreba^ eum natura mortaliu^ auida imperij* et preceps ad explendam animi
cupidinem.

Praeterea oportunitas sue liberorumque aetatis: quae etia^ mediocres viros
speprede transuersos agit. Adhoc studia Numidaru^ in Iugurtham accensa. Ex
quibus si tale^ viru^ do lis i^terfecisset / nequa seditio / aut bellu^
oriretur / anxius erat. His difficul tatibus circumuentus: vbi videt / neque
per vim / neque per insidias / opprimi posse hominem tam acceptu^ popularibus:
quod erat Iugurtha manu promptus et appetens gloriae militaris: statuit eum
obiecta re periculis, et eo modo fortunam tentare.

Igitur bello Numantino Micipsa quum populo romano equitu^ / atque peditu^
auxilia mitteret: sperans vel oste^dendo virtute^: vel host^u^ seuitia: ^acile
eum occasuru^: prefecit Numidi^, quos in Hispaniam mittebat.

Sed ea res long aliter, ac ratus erat, euenit. Nam Iugurtha (vt erat ip^gio
atque acri ingenio) Vbi naturam Publij Scipionis, qui tu^ Romanus imperator
erat: et mores hostiu^ cognoui, multo labor, multaque cura, praete^ea mode
sti^^ime pa^e^do: saepe obuiam ^u^do periculis: in tanta^ claritudine^ breui
peruenerat, vt nostris veheme^ter charus, Numantinis maxim terrori esset. At
san^ ^ quod difficillimu^ (...). in primis et p^lio str^nu^ erar: et bonus
co^sili^: quorum alterum ex prouide^tia timore^: alteru^ ex audatia temeritatem
plerumque afferre solet.

Igitur imperator omnes fere res asperas per Iugurtham agere: in amicis habere:
magis magisque eu^ indies amplecti.

Quippe cuius consilium: neque inceptum ullum frustra erat. Huc accedebat
munificentia animi et ingenij solertia* quibus rebus Iugurtha multos ex Romany
sibi familiari amicitia co^iunxerat. Ea te^pestate in exercitu nostro fuere
quam plures no^i / atque nobiles / quibus diuitiae bono / atque honesto /
pociores erant: factiosi domi: potentes apud socio^: ciari magis qua^ honesti:
qui Iugurthae no^ mediocrem animu^ pollicita^do accendebant Si Micipsa rex
occidisset: fore vt solus imperio Numidiae potiretur. In ipso maxima^ virtutem.
Romae omnia ven alia esse.

SEd postquam Numa^tia deleta* Publius Scip^odimittere auxilia et ipse reuerti
domum decreuit: donatu^ / atque laudatu^ magnifice pro co^cione Iugurtha^ i^
pretoriu^ adduxit: ibique secreto mo nu^r: vt potius public / quam priuatim
amicitia^ populi Romani coleret. Neu aliquibus largiri insuesceret. Periculose
a paucis emi: quod multorum esset.

Si permanere vellet i^ suis artibus: vltro et illi gloriam / et regnu^
venturu^: Sin properantius pergeret suam pecuniam et ipsum precipitem casuru^.
Sic locutus: cum literis eum (quas Micipsae redderet) dimisit.

Earum sententia haec erat.

IVgurthae tui in bello Numantino long maxima virtus fuit.

Quam rem tibi certe gaudio esse scio. Nobis ob merita sua charus est: vt idem
senatui et populo Romano sit: summa open nitemur.

Tibi quidem pro nr^a amicitia gratulor. En habes virum dignu^ te atque auo suo
Massinissa.

IGitur rex vbi ea quae fama ^cceperat: ex litteris imperatoris esse ita
cognouit: tum virtute, tum gratia viri permotus flexit animum suum.

^t Iugurtham beneficijs vincere aggressus est.

Statimque eum adoptauit: et testamento pariter cu^ filijs haeredem instituit.

Sed ipse paucos post annos morbo / atque aetate co^fectus: cum sibi finem vite
adesse intelligeret: coram amicis / et cognatis: itemque Adherbale et Hiem^sale
filijs, dicitur huiuscemodi verba cum Iugurtha habuisse.

PAruu^ ego Iugurtha te amisso patre: sine spe: sine opibus: in meum regnu^
suscepi: existimans non minus me tibi: quam liberis (si genuissem) ob beneficia
charum fore.

Neque ea res falsum me habuit. Nam vt alia magna et egregia facta omitta^)
nouissime tu rediens Nu mancia meque, regnumque meum gloria decorasti: tuaque
virtute Romanos ex amicis amicissimos fe cisti.

In Hispania nome^ familiae nostre renouatum est: postremo (quod difficilimum
inter mortales est) gloria inuidiam vicisti.

Nunc (quoniam mihi natura finem vitae facit) per hanc dexteram: per regni
fidem moneo: obtestorque te: vti hos qui genere tibi propinqui beneficio meo
fratres sunt: charos habeas.

Neu malis alienos adiu^gere: q^ sanguine coniunctos retinere.

Non exercitus / neque thesauri presidia regni su^t. Verum amici, quos neque
armis cogere, neque auro parare queas: officio et fi de pariuntur.

Quis autem amicitior quam frater fratri? Aut quem alienum fid^m inuenies: si
tuis hostis fueris*

Equide^ ego vobis regnu^ trado firmum / si boni eritis: sin mali imbecillum.

Nam co^cordia paruae res crescunt, discordia maxim dilabuntur.

Caeterum Iugurtha ante hos te (quia aetate et sapi entia priores) ne aliter
quid eueniat prouidere decet.

Nam in omni certamine qui opulentior est: etiam si accipit iniuriam tame^
(quia plus potest) facere videtur.

Vos autem Adherbal et Hiempsal colite et obseruate hunc talem virum: imitamini
virtutem: et enit^mini: ne ego meliores liberos sumpsisse videar: quam genuisse.

Ad ea Iugurtha tametsi regem ficta locutum intelligebat: et ipse long aliter
in animo agitabat, tamen pro tempore benign respondit.

Micipsa paucis post diebus moritur.

Postquam illi regio more iusta magnifice fecera^t: reguli in vnum conueniu^t:
vt inter se de cu^ctis nego tijs disceptarent.

Sed Hiempsal, qui minimus ex illis erat: natura ferox: etiam antea
ignobilitatem Iugurthae: quia materno genere impar erat: despiciens: dextera
Adherbale^ assedit, ne medi^ ex tribus (quod apud Numidas honori ducit)
Iugurtha foret*

Deinde tamen vt aetati co^cederet / fatigatus a fratre: vix in partem altera^
traductus est.

Ibi cum multa de administrando imperio dissere re^t: Iugurtha inter alias res
ait: oportere qui^quen nij co^sulta et decreta oi^a rescindi.

Nam per ea tempora co^fectum annis Micipsam parum animo valuisse.

Tum Hia^psal placere sibi respondit: nam ipsum illum his tribus proximis annis
adoptione in regnum peruenisse.

Quod verbum in pectus Iugurthae altius quam quisquam ratus erat descendit.

Itaque ex eo tempore ira / et metu anxius: moliri / parare / atque ea modo i^
animo habere: quibus Hiempsal per dolum caperetur. Que vbi tardius procedu^t:
neque lenitur animus ferox: statuit quouis modo inceptum perficere.

Primo co^uentu: quem ab regulis factum supra memoraui / propter dissensionem
placuit diuidi thesauros. finesque imperij singulis co^stitui. Itaque tempus ad
vtra^que ^em discernitur / sed maturius ad pecuniam distribuendam.

REguli interea in loca propinqua thesauris / alius alio / co^cessere. Sed
Hiempsal in oppido Thirmida forte eius domo vtebatur / qui proximus lictor
Iugurthae: charus / acceptusque ei sem per fuerat. Quem ille casu ministrum
oblatu^ promissis onerat / impellitque: vti tanquam suam visens domum eat*
portaru^ claues adulterinas paret.

Nam vere claues ad Hiempsalem referebantur. Caeterum (vbi res postula ret)
seipsum cum magna manu venturum.

Numida mandata breui confecit.

Atque (vti doctus erat) noctu Iugurthae milites introducit. Qui postquam in
aedes irrupere: diuersi regem querebant: dormie^tes alios: alios occursa^tes
interfecere.

Scrutari loca abdita: clausa affri^gere: strepitu et tumultu oi^a miscere.

Quum interi^ Hiempsal reperitur / occultans se in tugurio mulieris ancille:
quo in initio pauidus: et loci ignarus perfugerat. Numide caput eius (vti nissi
erant) referunt. Caeteru^ fama tanti facinoris per omnem Aphrica^ breui
deuulgatur. Adher bale^ omnesque qui sub imperio Micipsae fuera^t / metus
inuadit. In duas parts Numide discedunt. Plures Adherbalem sequuntur Sed illum
alterum bello meliores.

Igitur Iugurtha / qua^ maximas potest copias parat: vrbes partim vi: alias
voluntate: imperio suo adiungere: Omni Numidiae imperare.

Adherbal (tametsi legatos Romam miserat: qui senatum docerent de cede fratris:
et fortunis suis) tamen fretus multitudine militum parat armis contendere.

SEd vbi res ad certamen venit: victus ex prelio profugit i^ prouinciam.

Ac dehinc Romam contendit.

Tum Iugurtha peractis consilijs / postquam omni Numidia pociebatur: i^ ocio
facinus suum i^ animo reputa^s: timere populu^ romanu^: neque aduersus ira^
eius vsquam* nisi in auaricia nobilitatis: et pecunia sua spem habere.

Itaque paucis diebus post / cu^ auro et arge^to multo Romam legatos mittit:
quibus precepit primum vti veteres amicos muneribus repleant: deinde nouos
exquirant. Postremo quaecunque possint largiendo ne cunctentur.

Sed vbi legati Romam venere: et ex praecepto regis hospitibus alijsq* quo ru^
ea tempestate in senatu authoritas pollebat: magna munera misere: Tanta
commutatio incessit: vt ex maxima inuidia et maliuole^tia in gratiam et fauorem
nobilitatis Iugurtha veniret. Quoru^ pars spe / alij premio inducti: singlos ex
senatu ambiendo nitebantur: ne grauis in cum consuleretur. Igitur vbi legati
satis confidunt: die co^stituto* senatus vtrisque datur.

Tum Adherbalem hoc modo locutum accepimus.

PAtres conscripti Micipsa pa^er meus moriens p^acep^^^yt regni Numid^ae
tantu^modo procurationem existimarem meam* Caeterum ius et imperium eius penes
vos esse populumque romanum* simul enitere^ vobis domi militiaeque quam maximo
vsui esse: vos mihi cognatoru^ et affinium loco ducere^. Si ea fecisse^: in
vestra amicitia exercitum / diuitias / munimenta regni me habiturum. Quae
praecepta patris cu^ agita^em: Iugurtha (homo oi^um: quos terra sustinet:
sceleratissimus) co^tempto vestro imperio / Massinissae me nepotem / a stirpe
socium atque amicu^ populi romani: regno / for runisque omnibus expulit. Atque
ego patres co^scripti (quoniam eo miseriarum ve^turus eram) vellem po tius ob
mea quam ob maioru^ beneficia meorum* posse me auxilium a vobis petere: ac
maxim^ deber^ mihi beneficia a populo romano quibus vtinam non egerem.

Sed si ea desidera^da era^t vti debitis vterer.

Sed quoniam paru^ tuta per seip^a^ probitas est: neque mihi in manu fuit:
qualis foret Iugurtha: ad vos co^fugi patres co^scripti: qui bus (quod mihi
miserrimum est) cogor prius one ri quam vsui esse.

Caeteri reges aut bello victi in amicitiam recepti sunt: aut in suis du bijs
rebus societatem vestram appetiuerunt.

Familia nostra cu^ populo romano bello Carthagine^si amicitiam instituit. Quo
tempore: magis fides eius quam fortuna petenda erat.

Quorum progeniem vos patres conscripti nolite pati me nepotem Massinissae
frustra auxilium pet^re. Sed si ad impetrandum nihil causae haberem praeter
miserandam fortunam abquod; paulo a^te ego rex genere, fama, atque copijs
potens: nunc deformatus erumnis: inops alienas opes expecto. Tamen erat
magestatis populi romani prohibere iniuria^ neque pati cuiusquam regnum par
scelus crescere.

Veru^ ego his finibus eiectus sum: quos maioribus meis populus romanus de dit:
vnde pater et auus meus vna vobiscum expulere Siphacem et Carthaginenses*
vestra beneficia mihi erepta su^t* patres conscripti in mea iniuria despecti
estis. Heu me miseru^. Huccine Micipsa pater beneficiatua euasere* Vt quem tu
parem cum liberis ^uis, regnique participem fecisti: is potissimum stirpis tue
extinctor sit. Nunquam ne ergo familia nostra quieta erit? Semper ne i^
sanguine, ferro, fuga versabimur? Dum Carthaginenses incolumes fuere iure omnia
seua patiebamur: hosts a latere. Vos amici procul. Sed omnis in armis.
Postquam illa pestis ex Aphrica eiecta est: leti pacem agitabamus: quippe
quibus nullus hostis erat nisi illi forte quem vos iussissetis. Ecce autem ex
improuiso: Iugurtha intollera^da audacia, scelere, atque superbia sese
efferens: ^ratre meo atque eodem propinquo suo interfecto primum regnu^ eius
sceleris sui predam fecit. Post vbi in eisdem dolis me nequiuerit capere: nihil
minus quam vim aut bellum expecta^tem in imperio vestro (sicut videtis)
extorrem patria, domo i^opem et coopartu^ miserijs effecit: vt vbiuis tutius
quam in meo regno essem. Ego sic existimabam patres conscripti vti predicantem
audiuera^ patrem meu^ qui diligenter colerent amicitiam vestram: eos multu^
laborem suscipere, caeteru^ ex omnibus maxim tutos esse.

Quod in familia nr^a fuit praestitit, vti in omnibus bellis adesset vobis. Nos
vti per ocium tuti simus in manu vestra est.

Patres conscripti pater nos duos fratres reliquit ^ertium Iugurtha^ beneficijs
suis ratus est coniunctum nobis fore.

Alter eorum necatus est, alter eius ipse ego manus impias vix effugi.

Quid agam? aut quo porissimu^ infelix accedam? Generis oi^a presidia extincta
sunt. Pater vti necesse erat naturae co^cessit.

Fratri quem minime decuit propinquus per scelus vitam eripuit affines, amicos
caeterosque meos propinquos aliu^ alia clade oppressit.

Pars cap^ti a Iugurtha, pars in crucem acti, et pars bestijs obiecti sunt.

Pauci (quibus relicta est anima) clausi in tenebris: cum merore et luctu morte
grauiorem vitam exigunt. Sed si oi^a mihi quae aut amisi, aut quae ex
necessarijs aduersa facta su^t incolumia manerent: tamen si quid ex improuiso
mali accidisset vos implo rarem patres conscripti quibus pro magnitudine
i^perij ius et iniurias oe^s cure esse decet. Nunc vero exul patria, domo,
solus atque oi^m honestarum reru^ egens quo accedam aut quos appellem? Naciones
ne an reges? qui oe^s familiae nostre ob vestram amicitiam infecti sunt. An
quoquam mihi adire licet vbi non meoru^ maiorum monumento hostilia plurima sint.

An quisque nostri misereri potest qui aliquando nobis hostis fuit?

Postremo Micipsa ita nos instituit patres co^scripti ne quem coleremus nisi
populum romanu^: ne societatem, neque federa noua acciperemus: abunde magna
presidia nobis in vestra amicitia fore. Sed si huic imperio fortuna mutaretur:
vna occidendum nobis fore.

Virtute ac dijs vole^tibus magni et opulenti estis. Oi^a secu^da et obedientia
su^t: quo facilius sociorum iniurias curare licet. Tantum illud vereor ne quos
priuata amicitia Iugurthae parum cognita tra^suersos agat: quos ego audio su^ma
open niti / ambire fatigare vos singulos: ne quid de abse^te (incognita causa)
statuatis.

Finge^e me verba: et fugam simulare: cui licuerit in regno manner.

QUOD vtinam illum (cuius impio facinore in has miserias proiectus sum) eadem
haec similante^ vide a^: et aliqua^do aut apud vos aut deos immortales: rerum
humanaru^ cura oria tur: vt ille qui nunc sceleribus suis ferox atque preclarus
est omnibus malis ipse excruciatus impietatis in parentem nostrum: fratres mei
necis: mearu^que miseriarum graves penas reddat.

Iamiam frater a^o meo charissime quamquam tibi immaturo: et vnde minime
decuit: vita erepta est tame^ letandum magis quam dolen dum casum tuum puto.

Non enim ta^tum regnu^: sed fugam / exiliu^ / egestatem / et has oe^s erumnas
(quae me premu^t) cum anima simul amisisti. At ego infelix in ta^ta mala
precipitatus ex patrio regno rerum humanatu^ spectaculum prebeo.

Incertus sum quid agam: tuas ne iniurias persequar / ipse auxilij egens: an
regno consulam: cuius vitae necisque potestas ex opibus alienis pendet. Vtinam
emori fortunis meis honestus exitus esset: ne viuere contentus videre^ / si
defessus malis iniuriae concessissem.

Nu^c neque viuere libet mihi neque mori licet sine dedecore.

Patres conscripti obtestor vos per liberos atque parents vestros: per
magestatem populi romani: subuenite mihi misero.

Ite obuiam iniuriae: nolite pati regnum Numidiae (quod vestru^ est) per scelus
et sanguinem familiae nostre tabescere.

POstquam rex loquendi finem fecit: legati Iugurthae largitione freti magis
quam causa paucis respondent, Hiempsalem ob seuitiam suam a Numidis interfectum.

Adherbalem vltro bellu^ inferentem (postquam superatus sit) queri, quod
iniuria^ facere nequiuisset. Iugurtham ab senatu petere ne se alium putarent ac
Numanciae cognitus esset: neu verba inimici ante facta sua ponerent.

Deinde vt^ique a curia digrediuntur. Senatus statim consulitur: fauto^es
legatoru^: preterea senatus mag^a pars gr^a deprauata Ad^erbalis dicta
cort^tere: Iugurthae virtu^ extollere ^audi^us^ gia, voce* Denique oi^bus modis
pro ali^^o scelere et flagitio: sua quasi pro g^ia niteba^tur. Ac co^tra: pauci
quibus bonu^ et a quu^ diuitijs car^us erat / subu^m^rdu^ Adherbal^, et
Hiempsalis morte^ severe vindic^da^ censeba^t. Sed ex oibus maxi^e Aemilius
Scaurus homo nobilis, impiger, factiosus, auidus pote^tiae, honoris,
diuitiarum. Caeterum vitia call: de sua occulta^s. Is postquam videt regis
largi tionem ^amosam impude^ temque ^ veritus (quod in tali re fieri solet) ne
polluta licentia inuidiam accenderet ai^m a consueta libidine continuit: vicit
tamen in senatu pa^s illa que vero precium aut gratiam antefer^bat.

Decretum sit vti dece^ legati regnum quod Micipsa obtinuerat inter Iugurtham
et Adherbalem diuiderent: cu^us legationis princeps ^uit Lucius Opimius: homo
clarus: et tum in senatu potens: qui co^sulibus Caio Graccho et Ma^co Fulu^o
flacco interfectis / acerrime nobilitatis victoriam in plebem exercuerat.

Eum Iugurtha tametsi Romae in inimicis habuerat: tamen accuratissime accepit.
Dando et pollicendo multa / perfecit* vti fame, fidei, postremo omnibus suis
rebus commodum regis anteferret.

Reliquos legatos eadem via aggressus est: plerosque capit. paucis charior
fides quam pecunia erat.

In diuisione regni que pers Numidie Mauritaniam attingit agris virisque
opule^tior* Iugurthae tradit. Illam altera^ specie pociorem quam vsu: quae
portuosior / et edificijs magis exornata erat: Adherbal possedit.

Res postulare videtur / situm Aphrice paucis exponere: et eas ge^tes quibus
cum nobis beslu^ aut amicitia fuit / attingere.

Sed que loca et nationes ob calorem et aspiritate^ inter solitudines minus
frequentata sunt: de hijs haud facile compertum / narrauero. Caetera quam
paucissimis absoluam.

IN diuisione orbis terrae / plerique in part tertia Aphricam posuere: pauci
tantu^modo Asiam et Europa^ esse: sed Aphricam in Europa.

Ea fines habet ab occide^te fretum nostri maris et oc^ani.

Abortu sodis decliuem latitudinem: quem locu^ Catabathmon incole appella^t.
Marc seuu^ importuosu^: ager frugu^ fertilis / bonus pecori: arbo^i infecu^dus:
caeli terraeque penuria aquarum.

Genus hominum salubri corpore, velox, patie^s laborum: plerosque senectus
disioluit: nisi qui ferro aut bestijs interiere. Na^ haud morbus saepe quemquam
superat. Adhec malefici generis plurima ai^alia. Sed qui mortales in initio
Aphrica^ habuere: quique postea accesserint: aut quomodo inter se permixti sint
quamquam ab ea fama quae plerosque obtinet diuersu^ est tamen vti ex libris
punicis qui reg Hiemp^alis dicebant: interpretatum nobis est: vtique r^m sese
habere cultores eius terre puta^t: quam pa^cis^i mus dicam. Cateru^ f^des eius
penes authors erit. Aphricam habuere in initio Getuli et L^bes, asperi,
incultique quibus cibus erat caro ferina: atque humi pabulum vti pecotibus. Hi
neque moribus, neque lege, aut imperio cuiusquam regebantur: vagi, palantes,
quo nox coegerat seeds habebant. Sed postquam in Hispania Hercules (sicuti
Aphri puta^t) interijt: exercitus eius co^positus ex varijs gentibus amisso
duce: ac passim multes sibi imperium pete^tibus breui dilabit. Ex eo numero
Medi, Per se, et Armeni nauibus in Aphrica^ tra^suecti / proximos nr^o mari
locos occupauere. Sed Perse intra magis occeanu^. Hique alueos nauiu^ inuersos
pro tugurijs habuere. Quia neque materia i^ agris, neque ab Hispanis emendi:
aut mutua^di copia erat: mare magnu^ et ignara lingua co^mercia prohibebant. Hi
paulatim per co^nubia Getulos secum miscuere. Et quia saepe tentantes agros:
alia, deinde alia loca petiuera^t: semetipsi Numidas appellauere. Caeterum
adhuc edificia Numidarumquam agrestim^ mappalia illi vocant / oblonga* curuis
lateribus tecta, quasi nauium carinae sim. Medi aute^ et Armeni accessere
Lybes. Nam hi mare propius Aphricu^ agitabant. Getuli sub sole magis / haud
procul ab ardoribus: hique mature oppida habuere: nam freto diuisi ab Hispania
/ mutare res inter se constituerant. Nomen eorum paulatim Lybes corrupere:
barbara lingua Mautos pro Medis appellantes.

Sed res Persarum breui adoleuit: ac postea nomine Numide propter multitudinem
domi minuendam / a pare^tibus digress^ possidere ea loca / quae proxime
Carthaginem Numidia appellatur. Deinde vtrique alteris freti / finitimos armis,
aut metu / sub imperium suu^ coegere: nomen, gloria^que sibi addidere: mages
hi* qui ad nostrum mare process rant: quia Lybes quam Getuli minus erant
bellicosi. Deinde Aphricae pars inferior pleraque a Numidis possessa est /
victi omnes in gentem nomenque imperantium concessere.

Postea Phenices alij multitudinis domi minuende gratia: pars cupidine imperij,
solicitata plebe, et alij nouarum rerum auidi: Hiponem, Adrumentum, Leptim,
alia^que vrbes in ora maritima condidere.

Haeque breui multum aucte: pars originibus suis presidio, alie decori fuere.
Nam de Carthagine silere melius puto, quam pa^u^ dicere: quoniam alio properare
tempus admonet.

Haec tum ex Marone, tum ex Seruio, reliquisque probis auctoribus sunt excerpta.

Igitur ad Catabathmon (qui locus Egyptum ab Africa diuidit secu^dum mare)
prima habitatio Cirene e^, Tolonia, There con, ac deinde due sunt Syrtes, inter
quas Leptes, Deinde Philenorum are, quem locu^ Egyptum ver sus / finem imperij
habuere Carthaginenses.

Post alie Punice vrbes* caetera loca vsque ad Mauritaniam Numidae tene^t.
proxime Hispania^ Mauri sunt.

Supra Numidiam Getulos accepimus, partim in tugurijs, alios incultius Vagos
agitare. Post eos Ethiopes esse.

Igitur bello Iugurthino pleraque ex Punicis oppida: et fines Carthaginensium:
quos nouissime habuerant: populus Romanus per magistratus administrabat.
Getulorum magna pars et Numdiae vsque ad flumen Mulucha^ sub Iugurtha era^t.
Mauris oi^bus imperitabat rex Bocchus praeter nome^ per caetera ignarus populo
romano. itemque, neque pace, neque bello ante cognitus erat. De Aphrica et de
eiusdem incolis ad necessi tudine^ rei satis dictu^ est.

POstquam autem diuiso regno legati ab Aphrica discessere: et Iugurtha co^tra
animi timorem premia sceleris adeptum sese videt: certum esse ratus quod ex
amicis apud Numantiam acceperat, oi^a Romae venalia esse: simul et illorum
pollicitationibus accensus: quos paulo ante muneribus expleuerat: in regnum
Adherbalis animu^ inte^dit.

Ipse acer^ bellicosus. At is quem petebat: quietus imbellis, placido i^genio,
oportunus injury, metue^s magis quam metue^dus.

Igitur Iugurtha ex improuiso eius fines cu^ magna manu inuadit: multos
mortales cum pecore atque alia preda capit: edificia incendit: pleraque loca
hostiliter cum equitatu petit.

Deinde cu^ omnium multitudine in regnu^ suum co^uertit: existimans Adherbalem
dolor permotu^ iniurias suas vindicaturum eamque rem belli causam fore. At
ille: quod neque se parem armis existimabat: et amicitia populi to mani magis
quam Numidis fretus erat: legatos ad Iugurtham de iniurijs questum misi: qui
tametsi co^tumeliosa dicta retuleru^t prius tamen omnia pati decreuit quam
bellum sumere quia tentatum ante secus cesser^t.

Neque eo magis cupido Iugurthae minuebatur.

Quippe qui totu^ regnum eius animo iam inuaserat* Itaque non vti ante cu^ pre
datoria manu: sed magno exercitu comparato bellum gerere cepit: et totius
imparium Numidiae petere: caeterum qua pergebat: vrbes, agros vastare: predas
agere: suis animu^: hostibus terrorem augere. Adherbal vbi intellexit eo
processum: vti regnum aut reliquendum esset: aut armis retinendum necessario
copias parat et Iugurthae obuius procedit. Interim haud long amari prope
Cirtham oppidum vtriusque exercitus co^sedit et quia diei extremum erat:
prelium non est inceptu^: sed vbi plurimum noctis processit: obscuro etiam tunc
lumine: milites Iugurthi ni signo dato castra hostium inuadunt: semiso^nos
partim alios sume^tes arma suga^t sunduntque. Adherbal cum paucis equitibus
Cirtham profugit: et ni multitudo togatorum fuisset: quae Numidas insequentes
menibus prohibebat: vno die inter duos regos ceptum atque patratum bellum
forer. Iugurtha oppidum circu^ sedit: vineas, turribusque et machinis omnium
generum expugnare aggreditur: maxim festinans tempus legatorum ante capere
quos ante preliu^ factum ab Adherbale romam missos audiuerat.

SEd post quam senatus de bello eorum accepit: tres adolescentes in Aphrica^
lega^tur: qui ambos reges adeant senatus populique romani vrbes nu^cie^t
censere et velle: eos armis discedere, ita seque, illisque dignum esse. Lega ti
in Aphricam maturantes veniunt, eo magis / quod Romae, quum proficisci parant,
de prelio facto et oppugnatione Cirthae audiebatur.

Sed rumor clemens erat. Quorum Iugurtha accepta oratione respondit, sibi neque
mai^ quicquam, neque charius authoritate senatus esse: ab adolescentia ita se
enixum: vt ab optimo quoque probar^t.

Virtute, non malitia Publio Scipioni summo viro placuis^e, ob easdem arts a
Micipsa non penuria liberorum in ^egnum adoptatum esse.

Caeterum quod pleraque been atque strennue fecisset, eo ai^m suu^ iniuriam
minus tollerare. Adherbalem do lis vitae suae insidiatu^ esse: quod vbi
comperisset: sceleri obuiam isse.

Populum romanum neque recte, neque pro bono fact^rum: si a iure ge^tium sese
prohibuerit.

Postremo de omnibus rebus legatos Romam breui mis^urum Ita vtrique d^
grediuntur.

Adherbali modo fuit appellandi copia.

Iugurtha vbi eos Aphrica discessisse ratus est neque propter loci naturam
armis expugnare Cirtham potest: vallo atque fossa menia circundat, turres
extruit, easque presidijs firmat.

Praeterea dies noctesque aut per vim, aut dolis te^tare: defe^soribus moeniu^
praemia modo: modo formidinem ostentare suos horta^do ad virtutem erigere /
prorsus inte^tus cuncta parare.

At vbi Adherbal intelligit omnes fortunas suas in extremo sitas: hostem
infestu^: auxilij spem nullam penu^ia necessariarum rerum bellum trahi non
posse: ex his, qui vna Cirtham profugerant, duos maxim impigros delegit: eos
multa pollicendo ac miserando casum suu^ co^firmat: vti per hostium munitio^es
noctu ad proximum mare, deinde Romam pergerent.

Numidae paucis diebus iussa efficient.

Litterae Adherbalis in senatu recitate sunt, quarum sente^tia haec erat.

NOn mea culpa saepe ad vos oratum mitto patres co^scripti, sed vis Iugurthae
subegit: quem tanta libido extinguendi me inuasit: vt neque vos, neque deos
immortales in aio habeat. Sanguinem meum quam oi^a malit. Itaque iam quintu^
me^sem socius, et amicus populi romani armis obses^us teneor, neque Micipsa
patris mei beneficia, neque vestra decreta auxiliantur.

Ferro an fame acrius vrgear incertus sum.

Plura de Iugurtha scribere dehortatur me fortuna mea: etiam ante expertus sum
parum fidei miseris esse, tamen intelligo illum supra quam ego sum petere.
Neque simul amicicia^ vestram et regnum meum sperare utru^ grauius existimet
nemini occultu^ est.

Nam i^ initio occidit Hiempsalem fratrem meu^. Deinde patrio regno me expulit.
Que sane fuerit nr^e injury: nihil ad vos. Verum nunc regnum armis tenet. Me
quem vos imperatorem numidis posuistis clausum obsidet: legatorum verba quanti
fecerit: pericula mea declarant.

Quid reliquum nisi vis vestra qua moueri possit Nam ego quidem vellem hec que
scribo et illa quae antea in senatu questus sum vana forent: potius quam
miseria mea fidem vobis faceret: sed quoniam in eo natus su^: vt Iugurthae
scelerum ostentui essem. Non iam morte^ nec erumnas tantu^modo imperium inimici
et cruciatus corporis dep^cor. Regno Numidiae patres conscripti quod vestrum
est: vti libet consulite me manibus ab impijs eripite per magestatem imperij:
per amicitiae fide^: si vlla apud vos memoria manet aui mei Massinissae.

HIs literis recitatis fuere qui exercitu^ i^ Aphricam mittendum decernerent:
quam primum Adherbali subueni endum. interim de Iugurtha consuleretur quonia^
legatis non paruisset. sed ab ijsdem regis fautoribus summa open enixum est ne
tale decretum fieret: ita bonum publicum (vt plerisque negotijs solet) priuata
gratia deuictum. Legantur tamen in Aphrica^ maiores natu / nobiles amplis
honoribus vsi: in quis fuit Marcus Emilius Scaurus de quo supra memorauimus:
homo co^sularis: and tum in senatu potens princeps.

Hi quod Iugurthae res in inuidia erat: simulet a Numidis obsecrati: triduo i^
nauem ascendere. Deinde breui Vticam appulsi literas ad Iugurtha^ mittunt quam
ocissime ad proui^ciam accedat: seque ad eum ab senatu missos.

assumitur Scaurus: qui ta metsi a principio plerisque aex factione eius
corruptis acerrime rege^ impugnabat: ^n^ magnitudine pecuniae a bono honestoque
in prau^m abstractus est.

Sed Iugurtha primu^ belli tantu^modo moram redime bat: existimans sese aliquid
interim Romae preci^ o aut gratia effecturum. Poste^a vero quam participem
negocij Scaurum accepit: i^ maximam spem adductus recuperan de pacis: statuit
cu^ eis de omnibus pactionibus presens agere.

Caeteru^ interea fidei causa mittitur a co^sule Sextius questor in oppidum
Iugurthae Vaccam: cuius rei species erat acceptio srumenti: quod Calphurnius
palam legatis imperauerat: quonia^ deditionis mora inducie agitabantur.

Igitur rex (vti constituerat) in castra perueuit ac pauca presenti co^sil^o
locutus de inuidia facti sui atque vti i^ deditionem acciperetur:

reliqua cu^ Bestia et Scau^o secreto transegit.

Deinde postero die quasi per satyram legem sente^ tijs exquisitis in
deditionem accipitur:

Sed vti pro consilio imper atum erat: eliphante / triginta pecus / atque equi
multi non cum paruo argenta pondere questori traduntur.

Calphurnius romam ad magistratus roga^dos proficiscitur.

In Numidia et in exerci tu nostro pax agitabat.

POstquam autem r^s in Aphrica gestas et quomodo act forent fama diuulgauit.
Rome per omnis locos et conuentus de facto consulis agitari: apud plebem grauis
inuidia orta est. Patres solici ti erant an probarent ta^tum flagitium an
decretum co^sulis subuertere^t: parum constabat. At maxim eos potentia Scauri
quod is auctor et socius Bestie ferebat a vero bonoque impediebat.

At Caius Me^mius: de cuius liberate ingenij / et odio pote^tie nobilitatis
supra diximus inter dubitationem: et moras se natus in concionibus populum ad
vendicandum hortari: monere populu^ romanum ne libertatem suam desererent:
crudelia et superba multa facinora nobilitatis ostendere: prorsus intentus
omnino plebis animum accendebat.

Sed quoniam ea te^pestate Rome Memmij facundia clara / pollens que fuit decere
existimaui vna^ (ex ta^ multis) orationem eius perscribere: ac potissimum eam
dicam qua^ in co^cione post reditum bestie huiuscemodi verbis disseruit.

MVlta me dehortant a vobis quirites: ni si studium rei publicae omnia superet:
opes factionis: vestra patientia: ius nullum: ac maxim quod innocentie plus
periculi quam honoris est.

Nam illa^ quidem piget dicere: his annis quindecim quam ludibrio fueritis su
perbie paucorum quam fed^^ quamque multi perierunt vestri defe^sores vt nobis
animus ab ignauia atque seco^dia corruptus sit: qui ne nu^c quide^ obnoxij
inimicis exurgitis.

Atque etiam nunc timetis eos: quibus terrori decet esse. Sed quamquam haec
falia sunt: tamen obu^am ire potentie factionis animus subegit.

Certe ego libertate^ que mihi apare^te meo tradita est experiar. Verum ^d
frustra / an ob rem facia^ / in vestra manu situm est. Neque vos hortor quod
saepe vestri maiores fecere uti contra iniurias armati eatis: nihil vi nec
secessione opus est: necesse est suomet ipsi more p^cepites eant.

Occiso Tiberio Graccho (quem regnu^ parare homines a^ebant) in plebe^ romanam
graves habit su^t quaestiones. Post Caij Gracch^ et Marci Fuluij cedem: item
vestri ordinis multi mortales i^ carcere necati sunt. Vtriusque cladis non lex
veru^ libido eorum finem fecit. Sed sane suerit regni re paratio plebi sua ^ura
re stituere quicquid sine sa^guine c^uium vlcisci nequit in^e ^actum sit*

Superioribus annis taci ti indignabamini erariu^ expilari: reges et populos
liberos paucis nobili bus ve^^igal pendere penes eosdem et su^mam gli am et
maximas diuitias esse t^ talia facinora impune suscepisse parum ha buere.

Itaque postremo leges / magestas yr^a diuina et humana oia hostibus tradita
sunt.

Neque qui ea fecere pu^e^ aut paenitet: sed incedunt perora vestra magnifice:
sacerdotia et co^sulatus: pa^s triumphos su^s ostentantes perinde quasi ea
honori non prede habeant.

Setu^aere comparati / iniusta imperia dn^orum no^ perferunt. Vos quirites in
imperio rati / equo animo s^ruitutem toleratis. At qui sunt hi / qui
re^publicam occupaucre? homines sceleratissimi / cru^ntis manibus / imma^^
auatitia / nocentissimi / ^^demque superbissimi / quibus decus / fid^s / pietas
/ postremo honesta atque in honesta oia questui sunt.

Pars occidisse tribunos plebis: alij questiones iniustas plerique fedem in vos
fecisse / pro munimento habent.

Itaque quamtum quisque pessime fecit / ta^ maxim tu tus est: metu^ a scelere
suo ad ignauiam vestram tra^ stulere: quos omnis eade^ cupere: eadem odisse:
eadem metuere in vnum co egit. Sed haec inter bonos amicitia: inter malos
factio est.

QUOD si tantam vos curam libertatis haberetis: quam illi ad dominatione^ accen
si sunt: profecto: neque res publica (sicuti nunc) vastaretur: et beneficia
vestra penes optimos no^ au dacissimos forent.

Maiores ^estri parandi iuris et magestatis co^stituende gratia* per
secessionem armati: bis Auentinu^ montem occupauere: vos pro liberate qua^ ab
illis accepistes: no^ne su^ ma open nitemini: atque eo vehe^tentius / quod maius
dedecus est parta amittere quam omnino no^ parauisse?

Dice^ aliquis: quid igit ^enses? vindicandum in eos qui hosti prodidere rempu:
non manu neque ^i: quod magis vobis ^ecisse: quam illis accidisse indignum est*

Verum questionibus et indicio ipsius iugurthae: qui si deditus est: profecto
iussis vestris obediens erit.

Sin ea co^temnit: scilicet existimabitis qualis illa pax aut deditio sit: ex
qua ad Iugurtham scelerum impunitas: ad paucos potentes maxim diuitie: ad
rempu. damna atque dedecora peruene rint. Nisi fore non du^ eti am vos
dn^ationis eorum satietas tenet: et illa quam haec tempora magis placent: cum
regna / prouincie / leges / ^ura / iudicia / bella / atque paces: postre mo
diuina and humana omnia penes paucos erant. Vos autem inuicti ab hostibus
imperatores omnium gentium satis habebatis animam retinere.

Nam seruitutem quidem quis vestrum recusare audebat?.

At ego tametsi virum flagitiosum existimo i^pune iniuria^ accepisse: tn^ vos
hoi^bus sceleratissimis ignoscere: qm^ c^ues sunt aequo ai^o paterer ni mi^a i^
perniciem casura esset. Nam et illis quantu^ importunitatis habent parum est
impune male fec^sse: nisi faciundi licentia deinde eriptatur. Et vobis eterna
folicitudo remanebit: quum intelligitis aut serutendu^ esse aut per manus
libertatem retinendam.

Nam fidei quid^ aut con cordie quae spes est?

Dn^ari ^i^i volunt: vos liberi esse: facere illi iniuriam vos prohibere:
postremo socijs nostris velu ti hostibus: hostibus pro socijs vtuntur: potest
ne in tam diuersis mentibus pax aut amicitia esse? Quare moneo horrorque vos ^
ne tantum scelus impunitum omittatis. Non peculatus erarij factus est neque per
vim socijs erepte pecume que* quam quam grauia sunt, tamen ex co suetudine iam
pro ni^ilo habentur.

Hosti acerrimo prodita senatus authoritas: proditum imperium vestium est: domi
militieque refpublica venalis suit que nisi quesita erunt: et nisi vindicatum
in noxios quid erit reliquu^ / nisi vt illis obedientes viuamus qui ea
^ecerunt? Na^ impune quodlibet agere: id est regem esse.

Neque vos quirites hortor / vt malitis ciues vestros perpe^a^ quam recte
fec^^^e sed ne ignoscendo malis bonos p^^ditum eatis.

Ad-hoc in republica multo prestat benefici^ quam maleficij immemorem esse:
bonus fit tantu^modo f^gn^o^ / vbi negligas: at malus improbior: ad hoc si
injury non sint: haud saepe auxilij egeas.

HEc atque alia huius cemodi saepe dicendo Memmius populo persuadet vt Lucius
Cassius qui tum praetor erat ad Iugurtham mitteret: eumque interposita fide
publica Roman duceret: quo facilius idicio regis Scau^i et reliquorum quos
pecunie capte arcesseba^t delicta pat^fierent.

DVm haec Rome geru^tur: qui in Numidia relicti a Bestia exercitui pre erant:
sequuti morem imperatoris sui plurima and flagitiosissima f^cere facinora.
fuere qui auro corrupti elephantos Iugurthae traderent. Alij perfugas
venderent: pars expacatis predas agebant. Tanta vis auaricie animos eorum
veluti ^abes inuaserat.

AT Cassius / perlata rogatione a Caro Memmio / ac percul sa omni nobilitate /
ad Iugurtham proficiscitur: ei que timido et ex conscientia diffidenti rebus
suis persuadet (quoniam se populo romano dedisset) ne vim quam misericordiam
experir^ mallet.

Priuatim praeterea fidem suam interponit / qua^ ^o^ minoris quam publicam
ducebat.

Talis ca te^pestate fama de ^assio erat.

Iugurtha co^tra decus regium / cultu quam maxim miserabili / cum Canto Romam
venit. Ac tametsi in ipso magra vis animi erat confirmato ab omnibus / quorum
potentia aut scelere cu^cta ea gesserat: quae supra d^ximus Ca^u^ tamen Bebium
tribunum plebis / magna mercede parat cuius impudentia contra ius et iniurias
omnes munitus foret.

A^ Caius Memmius aduocata concione (quamquam regi infesta plebs erat: et pars
in vincula duci iuberet: pars vero nisocios sceleris aperiret: more maiorum de
host supplicium sumi dignitati magis quam ire consulens: sedare motus et
animos eoru^ mollire / postremo confirmare fidem publicam per sese inuiolatam
fore.

Post vbi silentium cepit / producto Iugurtha / verba facit. Rome Numidiaeque
facinora eius memorat scelera in patre^ fratresque oste^dit: et quibus
iuuantibus quibusque ministris ea egerit: quam quam intelligit populus Romanus
tamen se velle manifest magis ex illo habere: si verum aperiat: in fide et
cleme^tia populi romani magnam spem illi sitam.

Sin reticeat: non saluti ^ocijs fore: sese et suas opes corrupturum. Deinde
vbi Me^mius dice^di finem fecit / et Iugurtha ^ussus est respondere Caius
Bebius (que^ pecunia corruptum supra diximus) regem tacere iubet: ac tametsi
multitudo quae in co^cione aderat vehementer accensa terrebat eu^ clamore
vultuque: sepe impetu: atque alijs omnibus quae ira fieri ama^: Vicit tn^ Bebij
impudentia. Itaque populus ludibrio habitus ex contione discessit.

Iugurthae / Bestieque et caeteris quos illa question ex agitabat ai^ augescunt.

ERat ea te^pestate Romae Numida quidam nomine Massiua filius Galussae: nepos
Massinissae: qui (quia in dissensione regum Iugurthae aduersus fuerat) dedita
Cirtha et Adherbale interfecto profugus ex Aphrica abierat. Huic Spurius
Albinus qui proximo anno post bestia^ cum quinto Minutio Ruffo co^sulatu^
gerebat: persuadet: quoniam e stirpe Massinissae sit Iugurtham ob scelera in
uidia cu^ metu vrgeat: regnum Numidiae a senatu petat. auidus consul belli
gerundi moueri quam seen scere omnia malebat.

Ipsi prouincia Numidia Minutio Macedonia obuenit. Que postquam Massiua agitare
cepit: neque Iugurthae in amicis satis p^sidij est (quia little aliu^
conscientia: alium mala fama et timor impediebat) Bomilchari proxi^o ac maxim
fido sibi imperat vt precio (sicuti multa confecerat) ^i sidiatores Massiue
paret: ac maxim occulte: sinid paru^ procedat: quouis modo Numidam
interficiat. Bomilchar mature regis mandata exequitur per homines talis negocij
artifices: itinera / egre^^usque / eius / postremo loca / atque tempora
explorat. Deinde vbi res postulabat: insidias tetendit. Igit vnus ex eo numero
qui ad cedem parati erant: paulo inco^ ultius Massiua^ aggreditur: illu^que
obtruncat. Sed ipse ^eprehe^sus multis horta^ribus, et in primis Albino consule
in dicium profitetur. Fit reus magis ex aequo et bono quam ex iure gentium
Bomilchar comes eius qui Roman fide pu. venerat.

At Iugurtha manifestus tanti sceleris non prius omisit contra verum niti /
quam anima duertit supra gratiam ac pecuniam suam inuidiam sact^esse.

Igitur quamquam in priori actio ne ex amicis quinquagin ta vades dederat:
regno magis quam vadibus consulens: c^am in Numidiam dimittit Bomilchar
e^veritus ne reliquos populares metus inuaderet parendi sibi: si de illo
supplicium sumptum foret.

Et ipse paucis diebus eo profectus est: iusius a senatu Italia discedere.

Sed postquam Roma egressus est / fertur saepe tacitus respiciens / postremo
dixisse / vrbem venalem / et mature perituram: si emptore^ inuenerit.

INterim Albinus renouato bello / co^meatum / stipendiu^ / aliaque / quae
militibus vsui forent: maturat in Aphrica^ portare ac statim ipse profectus est
/ vti ante comitia ( quoth tempus haud long aberat) armis aut deditione^ aut
quouis modo bellum conficeret.

At contra Iugurtha trahere omnia: et alias / deinde alias causas more facere:
polliceri deditione^ ac deinde metum simulare: cedere instanti: et paulo post
(ne sui diffidere^t) instare: ita belli modo: modo pacis mo^a / consulem
ludificare.

At fuere / qui tum Albinu^ haud ignarum co^silij regis existimarent.

Neque ex tanta propera^tia: tam facile tractu^ bellum secordia magis quam dolo
crederent. Sed postquam dilapso tempore / comitiorum dies aduen^abat* Albinus*
Aulo fratre in castris pro p^tore relicto / Roman distescit.

EA tempestate Romae seditionibus tribunitijs atrociter respu. agitabatur.
Publius Lucullus: Lucius Annius tribuni plebis resistentibus collegis
co^tinuare magistratum nitebantur.

Quae dissensio totius anni co^mitia impediebat.

Ea mora in spem adductus Aulus (quem pro pretore in castris relictu^ supra
diximus) aut conficiendi belli gratia: aut terrore exercitus ab rege pecunie
capiunde / milites mense Ianuario ex taber naculis in expeditionem euocat:
magnisque itineribus hyeme aspera peruenit ad oppidu^ Suthul ^ vbi regis
thesauri erant.

Quod quamquam et seuitia temporis et oportunitate loci neque capi neque
obsideri poterat (nam circa murum situm in prerupti montis extremo planicies
limosa hyemalibus aquis paludem fecerat) tn^ aut similandi gratia quo regi
formidine^ adderet: aut cupidine cecus opidi potiundi: vineas agere: aggerem
^acere: aliaque quae incepto vsui forent preparare.

At Iugurtha cognita vanitate atque imperitia legati / subdole eius augere
ame^tia^ / missitare supplicantes legatos: Ipse quasi vitabundus per saltuosa
loca et trami^es exercitu^ ductare.

Denique Aulum spe pactio^is pepulit: vti / Suthule relicto / in abditas
regiones sese veluti rede^tem insequeretur.

Ita delicta occultiora fuere.

Interea Iugurtha per homines callidos die noctu que exercitum tentabat:
centuriones / ducesque turmarum partim vti transfugere^t corrumpere* alij signo
dato vti locum desererent.

Quae postquam ex sente^tia instruxit / intempesta nocte cum multitudine
Numidarum Auli castra circu^uenit.

Milites Romani perculs^^nsolito metu arma cape^ alij sese abdere: pars
territos confirmare: trepidare omnibus locis vis magna hostium:

^alum nocte atque nubibus obscutatum: periculum anceps.

Postremo ^ugere an manner tutius foret ^ in incerto erat.

Sed ex eo numero quos paulo ante corruptos diximus / cohors vna ligurum cum
duabus turmis Tracum et paucis gregarijs militibus transiere ad regem: et
Ce^turio pri mipili tertie legionis permunitione^ / quam vti defenderet
acceperat) locu^ hostibus intro ^undi dedit. Ea part Numide cunct^^rrupere. Ex
nost^is feda fuga: plerique abiectis armis proximu^ collem occupauere. nox
atque preda castroru^ hosts quominus victoria vterentur remorata su^t. Deide
postero die Iugurtha cu^ Aulo in colloquio verba facit: tametsi ipsu^ cum
exercitu fame / ferroque clausum tenet: tame^ dicit se memorem humanarum rerum
si secum fedus faceret: incolumes omnes sub ^ugum missu^um: preterea vti december
diebus Numidia decederent.

Quae quam quam grauia et flagitij plena erant: tame^ que a mortis metu
nutabant sicuti regi libuerat pa^ conuenit.

SEd vbi ea Romae comperta sunt: metus atque meror ciuitatem inuasere. Part
do^ere pro gloria imperi: pars insoli ti bellicarum rerum time re libertati.

Aulo omnes i^ festi: ac maxim qui bello ^elari sepe fuerantque armatus de
decore potiusque manu salutem quesiuerat.

Obea consul Albinus ex delicto fratris inuidiam ac deinde periculum timens
senatum de foedere consulebat: tamen exercitur interim supplementum scribere.

A sceli^ et nomine latino auxilia accersere: denique omnibus modis sestinare.

Senatus (vti par fuerat) d^cernit suo atque populi imussu nullum potuisse
fedus fieri.

Consul impeditus a tribuno plebis ne quas parauerat copias secu^ portaret:
paucis diebus in Aphricam proficiscitur.

Na^ omnis exercitus ^ vti co^uene^at / Numida deductua in prouincia hyemabat.

Postquam eo ventum est (quam quam persequi Iugurtham: et moderi fraterne
inuidie animus ardebat) cognitis militibus quos preter sugam soluto imperio
lice^tia atque lasciuia corruperat ex copia reru^ sta ^uir sibi nihil agendum.

Interi^ Romae Caius Ma^lius limitanus tribunu^pl. rogationem ad populum
promulgat vti quereretur in eos quoru^ co^silio Iugu^tha senatus decreta
neglexisse: et qui tradid^ssent elephantos e^ perfugas: quique ob eo aut in
legationibus aut imperijs pecunias accepi^ent.

Item qui de pace / aut bello cum hostibus pactiones fecissent.

Huic rogationi partim conscij sibi: alij ex partium inuidia pericula
metuentes: quoniam aparte resistere non poteran^ qui^ illa et alia ralia
placere sibi faterentur occulte per amicos ac maxim per homines nominis latin^
et socios Italicos i^pedimenta parabant.

Sed plebs (i^credibile memoratu est) quamtum intenta fuerit quamtaque vi
rogatio nem iuss^rit: magis odio nobilitatis (cui illa mala parabantur) quam
cura re^publice.

Ta^ta libido in partibus erat. Igitur caeteris perculsis metu Marcus Scaurquem
legatum Bestie supra memorauimus inter leticiam plebis et suoru^ fuga^ trepida
etiam tunc ciuitate quum ex Ma^li^ rogatio^e tres quesitores rogare^tur:
effecerat vti ipse in eo munero crearetur.

Sed questione exercitata aspere viole^terque ex rumore et libidine plebis: vt
saepe nobilitatem: sic ea tempestate plebem ex secundis rebus insole^tia
ceperat.

CEterum mos partiu^ popularium: et se^a tus factionum: ac de inde omnium
malarum artium paucis ante annis Romae ortus est otio atque habundantia earu^
rerumque prima morta^^s ducunt.

Nam ante Carthaginem deletam populus et senatus romanus placide modesteque
inter se rempublicam tractabant. Neque glory certamen neque dominationis inter
ciues erat. Metus hostilis in bonis artibus ciuitatem retinebat.

Sed vbi illa formido a mentibus discessit: scilicet ea que res secunde amant:
lasciuia / atque superbia incessere. Ita (quod in aduersis rebus optauerant)
ocium postquam adepti sunt acerbius / asperius que tulere.

Nam cepere nobilitas dignitate^ in dn^atione^: populus libertate^ in libidinem
vertere: sibi quisque ducere / trahere / r^pere.

Ita omi^a in duas parts abstracta sunt. respublica / quae media fuerat
dilacerata est.

Caeteru^ nobilitas factione mages pollebat plebis.

Vis soluta ac dispersa in multitudine minus poterat.

Paucorum arbitrio belli domique respublica agitabatur: penes eosde^ aerarium /
prouincie / magistratus / glory / triumphi que erant.

Populus militia atque i^opia vrgebatur.

Predas bellicas imperatores cu^ paucis diripieba^t.

Interea pare^tes aut parui liberi militu^ (vti quis que potentiori confinis
erat) sedibus pelleba^tur. Ita cum potentia auaritia sine modo modestraque
inuadere / polluere / et vastare omnia: nihil pe^si ne que sancti habere quo ad
semetipsa^ precipitauit.

Na^ postquam Tiberius et Ca^us Gracchus (quoru^ matores in punico bello atque
alijs multum respubl^cae addidera^t) vendicare plebem in libertate^: et
paucorum scelera patefacere cepere nobilitas noxi a atque eo perculsa modo per
socios ac nome^ latinu^ / interdum per equites romanos (quos spes societatis a
plebe dimouerat) Gracchorum actionibus obuia^ erat: et primo Tiberiu^* deinde
paucos post annos ingredientem eadem Ca^um tribunum al terum triumu^ru^ in
educendis colonijs cu^ Marcho Fuluto Flacco ferro necauerat. Et sane Gracchis
cupidine victory no^ satis moderatus fuit.

Sed bono vinci facius est quam malo more iniuria^ vincere.

Igiturea victoria nobilitas ex libidine sua vsa multos mortalis ferro aut fuga
extinxit: plusque in reliquum sibi timoris quam potentie addidit.

Quae res plerumque magnas civitates pessundedit du^ alteri alteros vincere
quouis modo / et victos acerbius vlcisci volunt. Sed de studijs partium oi^bus
que ciuitatis moribus si singulatim aut pro magnitudine parem disserere: tp^s
quam res maturius me desereret. Quam obrem ad inceptum redeo.

POst Auli fedus / exercitus que nostri fuga^ fedam / Quintus Metellus et
Marcus Sillanus consules designati / prouintias inter se parti uerant.

Metelloque Numidia obuenerat / acri viro: et quamquam aduerso populi partibus
/ fama tamen aequabili et inuiolata.

Is vbi primum magistratu^ ingressus est: alia omnia sibi cum collega coi^a
ratus / ad bellum (quod gesturus erat) ai^m inte^dit.

Igitur diffide^s veteri ex ercitui: milites eligere / scribere / presidia
vndique accersere / a^ma / tela / equos / et caetera instrume^ta militie
parare: ad hoc co^meatum affatim: denique omnia quae in bello vario et multarum
reru^ egenti / vsui esse solent.

Caeterum ad ea patranda senatus authoritate / socij / nome^que latinu^ / et
reges. Postremo oi^s ciuitas summo studio adnitebantur.

Itaque ex sententia om^^^^s rebus paratis compositisque in Numidiam
proficiscitur magna speciuiu^: tum propter artis b^nas: tu^ maxim quod
aduersum diuitias inuictu^ animum gerebat: et auaritia magistratuum ante id
te^pus in Numidia nostre opes contuse: hostiu^que aucte erant. Sed vbi in
Aphricam venit exercitus ei traditur a Spurio Albino proco^sule iners
imbecillis neque periculi neque laboris patiens: lingua quam manu promptior:
predator ex socijs et ipse preda hostium sine imperio and modestia habitus. Ita
imperatori nouo plus e malis maioribus solicitudinis quam ex copia militu^
auxilij aut bonae spei accedebat. Statuit tamen Metellus (quamquam et estiuorum
tp^s comitioru^ mora imminuerat: et expectatione euentus ciuium ai^os intentos
putabati non prius bellum attingere: quam maioru^ disciplina^ milites laborare
coegisset. Nam Albinus Auli fratris exercitusque clade perculsus, postquam
decreuerat non egredi prouintia, quamtum te^poris aestiuoru^ in imperio fuit:
plerumque milites in statutis castris habebat: nisi cum odor^ aut pabuli
eges^^s locum mutare sub egerat. Sed neque more mil^tari vigilie ducebantur:
vti cuique libebat, ab signis aberat. Lixae permixti cum equitibus die noctuque
vagabantur: and palantes ^gros vastare: villas expugnare: pecoris et
mancipiorum predas / certantes agere: eaque mutare cu^ marcatoribus / provino
aduecticio / et alijs talibus.

Praeterea frumentum public datum vendere: panem indies mercari. Postremo
quaecunque dici aut fingi queunt ignauie luxurieque probra in illo exercitu
cuncta fuere: et alia amplius. Sed in ea difficultate Metellu^ non minus quam
in rebus hostilibus magnum et sapiente^ virum fuisse co^perio: tanta
tempera^tia inter ambitionem seuitiamque moderatu^. Na^que edicto primo
adiumenta ignauiae dicit sustulisse ne quisquam i^ castris panem / aut quem*
aliumcibum coctum venderet: ne lixe sequere^tur exercitum: ne miles gregarius
in castris^ neue in agmine seruu^ aut iumen tum haberet.

Caeteris art modum statuisse. Praeterea transuersis itineribus / quotidie
castra mouere: vallo ac fossa munire: vigilias crebras ponere: et eas ipse cum
legatis circu^ire.

Item i^ agmine inprimis modo: modo i^ postremis: saepe in medio adesse: ne
quispiam ordine ^grederetur: vt cum signis freque^tes incederent: miles cibum
et arma portaret.

Ita prohibe^do a delictis magis quam vindicando exercitum breui co^firmauit.

INterea Iugurtha vbi ea quae Metellus agebat ex nu^cijs accepit si mulde
innoce^tia eius certior Rome factus diffidere suis rebus: ac tum deinum veram
deditionem facerere conatus est.

Igitur legatos ad consulem cum supplicijs mittit. Qui tantu^modo ipsi liberis
que vita^ petere^t: alia omnia dederent populo Romano. Sed Metello ta^ antea
experime^tis cognitum erat genus numidarum infidum ing^nio mobili: nouaru rerum
auidum esse. Itaque legatos alium ab alio diuersos aggreditur: ac pau satim
tentando postquam oportunos sibi cognouit: multa pollicendo persua det vt
Iugurtham maxi^e viuum: sin id parum procedat: necatum sibi trade^ent.

Caetera palam ^ quae ex voluntate forent nunciari regi iubet.

Deinde paucis diebus / in tento atque infesto exercitu / in Numidiam procedit.
Vbi contra belli faciem tuguria plena hominum: pecora / cultoresque in agris
erant: ex oppidis et mapalibus profecti regis obuiam procedebant: parati
frumentum dare: co^meatum portare.

Postremo omnia quae imperarentur facere.

Neque Metellus idcircominus sed pariter ac si hosts adessent: munito agmine
i^cedere: late explorare: oi^a illa deditionis sig^a oste^tui esse credere: and
insidijs locum tentare.

Itaque cu^ expeditis cohortibus: Item funditoru^ et sagittarioru^ delecta manu
apud primos erat. Postremo Caius Marius legatus cum equitibus curabat. In vtrum
que latus auxiliarios equites tribunis legionu^ / et prefectis cohortum
dispertiuerat: vt cu^ his velites permixti quocu^que accederent: equitatus
hostiu^ propulsare^t. Nam in Iugurtha ta^tus dolus / tantaque peritia locorum
et militie erat: vt absens^ an presens pacem an bellum gerens pernitrosior
esset: in incerto haberetur. Erat haud long ab eo itinere / quo Metellus
pergebat / opidu^ Numidarum noi^e Vacca forum rerum venaliu^ totius regnitet
maxim celebratu^: vbi et incolere: et mercari res consueuera^t Italici generis
multi mortales. Huic consul simul te^tandi gra et capiundi (si paterent
oportunitates loci) presidium imposuit. Praeterea imperauit frume^ tu^ et alia
quae bello vsui forent / co^portare: ratus (id quod res monebat) freque^tiam
negociatoru^ et co^meatu^ etia^ paratis rebus munimento fore. Inter haec
negotia Iugurtha impensius modo legatos supplices mittere: pacem rogare: preter
suam liberorumque vitam Metello omnia dedere.

Quos ite^ (vt priores) co^sul illectos dimittebat ad proditionem: regi pacem
(quam postulabat) neque abnuere: neque pollicer^: et inter eas moras promissa
legatoru^ ex pectare.

Iugurtha vbi Metelli dicta cum factis composuit: ac se suis artibus tentari
ai^aduertit (Quippe cui pa^ verbis nunciabatur: caeterum rebellum a spertimu^
erat: Vrbs maxima alienata:

Ager hostibus cognitus animi popularium tentati) coactus rerum necessitudine
statuit armis cae^^are.

IGitur explorato itinere hostrum / in spem victoriae adductus ex opportunitate
loci: quam maximas copias potest oim generu^ parat: ac per tramites occultos
exercitum Metelli anteuenit.

Erat in ea Numidie part: qua^ Adherbal in diuisione possederat: flumen oriens
a meridie / nomine Muthul / a quo mons aberat ferme milia pa^^uu^ viginti
tractu part: vastus a natura / et humano cultu alienatus: sed ex eo medio quasi
collis oriebat / in immensum pertingen^ / vestitus oleastro / ac myrthetis /
alijsque arboru^ generibus / que humo arida atque a^enosa gignuntur. Media
autem planicies deserta erat penuria aque / p^ter flumini propinqua loca: ea
consita arbustis / pecore atque cultoribus frequentabantur. Igitur in eo colle
(q^em transuerso itinere portectum docuimus:) Iugurtha extenuata acie suoru^
co^sedit: elephantis et parti copiaru^ pedestriu^ Bomilcharem prefecit: eum
edocet / quae ageret: ipse propior montem cum omni equitatu atque peditibus
delectis suos collocat.

Deinde singulas turmas et manipulos circu^^en^^ monet atque obtestatur^ vti
memores pristine virtu^is e^ victory: sese / re^^ umque ab Romano ru^ ^^a^icia
defendant. Cum ^us certamen fore quos antea victos sub ^ugum miserint. Duce^
illis non animum mutatum. Quae ab imperatore decuerint omnia* suis prouisa
locum superiorem: vti prude^tes cum imperitis / nec pauciores cum pluribus /
aut rudes cum bello melioribus / manum consererent: proinde parti intentique
essent ^ siguo dato Romanos inuadere. Illumd^e^ / aut omnis labores et
victorias confirmaturu^: aut maximarum erumnarum initiu^ fore. Adhoc viritim:
vti que^que ob militare facinus pecunia: aut honor extulerat co^mone facere
beneficij: et eum ipsum alijs ostentare.

Postremo pro cuiusque i^ genio pollicendo: minitando: ostentando: alium alio
modo excitare.

Cum interim Metellus ignarus hostium / monte degrediens cum exercitu
conspicitur: primo dubious / quidnam insolita facies ostenderet (Nam inter
virgulta equi Numideque confederant / neque plane occultati humilitate arborum:
et tamen incertum / quidnam esset / tum natura loci: tum dolo: ipsi atque
militaria signa obscurati) Deinde b^^ui cognitis insidijs paulisper agme^
co^stituit Ibi co^mutatis ordinibus i^ dextro latere quod pro ^^^mum hostibus
erat: triplicibus subsidijs aci^m instruxit: inter manipulos funditores et
sagitta rios dispertit.

equitatu^ omnem in cornibus locat:

ac pauca pro te^pore milites hortatus: aciem sicuti instruxerat: tra^suersis
principijs in planum (...).

Sed vbi Numidas quictos / neque digressos colle animaduertit: ex anni te^pore
veritus / et inopia aquae / ne siti conficeretur exercitus: Rutiliu^ legatum
cu^ expeditis cohortibus / et part equitu^ pre misit ad flumen: vti locu^
castris ante caperet: existimans crebro hosts impetu / et transuersis prelijs
iteru^ / remoraturos: et (quoniam armis diffidere^t) lassitudinem et sitim
militum te^taturos. Deinde ipse pro re atque loco / sicuti monte descenderat /
(...) paulatim procedere / Marium post principia habere: ipse cum equi tibijs
sinistrae alae esse / qui in agmine princeps facti erant.

AT Iugurtha vbi ex tremu^ agmen Metelli primos suos praetergressum videt: prae
sidio quasi duu^ miliu^ peditum montem occupat: quo Metellus descenderat: ne
forte cedentibus aduersarijs receptui: ac post munimento foret. Deinde repent
/ signo dato hosts inuadit. Numidae alij postremos caedere pars a sinistra ac
dextra tentare: infe^si adesse: instare atque omnibus locis romanorum ordines
conturbare. Quorum etiam qui firmioribus animis obuij hostibus fuerant*
ludificati incerto praelio: ipsi modo eminus sauciaba^tur: neque contra
feriendi aut con^erendi manum copia erat.

Ante iam docti ab Iugurtha equites: vbi romano ru^ turmae insequi coeperant /
non confertim neque in vnum se recipiebant: sed alius alio quam maxim diuersi.
Ita numero priores si a persequendo hosts deterrere nequiuera^t: disiectos a
tergo aut a lateribus circunueniebant. Sin oportunior fugae collis / quam ca^pi
fuerat: Ea vero loca consueti numidarum equi facile i^ter virguita euadere:
Nostros asperitas et insolentia loci retinebat.

Caeterum facies totius negoci^ varia: incerta: feda atque miserabilis:

diuersi a suis pars read-

re: alij insequi: neque signa neque ordines obseruare:

Vbi quemque periculu^ ceperat: ibi resistere ac propulsare.

Arma / tela / equi / viri / hosts / atque ciues permixti: nihil co^silio aut
imperio ag^: sors omnia regere^

Itaque multum diei processerat: cu^ etiam tu^ even tus in incerto erat.

Denique omnibus labor et estu languidis / Metellus vbi videt Numidas minus
instare: paulatim milites in vnum co^ducit: ordines restituit: et cohortes
legionarias quatuor aduersus pedites hostium collocat.

Eorum magna pars locis superioribus sessa consederat simul orare: hortari
milites ne deficerent*

Neu patere^tur hoste^ fugientes vincere:

neque illis castra esse: ne que munimentum vllum / quo cedentes tenderent: in
armis omnia sita.

Sed nec Iugurtha quide^ interea quietus erat: circu^ire / hortari / renouare /
prelium: et ipse cum delectis oi^a subuenire suis: hostibus instare dubijs:
quos firmos cognouerat: eminus pugnando retinere.

Eo modo inter se duo imperatores su^mi viri certabant: ipsi pares: caeterum
opibus disparibus.

Nam Metello virtus militu^ erat et locus aduersus. Iugurthae alia oi^a p^ter
milites opportuna. Deinde romani vbi intelligunt neque sibi profugium esse:
neque ab host copiam pugnandi fieri: etiam diei vesper erat: aduerso colle
(sicuti praeceptum fuerat) euadunt.

Amisso loco / Numidae fusi fugatique pauci interiere. Plerosque velocitas / et
regio hostibus ignara tutata sunt.

INterea bomilchar / que^ eliphantis et parti cop^aru^ pedestrium prefectum a
Iugurtha / supra diximus: vbi eum Rutilius pretergressus est: paulatim suos in
equum locum deducit: ac dum legatus ad flumen / quo premissus erat / festina^s
pergit quie^tus (vti res postu^abat) aciem instruxit: neque remittit explorare
quid vbique hostis ageret.

Postquam Rutilium consedisie ^am et ai^o vacuu^ esse accepit: simulque
Iugurthae ex prelio clamorem augeri: veritus ne legatus cognita re labora^tibus
suis auxilio foret: aciem, quam diffidens virtuti militum arcte statuerat, quo
hostium itineri officeret, latius porrigit.

Eoque modo ad Rutilij castra procedit. Romani ex i^prouiso pulueris vim magnam
ai^aduertunt. Nam prospectu^ ager arbustis co^situs prohibebat.

Et primo humu^ rati sunt aridam vento agitari. Post vbi aequabilem manner:
s^cuti acies mouebatur: magis magis que appropinquare videbant cognita re /
properantes arma capiu^t: ac pro castris (sicuti imperatur) consistunt.

Deinde vbi propius ventum est / vtrimque magno clamore concurritur. Numidae
tantu^modo su^t remorati / du^ in eliphantis auxilium puta^t: postquam eos
impeditos ramis arborum atque ita dis^ectos circu^ueniri vident: fugam faciunt:
ac plerique abiectis armis collis aut noctis (quae iam aderat) auxilio i^tegri
abeunt. elephanti quatuor capti: reliqui oe^s numero quadraginta interfecti
sunt.

At romani quam quam itinere atque opere castroru^ et praelio fe^si lassique
erant: tn^que Metellus amplius opinione morabatur instructi / intentique obuiam
procedunt.

Nam dolus Numidarum nihil languidi neque remissi patiebatur.

Ac primo obscura nocte / postquam haud procul inter se erant strepitu velut
hosts aduentare: alteri apud alteros formidinem ^imul et tumulum facere: et
pene imprudentia admissum facinus miserabile foret: ni vtrimque proemissi
equites rem explorauissent.

Igitur pro metu repent gaudium exhortum est.

Milites alius alium laeti appeliant: acta edocent: atque audiunt: sua quisque
fortia facta ad celum ef^ert.

Quippe humane res ita se habent: in victoria etiam ignauis gloriari licet:
adverse res etiam detractant bonos.

Metellus inijsde^ castris quatriduo moratus: saucios cum cura reficit: me
ritos in prelijs more militiae donat: vniuersos in contione laudat: atque agit
gratias:

hortatur / ad caetera quae leuia sunt / parem animu^ gerant:

Pro victoria satis ia^ pugnatum: reliquos labores praedae fore.

Tum interim tra^sfugant et alios oportunos vbi Iugurtha gentium: aut quid
ageret: cum pauci^ ne esser: an exercitum haberet: vt sese victus gereret:
exploratum misit.

At ille sese in loca saltuosa et munita natura receperat: ibique cogebat
exercitum numero hominum ampliorem: sed hebe^em i^firmumque: agri ac pecoris
magis quam belli cultorem.

Id ea gratia eueniebat: quod praeter regios equites n^mo omniu^ Numidaru^ ex
fuga regem sequebat. Quo cu^usque animus fert eo descedunt: neque id fla^^tium
militiae ducit: ita se mores habent.

IGitur Metellus vbi videt regis etia^ tum animum ferocem esse bellum renouari:
quod nisi ex illius libidine ge^i no^ posset:

Praeterea iniquum certa men sibi cu^ hostibus: minore detrimento illos vi^ci
quam vincere: statuit non praelijs neque in ac^e / sed alio modo bel^um esse
gerendum.

Itaque in loca Numidiae opulentissima pergit: agros vastat: castella multa et
oppida temere munita aut sine presidio capit: incenditque.

Puberes interficit: iube^ oi^a alia (...) esse.

Ea formidine multi mortales romany dediti: obsides / frume^tu^ / et alia que
vsu^ rore^t: affatim prebita sunt: vbicu^que res postulabat / presidiu^
impositu^. Que negotia multo magis quam praeliu^ male pugnatum ab suis / regem
^errebant.

Quippe cui spes oi^s i^ fuga sita erat: sequ^ cogebatur: et qui sua loca
defendere nequiuerat: in a lienis ^ellum gerere: tamen ex inop^a / quod optimum
videbatur consiliu^ / capit:

exercitum plerumque in ijsdem locis operiri iubet.

Ipse cum delectis equitibus Metellum sequitur noc^u^nis auijsque itineribus
ignoratus roma nos palantes repent aggreditur. Plerique inermes cadunt: multi
capiu^tur. Nemo omniu^ i^tactus profugit. Numidae priusquam subueniretur
(sicuti i^^^i erant) in proximos colles discedunt.

INterim Rome gaudiu^ ingen^ ortum est cognitis Metelli rebus vt se /
exercitumque more maiorum gereret.

quam quam inaduerso loco tn^ victor fuisse virtute hostiu^ agro potiretur.

Iugurtham magnificum ex Auli secordia quod spem salutis insolitudine aut fuga
coegessit habere.

Itaque senatus ob ea feliciter acta / dijs immorta libus supplicia decernere.
Ciuitas a^rea trepida et solicita de belli euentu laeta agere.

Fama de Metello preclara esse. Igitur eo intentior Metellus ad victoriam niti
omnibus modis: festinare: cauere: tn^ necubi hosti oportunus fieret.

Meminisse post gloriam inuidiam sequi: ita quo clarior eo magis anxius erat:
neque post insidias Iugurthae effuso exercitu praedari.

Sed vbi frumento aut pabulo opus erat: cohortes cum omni equitatu praesidium
agebant.

Exercitus parte^ ipse: reliquos Marius ducebat: sed igne magis quam praeda
ager vastabatur.

Duobus locis haud long iter se castra facieba^t. Vbi vi opus erat: cuncti
aderant: caeteru^ quo ^uga atque formido latius cre^^eret: diuisi agebant.

Eo te^pore Iugurtha per colles sequi: tp^s aut locum pugnae quaerere: qua
venturum hostem audierat / pabulum aut aquaru^ fontes (quorum penuria erat)
corrumpere.

modo se Metello: i^terdu^ Mario ostendere: postremo in agmine te^tare: a^
statim in colles regredi.

Rursus alijs post alijs minitari: neque prelium facere: neque ocium
pati^tantummodo hostem ab incepto retinere.

ROmanus sperator / vbi se dolis fatigari vide^: neque ab host copiam pug^andi
fieri: vrbem magnam et i^ ea part qua sita erat ^ artem regni nomine Zama^
statuit oppugnare: ratus (id quod negotium postu labat) Iugurtham laborantibus
suis auxilio venruru^: ibi que preliu^ fore. At ille / que parabantur ^doctus a
perfugis magnis itineribus Metellum ^nteuenit:

oppidanos hortatus / more nia defenda^t: add^^is auxilio perfugis / quod genus
ex copijs regis (quia fallere nequibat) fortissimum erat.

Praeterea pollicetur in te^pore semet cum exercitu affore.

Ita co^positis rebus / in loca quam maxim occulta descendit: ac post paulo
cognoscit ex itinere Marium frume^^atum cu^ paucis cohortibus Sicca^ missu^ /
quod oppidum primu^ omnium post malam pugnam ab rege defecerat. ^o cum delectis
^quitibus pergit noctu: et egredien tibus Romany / in porta pugnam facit.
Simul magna voce Siccenses hortatur vti cohortes a tergo circumueniant:
fortunam illis praeclari facinoris casu^ dare: si id fecerint: postea sese in
regno: illos in liberate sine metu aetate^ acturos.

At ni Marius signa infer ^atque euadere oppido propetauisset: profecto
cuncti (aut magna pars) Siccensium fidem mutanissent. Tanta mobilita te sese
Numidae ge^unt. Sed milites Iugurthini / paulisper a rege sustentati / postquam
maiore vi hosts vrge^t / paucis amissis / profugi discedunt.

Marius ad Zammam peruenit.

Id oppidum in campo situm / magis opere quam natura munitum erat* nullius rei
idoneae egens: armis viris que opulentum.

Igitur Metellus / pro tempore atque loco paratis rebus ^ cuncta menia exercitu
circu^uenit. Legatis imperat vbi quisque curaret.

Denique signo dato / vndique simul clamor ingens oritur: neque ea res Numidas
terret: infensi / intentique sine tumultu manent: praelium incipitur.

Romani pro i^genio quis que: pars eminus glande aut lapidibus pugnare: alij
inuadere: ac muruni suffodere modo scalis aggredi: cupere praeliu^ manibus
facere.

Co^tra ea oppidani in pro ximos saxa voluere: sudes / pila / praeterea pice et
sulphur tedam mixtam ardenti mittere.

Sed nec illos qui procul manserant timor animi satis munierat. Na^ plerosque
iacula tormentis aut manibus emissa vulnerabant. Parique periculo: sed ^ama
impari: boni atque ignaui erant.

DVm apud zammam sic certatur: Iugurtha ex inprouiso castra hostium cum magna
manu inuadit (remissis qui in praesidio erant) et (omnia magisquam prelium
expectantibus) portam it rumpit.

At nostri repentino motu perculsi: sibi quisque pro moribus consulunt: a^ij
fugere: alij arma cap^re: magna pars vulnerati aut occisi sunt.

Caeterum ex omni multitudine non amplius qua draginta memores nominis romani:
grege facto locum coepere paulo quam alij editiorem ne que inde maxima vi
depelli quine runt:

Sed tela eminus missa remittere: pauci in pluribus frustrari.

Sin Numidae propius accessissent: ibi vero virtutem ostendere: et eos maxima
vicedere: fundereatque fugare.

Interim Metellus cum ace^rime rem gereret clamorem a tergo ^^ecepit. Deinde
conuerso equo / animaduertit fugam ad seversum fieri: quae res indicabat
populares esse. Igitur equitatum omne^ ad castra propere misit* ac statim Caium
Marium cum cohortibus socioru^ eumque lachrimans per amicitia^* perque rem
publicam obsecrat: ne quam contumelia^ remanete in exercitu victore: neue
hosts inultos abire sinat.

Ille breui ma^data efficit. At Iugurtha munimento castrorum impeditus cum alij
super vallu^ praecipitarentur: alij in angustijs ipsi sibi properantes
officerent: multis amissis in loca munita sese recipit.

Metellus / infecto negocio / postquam nox aderat / i^ castra cum exercitu
reuertitur. Igitur postero die priusquam ad oppugnandum egrederetur: equitatum
omne^ in ea part / qua regis adue^tus erat: pro cas^^^s agitare ^ubet: portas
et proxima loca tribunis dispertit: deinde ipse pergit ad oppidum atque vti
superiore die muru^ aggreditur. Interim Iugurtha ex occulto repent nostros
inuadit: et qui in proximo locati erant paulisper territi / pertur bantur /
tamen reliqui cito subueniunt. Neque diutius Numidae resistere quiuissent: ni
pedites cum equitibus permixti magnam cladem in congressu facerent: quibus illi
^reti / non (vti inequestri fieri praelio solet) sequi: deinde vero cedere: sed
aduersis equis co^currere: implicare: ac perturbare aciem.

Ita cum expeditis peditibus suis hosts pene victos dare.

^Odem tempore apud (...) Zammam magna (...) cer^abatur. Vbi quis (...) legatus
aut tribunus (...): ibi acer^ime (...) alius spe^ in alio (...) quam in se
habere.

Pariter oppid any agere oppugnare: aut parate omnibus locis: auidius alteri
alteros sauciare / qua^ semet tegere.

Clamor permixtus hortatione: leticia gemitu: ite^ strepitus armoru^ ad caelum
ferri: tela vtrinque volare.

Sed illi, qui menia defensaba^t: vbi hosts paululum modo pugnam remiserant:
inten^i praelium equestre prospectabant. Eos (vt quaeque res lugurthae erant)
letos modo: pauidos modo aiaduerteres: ac sicuti audiri a suis aut cerni
possent: admonere alij: hortari alij aut manu significare: aut niti corporibus:
et huc et illuc quasi vitabundi: aut iacie^tes tela agitare.

Quod vbi Mario cognitum erat (na^ is in ea part curabat) co^sulto leuius
agere: ac diffidentiam rei simulare: pati numidas sine tumultu prae^^u^ regis
visere.

Ita illis studio suoru^ astrictis repent magna vimurum aggreditur: et ia^
scalis aggre^^^ milites / peope summa ceperant: cum oppidani co^curru^t:
lapides / ignem / alia praeterea tela ingerunt. Nostri primo resistere de inde
vbi vne ac altere sealae i^minutae sunt: qui superstiterant ^ afflicti sunt.
Caeteri quoquo modo potuere: pauci integri: magna pars confecti vulneribus
abeu^t Dei^de vtrinque ^lium nox diremit.

MEtellus vbi videt frustra inceptu^: neque oppidum capi: neque Iugurtham
nitinisi ex insidijs / aut suo loco pugnam facere: etiam estatem exa^tam esse
ab Zamma discessit: et in hijs vrb^bus quae ad se de iccerant: satisque munite
l^co aut menibus erant: praesidia imponit.

Ceterum exercitum in prouintia / quae proxima est Numidae hyemandi gratia
collocat.

Neque id tempus ex aliorum more quieti au^ luxury concedit.

Sed quoniam armis bellum parum procedebat: insidias regi per amicos te^dere:
et ^orum persidia pro armis vti parat. Igitur Bomilcharem qu^ Romae cum
Iugurtha fuerat et inde vadibus datis clam Massi^ae n^cis iudiciu^ fugerat:
quod ei per maxima^ amicitia^ proxi^a copia fallendi erat: multis
policitatio^ibus aggredit ac primo efficit vti ad se coloque^di gratia occulte
veniat: deinde fide data si Iugurtham vi^u^ aut necatum sibi tradidisse^: fore
vt illi senatus impunitatem et sua oi^a co^cederet: facile Numidae persuadet:
tu^ ingenio rufido tu^ metuenti ne si pax cu^ romany fieret: ipse per
co^ditiones ad supplicium traderetur

Is vbi primum opportunum fuit Iugurtham anxium ac miserantem fortunas suas
accedit.

Monet atque lachrimans obtestatur vti aliquando sibi / liberisque et ge^ti
Numida^um optime merit prouideat: oi^bus praelijs sese victos: agru^ vastatu^
multos mortalis captos aut accisos: regni open co^minutas esse: satis sepe ia^
virtutem militu^ et fortunam tentatam: caveat ne illo cuncta^te Numidae sibi
consulant.

His atque alijs talibus ad deditionem regis animu^ impellit: mittuntur ad
i^peratorem legati: qui Iugurtham imperata facturum dicerent: ac sine vlla
pactione sese / regnumque suum in illius fidem tradere.

Metellus cunctos senatorij ordinis exhibernis propere accersi ^ubet: eorum
atque aliorum quos idoneos ducebat: consilium habet.

Ita more maiorum co^silij decreto per legatos Iugurthae imperat argenti pondo
ducentamilia / elephantos omnes / equoru^ et armorum aliqua^tulu^.

Quae postquam sine mora facta su^t: iubet omnes perfuga^ vinctos adduci. Eoru^
magna pars vti iussum erat adducti.

Pauci quum primu^ deditio cepit: ad regem Bocchum i^ mauritania^ abierant.
Igitur Iugurtha vbi armis / virisque et pecunia spoliatus est: cum ipse ad
imperandum Tisi diu^ vocaretur rursus cepit flectere ai^m: et ex mala
conscientia digna timere.

Denique multis diebus per dubitationem consumptis: quum modo taedio rerum
aduersarum oi^a bello potiora duceret: interdum secu^ ipse reputaret quam
grauis casus inseruitium ex regno foret multis magnisque praesidijs ne quicquam
perditis de integro bellum sumit.

Et Romae senatus de prouincijs co^sultus: Numidia^ Metello decreuerat.

PEr idem tempus Vtice sort Caro Mario per hostias dija supplicanti magna
atque mirabilia porte^di haruspex dixerat.

Proinde quae animo agitabat fretus dijs ageret.

quam sepissime fortunam ex periretur: et omnia prospere euentura.

At illum iam antea consulatus inge^s cupido exagitabat: ad quem capie^ dum
preter vetustare^ family oi^a abunde erant: industria / probitas / militie
magna scientia / animus belli ingens / domi modicus: libidinis: et diuitiatum
victor: tantum modo glory auidus.

Sed is natu et per omne^ pueritiam Arpin^ alitu^ vbi p^imum etas militie
patiens fuit stipe^dijs faciundis: non greca facundia: neque vrbanis munditi ^s
sese exercuit: ita inter artis bonas integrum in genium breui adoleuit.

Ergo vbi primum tribunatum militare^ a populo petit plerisque faciem eius
ignorantibus facile notus per omni^ tribus declaratur.

Deinde ab eo magistratu alium post alium sibi pep^tit: semperque in
potestatibus eo modo agitabat: vt ampliore honor quam ge^ebat dignus haberetur.

Tamen is ad id locorum talis vi^ consulatum pe^ere non aude bar.

Nam postea ambitio^e p^ceps datus est.

Et iam tum alios magistratus plebs: consulatu^ nobilitas per manus inter se
tradebat* Nouus nemo tam praeclarus: neque tam egregijs factis erat: quin is
indignus illo honor haberetur.

Igitur vbi Marius har^* spicis dicta eode^ quo cupido animi hortabat intendere
videt ab Metello consulatum petendi gratia missionem rogat. Cui quam quam
virtus / gloria atque alia optanda boni^ superabant: tamen inerat co^tem^tor
animus et superbia c^e nobilitatis malum.

Itaque primum co^motu^ insolita re / mirari eius consilium: et quasi pera
micitiam mouere: ne tam praua inciperet: neu supra

fortunam ai^m gereret. non ominia omnibus cupie^da esse: debere ille res suas
satis placere.

Postre^o caueret id petere a po. roma^o quod illi iure negaretur.

Postquam haec atque alia talia dixit: neque animus Marij flectitur: respo^dit
vbi primum potuis^e^ per negotia publica facturum sese quae peteret.

Ac postea sepe eadem postulanti fertur dixisse: ne festinaret abire: satis
mature illum cum filio consulatum petiturum.

Is eodem tempore in co^tubernio patris ibidem militabat a^nos natus circiter
viginti.

Quae res Marium tu^ pro honor quem affectabat: ^um pro licentia redeundi quem
ab eo impetrare nequibat: contra Metellum vehementer acce^derat. Ita cupidine
atque ita pessimis consultoribus gra ^ari: neque facto vllo neque dicto
abstinere: quod modo ambiciosum foret.

Milites quibus in hibernis praecrat laxiore imperio quam ante habere.

apud negociatores quorum magna multitudo Vticae erat: criminose et simul
magnifice de bello loqui d^m dia pars exercitus si sibi permitteretur: paucis
diebus Iugurtham in cathenis habiturum: ab imperatore co^sulto bellum trahi:
quod homo inanis et regie superbie imperio nimis gauderet:

Quae omnia illis eo firmiora videbantur: quia diuturnitate belli res
familiares corruperat: et animo cup^enti nihil satis festinatur.

Erat preterea in exercitu nostro numida quidam nomine Gauda Manasta balis
filius: Massinisse nepos: quem Micipsa testamento secundum herede^ scripserat:
morbis consectus et ob ea^ causam me^te paululu^ imminuta. Cui Metellus pete^ti
more regum vt sellam iuxta ponere: item postea custody causa turma^ equitum
romanorum: vtrum que negauerat: honorem quod eoru^ modo foret quos populus
romanus reges appellauisset: presidium quod co^tumeliosu^ foret: si equites
romani satelliti numidae traderentur.

Hunc Marius anxiu^ aggreditur: atque hortatur vt contumeliarum imperatoris cu^
suo auxilio penas petat: hominem ob morbos animo paru^ valido secunda oratione
ex tollit: illum regem ingentem virum Massinissae ne potem esse: si Iugurtha
captus aut occisus foret imperium Numidiae sine mora habiturum.

id adeo mature posse euenire: si ipse consul ad id bellum missus foret.

Itaque et illum / et equites romanos: milites et negotiatores alios ipse*
plerosque pacis spe impellit vti romam ad suos necessarios aspere i^ Metellum
de bello scribant*

Marium imperatore^ posca^t sic illi a multis mortalibus honestissima
suffragatione consulatus petebatur. Simul ea tempestate plebs nobilitate susa
per lege^ manliam no^os extollebat.

Ira Mario cuncta procedere.

INterim Iugurtha post q^ omissa deditione bellum incipit: cu^ magna cura
parate omnia festinare: exercitum cogere: c^uitates quae a se def^cer^t
formidi^e: aut oste^tando praemia affectare: co^munire suos locos: arma

^^la: aliaque quae spe pac^^^m serat reficere aut co^m^^cari: seruitia
ro^arorum allicere: et eosipsos qui i^ praesidijs era^t p^c^nia tentare:
prorsus i^tactum nihil neque quietum pati: cuncta agitare.

Igitur Vacce^ses (quo Met^llus in initio Iugurtha pacificante presidium
i^posuerat) fatigati regis supplicijs: neque antea sua voluntate alienati
principes ciuitatis i^ter se co^iurant.

Nam vulgus vti pleru^que solet et maxim Numidarum ingenio mobili seditiosum
atque discordiosum erat cupidu^ nouarum rerum quieti et otio aduersum. Deinde
co^positis inter se rebus in die^ tercium constituunt quod is festus celebratus
que per omnem Aphricam: ludu^ et lasciuiam magis quam formidinem oste^debat.
Sed vbi tempus fuit centuri ones tribunosque militares et ipsum praefectu^
oppidi. Titum Turpilium Sillanum alius alium in domos suas inuitant:

eos oi^s praeter Turpiliu^ inter epulas obtru^cant.

Postea milites palantes: inermes quippe i^ tali die ac sine imperio
aggrediuntur.

Ide^ plebs facit pars edocti a nobilitate: alij studio talium rerum incitati.

Quis act^ consiliumque ignoratibus tumultus ipse et res nouae ^atis p^ace
(...) Romani milites i^proui^o metu incerti ig^^atique quid potissimu^ facerent
trepidare. Ad arcem oppidi vbi signa et scuta erant praesidium hostium: portae
ante clausae ^ugam prohibeba^t ad hoc mulieres puerique protectis aedificiorum
saxa et alia quae locus praebebat certati^ anceps malu^ neque a sortissimis i^
firmissimo generi resisti posse: iuxta boni malique strenui et i^becilles multi
obtru^cati sunt. In ea tanta asperitate saeuissimis numidis et oppido vndique
clauso. Turpilius praefectus vnus ex oi^bus Itali cis profugit intactus. Id
misericordia ne hospitis an pactio^e an casu ita euenerit parum co^perimus nisi
quia quod illi in tanto malo turpis vita integra fama po^ior fuit improbus
instabili^que videtur.

MEtellus postquam de rebus Vaccae actis co^perit paulisper moestuse conspectu
abijt.

Deinde vbi ira et aegritu do permista sunt cum maxima cura vltu^ ire iniurias
festinat.

Legionem cum qua hyemabat et quam plurimos po^t numidas equites pariter cum
occasu solis expeditos educit.

Et postera die circiter horam tertiam peruenit in qua^dam planiciem locis
paulo superioribus circu^uentam. Ibi milites fessos itineris magnitudine etiam
abnue^tes oi^a docet: oppidum Vaccam non amplius mill passuum abesse decere
reliquu^ laborem aequo ai^o pati: dum pro ciuibus fuis viris fortissimis atque
miserrimis poenas caperent: praeterea praeda^ benign oste^tat sic animis eorum
arrectis equites i^ primo latere: pedites quam arctissime ire et signa
occultare iubet.

Vaccenses vbi ai^aduertere ad se versum exercitu^ pergere: pri^o (vti res
erat) Metellum esse rati: portas clausere. Deinde vbi neque agros vastari: et
eos qui primi adera^t Numidas equites vident: rursum Iugurtha^ arbitrati cum
magno gaudio: obuij procedunt.

Equites et pedites repe^te signo dato alij vulgu^ effusum oppido caedere alij
ad portas festinare: pars turres capere.

Ira atque praede spes amplius quam laditudo posse.

Ita Vaccenses biduu^ modo ex perfidia laetati.

Ciuitas magna et opule^ta cuncta poene atque praedae fuit.

Turpilius quem prefectu^ oppidi vnu^ ex oi^bus profugisse supra ostendimus
iussus a Metello causam d^cere: postquam se parum expurgat: conde^natus
verberatusque poenas capite soluit.

Nam is ciuis ex latio erat.

PEr idem te^pus Bomilchar: cuius ipulsu Iugurtha deditionem quam metu deseruit
inceperat: suspectus regi et ipse eum suspicans: no^as res cupere ad pernicie^
eius dolum quaerere: diu noctuque fatigare ai^m: denique oi^a tentanto socium
sibi adiungit Nabdalsa^ hominem nobilem magnis opibus clarum acceptu^que
popularibus suis.

Is pleru^que seorsum ab rege exercitum ductare: et oe^s res exequi solitus
erat: quae Iugurthae fesso aut maioribus astricto superant: ex quo illi gloria
opesque inuente.

Igitur vtriusque consili^ dies insidijs statuitur.

Caetera vti res posceret pro tempore parari placuit. Nabdalsa ad exercitum
pro^ectus est quem inter hiberna romanoru^ iussus haberet ne ager in vltis
hostibus vastaret.

Is postquam magnitudine facinoris perculsus ad tps non venit metusque res
impediebat. Bom^^char simul cupidus incoepta patrandi: et timore socij anxius:
ne omisso vetere co^silio nouum quaereret literas ad eum per homines fideles
mittit i^ quis mollicie^ secordiamque viri accusare: e^ testari deos per quos
iurasset monere ne praemia Metelli in pesto^ conuerteret: Iugurthae exitum
adesse: caeterum sua ne an Metel^i virtute periret: id modo agitari.

Proinde reputaret animo suo praemia an cruciatum mallet:

sed cum literae allatae fuere: sort Nabdalsa exercitato corpore fessus in
lecto quiescebat. Vbi cognitis Bomilcharis verbis pri^o cura: deinde vti aegrum
animum solet: so^nus coepit.

Erat ei numida quidam negotioru^ curator fidus acceptusque et oi^m consilioru^
nisi nouissimi particeps. Qui postquam allatas literas audiuit et ex
consuetudine ratus opera aut ingenio suo opus esse: tabernaculu^ introiuit.
Dormiente illo eplam super caput in puluino temere positam sumit ac perlegit
Deinde propere cognitis insidijs ad regem pergit Nabdalsa post paulo exprectus
vbi neque eplam repperit et rem oe^m vti acta erat ex persugis cognouit: primo
indicem persequi conatus est post quam id frustra suit: Iugurtham placandi
gratia accedit: dicit quae ipse facere parauisset perfidia clie^tis sui
praeuenta: lacrimans obtestatur per amicitia^ perque sua ante fideliter acta ne
super tali scelere suspectum se haberet.

Adea rex aliter quam animo gerebat placide respo^dit Bomilchare interfecto /
alijsque multis / quos socios insidiarum cognouit / iram oppresserat: ne qua
seditio aut bellum ex eo negotio oriretur.

Neque post id / Iugurthae dies aut nox vlla quieta fuit: neque loco / neque
mortali cuiquam / aut tempori satis credere. Ciues hosts que iuxta metuere
circu^spectare oi^a / et omnistrepitu pauescere: a^o atque alio loco saepe
co^tra decus reg^u^ noctu requiescere:

interdum somno exitus arreptis armis / tumultu^ facere: ita formidi^e qua si
vecordia agitare.

IGitur Metellus vbi de casu Bomilcharis / et inditio patefacto ex perfugis
cognouit rurfus ta^quamad integru^ bellum cuncta parat festinatque Marium
fatigantem de profectione simul et inuisum et offensum sibi paru^ ido neu^
ratus: domu^ dimitti^* Haec Romae plebs / literis quae de Metello et Mario
missae erant / cognitis / volenti animo de ambobus acceperat* imperatori
nobilitas, quae antea decori fuit inuidie esse. At illi alteri gen^is hu^ilitas
fauorem addiderat.

Caeterum in vtroque magis studia partium quam mala aut bona sua moderata sunt.

Praeterea seditio si magistratus vulgum exagitate. Metellu^ omnibus
concionibus capti^ atcessere. Ma^ij virtutem in ma^^ celeb^a^e.

Denique plebs s^e est accensa vti opifices* aggrestesque omnes: quorum res
fidesque in manibus site erant rel^ctis operis frequentarent Mariu^: et vt sua
necessaria post illius honorem ducerent.

Ita perculsa nobilitate post multas tempestates nouo homini consulatus
mandaret.

Et postea populus a Tribuno plebis Lucio Manlio mancino rogatus / que^ vellet
cum Iugurtha bellum gerere: freque^s Ma^^um ^ussit. Sed senatus paulo ante
Metello Numidiam prouinciam decreuerat ea res frustra erat.

EOdem te^pore Iugurtha amissis amices (quorum plerosque ipse necauerat:
caeteri ^ormidie: pars ad romanos: alij ad regem Bocchum profugerant) quum
neque bellum geri sine ministris posset: et nouorum fidem in tanta perfidia
veterum experiri periculosum duceret: varius incertusque agitabatur: neque illi
res: neque consilium / aut quis qua^ hominum satis placebat: itinera /
profectus que indies mutare: modo aduersus hosts: interdum solitudines
pergere: sepe in fuga / ac paulo post in armis spem habere: dubitare / virtuti
an fidei popularin^ minus crederet. Ita quocunque inte^derat res adverse erant.

Sed inter eas moras repent sese Metellus cum exercitu ostendit. Numidae ab
Iugurtha pro tempore parati / instructique sunt. Deinde praelium incipitur: qua
in part reae pugnae affuit: ibi aliquan (...) certatum est. Caeteri eius oe^s
milites pri^o congressu pulsi fuga^ique sunt. Romam signo^^ / et ^^moru^ / et
aliquanto numero hostium paucoru^ potiti ^unt. Nam form numidas in oibus
praelijs magis pedes / quam arma tu^ati sunt. ^a fuga Iugurtha impe^sius modo
rebus suis d^ffide^s / cu^ perfugis et part equitatus in solitudines: deinde
Thalam puenit: id oppidu^ magnu^ atque opulentum: ibi plerique thesauri
filiorumque eius multus pueritiae cultus erat. Quae postquam Metello* comperta
sunt / quam quam inter Thalam flumenque proximu^ in spatio miliu^ qui quaginta
loca arida atque vast^ esse cognouerat: tn^ spe patrandi belli / si eius oppidi
potitus foret: oi^s asperitates superuadere / ac naturam etiam vince ^e
aggreditur. Igitur oi^a iumenta sarcinis leuari iubet: nisi frumento dierum
dece^. Caeterum vtres modo et alia vasa aquae idon^a portari. Praeterea
co^quirit ex agris quam plurimum potest domiti pecoris: eoque imponit vasa
cuiusque modi: sed pleraque lignea collecta ex tugurijs numidarum. Ad hoc
finitimis imperat: qui se post regis fugam Metello dedidera^t: quam plurimu^ vt
quisque aquae portaret. Diem locumque vb^ praesto fueri^t praedicit. Ipse
flumine: quam proxima^ oppido aquam esse supra diximus: iumenta onerat. Eo mo^
instructus ad Thalam proficicitur. Deinde vbi ad id loci ventum est / quo
numidas praeceperat et castra posita / munitaque ^unt: ta^ta repent celo missa
vis aquae dicitur vt ea modo exercitui: satis superque foret.

Praeterea co^meatus spe amplior: quia numidae (sicuti plerique faciunt) i^
noua deditione officia inte^derant:

Caeterum milites pro religione pluuia magis vsi. Eaque res multum animis eorum
addidit.

Nam rati sunt sese dijs immortalibus curae esse.

Deinde postero die co^tra opinionem Iugurthae / ad Thalam pue^unt. Oppidani /
qui se locorn^ asperitate munitos credidera^t / magna atque insolita re
perculsi: nihilo segnius bellum parare: idem nr^i facere.

Sed rex nihil iam infectu^ Metello credens / quippe qui omnia tela: et arma:
locos: tempora: denique naturam ipsa^ / caeteris imperitante^ industria
viceraticum liberis et magna part pecuniae ex oppido noctu profugit. Neque
postea vllo in loco amplius vna die aut vna nocte moratus simulabat se negotij
gratia properare. Caeterum proditionem timebat / quam vitare posse celeritate
putabat. Nam talia consilia solent per otium ex opportunitat^ capi.

At Metellus vbi oppidarios prael^o inte^tos / simul oppidum et operibus et
loco munitum videt: vallo follaque moenia circumuenit.

Deinde ^ubet duobus locis ex copia maxim ido nei^ vineas agere super^ eas
aggerem ^acere: et super aggere^ impositis turrib^ opus et administros ^utari.

Contra haec oppidani festinare: parare: prorsus ab vtrisque nihil reliquum
fieri: denique romani multo ante la^ore praelijsque fatigat^ post dies quadra
ginta q^ eo ventu^ erat: oppido modo potiti. Praeda omnis a perfugis corrupta
est.

Hi postquam muru^ arietibus f^riri: resque suas afflictas vident: aurum a^que
argentu^ et alia quae prima dicuntur domu^ regiam co^porta^t: ibique vino et
epulis grauati / illaque et domum: et semet igni corru^ punt:

Et quas victi ab hostibus poenas metuerant eas ip^i volentes pendere.

SEd pariter cum capta Thala / legati ex oppido Lepti ad Metellu^ venera^t:
ora^tes / vti praesidium praefectumque eo mit teret:

Amilcharem que^dam hominem nobilem / factiosu^ nouis rebus studere aduersum
quem neque imperia magistratu^ / neque leges valerent: ni id festinare in summo
periculo suam salute^ et illorum socios fore:

Na^ leptitani iam inde a pricipio belli lugurthini ad Bestiam consulem: et
postea romam milera^t amicitia^ societate^que rogatu^. Dei^de vbi ea impetrata
fuere semper boni fidelesque man^ere: er cu^cta a Bestia Albino Metelloque
imperata / gnauiter fecera^t. Itaque ab imperatore facile quae petebant adepti
sunt. Emissae sunt eo cohortes. Ligurum.iiij. et Caius Annius praefectus.

Id oppidu^ a sydonijs co^ditum est / quos accepimus pro fugos ^b discordias
ciuiles nauibus in eos locos venisse. Caeterum situ^ inter duas Syrtes quibus
nomen ex re inditu^. Nam duo sunt sinus prop^ in extrema Aphrica ip^res
magnitudine: par^s natura: quorum loca proxima terre peralta sunt. Caetera vti
sors tulit alta alia in tempestate vadosa. Nam vbi mare magnum esse saeuire
ventis coepit: limum arena^que et saxa ingentia fluctus trahunt ita facies
locorum cum ventis simul mutat.

Igitur eius ciuitatis lingua modo conuersa connubio numidarum. leges cultusque
pleraque Sydonica: quae eo facilius retinebant: quod procul ab imperio regis
aetatem agebant. Inter illos et freque^tem numidiam multi vastique loci sunt.

SEd quonia^ in has regiones per Leptitano^um negotia venimus: non indignum
videtur / egregiu^ atque mirab^le sacinus duoru^ Carthagine^ siu^ memorare. Eam
rem dicere locus admonuit.

Qua te^pestate carthagine^ses plereque Aphrice imperitabant Cirenenses quoque
magni atque opulenti fu^te. Ager in medio are n^sus vna specie neque flumen

victoresque defessos alius aggred^retur per insidias / spo^ sionem faciunt /
vti certo die legati domo proficiscerentur: et quo in loco inter se obuij
fuissent: is communis vtriusque populi finis haberetur.

Igitur Carthaginae duo fratres missi* quibus nomen Philenis erat: matu rauere
iter pergere.

Cirene^ses tardius ire: id secordia ne / an casu acciderit / parum cognoui.
Caeterum solet in his locis te^pus haud secus atque in mari retinere hoies.

poeni alia^ co^ditione^ tantu^modo aequa^ peterent: Cirenenses optione^
Carthaginensibus faciunt vt vel illi quos fines populo suo quaeterent ibi viui
obruerentur: Veleade^ co^ditione sese / que^ in locum velle^t processuros

ita viui obruti sunt. Carthaginenses in eo loco Philenis fratribus aras
consecrauere: alijque illis honores domi instituti.

Nunc ad rem redeo.

IVgurtha postquam amissa Thala / nihil satis firmum co^tra Metellu^ putat* per
magnas solitudines cum paucis profectus peruenit ad getulos: genus hoi^m ferum
incultu^que et eo te^pore ignaru^ nominis romani. eoru^ multitudinem in vnum
coegit ac paulatim co^suefacit ordines habere: signa sequi: imperiu^ obseruare.
Ite^ alia militaria facere.

Praeterea regis Bocchiproximus magnis muneribus et maioribus promissis ad
studium sui pellicit: quis adiutoribus regem aggressus impellit vti aduersus
romanos bellum incipiat. Id ea gratia facilius proniusque fuit quod Boccus in
initio huiusce belli legatos roman miserat: foedus et amicitiam petitum. Quam
rem opportunissima incepto bello pauci i^pediuerant. caeci auaritia quis oi^a
honesta atque inhonesta vendere mos erat.

Etiam antea Iugurthae filia Boccho nupserat. Verum ea necessitudo apud numidas
maurosque leuis docitur: quod singuli pro opibus quisque quam plurimas vxores:
alij denas alij plures habea^t. Sed reges eo amplius ita ai^mus multitudine
distrahitur: nullam pro socia obtinet: pariter oe^s viles sunt.

Igitur in locum ambobus placitum exercitus co^ueniunt ibi fide data and
accepta Iugurtha Bocchi animum oratione accendit: romanos i^iustos profu^da
auaritia: co^munes oi^m hosts esse eande^ causam illos belli habere cu^ Boccho
qua^ secum et cu^ alijs ge^tibus: libidinem imperandi.

Quis oi^a regna aduersa sunt tum sese: ante paulo carthagine^ses. Item rege^
Persen. post vti quisque opule^tissimus videatur: ita romany hoste^ fore.

(...) atque alijs talibus ad Cirtham oppidum co^stituunt quod ibi Quintus
Metellus praeda^ captiuosque and impedimenta locauerat.

Ita Iugurtha ratus aut capta vebe operae preriu^ sore aut si romanus dux
auxilio sui venisset praelio sese certaturos.

Na^ callidus id modo festinabat Bocchi pacem i^ minuere ne moras agita^ do
aliud quam bella^ mallet.

IMperator postquam de regum societate cognouit non temere* neque vti saepeia^
victo Iugurtha co^sueuerat: oi^bus locis pugnandi copiam facit. Caeterum haud
procul a Cirtha castris munitis reges operitur: melius esse ratus cognitis
Mauris (quoma^ is nouus host is accesserat ^ ex commodo pugnam facere.

Interim Roma per litteras certior fuit Mario prouinciam numidiam data^. Nam
consulem factumia^ antea acceperat quibus rebus supra ac honestu^ percullus:
neque lacrimas tenere neque moderari lin guam vt egregius in alijs artibus
nimis molliter aegritudinem pati.

Quam rem alij in superbiam vertebant: alij bonum ingenium contumelia accensum
esse.

Multi quod ia^ parta victoria ex manibus eriperetur. Nobis satis cognitum est
illum magis honor Marij quam iniuria sua excruciatum: neque tam anxie laturum
fuisse si adempta prouincia alij quam Mario traderetur. Igitur eo dolor
i^peditus et quia stulticiae videbatur alienam rem suo periculo curare: legatos
ad Bocchum misit postulatu^: ne sine causa hostis populi romani fieret: habere
tu^ magnam copiam societatis amicitiaeque coniungendae: que potior bello esset:
quam quam opibus suis confideret tame^ non debere certa pro i^cer it is mutate.
Omne Bellum sumi facile: caeteru^ aegerrime desinere: non in eius them potestate
initium eius ac finem esse. incipere: cuiuis etiam ignauo licere deponi autem
cum victores velint.

Proinde sibique regno consuleret: neu florentes res suas cum Iugurthae
perditis misceret.

Ad ea rex satis placide verba facit: sese pace^ cupere. Sed Iugurthae
fortunarum misereri. Si eadem illi copia fieret omnia conuentura.

Rursus imperator co^tra postulata Bocchi nuntios mittit: ille probare pertim
alia abnuere.

Eo modo saepe ab vtreque missis remissisque nuntiis tempus procedere: et ex
Metelli voluntate bellu^ intactum trahi.

AT Marius (vt supra diximus) cupientissima plebe consul factus / postquam ei
prouincia^ Numidia^ populus iussit: antea ia^ infestus nobilitati: tu^ vero
multus and ferox instare. modo singulos: modo vniuersos ledere. Dictitare sese
consulatu^ ex victis quasi illis spoli a coepisse. alia p^terea magnifica pro
se / et illis dolentia. Interim que bello opus erant / prima habere: postulare
legionibus supplementum: auxilia a populis et regibus sociisque accersere.

Praeterea ex latio fortissimu^ quemque / plerosque militia / paucos fama /
cognitos accire: et ambiendo cogere hoies emeritis stipendijs proficisci: neque
illi senatus / quamquam aduersus erat: de vllo negotio abnuere audebat.

Caeterum supplementum etiam laetus decreuerat: quia / neque plebe militiam
volente / putabatur Marius: aut belli vsum / aut studia vulgi amissurus.

Sed ea res frustra sperata* tanta libido cum Mario eundi plerosque inuaserat:
sese quisque praeda locupletem ^ore: victore^ domum rediturum: alia huiuscemodi
ais attrahebant: et eos non paululum oratione sua Marius arrexerat. Nam
postquam oi^bus decretis / quae postu lauerat: milites scribere vult hortandi
causa / simul: et nobilitatem (vti consueuerat) exagitandi concionem populi
aduocauit. Deinde hoc modo disseruit.

SCio ego Quirites plerosque non ijsdem artibus imperiu^ a vobis petere: et
postquam adepti su^t gerere. Primo industrios / supplices / modicos esse:
dehirc per ignauiam et supbiam etatem agere.

Sed mihi contra videtur. Nam quo pluris vniuersa respu. est quam consulatus
aut praetura: maiore cura illam administrari quam haec peti debere.

Neq: me fallit / quamtum cum maximo vestro beneficio negotij sustineam. Bellu^
parare^ simul et aerario percere: cogere ad militiam eos quos nolis offendere:

domi forisque omnia curare et ea agere inter inuidos / occursa^tes /
factiosos: opinione quirites asperius est.

Ad hoc alij si deliquere: vetus nobilitas: maioru^ fortia facta: cognatorum et
affinium opes: multae clientelae: omnia praesidio adsunt.

Mihi spes omnes in memet sitae: quas necesse est et virtute et innocentia
tutari: nam alia infirma sunt. Et illud intelligo Quirites omniu^ ora i^ me
conuersa esse: aequos bonosque fauere: quippe mea benefacta reipu. procedunt:
nobilitatem inuadendi me quaerere locum. Quo mihi acrius adnitendu^ est: vti
neque vos capiamini: et illi frustrari sit.

Ita ad hoc aetatis a pueritia fui: vt omnes labores et pericula consueta
habeam: quae ante vestra beneficia gratuito faciebam ea^ vti / accepta mercede
/ deseram / non est consilium / Quirites.

Illis difficile est in potestatibus temperare: qui per ambitionem ^ese probos
simulaue^re. mihi qui omnem aetate^ in optimis artibus aegi: benefacere ia^ ex
consuetudine in naturam conuertitur.

Bell ^um gerere me cu^ Iugurtha ^ussistis / qua^ rem nobilitas aegertime tulit.
queso reputate cum animis vestris number id mutari melius sit: si quem ex illo
globo nobilitatis ad hoc negotium: aut ad aliud tale mittatis hominem veteris
prosapiae: ac multarum imaginum et nullius stipendij: scilicet vt in ta^ta re
ignarus omniu^ trepidet: festinet: suma^ alique^ ex pplo monitore^ sui officij:
ita pleru^que euenit vt que^ vos imperare iussistis: is sibi imperatore^ alium
quaerat.

Atque ego scio quirites / q postquam co^sules facti sunt: acta maiorum / et
graecorum militaria praecepta legere coeperunt / hoe^s praeposteri: nam gerere
quam fieri tempore posterius re ^ atque vsu prius est.

Comparate nunc Quiri^^^ cum illorum superbi^^^e hominem nouum.

Quae illi audire et legere solent eorum partem vidi: alia agomet gessi: q^
illi litteris / ego ea milita^do didici: nunc vos existimate facta an dicta
pluris sint. Contemnunt nouitatem meam ego illorum ignauiam: mihi fortuna illis
probra obiectantur: quamquam ego naturam vnam et co^munem oi^m existimo^ sed
fortissimum quemque generosissimum esse.

At si iam ex patribus Albini^ aut Bestiae / queti posset me ne / an illos ex
se gigni maluerint: quid responsuros creditis? nis^ sese liberos quam optimos
voluisse?

QUOD si iure despiciunt me faciant idem maioribus fuis quibus vti mihi / ex
virtute nobilitas coepit.

Inuident honori meo: ergo inuideant labori / and in nocentiae^ periculis etia^
meis^ quoniam per haec illu^ honorem coepi.

Veru^ corrupti hoi^es superbia / ita aetatem agu^t qua si vestros honores
contemnant: ita hos petunt / quasi honest vixerint.

Nae illi fals^ sunt / qui diuersissimas res pariter expectant: ignauiae
voluptatem / et praemia virtutis. Atque etiam cum apud vos aut i senatu verba
faciunt pleraque oratione maioros suos extollunt eorum fortia facta memorando /
clariores esse putant: quod contra est Nam quanto vi^a eorum praeclarior: tanto
horum secordia flagi ciosior. Et prof^cto ita se res habet^ Maioru^ gloria
quasi posteris lumen est: neque bona neque mala eorum in occulto patitur.

Huiusce rei ego i^opiam patior quirites. Veru^ id quod multo preclarius est
meamet facta mihi dicere l^cet. Nu^c videte / quam in ^qui sunt: quod ex aliena
virtute sibi arrogant id mihi ex mea non concedu^t: scilice^ / quod imagines
non habeo: et quia mihi noua nobilitas est: quam certe peperisse melius est
quam acceptam corrupisse.

Equidem non ignoro: si iam respondere velint / abunde illis facundam et
compositam orationem fore. Sed in maximo vestro beneficio cum oi^bus locis me
vosque maledictes lacerent non placuit reticere: ne quis modestia^ in
conscientiam duceret.

Nam me equidem ex animi sententia nulla oration laedere po^t: quippe vera
necesse est praedicent* falsa vita moresque meisu perant.. Sed quoniam vestra
consilia accusantur qui mihi su^mum honore^ et maximum negotiu^ imposuistis:
etiam atque etia^ animis reputate number eorum poenite^dum sit. No^ possum fidei
causa imagines: neque triumphos aut consulatus maiorum meorum ostendere. At si
res postulet hastas / vexillum: phaleras: al^a militaria dona praeterea
cicatrices in aduerso corpore.

Hae sunt meae imagines: haec nobilitas non hereditate relicta vt illa illi^
sed quae meis laboribus et periculis quaesiui. No^ sunt composita mea verba:
parum id facio: ipsa se virtus satis ostendit.

Illis artificio opus est vt turpia facta oratione tegant. Neque graecas
litteras didici: parum placebat eas discere: qppe quae ad virtutem doctoribus
nihil profuerant.

At illa multo optima reipu. doctus sum: hosts ferire: praesidia agitare:
nihil metuere / nisi turpem famam: hyeme^ et aestatem iuxta pati: humi
requiescere eodem te^pore inopi am et laborem tolerare. Ergo his ego praeceptis
milites hortabor: neque arcte cola^ illos vt me opulente^t neque gloria^ mea^
laborem illorum faciam.

Hoc est vtile hoc civil i^perium. Nam cum tute per molliciem agas: supplicio
cogere: id est dn^m non imperatorem esse.

Haec atque alia talia nostri maiores faciendo seque remque pu. celebrauere:
quis nobilitas freta ipsa dissimilis moribus: nos illorum aemulos conte^nit et
oi^s honores non ex merito* sed quasi debitos a vobis repetit. Caete ruin
hoi^es superbissimi: procul errant. Maiores eoru^ oi^aquae licebat / illis
reliquere: diuicias imagines: memoriam sui praeclaram virtutem non reliquere
neque poterant: ea sola neque datur dono / neque accipit^.

Sordidum me et incultis moribus aiunt quod parum site conuiuium exorno: neque
histrionem vllum neque pluris coquum quam villicu^ habeo: quae mihi no^ libet
confiteri quirites: nam ex parente meo et a lijs sanctis viris ita accepi:
mu^dicias mulicribus viris laborem conuenire omnibus bonis oportere plus
gloriae quam diuitiaru^: arma non supellectilem decori esse.

Quin ergo quod iuuat: quodque c^arum aestimant id semper faciant ^ame^t:
potent vbi adulesce^tiam habuere: ibi senectute^ agant in conu^u^js: dediti
ve^tri et turpissimae parti corporis: sudorem: puluere^: e^ alia talia nobis
reli^qua^t quibus illa epulis iucundiora sunt.

Verum non ita est. Nam vbi se flagitijs dedecora uere turpissimi viri bonorum
praemia ereptum ^unt: ita iniustissime luxuria et ignauia / pessime arts /
illis qui coluere eas / nihil officiunt reip. in noxiae cladi sunt. Nunc
quonia^ illis / quantu^ mei mores / non quantu^ illorum flagicia posceba^t
respondi: pauca de rep. loquar.

Primum oi^m de Numidi a bonum animum habetote Quirites. Nam quae vsque hoc
tempus lugurtha^ tutata sunt: oi^a remouistis / auaritiam / imperitiam / atque
superbiam. Deinde exercitus ibi est locorum sciens: sed me her^le magis
stre^nuus / quam felix. Na^ magna pars eius auaritia aut temeritate ducum
attrita est. Qua^obre^ vos / quibus in est militaris aetas: adnitimini mecu^:
et capessite re^pu. Neque quemquam ex calamita te aliorum aut imperato rum
superbia metus coeperit Egomet i^ agmine atque in praelio consultor idem et
socius periculi vobiscu^ ad ero: me vosque omnibus in rebus iuxta gera^. Et
profecto dijs iuua^tibus: omnia matura sunt / victoria praeda / laus. Quaesi
dubia: aut procul essent: tamen omnes bonos reip. subuenire deceret.

Etenim ignauia nemo i^mortalis factus est neque (...) quam pa^ens ^iberis /
vti a ^erni fore^t optauit / magis quam vti b^n / honestique vitam exigerent.

Plura dicerem Quirites si timidis virtutem verba addere^t. Nam strenuis abunde
dictum puto.

HViu s^emodi oratione habita / Marius postquam plebis ai^os erectos videt
propere com m^atu / stipendio / armis / atque alijs vtilibus naues onera^.

Cum his Auium Manliu^ legatum proficisci iubet. ipse interea milites scribere
non more maiorum neque ex cla^^ibus: sed vti cu^usque libido erat: capite
censos plerosque.

Id factum alij inopia bonorum: a^j per ambitionem co^sulis memoraba^t quod ab
eo genere celebratus ad^utus que erat: et homini pote^tiam querenti
egentissimus quisque oportunissimus: ^ui neque sua chara (quippe q^ nulla sunt)
et oi^a cu^ precio honesta videntur.

Igitur marius cum aliquanto maiore numero quam decretu^ erat / in Aphricam
profectus: paucis diebus Vticam aduehit^. Exercitus ei traditur a Publio
Rutilio legato: nam Metellus prospectu^ Marij fugerat: ne videret ea / quae
audita animus tolerate nequiuerat. Sed consul / expletis legionibus cohortibus
que auxiliarijs / in agru^ fertilem et praeda onustum proficiscitur: oi^a ibi
capta militibus donat. Deinde castella et oppida paru^ munita natura et viris
aggreditur: praelia multa caeterum alia l^uia locis facere. Interim noui
milites sine metu pugne adesse: videre fugientes capi aut o^cidi: fortis^imu^
quemque tutissimu^: armis / libertatem patriam / pare^tesque / et alia oi^a
tegi: gloriam atque diuitias queri. Sic breui spacio / nou^ / veteresque
coaluere: et virt^s oi^m aequalis facta. At reges vbi de aduentu Marij
cognouere: diuersi in locos difficiles abeunt.

Ita Iugurthae placuerat speranti* mox esfusos hostis inuadi posse romanos
sicuti plerosque remoto metu laxius licentiusque ^i^^uros.

MEtellus intetea Roman profectus: contra spem suam laetissimis ais excipitur
plebi pr^ibusque postquam inu^dia decesserat: iuxta charus.

Sed Marius impigre prudenter que suorum et hostium res patiter atte^dere:
cognoscere / quid vtrique boni* aut co^tra esset. explorare itinera regum /
consilia et insidias ante veni^e. Nihil apud ser^mi^sum / neque apud illos
tutum pati.

Itaque et getulos et Iugurtha^ praedas age^tes ex socijs ^r^is / saepe
aggre^^us itinere suderat: ipsumque rege^ haud procul ab oppido Cirtha arm^s
ex^erat. Quae postquam gloriosa modo facta su^t: neque belli copiam patra^di
cognouit: statuit vrbes / quae viris aut loco pro hostibus / et aduersum se
oportunissime era^t singulas circumuenire: ita ratus / aut Iugurtham praesidijs
nudatum / si ea pateret / aut praelio certaturum.

Nam Bocchus nuncios ad eum saepe miserat / velle populi^^ro. amicitiam. ne
quid a se hostile timeret.

Id simulauerit ne / quo inprouisus grauior accederet: an mobilitate ingenij /
pacem atque bellum mutare solitus / paru^ exploratum est. Sed consul / vt
co^stituerat* oppida castellaque munita adire partim vi: alia metu aut premia
ostentando auertere abhostibus.

A^ primo mediocria gerebat: existimans Iugurtham ob suos tuta^des in manus
venturum / sed vbi illum procul abesse / et alijs negotijs inte^tum accepit:
maior^ et magis aspera aggredi tempus visum est.

Erat inter inge^tes solitudines oppidu^ magnu^ atque valens / noi^e Capsa /
cuius co^ditor Hercules libys memorabat. Eius ciues apud Iugurtham immunes leni
i^perio: et ob ea fidelissimi habebantur: muniti aduersum hosts non moeni bus
modo et armis atque viris: verum etiam multo magis aspitate loco^.

Nam proeter oppido loca propiqua: alia omnia vasta: inculta: egentia aquae:
infesta a serpe^tibus: quorum vis (sicuti omnium ferarum) inopia cibi acrior.
Ad hoc natura serpe^tium perniciosa: siti magis quam alia re accenditur.

Eius potiundi Marium maxima cupido inuaserat: tum propter usum belli: tum quia
res aspera vi debatur. et Metellus oppidum Thalam magna gloria coeperat: haud
dissimiliter situm munitumque: nisi quod apud Thalam non long a moenibus
aliquot sontes erant. Capsences vna modo atque ea intra oppidum rugi aqua:
caeteri pluuia vteba^tur. Id ibique et in Aphrica quae procul a mari incultius
agebat) eo sacilius tolerabatur: quia numidae pleru^que lacte et ferina carne
vescebant: et neque salem neque alia irritame^ta gule quaerebant: cibus
potusque illis aduersus fame^ atque sitim no^ libidini neque luxury erat.

Igitur co^sul omnibus exploratis credo dijs fretus.

Nam contra tantas difficultates consilio satis prouidere non poterat (quippe
etiam frumenti inopia te^tabatur / quod Numidae pabulo pecoris / magis quam
aruo student.

Et quodcu^que seme^ natum fuerat / iussu regis in loca munita contulerant.
Ager aute^ aridus / et frugum vacuus / ea te^pestate: nam aestatis extremum
erat). Tame^ pro rei copia satis prouidenter exornat. Pecus omne / quod
superioribus praedae fuerat: equitibus auxiliariis agendum distribuit.

Aulum Manlium legatu^ cum cohortibus expeditis ad oppidum Larim (vbi
stipendium et co^meatum locauerat) ire iubet: dicitque se praedabundum* post
paucos dies eodem ve^turum. Sic incoepto suo occultato / pergit ad flumen Tanam.

Caeteru^ in itinere quotidie quadraginta duu^ pecus exercitui per centurias /
item per turmas aequaliter distribuerat:

et ex corijs vtres vti fierent / curabat: simul et inopiam frume^ti lenire: et
ignaris omnibus parare / quae mox vsui forent.

Denique sexto die cum adflumen ventum est maxima vis vtrium effecta o^* Ibi
castris leui munime^to positis milites cibum capere atque vti simul cum occasu
solis egredere^tur paratos esse iubet: omnibus abiectis sarcinis aqua modo
seque et iume^ta onerare.

Deinde postquam visu^ est tempus castris egreditur: noctemque totam itinere
facto consedit. Idem proxima facit. Deinde tertia multo ante lucis aduentum
peruenit in locu^ tumulosum / long a Capsa non amplius duum milium interuallo:
ibique quam occultissime potest / cum omnibus copijs diem opperitur. Sed vbi
dies coepit / et Numidae nihil hostile metuentes / multi oppido egressi:
repent omnem equitatum: et cu^ his velocissimos pedites cursu tendere ad
Capsam: et portas obsidere iubet. Deinde ipse inten^tus propere sequi / neque
milites p^dari sinere. Quae postquam oppidani cognouere: res trepidae metus
inge^s: malum improuisum.

Ad hoc pars ciuiu^ extra moenia in hostium potestate deprehensa / cogere vti
deditionem facerent. Caeterum oppidum ince^ sum. Numide puberes in terfecti:
alij omnes venu^ dati praeda militibus diuisa. Id facinus contra ius belli* no^
auaritia* neque scelere consulis / est admissu^: sed quia locus Iugurthae
opportunus: nobis aditu difficilis: genus hominum mobile / infidu^ ante: neque
beneficio* neque metu coercitum.

POst quam tantam rem pe^ egit Marius / sine vllo suorum incommodo: magnus et
clarus antea / mayor clariorque haberi e^ pit. Oia non been consulta modo /
verumetiam casu data / in virtutem trahebantur.

Milites modesto imperio habiti: simul et locupletes ad coelu^ far Mariu^.

Numidae magis quam vllum mortalem timere postremo omnes socij: arque hosts
credere / illi aut men tem diuinam esse / aut deorum nutu cuncta porte^di.

Sed consul: vbi ea res been euenit: ad alia oppida pergit: pauca /
repugna^tibus Numidis / capit:

plura propter capsensiu^ miseras igni corrumpit.

luctu atque caede omnia complentur.

Denique multis locis potitus ac p^erisque exercitu incruento: aliam rem
aggreditur / non eadem asperitare qua capsens^^ / caeterum haud secus
difficilem. Nanque haud long a flumi^e Mulucha (quod Iugurthae Bocchique
regnum disiungebat) erat inter ceteram planiciem mo^s sax^us* mediocri
castello: satis patens in immensum editus: vno per angusto aditu relicto. Nam
per omnia natural velut opere atque consulto / praeceps erat quem locum Marius
/ quod ibi regis thesauri erant summa vi capere inte^dit: sed ea res forte quam
co^s^^o melius gesta erat.

Nam in castello virorum atque armoru^ satis magna vis* et frumenti^: et fons
aque: aggeribus / turribusque et alijs machi nationibus locus importunus.

Iter castellanorum angustum admod^m. vtrinque precise vinca cu^ ingenti
periculo frustra ageba^tur.

Nam cum hae paululum pr^ces^erant / igni aut lapidibus cor^umpeba^tur.

Milites neque pro opere consistere propter iniquitatem loci: neque inter
vinea^ sine periculo administrare: optimus qui^que cadere aut sa^ciari:
caeteris metus augeri.

At Marius / multis diebus and laboribus consumti^ anxius trahere cum animo suo
omitteret ne i^coeptum: qm^ frustra erat: an fortunam experiretur qua saepe
prospera vsus fuerat.

Quae quum multos dies noctesque aestua^s agitaret: ^o^te quidam ligu^ ex co
horribus auxiliarijs / miles gregarius aliquantulu^ egre^sus castris / haud
procul a latere castelli quod aduersum praeliantibus erat: ai^aduertit inter
saxa repe^tes cocleas quarum cu^ vnam atque altera^: deinde plures peteret
studio legerdi paulatim prope ad su^mu^ mo^ it is egrellus est.

Vbi postquam solitudine^ intellexit more ingenij humani cupido difficilia
faciundi animum vertit.

Et forte in ^o loco grandis ^lex coaluerat / inter saxa / paululu^ modo prona:
d^inde flexa atque aucta in altitudine^* quo cu^cta gigne^tu^ natura fert.

Cuius ramis modo: modo eminentibus saxis nixus Ligur / castelli planic^em
perscrips^t quod cuncti Numidae i^tenti praeliantibus aderant.

Expioratis omnibus quae mox vsui fore ducebat: eodem regreditur non temere /
vti ascenderat: sed tentans omnia et circumspiciens.

Itaque propere adit Marium: acta edocet: hortatur ab ea part / qua ipe
desce^derat / castellu^ te^tet: pollicetur se ducem itineris: periculique nihil
esse. Marius cum ligure promissa eius cognitu^ ex presentibus misit: quoru^ /
vti cuiusque ingenium erat: itarem difficilem aut facilem nunciare.

Consulis tamen animus paululum arrectus est. Itaque ex copia tubicinum et
cornicinum quinque numero quam velocissimos delegit: et cum his / praesidio qui
forent quatnor centuriones: omnesque liguri parere iubet: et ei negotio
proximum diem constituit.

Sed vbi ex praecepto ducis tempus visum est paratis compositisque oibus ad
locum pergit. Caeteru^ illi qui centurijs praeera^t edocti a duce / arma
ornatumque mutauerunt / capite atque pedibus nudis / vti prospectus nixusque
per saxa facilius ^oret.

Super terga gladij and scuta: veru^ ea numidica excorijs po^deris gratia:
simul^ et offe^sa quo leurus s^^epere^t. Igitur praegredie^s ligur / saxa / et
si quam vetusta te radices emineba^t / laq^is vi^ciebat: quibus alleuati
milites facilius ascenderent: interdu^ timidos insolentia itineris leuare manu.
vbi paulo asperior ascensus erat / singulos prae se inermes mitte re Deinde
ipse cu^ illoru^ armis sequi. q^ dubia nixu videba^tur / potissimum tentare /
ac saepius eadem ascendens et desce^dens: deinde statim di gredie^s caeteris
audacia^ addere.

Igitur diu multumque fatigati / tandem in castellu^ perueniunt desertum ab ea
part / quod sicut alijs die bus / omnes aduersum hosts aderant.

Marius vbi ex nuneijs ea quae ligur agerat / cognouit quam quam tota die
intentos praelio suos habuerat: tu^ vero cohortatus est milites: etipse extra
vineas egressus testudine acta suc cedere: et simul hostem tormentis /
sagittarijsque: et sunditoribus eminus terrere.

At Numidae / saepe antea vineis Romanorum subuersis / item incensis / non
castelli moenibus sese tutabantur: sed pro muro dies noclesque agitare: ac
Romany m^ledicere: Mario vecordiam obiectare: militibus nr^is seruitium
Iugurthae minari secundis rebus feroces esse. Interim oibus remanis hostibusque
praelio inte^tis: vi vtrinque: pro gloria pro imperio his: illis pro salute
rertantibus: repent a tergo signa canere:

ac primo mulieres et pueri qui visum processera^t fugere Deinde vti quisque
muro proximus erat: post remo cu^cti armati in ermesque: quod vbi accedit: eo
acrius instare romani: fundere ac pleros que tantummodo sauciare. Deinde super
occisoru^ vadere corpora: auidi gloriae: certantes murum ascendere: neque
quemquam omnium praeda morari. Sic forte correpta Marij temeritas gloriam ex
culpa inuenit.

CAeteru^ dum ea res agitur: Lucius Silla questor cum magno equitatu in castra
venit qui / vti ex lation et socijs exercitu^ cogeret / Romae relictus erat.

Sed quoniam nos tanti viri res admonuit idoneum visum est de natura cultuque
eius paucis dicere. Neque enim alio loco de Syllae rebus dicturi sumus. Et
Lucius Sisenna optime et diligentissime omnium / qui eas res dixere persecutus:
paru^ mihi libero ore locutus videtur.

Igitur Sylla ge^tis patriciae nobilis fuit: familia prope iam extincta maiorum
ignauia.

Literis graecis atque latiis iuxta atque doctissime eruditus animo inge^ti
cupidus voluptatu^: sed gloriae cupidior: ocio luxuriosus esse tamen ab
negotijs nu^quam voluptas remorata e^ nisi quod de vxore potuit honestius
consuli. Eacundus callidus: et amicicia facilis: ad simulanda negocia altitudo
ingenij incredibilis multarum rerum / ac maxim pecuniae largitor atque illi
foelecissimo omniu^ ante ciuilem victoriam nu^quam super industriam fortuna
fuit: multique dubitauere / fortior an foelicior esset.

Nam postea quae fecerat incertum habeo: pudeat mag^an pigeat disserere.

Igit Sylla (vt supra dictum est) postquam in Affrica^ atque in castra Marij
cum equitatu venit rudis ante et ignarus belli: solertissimus omnium in paucis
tempestatibus factus est. Ad hoc milites benign appellare: multis rogantibus*
alijs ip^e per se^dare beneficia: inuitus acci pere: sed ea properanti us quam
aes mutuum reddere: ipse a nullo repetere:

magis laborate id / vt illi quam plutimi deberent: ^oca atque seria cum
humillimis agere.

In operibus: in acie atque ad vigilias multus adesse neque iterim (quod praua
ambitio solet) consulis aut cuiusquam boni fama^ laedere: ta^t ^imod o co^silio
neque manu priorem aliu^ pati: plerosque anteuenire. Quibus rebus et artibus
breui Mario et militibus c^arissimus factus est.

AT Iugurtha postquam oppidum Cap^am aliosque munitos et sibi vtiles / simul et
pecuniam magna^ amiserat ad Bocchu^ nu^cios mittit quam primu^ in numidiam
copias adduceret. Praelij faciendi te^pus adesse. Que^ vbi cu^ctari accepit: et
dubiu^ belli atque pacis rations trahere: rur sus / vti an tea proximos eius
donis corrumpit.

Ipsique Boccho pollicetur numidae tertiam partem si aut romani aphrica expulsi
/ aut integris suis finibus bellum compositum foret. Eo praemio illectus
Bocchus / cum magna multitudine Iugurtam accedit. Ita amborum exercitu
coniuncto Marium iam in hiberna proficiscentem / vix decima part diei relicta
/ inuadunt: rati noctem quae iam aderat / et victis sibi munimento fore: et si
vicissent: nullo impedimento: quod locorum scie^tes erant.

Contra romany vtrumque casum in tenebris difficilem ^ore. Igitur simul co^sul
ex multis de hostium aduentu cognouit / et ipsi hosts aderant et priusquam
exercitus aut instrui aut sarcinas colligere: denique ante quam signum aut
imperium vilum accipere quiuit: Equites mauri atque getuli: non acie neque vllo
more praelij: sed cateruatim* vti quosque sors co^globauerat: in nostros
concurrunt. Qui omnes trepidi improuiso metu: attamen virtutis memores: aut
arma capiebant: aut capie^tes illos ab hostibus defensabant.

Pars equos asce^dere: obuiam ire hostibus: pugna latrocinio magis quam praelio
similis fieri: sine signis: sine ordinibus equi^es peditesque permisti caedere
alios:

alios obtru^care: multos contra aduersos acerri^e pugnantes ab tergo
circu^uenire: neque virtus: neque arma satis tegere: quod hosts numero plures
/ et vndique circum fusi erant. Denique romani veteres: nouique et ob ea
scientes beli^ / si quos locus aut casus coniunxerat: orbs facere.

Atque ita ab oibus partibus simul et tecti et istructi hostiu^ vim
suste^taba^t.

Neque i^ eo ta^ aspero negotio Marius territus: aut magis quam antea dimisso
animo fuit: sed cum turma sua (quam ex sortissimis: magis quam ex
familiarissimis perauerat)

vagari passim: ac modo suis labora^tibus succurrere: modo hosts / vbi
co^fertissimi obstiterant / inuadere:

manu co^sulere militibus quonia^ imperare co^turbatis oi^bus non poterat.

Iamque die^ consumptus erat cum tamen barbari nihil remittere: atque vti reges
praeceperant: nocte^ pro se rati acrius instare.

Tum Marus ex copia rerum consilia trahit: atque vti suis rec^ptui locus esset:
colles duos propinquos inter se occupat. Quoru^ in vno castris paru^ amplo
foris aquae magnus erat: alter vsui oportunior: quia magna part editus et
praecepa pauca munimenta gerebat.

Caeterum apud aqua^ Syllam cu^ equitibus noctem agitare iubet. Ipse dispersos
milites paulatim / non minus hostibus co^turbatis / in vnum contrahit. Deinde
cu^ctos plen^ gradu in collem subducit. Ita reges loci difficultate coacti /
praelio deterre^tur: neque tamen suos longius abire sinunt. Sed vtroque colle
multitudine circundato / effusi consedere.

Deinde crebris ignibus factis pleru^que noctis barbari more suo laetari:
exultare: strepere pedibus: vocibus: et ipsi reges feroces / quod non fugera^t
pro victoribus agere.

Sed ea cu^cta romany ex tenebris editioribus locis facilia visu magnoque
hortamento erant.

Plurimum vero Marius imperitia hostium co^firmatus / quam maximum scile^tium
haberi iubet: ne sign^^ quidem / vti per vigilias solebant / canere. Deinde vbi
lux aduentabat: defessis iam hostibus ac paulo ante somno captis: de improuiso
victigales: item cohortu^ turmarum: legionum tubicines simul omnes tuba canere
et milites clamore^ tollere aut portis erumpere.

Mauri atque getuli ignoto atque horribili sonitu repent exciti / neque fugere
/ neque arma capere neque omnino facere / aut prouidere quicquam potera^t: ita
cunctos strepitu / clamore nullo subuenie^te* nr^is instantibus tumultu:
terrore: formidine^: quasi vecordia acceperat.

Denique omnes fusi fugatique arma et signa militaria pleraque capta: pluresque
in eo praelio quam omnibus superioribus interempti sunt. Nam so^no et metu
insolito impedita fuga.

DEinde Marius / vti ceperat / inhiberna it propter commeatum. in oppidis mari
timis agere decreuit: neque tame^ victoria seco^^ aut insolens factus: sed
pariter ac si in conspectu hostium quadrato agmine incedere.

Sylla cu^ equitatu apud dextimos: in sinistra part Aulus Manlius cu^
funditoribus et sagittarijs: praeterea cohortes ligurum curabat. Primos et
extremos cum expeditis manipulis tribunos locauerat. Perfugae regionum
scientissimi hostium iter explorabant. Simul consul / quasi nullo imposito /
omnia prouidere: apud omnes ad esse: laudare fortis: et i^crepare moerentis.
Ipse armatus inte^tusque. Item milites cogebat / neque secus atque iter faceret
castra munire: excubitum in porta cohortes ex legionibus: pro castris equites
auxiliarios mittere praeterea alios i^ munimentis super vallum locare vigilias
ipse circu^ ire: non ta^ difridentia fu^urum / quae imperauisset quam vti
militibus exaequatus cum imperatore labor volentibus esset.

Et sane Marius illo alijsque tperibus iugurthini belli mages pudore quam malo
exercitum cocice^at: quod multi per a^bitione^ a^ebant alij ^ quod a pueritia
co^sueta^ duritia^ / and ali^ / que caeteri miserias voca^t: voluptati
habuisset: nisi tn^ reip. pariter ac saeuissimo imper ^o been atque decore oi^a
gesta sunt.

Igitur quarto denique die haud long ab oppido Cirtha vndique simul specula
tores citi sese ostendunt. Quare hostis adesse i^tellegitur. Sed quia diuersi
redeuntes / alius ab alia part / atque omnes idem significabant: consul
incertus / quona^modo acre^ instrueret: nullo ordine co^mutato: aduersum oi^a
paratus ibidem opperit.

Ita Iugurthae spes frustrata / qui copias in quatuor parts distribuerat ratus
ex oi^bus aeque alios ab tergo hostibus venturos.

Interim Sylla quem primum hosts attigera^t / cohortatus suos turmatim quam
maxie consertis equis ipse alijque mauros inuadunt:

Caeteri in vno loco mane^tes ab iaculis eminus emissis corpora tegere: et si
qui in manus venerant obtruncare.

Du^ eo modo equites praeliantur Bocchus cum peditibus / quos Volux filius eius
adduxerat / neque in priore pugna in itinere morati affuerant: postremam aciem
romanorum inuadit:

Tu^ Marius apud primos agebat: quod ibi Iugurtha cum plurimis erat.

Deinde numida / cognito Bocchi aduentu / clam cu^ paucis ad pedites co^uertit:
ibi latin (nam apud numa^tiam loqui didicerat) exclamat nr^os frustra pugnare:
ante paulo Marium sua manu inter fectu^: simul gladium sanguine oblitum
ostendere quem inpugna satis impigre / occiso pedite nr^o cruentauerat. Quod
vbi milites accepere / mages atrocitate rei quam fide nuntij terre^tur:
simulque barbari animos extollere et in perculsos acrius intendere.

Iamque paululu^ a fuga ab erant cum Sylla (profligatis his quos aduersum ierat
rediens mauris ab latere incurrit.

Bocchus stati auertitur. At Iugurtha dum sustentare suos: et prope ia^ adeptam
victoriam retinere cupit circumue^tus ab equitibus dextra sinistra que omnibus
occisis: solus interteia hostium vitabundus erupit.

Atque interim Marius / fugatis equitibus / occurrit auxilio suis / quos pelli
iam acceperat.

Denique hosts iam vndique fusi sunt: tum spectaculum horribile in campis
patentibus:

Sequi / fugere / occidi / capi / equi atque viri afflicti: ac multi vulneribus
acceptis* neque sugere posse: neque quietem pati:

niti modo ac statim concidere:

Postremo omnia / qua visus erat / constrata telis* armis / cadaueribus / and
interea humus infecta sanguine.

POstea loci co^sul haud dubie ia^ victor peruenit in oppidu^ Cyrtha^ quo in
initio profectus i^te^derat: eo post quintu^ diem qua^ iteru^ barbari male
pugnauerant / legati a Boccho veniunt qui reges verbis ab Mario petiere: duos
quam fidissimos ad eum mittere: velle de suo et de populi romani co^modo cum
his disserere. Ille statim Lucium Sylla^ / and Aulum Manliu^ ire iubet. Qui
quamquam acciti ibant tamen placuit verba apud regem facere: quo ingenium aut
aduersum flecterent: aut cupidum pacis veheme^tius accenderent.

Itaque Sylla cuius facundiae non etati a Manlio concessum est: verba pauca
huiuscemodi locutus est.

REx Bocche magna nobis laeticia est: cu^ te tale^ viru^ dij monuere: vt
aliqua^do pace^ quam bellu^ malles neu te optimu^ cum pessimo oi^m Iugurtham
miscendo co^ma culares. Simul nobis demeres acerbam necessitu dinem: pariter et
te erra^tem / et illum sceleratissimum persequi. Ad hoc populo romano iam a
principio inopi: melius visu^ amicos quam seruos quaerere tutiusque rati
volentibus quam coactis imperitare.

Tibi vero nulla opportunior amicitia nostra: primum quod procul absumus in quo
offensae minimum est: et gratia par / ac si prope adessemus. dei^de quod
pare^tes abunde habemus.

Amicorum neque nobis neque cuiquam hoim satis fuit Atque hoc vtinam tibi a
principio placuisset: profecto ex populo romano ad hoc te^pus multo plura bona
accepisses: quam mala perpessus esses.

Sed quoniam humanaru^ rerum fortuna pieraque regit: cui scilicet placuit vim
et gratiam nostram te experiri nunc quonia^ per illam licet / festina atque vti
coepisti / perge.

Multa opportuna habes quo facilius errata officijs superes.

postre^o haec in pectus tuum demitte nunquam populum romanum beneficijs victum
esse. Nam bello quam valeat tute scis.

ADea Bocchus placide et benign / simul pauca pro delicto suo verba facit: se
no^ hostili ai^o / sed ad regnu^ tutandum arma cepisse. Nam Numidiae partem
vnde Iugurtham expulerit / iure belli suam factam eam vastari a Mario pati
nequiuisse.

Praeterea missis antea romam legatis / repulsu^ ab amicitia. Caeterum vetera
omittere: actun^ si per Marium liceret / legatos ad senatum missurum.

Deinde copia facta mittendi / animus barbari ab amicis flexus / quos Iugurtha
cognita legatione Syllae et Manlij metuens id / quod parabat / donis corruperat.

Marius interea exe^citu in hibernis co^posito / cu^ expeditis cohortibus et
per^e equitarus proficiscitur in loca sola / obse^iu^ turrim regiam quo
Iugurtha perfugas oe^s praesidium imposuerat. Tum rursus Bocchus scilicet erga
roma^os seu reputando / quae sibi duobus praelijs euenera^t seu monitus ab
alijs amicis quos Iugurtha incorruptos reliquerat / ex omni copia necessariorum
/ quique delegit: quorum et ^ides cognita / et igenia validissima erat. Eos ad
Marium: ac deinde si placeat / Romam legatos ire iubet: agendarum rerum et
quocunque modo belli componendi lice^ciam permittit. illi mature ad hyberna
tomanorum proficiscuntur. Deinde in itinere a Getulis latronibus circumuenti /
spoliatique pauidi sine decore ad syllam profugiu^t: quem co^sul inexpeditionem
proficiscens pro praetore reliquerat. Eos ille no^ pro vanis hostibus vti
meriti era^t / sed liberaliter habuit.

Quare barbari et famam romanoru^ auaritiae falsam et Syllam ob munifi centiam
in sese amicum esse rati suut. Na^ etiam tu^ largitio multis ignora erat.
munificus etiam nemo putabatur / nisi pariter volens dona omnia i^ benignitate
habebant^.

Igitur quaestori mandata Bocchi patefaciunt: simul ab eo petu^t: vti fautor
consultorque sibi adsit. copias / fidem / magnitudinem regis sui: et alia /
quae aut vtilia: aut beneuolentiae esse credebant: oratione extollunt.

Deinde Sylla omnia pollicito: doctique quomodo apud Marium item apud senatum
verba facerent circiter dies ibidem.xl. opperiuntur.

Marius postquam / infecto negotio / quo inte^derat / redit Cyrtha^: and de
adue^tu legatoru^ certior factus est iliosque and Sylla^ ab Vtica venire iubet
ite^que Luciu^ Bellienum praetore^ praeterea omnes vndique senatorij ordinis:
quibuscum ma^data Bocchi cognoscit: in quis legatis potestas eundi Romam fit:
et ab consule interea induciae postula^tur

Ea Syllae et plerisque placuere. pauci ferocius decernunt / ignari rerum
humanarum: quae fluxae et mobiles semper in aduersa mutantur.

Caeterum mauri / impetratis omni^ rebus / tres Romam profecti / cum Cneo
Octauio Rufo: qui quaestor stipendium in Aphricam portauerat. Duo ad rege^
redeunt. Ex his Bocchus cum caetera: tu^ maxim benignitate^: et studium Syllae
libens accepit. Romaeque legatis eius postquam errasse regem et Iugurthae
scelere lapsu^ dep^ ^ati sunt: amiciam et foedus perentibus hoc modo
respondetur.

Senatus et populus romanus beneficij et iniuriae memor esse solet. Caeterum
Boccho / quoniam poenitet delicti / gratiam facit. foedus et amicitia dabu^tur
/ cu^ meruerit.

QVis rebus cognitis / Bocchus per litteras a Mario petiuit / vti Sillam ad se
mitteret. Cuius arbitratu de negotijs co^munibus co^suleret. Is missus cu^
p^sidio equitu^ atque peditu^: ite^ funditorum et ba^listariorum. Preterea iere
sagittarij: and cohors peligna cu^ velitaribus armis itineris propera^di causa
neque secus his / atque alijs armis aduersu^ tela hostiu^quod ea leuia su^t
muniti erant. Sed in itinere / quinto denique die / Volux filius Bocchi repent
in campis patentibus cum mill non amplius equitibus sese oste^dit: qui temere
et effuse euntes / Syllae alijsque omnibus et numerum ampliorem: et hostilem
metum efficiebant. Igit se quisque expedite: arma atque tela tentare:
intendere: timor aliqua^tus / sed spes amplior: quippe victoribus et aduersu^
eos / quos saepe vicerant. Interim equites exploratum premissi / rem / vti erat
/ quiet a^ nuntiant. Volux adueniens / quaestorem appellat: dicitque se a patre
Boccho obuiam illi / simul et praesidio missum. Deinde per illu^ et proximu^
die^ sine metu comuncti eunt. Post vbi castra locata: et diei vesper erat
repe^te Maurus incerto vultu paue^s ad Syllam accurrit dicitque sibi a
speculatoribus cognitu^ haud procul Iugur tham abesse. Simul vti noctu clam
secum profugeret / rogat atque hortat. Ille animo feroci negat se toties susum
numidam pertimes^ere: virtuti suorum satis credere: etiam si certa pestis
adesset ma^surum potius quam pro ditis his / quos ducebat turpi fuga / incertae
/ ac forsitan post paulo i^teriturae morbo / vitae parceret. Caeterum ab eode^
monitus / vti noctu prosicisceretur: consilium approbat: ac statim milites
coenatus esse i^ castris^: ignesque quam creberri mos fieri: deinde pri^a
vigilia sile^tio egredi iubet.

Iamque nocturno itinere fes^is omnibus / Sylla pariter cum ortu solis castra
metabatur: cu^ equites mauri nunciant / Iugurtham circiter duum milium
interuallo ante eos consedisse. Quod postquam auditum est: tu^ vero ingens
metus nostros inuadit: credere se proditos a Voluce / et insidijs circumuentos.
Ac fuere qui dicere^t manu vindicandum neque apud illum tantum scelus inultu^
relinquendum. At Sylla quam quam eadem existimabat / tn^ ab i^^uria maurum
prohibet suos hortatur / vti fortem animum gererent. Saepe antea paucis
stre^nuis aduersus multitudinem been pugnatum* quanto sibi in praelio minus
peper cissent: ta^to tutiores fore. neque que^quam decere qui manus armauerit /
ab inermibus pedibus auxilium p^tere. in maximo metu nudum et cecu^ corpus ad
hoste^ vertere. Deinde Volucem (qm^ hostilia faceret) louem maximu^ obtestatus:
vt sceleris atque praefidiae Bocchi testis adesset: castris abire iubet. Ille
lacrima^s orare / ne ea crederet: nihil dolo factu^: ac magis calliditate
Iugurthae / cui videlicet specula^ti iter suum cognitum esset.

Caeteru^ quoniam neque ingentem multitudine^ haberet and spes opesque ex patre
suo penderent crederet illum nihil palam ausurum: cum ipse filius testis
adesset. Quare optimum factu videri per media eius castra palam tra^sire sese /
v^ praemissis vel ibide^ relictis mauris / solum cum Sylla iturum. Ea res / vti
i^ tali negocio solet / probata est: ac stati^ profecti: quia de improuiso
acciderat / dubio atque hesitante Iugurtha / incolumes transeunt.

Dei^de paucis diebus quo ire intenderant / peruentum est.

IBi cum Boccho quida^ numida / Asper nomine multum et familiariter agebat:
praemissus a Iugurtha / postquam Sylla^ accitum audierat / oratu^ / et subdole
speculatum Bocchi consilia ierat. Praeterea Dabar / Massagradae filius / ex
gente Massinissae / caeterum materno genere impar (Nam matter eius ex eoncubina
orta erat) Mauro ob ingentia facta charus acceptusque quem Bocchus fidu^ multis
antea tempestatibus expertus illico ad Syllam nunciatu^ mit tit paratu^ sese
facere / quae populus romanus vellet colloquio: diem: locum: tempus: ipse
deligere^ consul to sese omnia cum illo integra habere neu Iugurthae legatum
pertimesceret: quod eo aduocatus esset quo res comunis licentius gereretur: nam
ab insidijs eius aliter sibi cauere nequiuisse.

Sed ego co^perio Bocchu^ magis punica fide: quam ob ea quae praedicabat /
simul romanos et numidam sp^ pacis detinuisse multumque cum suo animo voluere
solitu^ Iugurtham romany / an illi Syllam traderet: libidinem aduersu^ nos:
metu^ pro nobis suasisse.

Igitur Sylla respo^dit / s^ pauca coram aspare locuturum caetera occulte aut
nullo praesente / aut quam paucissimis: simul edocet: q^ sibi responderent.

Postquam sicuti voluerat co^gre^^i: dicit se missu^ a co^sule / venisse quae
situm ab eo / pacem an bellum agitaturus foret. Tum rex (vti praeceprum fuerat)
post diem decimum redire iubet. At nihil etiam d^creu isse: sed illo die
responsurum.

Deinde ambo ad castra sua degressi.

SEd vbi plerumque noctis processit Sylla a Boccho occulte accersit ab vtroque
tantu^modo fidi interp^tes adhibent. Praeterea Dabar internu^cius / sanctus vi^
/ jurat ex sente^tia ambobus: acstatim sic rex incipit.

Nunquam ego ratus sum ^ore / vti rex maximus i^ hac terra / et omniu^, quos
noui, opulentissimus priuato homini gratiam debere^: et me he^cle Sylla / ante
te cognitum / multis ora^tibus / alijs vltro / egomet opem tuli: nullius
i^digui.

Id esse imminutum / quod caeteri dolere solent / ego letor: fuerit mihi
eguisse aliquando praecium tuae amicitiae: qua apud animum meum nihil charius
habeo: id adeo experir^ licet arma: viros: pecunia^ postremo quicquid ai^o
libet sum: vtere: et quo ad viues nunquam tibi reddi tam gratiam putaueris:
sed semper apud me integra erit. Denique nihil me sciente frustra voles. Nam vt
ego existimo regem armis quam munificentia vinci minus flagitiosum.

Caeteru^ de republica vestra cuius curator huc missus es paucis accipe. Bellum
ego populo romano neque feci^ neque factum vnquam volui fines meos aduersum
armatos tutatus sum. Id omitto quoniam ita vobis placet. Gerite vti vultis cum
Iugurtha bellum. ego flumen Mulucham quod inter me et Micipsam suit non
egrediar. Denique id Iugurtha^ intrare sinam. Praeterea si quid me vobisque
dignu^ pe^iueris haud repuisus abibis.

Ad ea Sylla pro se breuiter et modice: de pace de q: co^munibus rebus multis
disseruit.

Denique regi patefecit: quod polliceatur senatu^ et pplm romanum: quoniam
armis amplius valuissent non in gratiam habiturum: ^aciendum aliquid quod
illorum magis quam sua retulisse videre tur: id adeo in prompt^ esse quoniam
Iugurth^ copiam haberet: quem si romany tradidisset fore vt illi plurimum de
beret amicitiam: sedus: Numidiae partem quam nunc peteret: tunc vltro
aduenturam.

Rex primo negare agitare cognitionem affinitatem praeterea foedus
i^teruenisse. Ad hoc metuere ne fluxa fide vsus populariu^ animos auerteret.
quis et Iugurtha charus et romani inuisi erant. Denique saepius fatigatus
leuit^r et ex voluntate Syliae omnia se fact urum promittit.

Caeterum ad simulandum pacem cuius numida defessus bello auidissimus erat:
quae vtilia visa sunt constituunt. Ita composito dolo degrediuntur.

AT rex postero die Aspere^ Iugurthae ^egatu^ appellat dicitque sibi per
Dabare^ ex Sylla cognitu^ posse co^ditionibus bellu^ sui sententia^ exquireret.
Ille laetus in castra Iugurthae proficiscit. Deinde cu^cta ab illo edoctus
properato itinere post diem octauum redit ad Bocchum et ei nunciat Iugurtha^
cupere omnia quae imperare^tur facere sed Mario paru^ confidere. Saepe antea
cu^ imperatoribus romany pacem co^uentam frustra fuisse. Caeterum Bocchus si
ambobus consulta^ et ^atam pacem vellet: daret opera^ vt vna quasi de pace in
colloquium conneniret ibique Sylla^ sibi traderet* cum talem virum in potestate
habuisset tum fore vti iussu senatus ac populi romani foedus fieret: neque
homine^ nobilem no^ sua ignauia captum: sed ob remp. in hostium potestate
relictum ir^.

Haec Maurus secum ipse diu voluens tandem promisit. Caeterum dolo an in re
cunctatus paru^ co^perimus sed plerumque regiae voluntates vt vehementes sic
mobiles: saepe ipi^e sibi aduersae.

Postea te^pore et loco constituo in colloquium vti de pace co^ueniretnt
Bocchus Syllam modo: modo Iugurthae legatum appellare: benign habere: idem
ambobus polliceri: illi leti pariter ac spei bonae esse pleni: sed nocte ea
quae proxia ^uit ante diem colloquio decretum maurus adhibites amicis ac statim
immutata volu^tate remotis a se caeteris dicitur secum multa agitauisset: vultu
/ color / ac motu corperis pariter atque animo varius quae scilicet ipso
tacente occulta pectoris oris immutatione patefecit.

Tamen postremo Syllam accersiri iubet: et ex eiu^ sentencia numidae insidi as
tendit.

Deinde vbi dies aduenit et ei nunciatum Iugurtham haud long esse cu^ paucis
amicis et quaesto^e nostro quasi obuius honoris causa procedit i^ tumu^um
facillimum v^su insidiantibus eodem numida cum plerisque necessarijs suis
inermia vti dictum erat accedit: ac statim signo dato vndique simul ex i^
sidijs inuadit.

Caeteri obtru^cati Iugurtha vinctus Syllae traditu^: et ab eo ad Marium
deductus est.

Per idem te^pus aduersum Gallos ab ducibu^ nostris Qui^to Scipione / et Caio
Manlio male pugnatum est.

Quo metu Italia omnis contremuerat.

Illique et denique omnes romani vsque ad nostram memoriam sic habuere: alia
omnia virtuti sua^ prona esse: cu^ Galli^ pro salute non pro gloria certare.

Sed postq^ bellum in Numidia co^fectum et Iugurtham Romam vinctu^ ad duci
nuntiatum est. Marius consul absens factus est et ei decreta proui^cia gallia.

Isque kale^dis Ianuarij magna gloria consul triumphauit.

Ex ea tempestate spes at que opes ciuitatis in illo sitae. Telos.
