A treatise declarynge the despyte of a secret sedycyous person / that dares
not show him self.
Qui male agit odit luce^. Io. 3.
His doyngs among true men / should not be had in place
That fears to tell his name / and shameth to show his face.

WHy I thus do write / is greatly to be mused
But before I depart / It shall appear more plain
Besechynge all honest men / to have me excused
Though (as no less bounden) I do seem very feign
By veryte to vaynquysshe malyuole dysdayne
Force me so forces / and wylleth me to write
Truly for the truths sake and nothing for despyte
And now briefly to my purpose / the effect is this
Of late I wrote two lybelles / not thinking to offend
But perceiving among us things to be amys
Still styrrynge and procuring us lewdly to contend
Of such indecent order / I desired the end
For the which cause only / I took on me to write
Truly for the trueths sake / and nothing for despyte
But now I well perceive / I rubbed some on the gall Obsequiu^ amicos veritas
odiu^ parit. Tirentius

Which causes them to grunte / and ernestly to groan
Well, (be as be may) I can not do with all
It will not from the flesh / that is rooted in the bone
For my true maenynge / some show them self full prone
By sclaunder to deface me / withal their power and might
Nothing for the trueths sake / but all for mad despyte
They name me a papyste / and say / I do not love
None other but Papystes / and men of popysshe mind
The true trial whereof / I refer to God above Hoies veritate^ dice^tes a
malis odio habe^tur. Ad gal. 4

And consequently to others / what they can prove and find
O man malycyous / that would so feign blind
The good intentes of others / which truly do and write
Labourynge their destruction / through serpe^tyne despyte
If justly you can prove / as you declare in writing Qui loquitur i^iqua no^
potest latere, nec preteriet illu^ corripie^s iudiciu^. Sap. i.

That I love none, but papists, tha^ may you well may^tain
Me to be a traitor / both to God / and our good King
To the just trial of the which / I woll drive you plain
For you it is to late / to call in your words again
Though as a lurky^g lorrel / your name you woll not write
Both you shall be known / and your deuelysshe despyte
If you have known / any such treason to be in me ^orte digni su^^ no^ solu^
q^ ea faciu^t sed etia^ q^ co^se^tiu^t facie^tibus, Ad Roma. i.

Then you in your duty / have been very neglygent
The part of every true heart / toward his King should be
what he knows against his grace / furthwt to make euyde^t
Who conceleth others treason / as a traitor does consent
Wherefore this your doing / may appear / to each ma^s sight
Nothing for the truethes sake / but all for lewd despyte
You declare furthermore / that lately I rebelled
Against the Kings majesty / and his council all
For the which sclaunder / I am greatly compelled
Before the higher powers / this matter for to call
As surely I woll do / doubt you it not at all Ois qui facit iusticia^ ex deo
natus e^. i. Io. ij

At whose hands I woll ask / but justice and right
Specially for the truethes sake / and nothing for despyte.
Yet Catho^ ye wise / does teach me / and byddeth me not to care Cu^ recte
viuas ne cures verba malorum Arbytrij n^i no^ e^ quod q^sque loquatur. Cato.

So as my life be honest / let the wicked say their mind
We can not forbid men's speech / wherefore let the^ not spare
Nature in every thing / woll show her proper kind
Which to be proved true / is easy enough to find
In that / that you have done / sparynge not to write
Nothing for the truths sake / but all for mad despyte
That / wherewt you be grieved / is always forth coming
My name plainly thereunto / I woll it not deny
And I ready to be punysshed / for such my doing
If I have so deserved / and can be found cause why Quare no^ timuistis
detrahere seruo meo. Nu. x.

Wherefore you be much to blame / so to rail and cry
Openly detractynge me / against all law and right
As I am / I woll be known / so shall be your despyte
I could say some what more, but I mind not to co^te^de Ex fructibus eoru^
cognostis eos. Math. vij. In insidiis suis capiu^tur i^iqui. Prou. x.

As the tree by her fruytes / is always chyefely known
So I doubt not / by your works / before this matter end
you shall be well perceived / and what blastes you have blowe^
And what kinds of sede / every other man has sown
Wherefore I do advise you / be sure you stand vpryght
I doubt not to overthrow you / in your own despyte.
your book does open matter / not mete I should here touch Te^peri seruie^du^
est. ad Romanos. xij.

But within short time / it shall show it self more plain
Your doings well declare / how in heart you still grouche
And against who^, because you can not your will obtain
your malice does so blind you / and byddeth you not refrain Malicia eorum
excecauit eos Sapien. ii,

But thoroughly to proceed / blusteryng with force and might
Forgetting clean your duty / and all for mad despyte
And now to conclude / O Dauyd holy prophet and king iudica me deus and
discern causa^ mea^ de gente no^ sct a^ abhoie ^iquo and doloso erue me. Psalm.
xlii

Unto god omnipotente / most high and eternal
In Psalmyst here with the / will I cry and sing
Judge thou me (o Lord) that art judge over all
Discern thou my cause / and let me to the call
To be rydde from the wicked / which labor day and night
Thy veryte to vanquysshe by deceytfull despyte
And as thou art Lord of lords and king of kings
Preserve our noble king / our most precious treasure
With Katherine our Queen, and grant yt their procedynges
In long life may prospere / unto thy will and pleasure
And to Edward our Prince / that most redolent flower
Infuse in them thy grace / and help we may be quyte
Of these sects sedycyous / so swellynge in despyte
God save the King.
Qui male agit odit luce^. Ioh. iii
His doings among true men / should not be had in place
That fears to tell his name and shameth to show his face
