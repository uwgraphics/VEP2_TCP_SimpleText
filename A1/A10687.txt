To the Christian Reader, grace and peace.
GOod Reader, in the year of our Lord 1588. when the Devil, Pope, and
Spaniard did rage against our late Q. Elizabeth, (never to be forgotten) and
this kingdom to have both killed us: and to possess the land* and when God
had so miraculously delivered us from that invincible Navy (as they termed it)
I wrote this Book, containing in it many good Songs, Ditties and Carrols, for
the comfort and solace of all those that are well disposed, after so miraculous
deliverance from our enemies, the Pope and Spaniards. If therefore it happen to
light into hands that are wise and learned: know this that I do not count it
so fit a book for thee as for the Scholars of petty Schools the poor
Coutrieman and his family, who will ask these vain questions, some times
saying: what shall we do in the long winter nights: how shall we pass away
the time on Sundays, what would you have us do in the Christmas Hollydayes:
For such have I made this book, wherein I shall no doubt please their merry
minds a little, for that they are naturally given to sing, if happily I may
win them to sing good things and forsake evil.

And when the gunpowder Treason was found out and bewrayed: I began to look
over this little book: and finding as great cause to move unto thankfulness
now as then: I did as my leisure served me correct and amend my former labors,
and added and augmented them more then was in the former book: and now have
finished the same, I offer it to the view of all well minded persons, and as
for others that cannot take plain labors in good part: I leave them to
themselves, and the rest unto God.

The Lords poor and humble servant, I. R.

The Countrymans comfort.
A song in stead of an Introduction to this work, worthy your reading and
entitled A Table of good Counsel.
It will go to the tune of in Create, if you sing it.
FIrst learn to honor God aright,
Let love and fear thereto provok:
Obey the King, with all thy might
Submit thy self to Parents yoke.
Embrace the good and shun the ill:
This is the sum of wisdoms skill.
To know thy self thou must apply:
And try thy friend before thou trust:
Content thy self, clime not too hie,
Let word and deed be all ways just.
Strive not to swim against the stream:
Account not of a drowsy dream.
Wish not for wealth by parents death,
A friend far passes worldly good:
And while the body yields breath,
Seek not for to exceed in food.
For great excess of meat and drink,
Does cause the soul in sin to sink.
Faint not though fortune favor fools,
Fret not at others good success:
Delight to sit in learned schools,
Thy former faults seek to redress.
Spurn not at him that tells thy crime,
Mend that against another time.
Spend sparingly yet not too nigh,
And make account how wealth does wast:
Hate Suretiship all debt books fly.
To give thy word make thou no have.
Let not apparel sumptuous be:
But still remember thy degree.
Respect not only present time,
But mark also what may ensue:
For crack of credit is a crime,
Change not an old friend for a new.
Take heed of brazen face past shame:
And love to live in honest fame.
Praise no man till thou do him know,
Dispraise not rashly any wight:
Least shame thereby to thee may grow,
Speak but few words place them aright.
Into the world then may thou go,
And say thy friend has taught thee so.
The sum of the Creed in Meeter:
IN Father Son and Holy Ghost,
Believe I steadfastly,
And that Christ Jesus Man became:
I hold as earnestly.
He also suffered for our sins,
Himself still void of sin:
Who did descend the manner how,
I say not much therein.
We find that Christ felt so much pain,
As satisfied Gods Ire:
And reconciled man to God,
That's all we need require.
And as for Christ in Pix, in bread,
Or harrowing up of Hell:
Of Purgatory Limbus twain,
The Scripture does not tell.
One true Church Catholic there is,
One earth still Millitant:
And I a member of the same,
Through Christ now Tryumphant.
This Church it has Communion,
And God remitts their sin:
To life and glory they shall rise,
And they shall never linne,
To sing out HALLELVIAH,
In everlasting Bliss,
Wherefore believe and live well here,
That so you may be his.
Amen.
The sum of the Ten Commandments.
1 None but Iehova have for God, 2 No Creature worship thou, 3 Take not Gods
holy Name in vain, 4 Keep well the Sabbath now, 5 Thy Parents honor and obey,
6 No murder once commit, 7 Be none adulterer at all, 8 Steal not by hand or
wit, 9 False witness bear thou not, I say, 10 Ne covet not in heart,
Thy neighbors wife, servant or goods,
That God gave for his part.
These Ten Commandments we divide,
Still into Tables twain:
And take them for our spiritual guide,
And our direction plain.
First to the worship of our God,
And then to Christian love:
That we may shun the fiery rod,
And live in heaven above.
Then do not like to Papists add,
Nor take from this his Law,
But down with Images and all,
And ever live in Awe.
And as the Lord did make us all,
So let him teach us too:
For he knows what is best for us,
And we blind what to do.
FINIS.
A Brief of the Lords Prayer.
O Father ours which art in heaven,
Still hallowed be thy Name,
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
In earth without all blame.
As it performed is in heaven,
Ofsoules and Angels bright:
Where thou art served without sin,
And praised day and night.
Give us this day our daily bread,
Forgive our sins likewise,
As we forgive them that us hurt,
When quarrels do arise.
Into temptation lead us not,
So to be overcome,
As wicked persons ever are,
That lose thy sweet kingdom.
For thine is that celestial place,
With power and glory still,
Both now and evermore, Amen,
Say we with right good will.
To pray to Saints or creatures then,
you see it is Po-pe-rie,
To have a Picture in this work:
Is idle certainly.
A Crucifix is nothing worth,
Ne Beads to count upon:
For blind-men they must leave those Paints,
And pray to God alone.
FINIS.
The Sum of the old Covenant or Testament with the two Sacraments thereof
given to the Jews by Almighty God.
IEhova that great God of heaven,
gave to the fathers old:
A covenant of doing all,
That in the Law is told.
Do this and live said God to them,
But no man could do so:
Wherefore the law sends all to Christ,
To keep their souls from woe.
This covenant was signed and sealed,
With two clear Sacraments:
The first was Circumcision,
Withal rights and intents.
The Other was the Passover,
Wherein Christ was set out:
The Lamb of God slain for our sins,
Of this be out of doubt.
FINIS.
The Sum of the new Covenant or Testament with the two Sacraments confirming
the same and given both to the Jews and Gentills by Jesus Christ the son of
God.
THe Covenant of Christ with man,
in the new Testament:
Is this that we believe in him,
and strive with whole intent.
To love and live as Christ has done,
yea bear his cross and pray:
That we may do as we would have,
men deal with us always,
This Covenant also is confirmed
With holy Sacraments twain,
Which like wise set out Christ to us,
Who for our sins was slain.
The first of these is Baptism,
Which sets out our new Birth,
The other the Lords Supper is
Which brings us heavenly mirth.
And thus one Church is gathered
Of Jews and Gentiles eke,
Rome therefore is a Harlot found
And our Church Catholic:
For we stand firmly to Gods word,
And thereby will be taught,
But Papists cheifely by the Pope,
Which thing great strife has wrought;
These Sacraments which Christ set out
They like not simple-ly
But will have 7. S. to Christ's twain;
And give no reason why.
Consider what absurdities,
Do grow of this by them.
Five covenants more they would confirm,
Belike from mortal men.
Their Priests of all men should receive
The Sacraments each one.
Yet must he not be married,
For then his Priest-hoods gone;
Some of these five called Sacraments,
The people may not have:
As Orders yea and Marriage too,
Which some men will not crave.
Where as the Sacraments of Christ,
Must be received of all:
Even as his Law and Covenant,
Which serves for great and small.
But I will now contend no more,
I seek to teach the Truth:
And to bewraye Absurdities,
To aged folk and youth.
FINIS.
An instruction of the whole year divided in 12. Months, four seasons or
quarters as also into weeks and days, of the Sabbath or Lords day: and what
is the true keeping of it.
Of a Year.
A year is that which holds from spring to spring
From march to march the five and twentieth day
Wherein we sow and reap of every thing,
To serve for meat and clothing as we say.
Of the 12. Months in the year.
Twelve months there are belonging to each year
Into four quarters we divide the same.
Thirteen full moons in this space do appear
And 4 weeks maks up every month we name
Of the names of the Months.
Cold January, February, March,
Mild April, May, with June and July these,
Hot August which the corn does ripe and parch
September sweet which does the Ploughman please
October and November then takes place,
The last of all these Months is called December
And they that have but even a spark of grace
Gods benefits in these they will remember.
Of the 4. Quarters in the year
1 The Quarters four in all the year are these
March twenty five is called our Lady Day,
Or the Anun-tia-ti-on if you please,
Of blessed Marie by that man of joy.
I mean the Angel Gabriell which did come,
With news from heaven that she should mother be
Of Jesus Christ Gods dear and only son,
Which story in the Scripture all may see.
2 The second quarter happens still in June,
And Saint John Baptists day we do it call:
Or Midsommer in English speech or tune,
The year is then at best as it will fall.
3 The third is in the Month we call September
And bears the name of glorious Mi-cha-ell
Wherein let poor men evermore remember
Their year or half years rent to pay down well
4 The fourth and last falls in December still,
And Christmas quarter men do call the same
God grant us in them all to do Gods will.
And so to thrive in body, goods, and name.
FINIS.
A religious Letter, showing how and whom to woo in the way of Marriage,
though all men cannot do, or have it so as is here set down.
IN humble wise I do commend,
and write these words to you:
Whom I esteem as my dear friend,
never to change for new.
Unto my words in patience,
now let your ears incline:
And that will be some recompense,
to quit these pains of mine.
In younger years when strength did grow,
and nature sought her will:
I used all good means that are,
The same to quench and kill.
I prayed to God, I fasted often,
I kept from com-pa-ny:
I read good books to beat down lust,
And harlots haunts did fly.
I labored in my calling much,
I watched and studied hard:
Yet as I sat the tempter came,
With all his band and guard.
Evil motions he did raise in me,
With Ona-nizme Sin:
But I likte not or gave consent,
To ought that he brought in.
But I would walk abroad sometimes,
And take some re-cre-ation:
To put vain thoughts out of my heart,
In good and christian fashion.
And even in this had I respect,
to every cir-cum-stance,
Time, place and seasons every thing,
That goodness might advance.
Then went I to my work again,
I never made a toil:
Of sport or recreation,
Which should be but as File
To get the Mellancholly ruste*
And filth of flesh away*
Least Sin and Satan should in me
As Kings bear rule and sway.
When none of these things did prevail
But Satan tempted still:
I thought upon man's last refuge*
Gods laws for to fulfill.
I mean the honest Marriage Bed,
Therein to live most chaste:
My body which Gods Temple is,
No way to file or wast.
My Parents which did bring me up,
Gave learning to mine Art:
And made me often read Gods word,
Which I laid up in heart.
Thus getting Scripture readily,
As at my fingers ends:
I vanquished world the flesh and Devil,
Not shaming self nor friends.
This was of God, I wrought it not,
but here all sorts may see:
Christ's yoke is easyer then we judge,
If good means used be.
But if like Cowardes we will yield,
To lust and to affection:
So often as Satan he will tempt,
In vain is all direction.
Where fore such counsel as I read,
Such counsel give will I:
Resist the Devil says Saint James,
And he from thee will fly*
Or else how did good Iosephhe
Susanna and the rest,
Withstand all filthiness of sin
and whoredom still detest*
To pass by this I will proceed,
and bend my speech more plain*
To you whom I respect in heart,
in which I do not feign.
Because I mean to knit my self*
In marriage as I said:
I did bethink my self where I,
Might find some honest maid.
That I might woo and take to wife,
In wedlock to live so*
As that I might not grieve my friends
nor yet rejoice my foes*
And still my mind did run on you,
as fittest match for me;
Among you madens in these parrs,
Or any I can see,
You are no gadding gosseper*
No proud nor peacocke dame:
No night bird walker as some are
That live not in good fame.
No stage play runner nor no shrew,
Of shrill or prattling tongue:
No scould nor brawler or stout piece,
That hurts both old and young.
No self wild person sour or cross,
To please or to entreat:
No idle houswife or the like,
That can but play and eat.
No sweet mouthed triflles, longing still*
For all things far or near:
And with the first to crave ripe fruit,
Though it be scarce and dear.
I know that you can read and write*
Yea sing and sweetly play
On instruments of sundry sorts
For your delight all way.
The needle, and the loome also,
You handle cunningly
The knitting needles of all sorts
Your fingers can apply.
Yet this does nothing hinder you,
From wheel and distaffe plain:
Which is the mistress sport sometimes,
And is not without gain.
I know that you live soberly,
Content with mean estate:
Abhorring pride and vanities
To live at simple rate.
A great Pains taker in an house;
For all works that belong:
To women sex both small and great,
Though you not very strong.
All this does come from God above,
For you live in his fear:
And Parents have took pains with you
Which winnes praise every where.
Blessed and happy is that man;
Which can win love of thee:
Or of thy like in some good part,
Though some should wanting be.
I pray you now to understand,
That all my words do tend:
To get your favor and your love,
In Marriage or I end.
And for my self you know me well,
I am a neighbors son:
And you a neighbors daughter are,
You know then whence I come*
I must not praise my self at all
My deeds and godly men;
Shall be sufficient in this point,
Wherefore I spare my Pen.
Yet give me leave a word or two,
In things that all know not:
Concerning me my life and state:
Which may fall to thy lot.
I fear and worship God on hie,
And what the scripture says:
That I believe unfainedly,
And there on build my faith.
All po-pe-ry I do detest,
With Sects and Schisms all:
In Christ and his Apostles words,
I stay and ever shall.
Now my profession sure it is,
Befitting your degree:
Which may induce thy heart to love,
And think the more on me.
I am no unthrift any way,
No prodigal or such:
No Naball niggard Churll or Clown*
At kindred for to grutch.
I am no cosening cogging knave,
No shifter vile or base:
No drunkard whoremaister or thief,
That dares not show their face.
I am no slothful or drone Be,
To suck away the honey:
That other men have labored for,
I owe no debts nor money,
I stand not bound in suretieship,
For any man alive:
I take no goods or wares on trust,
For then I should not thrive.
I brag it not in brokers suites
Of velvet, silk, or Sattine:
Widows or maidens to deceive,
By tongue that runs on pattine.
I meddle not with vserers,
That eat men out of all
Lands, goods, and leases, paunes, and what
May bring a man's great fall.
I follow my vocation still,
And on the Sabbath day:
With all my servants go to Church
To hear gods word and pray.
House, land, and money some I have,
My parents left it me*
Enough to bring a woman to,
If married I should be.
And something I have purchased since,
If children I should have
That they in time may be possessed,
Of that we get or save,
What wealth you have I do not know,
Nor will I that enquire,
It is sufficient if you like,
and all I do desire.
Our Parents thine and mine are dead,
Else would I out of hand:
Make suit to them for their good wills,
as Gods word does command.
But seeing God has called them,
And you at liberty:
To marry whom you will in God,
That course now stay will I.
But if that you have other men,
In such a work to use:
There good advise I wish you take,
And do it not refuse.
The better every thing shall go,
With you and eke with me:
For that with good advise this work,
Our friends shall ever see.
Now will I draw unto an end,
Till I may hear from you;
What hope there may be of my suite,
Or what shall now ensue.
The Lord direct your heart aright,
That I thine own may be:
If God has so ordained it,
And thus farewell to thee.
Your loving friend, your friend indeed That will not fail: in time of need.

Certain verses or English Meeters concerning locking in of our doors at Night
and of opening them in the Morning with prayer, and then of following some
lawful vocation or other.
To the Tune of the 25. Psalm.
AT night thy doors shut in,
With Prayer to the Lord,
Repent and leave thy sins betimes,
And so escape the sword.
For one day we shall count,
For thoughts for words for deeds;
Therefore let not the soul of thine,
Be pestered with such weeds.
No quiet can there be*
To them that sleep in sin:
And are not reconciled to God,
By Christ our help therein.
When Morning does appear,
And thou intendst to rise:
Praise God for thy good rest and sleep,
and shake of slothful guise.
Unlock thy doors again,
With prayer as before:
And willingly take pains some way,
In goodness evermore.
For they that live at ease,
And have no calling known,
Live not a Christian life be sure,
Though they live on their own.
As the eues such are to God,
And to his Children dear:
The slothful idle spending life,
Is no way in Gods fear.
If thou be but a child,
At school let be thy work:
And do not lose thy golden time,
In corners for to lurk.
If thou a servant be,
A man or else a maid:
Do that which does belong to thee,
To sin be thou afraid.
If Gentleman or Knight,
Or if young Lord thou be:
Let study good and exercise,
Be pleasant unto thee*
Thy house thy name and wealth,
Will else be over thrown:
And thou a man of no esteem
When thy bad life is known*
The streets of every Town,
are to to full each day:
Of idle and unthrifty men,
That seeks their own decay,
The Lord our God amend,
This sin and all the rest:
That now does reign in Englishmen
For God does it detest.
FINIS.
A song in praise of Music against all Stoickelike Natures.
Which may be sung to the Tune of: In Create when Dedalus.
THe Poets write in Musickes praise,
That Orpheus with his tuned Harp
The stones could move the trees could raise
And make the warbling Birds to carpe,
And all to show that Musickes art
Can mollify a stony heart.
The silly infants mournful cry
The fostering Nurse with songs does stay,
The Ploughmans whistling melody
Does pass away the painful day
The horse and Mule with sound of bell
Encouraged is to labor well.
The Head enfraught with frantike toies
The tuned strings do make full grave:
The heart oppressed and void of joy.
Will greatly joy Music to have
When study deep has duld the brain
Music will sharp the edge again.
We read how David played full trim
Before the holy Ark of God
And how his wife for mocking him
By sentence just was then forbod
For having Children any more
But barren should she be therefore.
The shepherds and the Angels eke
When that our Savior Christ was borne
With voice did laud that lamb so meek
That died for mankind without scorn
We ought to praise the Lord also
With musicks art in wealth and woe.
A song well set well sung with voice,
Or other music handled fine.
Far passes any earthly noise
Yea rather is a thing divine.
And some do writ that Music even
Does represent the joys of heaven.
Since Music is a science such,
That God will honored be withal
A fish and foul joys therein much
And every thing to nature thrall
Has he not then a stony heart
That can dispraise this noble art.
Love Music therefore in her use
Love Poetry void of abuse
Hear songs and Instruments sometimes
So as they lead not to ill crimes
And thus an end of Musicks praise
Which God advance in all our days.
FINIS.
A song in commendation of diverse instruments of Music.
PRaise the Lord O man mortal
Night and day upon him call
Sing and say both great and small
That God is good and just:
Search and seek the Scripture well
It does testify and tell
Every one in joy shall dwell*
That in the Lord does trust.
Take the sounding Trumpet shrill
Tabrell and the sweet Timbrill
Wind the Flute with right good will,
That Saints on earth may hear:
Let the Drummer strike amain,
Till our spiritual foes be slain
Then with joy retire again,
And serve the Lord in fear.
Bring the Bandora to blay,
Let the Bumberd come and Bray
Put not Dulcimers away
Nor pipes that praise the Lord,
Send the Cinfan and Simball
Sacbuts long and virginal
Let the Lute and Citterns small
Agree with one accord.
Hear the Crumpehorne and the Harp
Hoboise and the Regale sharp
Let the Vialls come and carpe
Our minds for to delight.
Sing with Shalmes and Psaltery
Play upon the Organes hie
Cause the Cornets for to cry
In skillfull peoples sight.
Learn in Gods word how you may
Use these Instruments in play
Putting the abuse away
That wicked men do use.
Let your mirth and Music, still
Be according to Gods will
Carnal lust for ever kill
On good things always muse.
March with Moses valiantly
Answer Miriam singingly
After Isreal's victory
On Pharaoh and his host:
Joy with joyful Iaell she
Debora and Baruck he
Who did Siseras downfall see
Of whom there was much boast.
Britain think on things of weight
Spaniards coming eighty eight
With the Powder plot conceit
Where of all sorts should taste
Dally not with God therefore
Trust not Papists any more
Banish them that blessings store,
May come to us in have.
Their Sins of Idolla-try
Our Sins of impiety
Both of them to God does cry
For vengeance night and day
Let us therefore now repent
And all our sinful ways lament
Let our minds to good be bent
And we shall live for aye.

A song against Fortune and those that have or do defend the same,
which may be sung to the Tune of: Fortune my foe* why do thou frown on me.
FOrtune shall been God nor guide of mine,
Fortune to thee, nothing I will resign:
Fortune thou art the heathens Queen and Princess
How should a Christian take thee for his Mistres.
Fortune some say she has a restles wheel,
Turning the same that men her power may feel
Fortune does give; and take life as a Princess,
Thus every way* is Fortune took for Mistres.
But shall I show the folly of this thing?
And credit have if I the truth do bring
Then give me leave and I will prove this Heathnesse
To be no Goddess Princess Queen or Mistress
Fortune what is it who can tell or show?
It is no God nor Angel this we know:
No man nor woman, no creature dumb or senceles,
No vice nor virtue to be made a Princess.
What world or work did Fortune make or frame?
What law or Gospel comes forth in her name?
Whom does she call to count with as a Princess?
Where will she reign when this worlds turned to ashes?
Sees no man can define what Fortune is,
Nor yet declare, her works of bale or bliss:
Sees none did ever see or know this Princess,
Why should a christian take her for his Mistres?
In God therefore, that made both Sa and land,
Heaven, earth, and all things with his mighty hand
In him alone, the father of all mercies,
I put my trust above all earthly Princes.
Fortune and Fancy, Hazz and Hap and chance
Venture and Destiny, Luck an ignorance,
God will destroy and call account of Princess,
Of young and old, of servants and of Mistres.
Fortune ye see then* is but even a name,
Which Heathen Nations, to themselves did frame:
Of profane people, only she is Princess,
And therefore christians should have no such Mistres.
Where God is known and truly known indeed,
There Fortunes name, is banished with all speed:
Ye a all gross sin, which does our God offend,
Which thing I praise, and so my song shall end.
FINIS.
A song or Ditty made on this theme I know not what, wherein is showed how men
ought not to set their minds on worldy pleasure but on the living Lord.
To the tune of Labandalashot: and does run on the names of them that gave
the theme, and his that made the song.
Who viewes the life of mortal man
His state and where of he began:
Shall find such hugy heaps of woe,
As neither tongue nor pen can show:
Wherewith our minds should daunted be
From using worldly mirth and glee
And move us to consider well:
What pains here are prepared in hell
For wicked people as their lot
which have done hear they know not what.
If every man would hear Gods word,
and reverently obey the Lord:
Then wickedness would not abound,
But grace and virtue would be found
In young and old in hie and low
In servants and in childre'n also
In rich and poor in great and small
In preachers and in people all
Who delight in this and that
And often do they know not what.
Look round about in each degree
And mark what crimes and faults we see
Behold the court and country too
And then note well what great a do
There is in every kind of state
Few are content with simple rate
But every one will elime aloft
Till trial has them plainly taught
It Is vain in hope of this or that
To say or do they know not what.
Love is not found but here and there,
Lewd lust does flourish every where:
Good laws are made but kept at will,
Loose living it increases still.
Like swine we wallow in the mire,
And seek to follow vain desire:
Let God or man say what they please
We hunt for pleasure wealth and ease,
And for the love of this and that:
We say and do we know not what.
In pomp and pride we do excel,
Like Lucifer the Devil of hell:
All new found fashions we do crave,
To make our bodies fine and brave,
But for our souls we little care,
Small suites for it we do prepare:
We guard and lace us round about,
In Iigges and Iagges we let it out.
Some will wear this, some will wear that,
And some will wear they know not what.
All whordome is but tricks of youth*
Say those that do not know the truth*
Not one of twenty when they wed,
Do bring unto the Marriage bed,
Their bodies pure as Christians ought,
But fleshly pleasure first is sought:
And for to cloak their filthy deed
They must be married with all speed.
Then they do live like Dog and Cat,
Because they did they knew not what.
Much swearing many a one does use,
And so the Name of God abuse
Some swear by wounds, by blood and heart,
By foot by sides and every part
By Mass by cross by light by fire*
By bread and all we can desire.
By faith and troth though they have none
By Saints and Angels many a one,
Some swear by this, some swear by that,
And some do swear they know not what.
Fie on the drowsy drunken sort,
that in excess delight and sport:
Fie on all ale-knights that will quaffe,
to make men drunk when they may laugh
Fie on all potmates that delight,
to serve God Bacchus day and night*
To them belongs red eyes and nose,
to them belongs the ragged clothes
For they still drink of this and that
until they do they know not what.
O when will covetousnes be left,
with fraud and guile deceit and theft:
Or when will usury take his flight,
with flattery falsehood craft and spite.
When shall the poor in good state live,
by helps and gifts that rich men give:
When will our Landlords be content,
to let their Farms at the old rent.
Alas they cannot hear of that,
But they would have they know not what.
See how the Sabbath is abused,
and all good exercise refused*
O see what pastimes men devise,
to please their carnal ears and eyes.
Few take delight to hear Gods word,
but like brute beasts they rise from board:
To dance to boule to gaud and game,
though preachers often reprove the same.
Some follow this, some follow that,
and some do follow they know not what.
The Dice and Cards esteemed be,
of rich and poor we daily see:
Till all is gone there is no stay,
but at the Dice it must away.
The married man the Batcheler,
the prentice and the traueler:
They follow gaming earnestly,
until they come to beggary.
Examples draw them not from that,
but still they do they know not what.
Enfor'st I am to tell you plain,
what sins among us still remain:
That true repentaance may abound,
while God in mercy may be found.
For time will come when we shall say,
what fools we were to go astray:
And if we knock it will be too late,
for we shall answered be at gate.
Depart from hence I know you not,
which have done here you know not what
Repentance God does not deny,
if we do ask before we die:
And put not of from time to time,
the amendment of each fault and crime.
And mark also what things are taught,
and print them in your mind and thought
Beat down your wills with wit and grace,
and foster not in any case:
Your leude attempts to this or that,
but in Gods word learn what is what.
In humble sort pray we, pray we,
unto one God and persons three:
O let us magnify his name,
and sound out praises to the same.
He has given us as may be seen,
a royal King, a Prince and Queen.
Nothing we lack in these our days,
wherefore let us walk in his ways
Regarding neither this nor that:
but seek to know still what is what.
Here will I knit up and conclude,
now will I end my verses rude
O you that are disposed to sing,
to read or hear this simple thing:
Desire of God and so will I:
That we may profit well hereby
Even for his son Christ's Jesus sake,
to whom let us our selves betake.
So shall all never be forgot,
for he will teach us what is what.
FINIS.
A song against slanderous tongues showing that no sort of good men did or
ever could escape them.
Who so thou be that live best,
and least of all deseruest blame,
That would pass through above the rest,
this world without reproach and shame.
Come mark and see and credit me,
all slanderous tongues would trouble thee
If thou could walk with God himself,
as Henoch did Noah by name:
If Shem and Iaphets bashfullnes,
were thine in hiding fathers shame.
Yet mark and see and credit me:
all slanderous tongues would trouble thee*
If thou had Abra'ms faith and trust,
with Isa'kes Jacobs and that train*
If Joseph's chastity thou had,
and providence for countries gain.
Yet mark and see and credit me,
all slanderous tongues would trouble thee.
If like to Deborah thou could be,
to Iael Baruck and the best:
To Gideon and to Ieptha he,
to Samson stronger than the rest.
Yet mark and see and credit me*
all slanderous tongues would trouble thee.
If thou had Samuels righteoushes,
with David's harp and holiness:
The love of Jonathan and those,
that Saul the king took for his foes.
Yet mark and see and credit me:
all slanderous tongues would trouble thee.
If thou in princely seat did sit,
to rule the Realm* with golden mace
If thou were Solomon in wit,
and came of hie renowned race.
Yet mark and see and credit me,
all slanderous tongues will trouble thee
If thou had all the cunning skill,
that ever learned man could have
If thou in godly exercise,
spend'st time until thou go to grave:
Yet mark and see and credit me,
all slanderous tongues will trouble thee.
If thou had all King Cressus gold,
and daily did the poor relieve:
If God and nature had bestowed,
on thee all gifts that they could give.
Yet mark and see and credit me,
all slanderous tongues will trouble thee.
If thou to Marriage giv'st thy mind,
a number then their fancies say:
Some like it well, some fault will find,
and some will dash it if they may.
In this good work still credit me,
all slanderous tongues will trouble thee.
If Virgin-like thou mean to live,
or if a Maiden course thou take:
If public, or if private life,
if lay or Clergy man thou make.
Yet mark and see and credit me,
all slandrous tongues will trouble thee.
Was not our Savior Christ thus used
of Jewish people to his face:
Were not the Prophets so abused,
and the Apostles in like case:
What good men now among us be,
that have from slandrous tongue bin free.
Then to conclude sees it is so,
that slandrous tongues all sorts will bite:
Let faith and patience be thy guide*
and let the Lord give them their right:
Till then pray thou to God with me,
to mend those tongues that slandrous be.
FINIS.
A song or ditty, showing the nature of the ambitious, and what is true
happiness, namely to live as that we may make a good end before death.
THe happy life in these our days,
That all does seek both small and great:
Is who may gain, or win the praise,
or who may sit in highest seat:
But in this life happ what happ shall,
the happy end exceeds all.
A good beginning often we see,
but seldom stands at one stay:
For few do like the mean degree,
then praise at parting some men say,
To death sees every one is thrall:
the happy end exceeds all.
To be as wise as Cato was,
or rich as Cressus in his life:
To have the strength of Hercules,
which did subdue by force and strife.
What helps it when Death does call:
the happy end exceeds all.
The longer life that we desire,
the more offense does daily grow:
The greater pain it does require,
except the Lord some pity show.
Wherefore I think and ever shall:
the happy end exceeds all.
The rich my well the poor relieve,
the rulers may redress much wrong:
The learned can good counsel give,
but mark the end of this my song.
Who shows good fruits happy I call,
his happy end exceeds all.
FINIS.
A song in dispraise of spite and envy.
To the tune of: Now leave and let me rest.
When spite has spent his worst,
and malice wrought his will
Then truth will try the just,
and sift the good from ill*
Though truth may hap be blamed,
by spite and spightfull parts,
Yet truth shall not be shamed,
for all their spightfull hearts.
For truth will try it self,
at length with honest fame:
When that the spightfull elfe,
shall hide his head for shame*
Spite is a spightfull sin,
with falsehood to prevail,
A spightfull fained friend,
has poison in his tail.
Spite spies out spightfull ways,
a true man to deface,
And laughs when he decays,
such is his spightfull grace.
Yet speak out spite and spare not,
to spend thy spite dispatch,
For all thy spite I care not,
nor for no spightfull wratch.
For when thy spite is spent,
and truth shall come in place:
Then shame thy self shall shent,
and show thy shameful face.
For truth shall still prevail,
in spite of spights ill mind:
Though spite spightfull* rayles,
as curres that bite behind.
God sendes them all mis-chance,
that spends such spightfull dross,
With falsehood to advance,
themselves with others loss.
For spite I little care,
let spite spy out his worst:
And make of spite no spare,
for in truth will I trust.
Since truth did never fail,
at length for his defense:
Against wrong to prevail,
for all his false pretense.
Use falsehood they that list,
in earnest or in gain:
A false man never mist,
for falsehood ^o have shame.
A sorrowful song or sonnet, wherein is lamented our miserable estate in this
life hunting after vanity.
To the tune of Labandalashot.
TO view the state of man's unrest,
I muse often times in mournful breast:
What causes him by sundry ways,
to seek for worldly pelf and praise.
What hope, what help, what tried trust,
what joy or stay in things unjust,
What sureance have we here to bide?
we come and go as does the tide:
And yet we take felicity,
to love this worldly vanity.
How many mischiefs may befall,
upon thy head O man mortal?
When thou in joy and iollitie,
do little think of misery.
Great heaps of heavy harmefull haps,
does lucklesly light in our laps:
The snatching snare of death is spread,
and man on so daine is struck dead:
Yea tract of time does plainly try,
this world to be but vanity.
O wicked Dives man of mold,
that had all pleasures twenty fold:
The Abuse thereof does record bear,
that thou would not impart nor spare
One farthing to the fatherless,
nor needy neighbors in distress:
Can riches bring thee back again,
out of this place of plunging pain:
Where thou in woeful waves must lie,
bereft of worldly vanity.
My mind is much dismayed to see
both high and low of each degree:
How cunningly their parts they play,
as though this world should last for aye:
The king in higher place would sit:
the subject thinks himself most fit,
To rule and reign in regal state
that in the sight of small and great,
He may be seen to sit on hie
amidst this worldly vanity.
All good advise and counsel grave,
which we in memory should have,
Is cast into oblivion
and clean forgot of eueryman,
Examples rare of Gods judgment*
will not procure us to repent:
His benefits we do abuse,
his sacred word we do refuse,
His mercies powered plenteously,
we do reject for vanity.
Such lawless Lawyers some there be,
that plea des on both sides as we see:
For many makes the matter sure,
and master Mendax will procure,
That you shall be dispatched with speed:
if you can help him at his need:
These prating parasites God knows,
which in the silly sheepe-skin goes:
Deceives men by flattery,
and all for worldly vanity.
Prepend the life of merchants eke,
how ventrously at sea they seek,
For their advantage many miles,
and then with sundry worldly wiles:
The simple sort they do deceive,
and so the web of sin thy weaue:
For that with oaths and countenance made,
the country people they persuade:
All ware is good of honesty,
when it is worse then vanity.
If we would think upon our state,
and in our selves be at debate:
A remedy there might be found,
to beat our sins unto the ground,
But we in wantonness do spend,
our life and livings to the end:
And havoc makes such wast and spoil,
that Lazers poor do starve the while:
Instead of hospitality,
is Bacchus bankets of gluttony.
Could swinish Sodom live more ill,
and be so bent to wanton will:
Or could Gommorra truly say,
that we live not so ill as they,
If we be judge our selves herein,
yet must we look to sink for sin:
Our careless life calls to the Lord,
for vengeance great of fire and sword:
We have no care to live godly,
but to delight in vanity.
From friends to flatterers we come,
from God to godlesnesse we run:
Of whoredom now is nothing made,
and drunkennnsse is no ill trade.
We jest it out when we defame,
our neighbors nothing worthy blame
Upon suspect revenge we will,
what so we do it is not ill:
To bear false witness wrongfully,
some are content for vanity.
Of sacred scriptures we will none,
for we can read the same at home:
Of ministers we have no care,
we do deride them here and there:
We loathe their learned exhortations,
which should be for our own saluations,
Such like reproachful words some use,
Gods messengers for to abuse:
For they reprove their iollitie,
and say it is but vanity.
Refrain the santasies dear friends,
ask mercy for your former sins
Account this world to be but lent,
praise God and always be content:
His benefits both great and small,
we must give reckning for them all:
Our time is short right well we know,
and none is sure when he shall go:
With speed then let us prepare to die,
for sure this word is vanity.
Death is the end of mortal life,
and death does cease all worldly strife:
He bridles up the brainsicke fool,
and does dispute in fancies school,
Where dainty damsels he does meet,
and laps them all in shrowding sheet:
All Adams amorous impes beside,
which deck them selves in pomp and pride:
With ugly face most tufully,
he takes them from their vanity.
If I might move the mind of man.
only in heart to way and scan:
How I have now in verse displaid,
nothing but truth in that is said.
Repentance sure with tears would call,
help Lord forgive thy people all:
O guide our steps still with thy word,
deliver us from evil good Lord,
Inflame our hearts with joys on hie,
so shall we hate all vanity.
In this song we are put in mind of our frail and weak estate, and we are
taught how to lull and bring asleep our affections that we may go to God.
To the tune of the 15. Psalm.
SIng lullaby as women do,
wherewith they bring their babes to rest*
And lulaby can I sing too,
as womanly as can the best.
With lulaby the child they still,
with sugared songs they sing out shrill:
Such wanton babes God knows have I,
that must be stild with lulaby.
First lulaby my youthful years,
it is now time to go to bed:
For crooked age and hoarie hairs,
have won the haven in my head.
With lulaby then youth be still,
with lulaby subdue thy will:
Since courage quails and comes behind,
go sleep and so beguile thy mind.
Next lulaby my wanton plays,
let reasons rule restrain thy thought:
Since that I find by sundry ways,
how dear thou have thy sporting bought*
With lulaby take thou thine ease,
with lulaby thy dumps appease:
Blessed is that wight which ere he die,
does sing aright this lulaby.
Now lulaby my gasing eyes,
that wonted were to glance apace,
For every glass may now suffice,
to show the furrows in my face.
With lulaby then wink a while,
with lulaby thy looks beguile:
Let no fair face nor beauty bright,
entice thee unto vain delight.
And lulaby my body eke,
which once was clad in trim attire
Warm furs to cloth thee now go seek,
in chayer keep thee by the fire.
And lulaby let some man sing,
while thou to God do make reckning:
Prepare thy self always to dye,
forget not this my lulaby.
With lulably then bring asleep,
despair which comes by mistrust:
And Satan's doubts which feign would creep
into our hearts that are but dust.
Put confidence in Gods mercy,
and evermore sing lulaby:
Commit thy self to Christ alone,
with him to joy when life is gone.
Last lulaby in grave we make,
amidst the greedy worms in clay:
Until that Christ account shall take,
of every one at the last day.
Wherefore let us sing lulaby,
till all his sins sleep quietly:
And then to God make have away,
in heaven with him to live for aye.
The lamentable moan of a sorrowful soul.
IN trouble thus I heard one cry,
Upon his knees with weeping eye,
Saying, O whither should I fly,
Where might I wish my self to be,
That God take no account of me.
For why my sins are grown so great,
That if I come to judgment seat,
In vain it is for to entreat,
A place therefore to hide me in,
I crave by reason of my sin.
If in the heavens I seek to be,
There must I needs be seen of thee,
In hell is no defense for me,
Thy presence fills each place I know,
In heaven above and earth below,
If I had wings at will to fly,
Beyond the seas that farthest lie:
Yet there thy hand and power is nie,
To bind and bring me back again:
In place where I should still remain.
Thou do possess me every whit,
My heart my raines my head my wit,
My sinews that my joints do knit,
Thou broughtst me from my mothers womb,
And thou shall raise me from my tomb.
Thy passing power thy works declare,
Thy threats show what thy terrors are,
Thou see all secrets every where,
My soul therefore that is in woe,
Alas then whether shall it go?
As I was in this great distress,
One spoke and said to me doubtless:
Despair not man through heaviness,
For God delights not to see,
The death of sinners credit me.
By faith on these words I took hold,
And yet I durst not be too bold,
But tremblingly as one acold,
I prayed and gave God thanks withal:
For comfort in such woe full thrall.
And thus I was received well,
As one releast from pains of hell,
My horror sure no tongue can tell,
Those pinching pains that I did feel:
Would surely break an heart of steel.
A Christian promise then made I,
And vowed a vow to God on hie,
That from henceforth continually,
His faithful servant I will be:
Which to perform Christ strengthen me.
You sinners obstinate and ill,
That daily do resist Gods will,
Give ear now to my crying shrill.
Amend your lives while you have space,
Or else you are in woeful case.
For our good King now let us pray,
The Lord preserve him night and day:
His counsel eke God keep for aye,
This Realm good Lord save and defend,
From every foe to the worlds end.
A ditty declaring the fervent desire of a christian soul.
To the tune of, O Lord of whom I do depend.
Sweet Jesus who shall give me wings.
of pure and perfect love:
That I may mount from earthly things,
and rest with thee above.
For here beneath I fly about,
in weak and weary case:
Like to the Dove that Noe sent out,
which found no resting place.
Even thou O Jesus by thy power,
must give me wings to fly:
Else shall I never know thy lure,
to stoop obediently.
Ne can I rise off from the fist,
of worldly pleasures vain
But stubbornely thy will resist,
to mine eternal pain.
My weary wings sweet Jesus mark,
and grant me my request:
Put forth thy hand out of thine Arc,
and take me to thy rest.
For sure with thee are endless joys,
and no man there laments:
But here with us are great annoyes,
whereof each one repents.
In heaven thy Saints do sing to thee,
without all strife and fear:
But we on earth at variance be,
and subject much to care.
Deggerly conceits and base,
O toys of deep contempt:
From which sweet Jesus by thy grace,
my silly soul exempt.
For I have learned to loath those things,
wherein I did delight:
And unto thee the King of kings,
I come with all my might:
Craving a place with thy great host,
where I may sing always:
To Father, Son, and holy Ghost,
all honor laud and praise.
Two most excellent songs or Ditties, made by Queen Elizabeth, as it is
credibly reported (and as it is very likely by some words in it) in the year
1588 When the Spaniard came to possess this land and is in manner of a prayer
to God.
DEliver me O Lord my God,
from all my foes that be:
And eke defend all Christian souls,
that put their trust in thee.
Preserve us now and evermore,
from all the wicked train,
Who long and thirst for Christians blood,
and never will refrain.
Mine enemies O Lord be strong
and thou the same do know:
And that without offense in me,
they seek mine overthrow.
My hope and help in all distress,
has ever been in thee:
And thou, O Lord, of thy goodness,
did still deliver me.
Come now and end this strife likewise,
the cause is wholly thine:
Wherefore to thee my self and suite,
I wholly do resign.
The other song of Queen Elizabeth made in manner of a thanks giving to God
for her and our deliverance from the invincible Navy of the Spaniard (as he
termed it) which thanks and praise was performed at Saint Paul's cross in
London.
Look and bow down thine ear O Lord,
from thy bright sphere behold and see
Thy handmaid and thy handy work,
among thy Priests offering to thee.
Ecco's resounding up the skies:
my self and scepter sacrifice,
My soul ascend his holy place,
ascribe him strength, and sing him praise:
For he restrains Princes spirits,
and has wrought wonders in our days.
He made the winds and waters rise:
and did destroy mine enemies.
This Jacobs head, this Isreal's God,
the fiery, pillar and the cloud:
Which kept the Saints from Pharoahs rod,
and drencht the honor of the proud:
He has preserved now in love,
the soul of me his turtle dove.
A Carroll for Christmas day,
To the tune of Rogeero.
WE come to sing of Christ our King,
According to the time,
Therefore prepare and give good ear,
Let hearts and all incline.
Divinity our chief Story,
which speaks of man's Salvation:
Shows that the Lord by his pure word,
made all good by creation.
Mankind did bear Gods Image fair,
the creatures all were blessed:
Then satan's evil made him a devil,
and he gave man small rest.
But tempted him by Eva's sin,
till Paradise was gone:
Thus they and we were left you see*
in fearful state each one.
Then God above in tender love,
to men that was but dead:
Said that indeed the woman's seed,
should break the Serpents head.
To Abraham to Isaac then,
to Jacob, and the Jews:
A covenant sure aye to endure,
God made of this good news.
Before their eyes in Sacrifice,
our Savior was displayed,
In figure, types and other rites:
on Altar he was laid.
To Priests, to Kings were showed these things
to Prophets and the rest:
Who did assure that Virgin pure,
should bear this heavenly guest,
Realms now in peace all wars did cease
John Baptist came to preach:
And he likewise did some baptize,
that heard when he did teach.
The time full come God sent his Son,
in shape of sinful flesh:
Thus God and man one Christ became,
our souls for to refresh.
Angels did bring news of this thing,
to Shepherds in the night:
To whom they said be not afraid,
at this so heavenly sight.
But go your way and make no stay,
Christ is at Bethelem:
Behold him there borne poor and bare,
for sin of mortal men.
Then gloriously from heaven hie,
the Angels they did sing:
Praise to Gods name, peace without blame,
on earth to men living.
Shepherds did go and found it so,
as Angels had foretold:
Christ meekly lay swadled in hay,
within the stable cold.
This child he is our souls chief bliss*
our tree of life and all.
Our Abell slain our Isaac plain,
our Joseph left in thrall.
Our paschall lamb that hither came,
for his dear Spouse to die,
Our Manna sweet our Rock so deep,
our Arc of Sanctuary.
Our mercy Seat our altar great,
ou Lamp and lauor fair,
Our priest our King and every thing,
that we might not despair.
What thanks and praise in all our days,
ought we and ours to give,
Unto Gods name that wrought the same,
Long time ere man did live.
This is the day of our great joy,
if we will joy therein:
And not assign this blessed time,
to vanity and sin.
But evermore in virtues store,
to spend our days aright,
Which God grant us through Christ Jesus,
to do with all our might.
Another Carroll for Christmas day: made as if it were spoken by Christ to Adam
and his posterity.
REmember O thou man, O thou man, O thou man
Remember O thou man, thy time misspent,
Remember O thou man how thou camst to me than,
And I did what I can, therefore repent.
Remember Adams fall, O thou man, O thou man,
Remember Adams fall from heaven to hell:
Remember Adams fall, how we were condemned all
To hell perpetual there for to dwell.
Remember Gods goodness O thou man O thou man
Remember Gods goodness, and promise made,
Remember Gods goodness, his son should come doubt less
Our faults for to redress, be not afraid.
The Angels all did sing, O thou man; O thou man,
The Angels all did sing on the Shepherds hill,
The Angels all did sing praise to our heavenly king,
And peace to man living with a good will.
The Shepherds amazed was, O thou man, O thou man
The Shepherds amazed was to hear Angels sing.
The Shepherds amazed was, how that should come to pass
That Christ our Mesias should be our King.
To Bethelem do they go, O thou man, O thou man
To Bethelem do they go these Shepherds three,
To Bethelem do they go, to see if that were so,
That Christ were borne or no to set us free.
As the Angels before did say, O thou man, O thou man,
As the Angels before did say it came to pass:
As the angels before did say, they found the babe where it lay,
In manger wrapped in hay, so poor it was*
Give thanks to God always, O thou man, O thou man
Give thanks to God always with hearts most jolly,
Give thanks to God always for this most joyful day,
Let all men sing and say, Holy, Holy, Holy.
A Carroll for S. Stephens day.
The holding of the same.
O Lord our God pour down thy grace,
and holy Spirit from heaven:
That we may celebrate aright,
Christ's birth as did Saint Stephen.
The Dittie it self.
When Jesus Christ ascended was,
into the heavens hie:
His twelve Apostles spent much time,
in praying earnestly.
And when the holy Ghost was sent,
they preached bold by skill:
The word of God in every place,
according to his will.
The number of the Church increased,
and grew exceedingly:
So that the Apostles lacked help,
in that their ministry.
Wherefore they chose seven worthy men,
of good report and fame:
That took the alms up for the poor,
the blind, the halt, and lame.
Saint Stephen that worthy Martyr he,
was one of them they chose:
A man full of the holy Ghost,
against whom there arose.
A proud sect of the Libertines,
that did envy him sore:
Still seeking him to persecute,
that he should speak no more.
They hired some to swear and say,
that Stephen spoke blasphemy:
Against the Lord and Moses law,
for which he ought to die.
Then to the Counsel he was brought,
to purge him of that crime:
Which thing he did most worthily,
before them at that time.
When they had heard these words and saw,
he feared not the chief:
Their hearts for anger burst and they,
gnasht on him with their teeth.
They gave a shout with voices loud,
and lead him straight away:
Then did they stone him unto death,
yet he for them did pray.
O Lord forgive their sin (quoth he)
and do my soul still keep:
Upon his knees he prayed thus,
and so did fall a sleep.
Such patience grant to us (O Lord)
and eke such constancy,
When for thy truth or otherwise,
we shall be brought to die.
A Carroll for Saint John's day.
The holding of the same.
BEfore the Lord now let us sing,
with all the joy we can:
That we may rightly celebrate,
Christ's birth with good Sainr John.
The Carroll it self.
According to Gods promise made,
in mercy to Mankind,
Christ Jesus came into the world,
as we in Scripture find.
Of whom the Prophets prophesied,
long time ere he was sent:
That he should be a Savior,
to all that do repent.
Our Savior Christ both God and man,
when these things ended were:
And he had led his life on earth,
the space of thirty year.
He did begin to call the twelve,
and taught them earnestly:
To preach his fathers will in all.
the Regions far and nie.
And as he walked by the Sea,
he saw both James and John:
The sons of simple Zebedie,
who was a fisherman,
Christ called them and they forthwith,
obeyed him and came:
Wherefore Apostles they were made,
to preach still in his name.
Saint John was borne by mothers side,
of great and royal stock:
Though he were once a fisherman*
and after fed Christ's flock.
He came of Mary Sallome,
of David's branch most dear,
And Sister to the Virgin pure,
that bare our Savior dear.
The words of this Evangelist,
has sounded every where:
Unto the comfort of all those,
that serve the Lord in fear*
Wherefore let us with cheerful hearts*
sing praises to Gods name:
And in our Christian life like John,
still imitate the same.
FINIS.
A Carroll for Innocents Day.
The holding of the Carroll.
Weeping and mourning there was heard
in Rama did complain:
That woeful woman Rachel she,
her children they were slain.
The words of the Carroll it self.
When that the eternal Son of God,
by providence divine,
Into this sinful world did come,
mankind for to redeem.
Then Bethelem Judah thought her self,
thrice happy and thrice blessed:
That she was found a worthy place,
to lodge that heavenly guest.
Wisemen there came from the East parts,
to worship this young King,
Far they had seen his star appear:
which did foretell this thing.
When Herod heard of this strange news,
O he was troubled sore:
And all Jerusalem with him,
they were in an uproar.
He called the Priests and asked them,
where this great King should be:
They answered at Bethelem,
if he would search and see.
In secret then did Herod call,
the wise men unto him:
To know what time the starr appeared,
of this the newborn king.
And when he knew the certainty,
he bid the wisemen go,
And bring him word that he might come,
and worship him also.
But in a dream God warned them,
the King not to obey:
Wherefore as they returned home,
they went another way.
When Herod knew of this he said,
this young King I will quail:
Ten thousand for his sake shall die:
with blood I will prevail.
The Infants young of two years old,
by Herod's camp were slain:
Their guiltless souls God has received
in Heaven with him to reign.
To Joseph then an Angel spoke,
in sleep as we may read:
Saying take Mary and the child,
and have away with speed.
To Nazareth then was Jesus brought
and there he nursed was:
Until such time as he was called,
unto an other place.
A Carroll for New years day setting out unto us the true circumcision of the
heart, with out the which the circumcision of the outward members was of none
effect.
To the tune of any ordinary Psalm.
Rejoice we in the Lord our God,
for this joyful new year:
And let our holiness of life,
from day today appear.
The law of Circumcision now,
we humbly call to mind:
Yielding most hearty thanks therefore,
to God that is so kind.
He made his son our savior Christ,
obedient to the law:
For us that disobedient were,
and would not live in awe.
Not to the end we should abide,
in sin as heretofore:
But that we might repent and pray,
henceforth to sin no more.
This law of circumcision first,
God gave to Abraham
And to the fathers every one
long time before Christ came.
As we have Baptism now in use,
so did they hold and keep*
This ordinance which was a sign,
between God and his sheep.
The badge, the mark, the Sacrament,
whereby all men did know:
They were his chosen people then,
and he their God also.
The eight day after that their sons,
into the world were borne.
The Priests did circumcise them all,
or else thy were forlorn.
The foreskinne of their privy parts,
with sharp knife they did pare:
And called the children by that name,
which then was given there.
The women children were contained,
under the males each one:
Wherefore they gave them not the sign,
of circumcision.
This signified and did set forth,
unto the peoples view:
The Circumcision of the heart,
in all Gods children true,
And this the Lord did often recite,
by all his prophets then:
And in like sort by Preachers now,
he shows it to all men,
That God may have his honor due,
and every man his own,
That Justice may be ministered,
to make the truth well known.
That help may still be granted to,
the blind the halt and lame:
The prisoners that afflicted are,
for Christ his truth and name.
Then shall we tightly hold and keep*
this day called New-yeares day:
By putting evil out of our hands,
the which God grant we may.
To whom be honor, laud, and praise,
from whom be given grace:
To us that we may magnify,
his name in every place.
The father, Son, and holy Ghost,
that ever loved us dear:
Increase true amity in us,
and send a good new year.
A Carroll for Twelfe day.
On the Feast of the Epiphanie. The holding of the Carroll.
CHrist manifested in the flesh,
to Jews and Gentiles all:
Still show himself to us and ours,
when we do cry and call.
The Carroll it self.
This feast of Christ's Epiphanie,
or open setting out:
Unto believing Gentiles all,
to put us out of doubt.
That he the God and Savior is,
of Jews and Gentiles too:
And makes one people of them both,
which none but he could do.
He now saluted is of kings.
of Magies sage and wise:
To Eastern Aethiopians,
his star did now arise.
This star it brought them to our Star,
in dawning of the day:
I mean to Christ whose gospel bright,
drives all dark clouds away.
They offer first to him fine gold,
to show he is a King:
They gave him Frankincense, and Mirrh,
which notes some other thing.
That he was man and that he had,
a sacrifice to give:
To God for all believing souls,
so long as men shall live.
Our spiritual King he is to rule,
our Priest and sacrifice,
Our Prophet for to teach us all,
till we be heavenly wise.
O Lord give grace to us therefore,
to yield obedience:
To thee, and to thy holy Word,
with all due reverence.
So shall we reap the fruits thereof,
in heaven an other day:
When we with God and Christ shall reign*
in everlasting joy.
Unto which joy he bring us all*
that are of his elect*
And now accept of this our praise,
with merciful respect.
FINIS.
A song reproving Papists for the Gunnepowder treason, and of our joy and
thankesgiving for our deliverance from that danger and all others.
Rejoice England and joy in him,
that joys each Christian heart,
With songs of praises never linne,
to laud him for your part,
Oh set, oh sing, and sweetly play,
Gods works in verse and prose:
Declare and show from day to day,
how he has flaine our foes.
Exalt Gods goodness to this land,
and to our late dear Queen:
That worthy Lady dead and gone
in heaven still, to be seen.
And now King James succeeds in place,
these kingdoms for to sway:
God grant that his posterity,
may do the like for aye.
As troubles do abide all men,
so much more godly Kings:
That do the gospel still maintain,
and all the fruit it brings,
King James has often in dangers been,
in Scotland as we know:
In England at his coming in,
he wanted not his foe.
Yet God in wondrous wise did save,
and well deliver him:
Yea made the Traitors to bewray,
their own intended sin.
The chief of them had their reward,
at Winchester that City,
When on some others of their crew,
the King showed royal pity.
But Satan and his Impes sleep not,
new plots they still devise:
As this which was of Gunpowder,
apparent to our eyes:
This hellish work this strange devise,
surpassing all the rest:
Has left a forehead mark for them,
that such we should detest.
These wanted neither friends nor coin,
on every side the seas:
To bring this business to pass,
the Papists hearts to please.
And if some of their multitude,
did never know of it:
Which of them would refuse to have,
what others won by wit.
All things with secrecy was kept,
and they were ready now:
To finish up with stroke of strokes,
their foul and wicked vow.
But God bewrayed it or their hour,
yea they one letter sent:
Which opened all to King and state,
and void was their intent.
It was a woeful thing they sought,
the cutting off of all:
A bringing of this noble land,
to beggary and thrall.
I am astonished many times,
to think on the invention:
And muse what men on earth there be,
that like of this intention.
Poor Protestants so called in scorn*
by Papists day and night:
You never went with Massacres,
the Papists to despite.
For if you had then Papists throats*
like trumpets shrill would be:
To rail and write in every place,
till your heart bloods they see.
In blood at first they founded were*
by blood thy live and thrive:
In blood they also grounded are*
devouring men alive.
Yet once they must confounded be,
in Gods great harvest day:
Wherefore fly Romish Babylon,
with all the speed you may.
In the mean time let Christians strive*
to serve the Lord on hie:
Remembering each deliverance,
with thanks continually.
Lord look on us regard and hear*
our prayers and our praise,
And let our thanks appear in life,
abhorring sinful ways.
Amen.
A Game at Chesse with the Papists, or a Ditty made on that game against them
and their evil practices.
YE Papists that can play at Chesse,
and guide your men in battle ray:
Your doings still do well express,
that you do hope to have a day.
And yet as close as you can play,
to check the King and all his state:
It is foreseen to your decay,
that check without neck of force is mate.
Your pelting paune you thrust before,
to make the way to work your feate:
Your knights and rookes you have in store:
your Queen and Bishop keep their seat.
Your king cat holly we may say,
in Brittanie he would rule the state:
No God nor man must say him nay,
yet check without neck of force is mate.
Your practice old to us well known,
does urge the wise and godly race:
Well to provide and save their own,
and eke your treasons to deface.
Although your paunes do check his grace,
the knights with neck set them agate,
And did well weigh in time and place,
that check without neck of force is mate.
Your Iugling gins and sleights most sly,
are no more seen then nose on face:
And that in the'nd ye shall well try,
when you do hope they shall take place,
You shall be forced to run apace,
for that we watch early and late:
Well to provide and have in chase,
that check without neck of force is mate*
The check that you to us have sent,
to neck most easly are always:
All though to checking you are bent,
and we by necking win the praise.
Now check says Parsons and there stays,
now neck says Sutlife to thy pate:
And gave to them without delay,
a passing pure and plain check mate.
Although your learning will not serve,
to give to us a check indeed:
From old practice you do not swerve,
your bloody hearts to fat and feed.
Your powder plot makes all your seed,
to be abhorred of Church and state,
For that there by all at one blow:
you meant to us, check and check mate.
O Lord for Jesus Christ his sake,
keep clean and pure thy church to the end
That we by faith may undertake,
all truth in thee to comprehend.
Our King and realms good Lord defend,
against all those that would us check:
That we on thee may so depend:
to have always a speedy neck.
Amen.
An exhortation to praise God for that worthy science and skill of Music and
for the great masters of the Art and their worthy works.
PRaise God in whom only is found,
the fulness of all skill:
And from whose wisdom floes the stream,
of knowledge at his will.
Praise him therefore for Musickes art,
a science of the seven,
Which cheares the minds of men on earth*
and Joys the Saints in heaven.
Praise him for Iubal and the rest,
that first did find and frame:
The ground and principles whereby,
we teach and learn the same.
Praise him for silver trumpets twain,
that he bad Moses frame:
For Isreal's rising up to train,
and resting by the same.
Praise him for David's book of Psalms,
and for the songs of praise,
That Solomon did make and write,
in his most royal days.
Praise him for Azaph and the rest,
whom David set to sing:
In presence of the holy Arc,
when Solomon was king.
Praise him for all the songs and play,
left us by learned men,
Who by their studies night and day,
did much with ink and pen.
Praise him for those that love this Art,
and do the same maintain:
Rewarding it with willing heart,
among the godly train.
Praise him and pray that all abuse,
there of may hated be:
And that the godly and right use,
may rest in each degree,
Praise him and pray that those of skill,
may live in Har-mo-ny:
And bring up youth with favor still:
this art to dignifie.
Praise him and pray for our good King,
his Nobles and the rest:
Our Queen the Prince and the offspring,
Lord let them all be blessed.
Praise him, yea ever sing him praise,
on earth most joyfully:
That after death our souls may sing,
his praise eternally.
Amen.
