FLOVRES FOR LATIN SPEAKING SELECTED AND gathered out of Terence, and the
same translated in to English, together with the exposition and setting
forth as well of such latyne words, as were thought needful to be annoted,
as also of diverse grammatical rules, very profitable and necessary for the
expedite knowledge in the latin tongue: Compiled by Nicolas Vdall.

Nicolai Vdalli carmen end casyllabum ad libellum suum.
SI certum est tibi pertinax libelle
In multas hominum manus uenire,
Doctorumque libet subire nasum,
Sannas, uerbera, iurgium, cachinnos,
Perme sit tibi liberum uagari.
I quocunque uoles tuo periclo.
Securus poteras domi latere,
Et mecum poteras manner tutus.
Nunc es publicus, haud meus libellus.
Nec possum tibi iam patrocinari,
Nec suffragi, gratiamque uulgi,
Aut uitam, geniumque polliceri.
Orbis sed tibi, multitudinis que
Standum iudicio, uel est cadendum.
Ioannis Lelandi Londinensis decastichon.
Ca^didus exacta^ monstrare Tere^tius arte^
Eloquij nouit Roma diserta tui.
Illius ex horto flores selegit amoenos
Vdallus cupidae sedulus instar apis.
Quoque labor pueris studiosis gratior esset,
Transtulit in patrios uerba latina sonos.
Insuper et scholion, facu^dae munera linguae,
Addidit, aeterna uiuere digna cedro.
Vos igitur iuuenes Vdallu^ ornate Britanni.
Sic fluat e uestro comicus ore lepos.
Edmundi Ionsoni carmen in laudem operis.
Barbary lingua^ pulsa qui scire latina^,
Quique breui fieri te^pore doctus aues,
Hu^c lege Romani flores sermonis habente^
Non alius quales hortulus edit opes.
Hunc lege, qui lepidi uerissima sensa Tere^ti
Promit, et obscuros explicat art locos.
Hu^c lege, quam nitidus, limatus, dulcis amoenus
Verba loqui ueteru^ more latina docet.
Vdallo meritas tali pro munere grates.
Aeternum digno uiuere, lector age.
Nicolaus Vdallus suauissimo discipulorum suorum gre^gi salutem plurimam dicit.
QVANQVAM initio quidem, ut ingenue fatear, non mea uoluntate ad hanc docendi
prouinciam capessenda^ inductus, sed partim assiduis, eisdemque importunissimis
amicorum quorunda^ solicitationihus efflagitationihus que compulsus, partim
nescio quo meo fato protrusus uideri poteram, nunc tamen, postquam egregia
quorundam uestrum indoles luculentam sane minime que duhitatam spem ostendit,
fore aliquando, ut ad insignem aliquam eruditionem euadatis, tantum abest, ut
me instituti, coeptique poeniteat, ut nihil profecto hodie prius habeam, aut
antiquius. Quapropter quam sort nactus sum spartam, ornare, prout Graecorum
prouerbiu^ admonet, mihi proposui, planeque constitutum habeo, superis been
iuuantibus, in hanc gnauiter curam incumbere, insigniterque in eo elaborare, ut
uos ex immanissimis barbariei faucibus quamprimum eripiam, atque ex tenebrosa
obstrusaque inscitiae caligine uindicem, ad politioris literaturae puritatem,
lucem, claritudine^. Nec dici me hercule potest, qua^to desyderio flagrem,
quantaque quum omnium qui literis sunt dediti, tum uestris, duntaxat honestis
et rectis, studijs proficiendi cupiditate ardeam. Iam inde enim ab eo tempore,
quo in meam uos scholam, et disciplinam recaepi, parentis erga uos animum
induisse me fateor, semperque existimasse in eorundem me locum succedere, a
quibus traditi mihi ad instituendum estis. Quod cum ita sit, ut est, quam mihi
rem gratam, et iucundam, quam porro laetabilem, et gloriosam putatis fore, si
uos aliquando ad eas in disciplina uires accrescere, et peruenire uidero, ut
exuperatis euictisque istis grammaticarum praeceptionum, et rudimentorum
difficultatibus, ac uelut salebris, ad iucundissimam, ea^demque multo uberrimi
fructus latinorum authorum lectionem studium transfer ualeatis. Ad hanc autem
maturitatem cum animaduerterem non alia demum ratione perueniri posse, nisi si
quis in promptu iam ante, et ad manum habeat bonam, atque adeo diuitem latini
sermonis supellectilem, sedulo equidem mihi faciundum putaui, ne uobis deesset
unde ea potissime facultas parari possit, et latini sermonis copia, puritas
nitor, elegantia, nullo, aut certe quamminimo negotio perdisci. Scripsi itaque
uobis suauissimi tyrunculi quasdam latin loque^di formulas, ad cotidiani
sermonis usum et copiam sane quamaccommodatissimas. Eas uero ex Publii Terentij
potissimum comoedijs delegimus, quod is scriptor ad informandam, instruendam
que linguam puerilem maxim omniu^ idoneus, citraque controuersiam facile
princeps uideatur, utpote per quem ipsum Tullium Ciceronem, summum alioqui
latinitatis magistrum, ad tantu^ eloquentiae fastigium profecisse constet, id
quod quum ipsemet de se fatetur alicubi, imo potius gloriatur, tum scripta eius
ubique tantum non clamant. Porro latina ipse anglice interpretatus sum, quo uos
quoque latina uernacule, aut e contrario latin uernacula absque molestia uel
negotio, et cum aliqua ratione ac gratia, nec interim ineptis prorsus atque
absurdis, quod plaerique faciunt, sed appositis et accommodatis uerbis reddere
addiscatis. Neque uero putetis uelim nullum esse operae precium, si quis latina
apt in maternum uertere sermonem calleat. Nam si Cicero quaedam ex Graecis tam
poetis, quam oratoribus, ac philosophis, latin interpreta^do, quae in suos
referret libros operae precium existimare se fecisse non nusquam gloriatur, si
Terentius plus sibi laudis statuit, maioremque gloriam posuit in uertendis
Graecorum antiquis fabulis, quam inueniendis suis nouis, si ide^ Terentius rem
nihilo minus ingeniosam arbitratus est ex bonis graecis bona latina facere,
quam si ipse de suo noua excogitasset, quae scriberet, et posteris legenda
traderet, si denique ingenij argumentum, et non postremae laudis opus
existimatur, bona uernacula sic uerbis latinis mutare, ut interim seruetur
utriusque linguae idiotismus, et gratia, qui minus id quoque e diuerso maximae
laudi dari par sit, et uel summi artificis opus haberi conueniat, ex bonis
latinis scilicet reddere bona uernacula? Verum, ut redeam qui coepi tendere,
nec iusto diutius in hijs haeream, imo consilij uobis factique mei rationem
compendio expediam, addidi, sicubi opus id esse uidebatur quaedam uelut
scholia, quibus tum sensus poetae explicetur, tum uerba ipsa non paulo
declarentur apertius. Si qua insignis aut elegans incidit metaphora, indicaui.
Si qua figura occurrit, admonui. Si qua fabula interuenit, non sum grauatus
altiuscule repetitam narrare. Si quid quod ad latinitatem egregie faceret, sese
obtulit, non commisi, ut praeteriretur silentio. Si quid ad rationem
grammaticam pertinere uisum est, non piguit enucleare. Si quid prouerbij
interspersum est, exposui. Si quod uocabulu^ obscurius iudicatu^ est,
illustraui. Si qua formula a communi, uulgarique, et usitata latin loque^di
ratione paulo alienior apparuit, rationem, reddidi, citatis, ubi res posceret,
atque adhibitis ex optimis quibusque et probatissimis authorihus exemplis ac
testimonijs. Denique ut finem tandem faciam, quicquid usquam obiectum est, quod
puerile ingenium iudiciumue retardare in legendo posse uidererur, quantumuis id
humile foret aut leave, sedulo adnotaui, uestris scilicet studijs quamoptime
consultum cupiens, omnibusque omnium uestrum commodis nusquam non libentissime
deseruiens. Proinde haec quidem, quae commemoraui, omnia, pingui, quod dicitur,
crassaque ac rudi Minerua tradidi, et uereor, ne quorundam opinione, iudicio,
sententiaque, nimis etiamnu^ anxie, nimis scrupulose, nimis denique, ut it a
loquar, frustulatim persecutus sim, utique dum singula ad iudicij uestri
immaturitatem, et captus teneritudinem attempero. Sed nimisquam mihi, in
hocduntaxat negotio, placuit illud, quod dici solet, indoctius modo apertius,
praesertim, cum scirem quam maxim opus esset, nil nisi uelut praemansum uobis
in os inseri. Porro ipsum opusculu^ FLORES TERENTII libuit inscribere, quoniam
hae formulae, quas uobis iam nuncupamus, ex eius poetae lepidissimis iuxta
atque elegantissimis comoedijs, quasi horto quodam fragrantissimo, et ad
miraculum uario, amoenoque topiario, ordine omnes selectae sunt, et excerptae.
Hiis igitur laborum nostrorum quasi primitijs fruimini, ta^quam arrabone, ac
pignore tum nostri erga uos summi amoris, tum officij ac fidei. Quodsi prodesse
haec conducereque uestris studijs intellexerimus, alia, fauente Christo,
dabimus propediem altiora, at que maiora. Vestrae autem parts erunt suauissimi
tyrones, omni, quod aiunt, pede stare, omnibus ingenij neruis contendere, ac
modis omnibus curare, ne nostros sudores laboresque frustremini, ne ue nostrum
hoc tantum oleum et operam eludatis, sed potius, ut conceptae de uobis tum
spei, tum expectationi possitis per omnia respondere. Valete.

ANimum ad scribendum appulit, He applied his mind to wrytinge.

Id solum negotij credidit sibi dari: He thought he should have had no further
busynes but that.

Multo aliter euenire intelligit. He perceyueth hit much otherwise to chance

antepenultima. Duae, inquiens, parts orationis cum coniunctae, vnam fecerint,
mutant accentum. Interealoci ergo.i. interea, in the mean while, in the mean
time or space.

Post illa.i. ab eo tempore. Sins that time. Li nacre in his.vi. book, which
is entytled De figuris constructionu^, of the figures of construction,
understands tempora, and like wise in post ea, and says that in these and
such other manner of spekynges, as Ex quo, ex eo, ex illo, post ea, post illa.
etc. is eclipsis of this nowne tempus, as in these examples Verg. Ex quo
Tytides. Idem. Ex illo fluere, ac retro sublapsa referri. Suetonius in the life
of Domitius. Neque cessauit ex eo struere insidias fratri. for ex quo, illo, et
eo tempore, and like wise in such as this. Verg. Ante expectatu^ positis stat
in agmine castris. for ante expectatu^ tempus. But as Thesaurus linguae latinae
notith, and also the same Linacre in an other place, Post illa, is an aduerbe
of time, or used aduerbsially and is made one word of twain by submission,
like as interea loci, next before.

Mea consilia tibi credo omnia. I commit all my secrets unto you, or, I

Matter mea illic mortua est. My mother dyed there.

Aliquantum ad rem est auidior. He is somewhat covetous for to get money.
Laurentius Vallensis in the first book of his elegancies and the.16. chapitre
says, that these ad verbes, Tantum, quantum, aliquantum, multum, paulum, with
others like be joined with positiues, and words of like signification with
positiues, as tantum probus, quantum doctus, as honest, as well learned, quantum
potes, tantum elabora, labor so much as thou may. Tanto, quanto,
aliquanto, multo, paulo, with others like be joined with comparatifes, as Cic.
quanto es mayor, tanto te geras summissius.

The higher or greatter man that thou art, so much the more lowely behave thy
self. Yet this notwithstanding (says Valla in the place above alleged) for
as much as the said words tantum, quantu^, aliquantu^ etc. are changed into
the nature of aduerbes, therefore they may sometimes be used for tanto, quanto,
and the others ending in O. specially if there be not such contraposytion of
two diverse things, that is to say, express and plain setting of one
contrary against an other.

tense.

affirmation or granntynge, as well appears in the translation of Aristotle's

etc. Linacre in the vi. book of his latyne grammar, which is entitled of the

in their journey go clean out of their way. Erasmus in Chil.

Hoc nouum est aucupium. This is a new craft to get a lyuinge, or to get
money, a metaphore taken of foulynge, or taking of foul. For Auceps proprely
is a fouler, and Aucupium is foulynge, and by a metaphore it is used for all
manner of ways to get any thing by wyles, trains, or craft, and it is
derived of the verb aucupor, aris, to go a foulynge and to take birds, and by
translation aucupari laudem, is to go about to get preise and commendacion,
aucupari quaestum, to go about to get money.

Ego hanc primus inueni uiam. I was the first that found out this way, or, I

and by the trace. Plaut. in truculento. Haec una opera circum it per familias,
puerum uestigar, She goes all under one to every man's house, and traceth the

quod cum desidiosa delectatione uestiges, The very handelinge or exercise and

Heautontimorumeno. Nihil est tam difficile, quin quaerendo inuestigari possit,

does order it thus, Prae ut sc illa sunt, quae huius rabies dabit.i. faciet,
patrabit, monstrabit, ostendet. Prae, somtymes is very elegantly used
importynge a certain respect and comparacion to an other thing. Terence in
this comedy a little before. Ibi ego illum co^tempsi prae me, Than did I nothing
regard him in comparison of my self. And in this significacion prae is often
times (specially in Plaut. and Terence) found compou^de with quam, and ut, as
Hadrian has noted. Exemples, prae alone having an ablative case after him.
Plaut. in Mostellaria. Video te nihili pendere omnes homines prae Philolache, I
see that you fette by no man in co^paryson of Philolace. Ide^ in Mil. Prae
illius forma quasi spernas tua^, As who says you set not by your beauty in

Indede you are not void of some troubles, or without some care, but yet in
comparyson of me blisfull, or, in heaven.

Prae quam, Plaut. in Aulul. Sed hoc etiam pulchrum est prae quam ubi sumptus
petu^t, But this is even a goodly or ioyly thing, in comparyson of when they
require cost, charges, or expense of money. Idem in Amphitryo. Parua res est
uoluptatum in uita, prae quam quod molestum est, There is small pleasure in
this life in comparison of the troubles and cares that be in the same. Prae ut.
Plautus in Mil. Nihil hercle hoc quidem est, prae ut alia dicam. Nay this is
nothing in comparison of other things that I woll tell or show you. Ide^ in
Amphit. Parum etiam prae ut futurum est praedicas, Thou say or spekest eue^
very little, or in manner nothing, in comparyson of that that shall be in deed.
Idem in Menech. Modestior nunc quidem est de uerbis, prae ut dudum fuit, He is
now sobre in his words in comparison of that he was right now, or a little
while agone. Idem in Merc. Pentheu^ diripuisse aiunt Bacchas, nugas maximas
fuisse credo, prae ut quo pacto diuersus distrahor, They say, or, it is a
saying, that the women that did sacrifice unto Bacchus, did tere one Pentheus
all to peaces, but I think verily it was but a very small matter and a trifle
in comparison of this how diversely or how many ways my heart and mind is now
as who should say, pulled in peaces and torn in sundre. The fables do
report that there was one Pentheus king of the Thebans, whose father was
called Echion, and his mother Agaue, This Pentheus despised the sacrifice of
Bacchus the god of wynes, wherefore his own mother Agaue cut or stroke of his
head, And his systers with the other company of women, which than did
celebrate the feast and sacrifice of the said Bacchus, tore his body and
members all to peaces.

Vt illum dij deaeque senium perdant. God and all the saints in heaven give
that old churl a mischief, or, a vengeance light on that old churl, I pray
god and all the saints in heaven. Vt here, and in such other like manner
spekinges is taken for, Vtinam, execrando uel optando, in cursyng or bannyng or
wishing. Plautus in Persa. Vt istum dij deaeque perdant, God and all the
saints give this knave a mischefe. Idem in Mostellaria: Vt dij deaeque omnes
me pessimis exemplis interficiant, nisi ego illam interfecero siti fameque,
atque gelu, I pray god and all the saints send me the most shameful death
that may be to the example of al others, if I do not surely kill her up with
thirst, and hu^gre, and cold. Se moo examples in Hadrian, De sermon latino.
Further note that in this word, Senium, is emphasis, which is a figure either
when something, that is hidden and not spoken, is meaned, or else when it is
spoken for a more express, plain, and strong setting out and expressing of a
thing: which may be many ways, but the principal and most elegant way, is
when a substantyue is set for an adjective, that is to say when any quality
is put for the person that has the quality: as, scelus, ungraciousness, pro
sce lesto, for one that is ungracious, and so here Senium, agednes, or old
age, pro seen, for him that is old. For (as Donatus says) Senex, is referred
too the age of years, senium, to the contumelyouse, and dispytefull, and
contemptuouse words. And therefore I english, illum senium, that old churl.

where note that al be it that seniu^, is the neutre gendre, yet it has
joined with him an adjective of the masculyne gendre, and the relatyfe that
comes after is also put in the masculin gendre. For (as Donatus witnesses)
the gendre both of the adjective and also of the relatife is referred to the
thing that is understand, that is to say, senem, or, hominem senem, So
Terence in the prologue of this second comedy. Eas se non negat personas
transtulisse in Eunuchu^ suam ex graeca, He says not nay, or, he does not
deny, but that he took the same parts that are in the greek comedy, from
thens into this his comedy entitled Eunuchus. Eunuchum is the masculine
gendre, and yet because there is meaned by it comae diam, therefore the
adjective suam, is put in the feminine gendre. Idem in Andr. Vbi illic.i. ille
scelus est, qui me perdidit? where is that ungracious knave, that has cast me
away? Idem in Adelphis. Festiuum caput, qui omnia sibi posthabe^da putarit
esse prae meo co^modo, The gentylest companion or the most honest or best
fellow alive, which could find in his heart to let all other things
alone, or to set all other things a part in respect of my co^modite and
pleasur or for my comodite and pleasure. By caput is understand Eschinum, and
therefore the relatife qui, having respect and relacion to the person that is
meaned, and not to the substantyue, that is expressed is put in the masculin
ge^dre and not in the neutre ge^dre.

Me remoratus est. He caused me to tarry, or, tarried me or hyndred me of my
way..i. detinuit me.

Qui illum non floccifecerim. That I set so much as a straw or a rusche by
him.

Floccus is any little ragge of a lock of woulle the which as unprofitable,
and the which woll serve for no thing, is pulled from the flice and cast
away and flies away, or some like thing of no value, price, nor estimation,
whereof the latin men, wha^ they wol signify or show that they set nothing
by a man or any other thing, use to say prouerbially. Flocci non facio, or
else Flocci facio i^differently. For which we englishmen in a like proverb
say, I set not the left straw or rusch under my foot by it, or I set
not the lest here in my heed by it, al be it for this later, both the greeks
and latin men have a peculiar pronerbe taken of the same thing, Pili non facio.
I set not a here by it.

Quid tu es tristis? why are your sad?

Quid tu es alacris? why are your merry?

Mihi uel ui, uel clam, uel precario fac tradas. See that thou get it me or in
to my hands either perforce and by strenghte of hands, or else by preuye
conueyaunce and stelthe, or else of lone for a little while, and than to be
restored home again. For precarium carij, is that thing, which is by prayer
instaunce and petition granted to any body to use, to occupy, or to enjoy so
long as it shall please and co^tente the party, that does so lend or
grant it, and no longer. So Alexander, apud Q. Cur. says, Mori prestat quam
precario imperator esse, Better it is to dye than to be a captain or a king at
the pleasure of other men and no longer. Ibide^. Precariu^ spernebatur
imperiu^, He set nothing by that pouer, dominion, or rule, which should
continue so long as pleased them that gave or granted it, and no longer. And
under this meaning did Seneca say, hominem esse precarij spiritus, That the
life of man does continue at the pleasure of nature, fate, or destine, which
take it away when they woll, and not when pleases us. Of this the nown
precario, in the voice and terminacio^ of the dative case is used aduerbially
in the same significacion, Pau. iureco^su. Precario he^re uidet quam
possessione^ corporis ul iuris adeptus est hac solu^modo causa, quoth adhibuit
preces and impetrauit, quod sibi possidere aut uti liceat, ueluti si me
precario rogaueris, ut per fundum meum ire uel agere liceat, uel ut in tectum
meum stillicidium, uel tignum in parietem immissum habeas. A man to have a
thing precario (says Paulus) seems to be when any body has obtained and
gotten the possession of any body or bodyly thing, or of any right and title
to any thing only for because he made request and instaunce for the same, and
thereby has obtained, that it may be lefull for him to possess or to use and
occupy it, as if you should make request and instaunce unto me, and desire me
that you might for a while as long as it should please me, to have a way or to
goo through my ground, or to do any thing therein, or else that you might have
a little gutter or synke to come by my house, or else to have a rafter, a logge,
or a beam set within or upon the wall of my house. Plinius de uiris
illustribus. Seruius Tullius, quasi praecario regnare coepit, sed recte
imperium administrauit, Seruius Tullius began at the first to reign in the
city of Rome as who should say, precario, that is at the will and pleasure of
the people, and as long as they would permit and suffer him and no longer,
but yet afterward he ordered and ruled the same Impire well enough. Plinius in
epistolis. Quibus ex causis precario studeo, studeo tamen. For which causes I
study only when please them, or as long as they wol suffer me, and yet some
study I have. Cic. in the oration, pro Aulo Cecinna. Ne id quidem satis est,
nisi docet ita se possedisse, ut nec ui, nec clam, nec precario possederit, But
yet that is not sufficient or enough, neither except he plainly show and
declare, that he had it so in his possession, that he held it neither by force
and strength, nor privily and unknowing to the owner, or else that he had it
lent him for a season to be restored home again, when it should be required.
For that be the three ways unlawfully to keep away any thing of an other
man's. And Precario in this significacion may, be vsid aduerbially in many
diverse and sondrie manner spekynges. For precario co^cedere, is to lend or to
grant a thing till you shall require it again. Precario petere uel rogare, is
to desire to have a thing as long as may please the owner, and than make
surrendre and redeliuerie of the same, when it shall be required.

Neque quenquam esse homine^ arbitror, cui magis bonae felicitates omnes
aduersae sient. And I think, there is no man alive, that has al good fortune
and chances more against him, than I have. These two words homo quisquam, be
often times elega^tly thus joined to gether, not withsta^dyng that quisquam alone
by it self signifies as much as homo quisquam. Liuius ab urbe cond. Victoria
cui nec deus, nec homo quisquaminuideat, A victory, at which neither any of

Nonne hoc monstri simile est? Is not this like a very monstre? or, is not this
a very strange thing? Mo^strum, i, o, is deriuied of monstro, as, aui, are, to
show whereof. Mo^strum is any thing, that in signifienge any other thing,
does show it, Cicero de natura deoru^: Monstra, praedictiones, et prae
sensioues rerum futurarum quid aliud declarant, nisi hominibus ea, quae futura
sunt, portendi, praedici, ex quo illa ostenta, monstra, porte^ta, prodigia
dicu^tur, These strange tokens or shewingis, propheciengis, and foreknowingis
and fore perceyuinges of thingis to follow and come: what other thing do they
declare, but such things as shall in deed follow after, to be before signified,
betokened, and showed unto men, and by reason thereof, such or the same thyngis
be called in latin ostenta, monstra, portenta, or prodigia. And therefore
Vergil used mo^strum for and instead of the nowne verbal monstrario. Monstra
deum refero, I make relacion unto you of such things, as the goddis have
showed unto me. But because that such things, for the most part, are noted
by strange sightes and chances (which not only in our english tongue, but
also in all other tongues for the most part ar called monsters after the latin
word) Therefore monstru^ is most commonly used and taken for all such thingis
as ar contrary or against the common order and course of Nature, either in
defaute and lackyng, orels in exceeding, as to have two thummes upon one hand,
or to be borne the hele standing in the place of the toes, or to be borne
without a nose, with others like.

Iocari and iocus be proprely in words, ludere and ludus in deeds. Al be it
they be in authors co^funded, that is to say the one used for the other, as
Valla proves and shewith by examples i^ the forsaid place.

Flagitium facimus. We do, or, we should do an heinous offense. Facere
flagitium, is to commit, to perpetrate or to do an heinous offense, or a great

flagitij est? C. Crepuerunt clare. This door did a great trespass right now. Ad.
what great or heinous offense is that? C. It gave a great loud crack, or it

Nunquam defugiam authoritatem. I wol not do ageynste your authorite, That is,

commandment. Defugere authoritatem is to avoid, and (as who should say) to be
aferde to follow and to do that thing that any person has authority to
co^mande, orels may do by authority. Cic. pro P. Sylla. Tu remp. reprehendis,
quae domesticos hosts, ne ab ipsis ipsa necaretur, necauit. Itaque attend iam
Torquate, quam ego defugiam authoritate^ consulatus mei, Thou reproueste the
common weal, for that it has put to death familiar ennemies and rebellious,
that were within the city, lest that by them it self might have be^ oppressed
and brought to utter confusion and desolation. Therefore o Torquate, se now and
mark well, how greatly I am aferde to stand by that that I did by or in the
authority of mine office of Co^sulshyp, as who should say, se that I am not
aferde to stand by it, and that I do not now repent or go from that that I
did, when I was Consul, in sleinge Catiline and puttyng him to death. etc. as by
the place in Tully, the judgment of a diligent reder may well se.

Qui habet salem, qui in te est.i. sapientiam et le porem. Who so has the
wisdom and pleasant facion, that you have. Donatus expounds Salem.i.
sapientiam, wisdom. Where he notes that sal, neutraliter condimentum
significat, masculinum pro sapientia accipitur uel ponitur. Al be it sal, when
it is latin for salt, is both the masculine and also the neuire ge^dre in
both nu^bris. Cato in, re rust. Ex sale qui apud Carthaginenses fit Of the salt
that is made in the parties about the cite of Carthage. Salu. in Iug. Neque
sale^, neque alia gulae irritamenta, Neither salt, nor any other things to
provoke the appetite. Columel. Carne^ salibus aspersam, Flesh over cast with
salt. Paul. iur. con. Cotem ferro subigenda^, necessaria quoque hostibus
uenu^dari, ut ferru^, and frumentu^, and sales, non sine capitis periculo
licet, It is not lefull under the pain of death, to sell to our enemies either
a whetstone to make any knyfe sharp, or any other necessaries, as iron, or
knyues, and wheat and salt. etc. Sal, by translation is taken pro urbanitate,
lepore, uenustate, ioco, Good and pleasant fashon, and merry co^ceytes both in
words and otherwise, as here in this place of Terence. And Catullus: Nulla in
tam magno est corpore mica salis, There is not one crum or drop of good
fashon in all that great royles body. For Catullus there speaks of a certain
maiden, that was called Quintia, whom many esteemed and called fair,
beautiful, and goodly. In deed (says Catullus) I grante that she is white of
skin, tall, and slendre of making, and bolte up right, but that she is
formosa, that is fair or beautyful, that I deny, for there is no manner
pleasauntenes nor good faciou in her. The verses of Catulles be these: Qui^tia
formosa est multis, mihi ca^dida lo^ga

Recta est, haec ego sic singula confiteor. Totu^ illud formosa nego na^ nulla
uenustas,

Nulla in ta^ magno est corpore mica salis.

Salis.i. uenustatis, leporis, plesa^tnes, grace, and propre feture, or good
facio^ in her gesture, behauior, or pleasant words, which may delight the^ that
se her, here her, or be in her company. Plau. in Ca. Nec pote quicquam
co^memorari, quod plus salis, plusque leporis habeat hodie. Nec pote. s. est.i.
no^ potest quicquam. etc. It is not possible to rehearse or to show any body,
that has more grace, amiablenes, or pleasant facion at this hour. where,
que, is taken for, id est, plus satis, plusque leporis. For plus salis.i. plus
leporis, as I have noted in other places before. And here of Sal, in the singlar
number and, sales, in the plurell be taken for merry co^ceites, or delectable
and pleasant co^municacion, that may make or cause the herers to laugh, and
yet is sumwhat sharp and biting withal, as witnesses Quin. li. 6. And Plin.
l. 31. cap. 7. of the natural history, where he says thus: Ergo Hercule
uita humanior sine sale nequit degere, adeoque necessarium elementum est, ut
transierit intellectus ad uoluptates animi quoque. Nam ita sales appellantur,
omnisque uitae lepos, et summa hilaritas, laborumque requies non alio magis
uocabulo co^stat, Than truly the life of man being in any thing reasonable
good condition or state, can not continue without the use of salt, which is
so necessary and profitable an help and sustinance or sustentation to and for
the life of man, that the mind, intelligence, and under standinge has taken
and made from the same a metaphore or translation unto the pleasures and
delectations of the mind. For the said pleasures and delectations of the mind,
or called in latin sales, and al manner pleasure of our life, and the highest
myrthe and pastyme, that we have (which consists in witty, merry, and
pleasante co^municacion) and also al quiet rest and ease after peyneful
labors, ar by none other latin word in the world better, or more expressly
and generally signified, than by this word sales, of which be metaphorically
derived many pretty adagies or proverbs, of the which read Erasmi Chiliades,
and specially (for this purpose) the pruerbe, Salsitudo non inest illi.

Sicubi eum satietas hominum caeperat. If he were at any time weary of the
company of men.

Negotij eum siquando odium caeperat.i. tae dium. If he were weary of his
business, or great labors.

Requiescere ubi uolebat. when he was disposed to be at quiet, or to rest aft
his labors.

Me conuiuam solu^ abducebat sibi. He took awey with him me and no man else to
be his guest, and to dyne or suppe with him.

Sic homo est. Such is his facion, or, this is the facion of the man.

Inuidere omnes mihi, ac mordere clanculum. for inuidebant and mordebant. Every
man had envy or grudged at me, and spoke very ill by me behind my back.

Vbi molestus mihi magis est. When he began to be some what busy with me, or,
when he disquieted or vexed me, or, would not let me be in rest.

Eo ne es ferox, quia habes imperiu^ in beluas? Eo ne for Ideo ne. etc. Art
thou therefore hasty on men, because thou art a master of brute beastis?

Pulchre me hercle dictum, et sapie^ter. well spoken by my southe and wisely.

Quid illud, quo pacto Rhodiu^ tetigerim in conuiuio, nunquid tibi dixi? What
that, how I took up a fellow of Rhodes as we sat at the table did I never
tell it the?

Nunquam, sed narra obsecro, Never, but tell it, I beseech you.

Plus millies iam audiui, I have herd it already a thousand times and above.

Vna in conuiuio erat hic, quem dico, Rhodius adolescentulus. This young fellow
of Rhodes, that I speak of, and I sat together at a table.

Coepit me irridere. He began to mock me.

Quid ais, inquam, ho^ impude^s? what say est thou shameless or thou saucy
fellow quod I?

Tuum ne, obsecro, hoc dictum erat? I pray you heartily was that your saying?

Audieram saepe, and fertur in primis. I had herd it many times, and it is a
saying as comen, as any is.

Dolet dictu^ imprudenti adolescenti. This word or saying grieved the folysh
young man.

Risu omnes qui aderant emori. All that were in company, were almost deed
with laughture. Emori.i. emoriebantur, per Antiptofin. For Donatus in many
places notes, that the infinytife mode in such spekinges is more vehemente and
of more virtue* strength, and efficacy, than is the indicative.

Metuebant omnes iam me. Then were they all aferd of me.

Id ut ne fiat, haec res sola est remedio. That that shall not be, this thing
only is a remedy and help.

Phaedriam intromittamus comessatum. Let us have in Phedria to make good chere
with us. Comessor, aris, ssatus su^, sari, depon. is proprely that we say in
english, to bankette after suppar, or, to make ryer suppars. Sue. in
Domitiano. Conuiuebatur frequenter and large, sed paene raptim, certe no^ ultra
solis occasu^, nec ut postea comessaretur. He took repastes and feasted both
often and also eat much at ones, and yet in manner never but by snatches, and
of truth never longer tha^ till the soon went down, nor never to banquet nor to
have any ryer suppar after. Plau. in Rude^te. Veru^ si uoletis plausum fabulae
huie claru^ dare, comessatu^ oe^s uenitote ad me ad a^nos sedecim. But and if
you wol clappe your hands to gether, that hit sownde loud in approving and
allowyng this come die, that we have played, come every one of you home and
banquet or make good chere for these sixtene years. Liui. L. x. De bell. Mace.
Reports that Demetrius, after that he had made a certain suppar to his
companions said unto them. Quin comessatu^ ad fratre^ imus? Why go we not to my
brothers to bankette? And of comessari comes a nowne verbal comessatio,
deriuied (as Festus Po. witnesses) a uicis, quas graeci komas dicunt, that is
of littel stretis. For in such men dwelled before that towns were builded,
and there one would bid an other to drinking or ban kettynge for good
neighborhood. For of the greek nowne kome, is deriuied a verb komazo to
bankette, and of komazo is derived comessor in latin, prima longa, with one m.
Of comessor comes comessatio for bankettynge, or making good chere after
supper. Suet. in Vitel. Epulas trifariam sem per, interdum quadrifariam
dispertiebat, in ientacula, pra^dia, coenas, et comessationes, He divided his
meals into three evermore, and somtymes into four, that is to wit, break
fastes, dyners, suppers, and reresuppers or bankettis, or collations after
supper.

Pamphilam cantatum prouocemus. Let us pray Pamphilam to singe, or, let us
call forth Pamphilam to singe. For as I think Terence uses here prouocare for
euocare, to call forth, as prodire.i. exire to go forth, and that is his most
propre significacion, and specially in this place of Terence. for he said
before, Intromittamus Pamphilum, Let us have in Pamphilum, and now contrary to
that prouocemus Pamphilam, Let us call forth Pamphilam. So Plau. in Pseu.
Herus si domi est tuus, quin prouocas, If thy master be at home, why do thou
not call him forth. Prouoco has other significations, but they perteyne not
to this place.

Par pari referto. Do like for like.

Quando illud quod tu das amat, te amat, quando pro quoniam, Saying that he
sets store by that that you give unto him, he loves your self well.

takes and has now, you being angrye with him, upon displeasure wol bestow
an other way.

Mihi isthuc non in mentem uenerat. I remembered not so much.

In the second Scene.
O Thais mea, o meum suauium, quid agitur? O my dear Thais, o mine own
swetynge, how is it with you?

forth quickly.

Procedere tu huc. Come thou forth here, and stand by me.

Est ex Aethiopia usque hic. This fellow is come as far as from Ethiopia.

Ita me dij ament honestus est. As God help me hit is a goodly fellow: or (as
we use commonly to speak) as I shall be saved: or, as I trust to be sauedde,
hit is a goodly fellow.

Tacent, satis laudant. They say nothing, and in that they praise hit
sufficiently. For holding a man's peace and saying nothing, specially in a
man's adversary, is a certain kind of preysynge or granting. whereof there
goes a proverb in latin: Qui tacet, consentire uidetur, He that holds his
piece, and says nothing, seems to consent, that is to say, seems to think as
the other party said, and to be of the same mind.

Fac periculum in literis. Prove him in learning. There is understood, de eo.

Fac periculum in palaestra. Prove him in wrastlynge.

Te esse puro infra omneis infimos homineis. I repute the to be the most
villayne of al villaynes.

Qui huic assentari animu^ induxeris. That coudest find in thy heart to
flatter such a fellow as this is. Val. li. 5. ele. c. 66. shows the
difference between these three verbes assentor, adulor, and blandior. Assentari
is to flater any body, affirmyng his sayengis and upholding his ye, and his
nay, or preysyng him to much, or else many times other wise than the truth
is, to the end to get some profit and auantage thereby, and it is proprely in
words. And therefore this kind of flaterye called Assentation, is not in any
brute beast, but only in man. Plau. Exte^plo, quasi res cum ea esser mihi,
coepi assentari, mulier quicquid dixerat, idem ego dicebam. A non as though I
had had to do with her, I began to hold up her Ye and her Nay, and what so
ever she said, I said the same. Ide^. Assentandum est quicquid hic mentibitur,
what so ever lie this fellow shall make, we must uphold it and say as he does.
Tere^ce self in the second scene of the second act of this same comedy,
does best of al declare the nature of this verb assentor, aris: where Gnato
says thus: Hos consector, hisce ego non paro me ut rideant, sed his ultro ar
rideo, et eoru^ ingenia admiror simul, quicquid dicu^t, laudo, id rursum si
negant, laudo id quoque. Negat quis, nego: ait, aio. Postremo imperaui egomet
mihi omnia assen tari, is questus nunc est multo uberrimus. Such men do I
follow at the tail, and among such persons I do not so fashon my self,
that they may laugh at me, but contrary wise, what so ever they say or do, I
show them a merry countenance of mine own self, and also make a great meruailing
at their high wittis. what so ever they say, I commend it, that if they deny
the same again, that also I co^me^de: if a man say nay, I say nay also: if he
say ye, I say ye to. And for a conclusion to be short, I master and rule mine
own self, to uphold his ye and his nay, and to say as he says in all manner
things, for that is the next way now a days to get money enough.

Adulari is to flater an other man in humblyng them selfs and being
serviceable about him, and to labor by such facions to win and get his favor,
whether it be by voice and words, orels by gesture of the body, or by any
other way and mean what so ever it be. Nonius Marc. says thus: Adulatio est
proprie canum blandimentu^, quod ad homines consuetudine translatum est,
Adulation proprely signifies the fauning and leapinge of dogs upon their
masters, from which propretie by translation it is applied to men only by
use of speaking, and not by the propre signification of the word. Some
gra^marians form adulor of the word au la (which is latin for a princis
court, where such flatery is very much used) by changinge the dipthonge au,
into u long, taking that etymology out of Ovid, where he says Agmen adulantu^
media procedit ab aula. But Valla holds with them, that deriuie adulor out of
the greek word dulos, which is feruus. For that (as al agree) adulari is a
servile thing, and is only in such as can abide to be subject and bond to
an other body, and not in honest men. Where note, that adulor is a verb
deponent, and governs a dative case. Val. Max. Diogenes Syracusis, cum olera
ei lauanti Aristippus dixisset: Si Dionysio adulari uelles, ista non esses, Imo
inquit, si tu ista esse uelles, Dionysio non ad ulareris, Diogenes in the city
of Sarragous (when that Aristippus had said unto him, as he was washyng herbs
for a salet, these words, If thou would seek favor of Dionysius the tyran
and flater him, thou should not eat such meat as that) answered and said
again: Nay if thou would eat such meat as this, thou should not need to
flater Dionysius. Quint. Transeo oblata^ uole^ ti muneru^ uacationem, et
blandius quam militiae disciplina postuler, adulatum militi tribunu^, I pass
over that he had offered unto him liberty to be void of al offices in the
army, when he would none of it, but refused it: and that the Tribune labored
to win him more gently than the law of arms or the order of warfare required.
Yet Cornelius Tacitus joined the same verb deponent with an accusative,
saying: Tigillinum, aut quem alium adulatus est, He flatered Tigillinus or
some other man. There is also red adulo, as, aui, are, an active and
transsitiue, gouernynge an accusative case. Cic. li. 2. tusc. quest. where he
translateth certain verses out of a tragedy of the greek poet Eschylus speking
in the person of Prometheus of the egle, that fed of his liver: Tum iecore
opimo ferta, et satiata affatim, clangorem fundit uastum et sublime aduolans
pinnata cauda, nostru^ adulat sanguinem, Than she being stuffed and satisfied
even at full, with as much as she would eat of my fat liver, gave an horrible
shreche, and taking her flight high up in to the air, with her forked and
styffe fethered tail houered, playenge and dalyinge at my blood. Al be it the
Dictionaries take adulat there, for lambit or bibit, as who should say in
english, She sweted her lips licking and suckyng up my blood. And Cic. li.
1. of. used the passive of the same: Cauendum est, ne assentatoribus
patefaciamus aures, neue adulari nos sinamus. we must beware that we open not
our ears to flaterers, nor suffer our selfs to be won or overcome with
faunynge or humble behavior of others toward us. For there Cicero does
manifestly put a difference between assentation and adulation. Lucretius used
adulo, as, aui, as a verb neutre absolutely, that is to say not ioynyng any
case with him in that verse: Long alio pacto gannitu uocis adulant. And
Linaker in the place of Val. Max. above cited redeth thus, Diogenes Syracusis,
cum olera ei lauanti Aristippus dixisset, Si Dionysio adula ri uelles, ista non
esses: Imo inquit, si tu Dionysium non adulares, illa non esses. But I fnid not
that lettre in any exemplarie that I have hitherto seen, but the co^me^taries
read, si Dionysio non adulares, that it be a verb neutre gouernyng a dative,
where Olinerus notes, that many verbes be neutres in o, and deponentes in one
and the same significacion as populo and populor, impertio and impertior, adulo
and adulor. etc.

Blandiri belongs proprely to touching and handlynge, and by vnpropre using
it is by metaphore translated and referred to other parts of the body, ye and
many times to the mind, exemplorum plena sunt omnia.

Iam ne imus? Shall we go now?

Hos prius introducam, et quae uolo simul imperabo. I wol first have in these
folks, and give in commandment such things as I would have done.

Postea continuo exeo. That done I woll come forth by and by. For in such
manner spekinges as this, and Iam ne imus? before. and Ego hinc abeo next
following, with others like, where as the propretie of our english tou^ge is
to speak by the sign of the future tense, shall or woll, the phrase of the
latin tou^gue is to speak by the present tense.

Ego hinc abeo. I wol begone hens.

excuse or occasion to make me tarry there.

Ait rem seriam uelle agere mecu^. He said he would commone with me of a sad
and weyghty matier.

Iam tum erat suspicio dolo malo haec fieri omnia. Even very than I mystrusted
all ready, that all to gether should be done by fraud and collusion. Dolus
(says Donat) a dolendo, that it makes men sorry when they are begyled, uel a
dolando, that is hurting or diminishing, for dolos in greek is laesio in
latin, hurtyng in english, and there of it is taken for all manner gyle and
deceyte or trumperie. Doli uocabulo (says Nonius Mar.) nunc tantum in malis
utimur, apud antiquos autem etiam in bonis rebus utebantur: unde ahuc dicimus,
sine dolo malo, nimirum quia solebat dici et bonus, and for his authorite and
exeample he cites this place of Terence: so that dolus is al manner deceit,
and dolus malus is that that we use to say in english, craft and collusion.
Read de dolo malo in the third book of Cice. de offic. where among other
things he says thus: Non dum enim Aquilius collega and familiaris meus
pertulerat de dolo malo for mulas. In quibus ipsis cum ex eo quereretur, quid
esset dolus malus, respondebat, cum esset aliud simulatum, aliud actum. For my
fellow in office and familiar friend Aquilius had not yet made and
established the form of the writes of dolo malo. In which writes when it was
demanded of him what was dolus malus, he made answer and said, that dolus
malus was, when one thing was pretended and outwardely showed, and an other
thing done and executed in deed.

Apud nos hic mane dum redeat ipsa. Tari here with us until she come her self.

Nihil minus. No point.

Si isthuc ita certum est tibi. If you be utterly determined, and appointed on

Illuc transies, ubi illa est. Go thither, where she is.

In the fourth Scene.
Heri aliquot adolesce^tuli coimus, Yesterday three or four young men of us met
together.

Cheream ei rei praefecimus. we made Cherea the chief captain and doer in
that mattier. Here Terence spoke of a promys, that was made for to meet to
gether, and to make good chere: so that in this place and meaning, it might
conveniently be englished thus: we made Cheream our steward and master of the
feast.

Locus, tempus constitutum est. The place and time was appointed.

Praeterijt te^pus. The time or hour is past.

Visam si domi est. I woll go se if he be at home.

Quisnam hinc a Thaide exit? who comes forth from Thais house here? Quisnam
for quis: It is called parelcon, that is wha^ a letter or a syllable is added,
which makes nor helps nothing to the sense.

Is est, an non est? Is it he, or is it not?

Quid hoc hominis? i. qui hic homo est? what manner of fellow is this? or, what
manner a fellow have we here?

Nequeo satis mirari, neque conijcere. I can not leave merueilynge, nor
perfectly coniect.

Libet sciscitari. I have a phansy to enquere, or, I have a great desire to
ask. Sciscitor, aris, etc. is to ask to the end for to know a thing, as the
voice self shows, for it comes of scio. Percontari proprely is to ask to
the end to reprove a man, and to take him in a trippe. Interrogo is also to ask
to the end to know: Al be it it is indifferently used for percontor, to oppose
a man, as we say.

In the fyfte Scene.
Nu^ quis hic est? Is there any body here?

Nemo homo est. There is no man. Hadrianus de ser. lat. notes, that homo is
elega^tly some times joined with nemo, not with standing, that nemo is the
same that nullus homo.

lam ne erumpere hoc mihi licet gaudium? May I now out with this my joy and
gladness?

Proh Iuppiter. Oh lord.

Nunc est, interfici cum perpeti me possum ne hoc gaudium contaminet uita
aegritudine aliqua. Now at this present time so it is that I could be
content to dye, that life might not here after disteyne this gladness that I am
in, by any mysfortune, displeasure, or sorrow.

Ab eo gratiam hanc inibo. I wol get or have that thank of him.

Quid est, quod sic gestis? what is the matter that you lepe and skyppe so?
Gestire says Donat) is to notify what the mind thinks or desires, by the
mouynge and gesture of the body. And it is manifest (says he) that it is by
translation taken of the propretie of brute beasts, and referred to man. And
hit may be referred as well to sorrow as to gladness, or to any other
affectionate appetite or passion of the mind.

Quid sibi hic uestitus quaerit? what means this apparel?

Quid est, quod laetus sis? what is the matier why thou should be so glad?

Nostin ne ha^c, quam amat frater? Do you not know her here, that my brother

Elegans spectator formarum. Very well skilled or seen in fair women, or, a
deyntie fellow in choosing of fair women. For so does Donatus expowne it.

Quid multa uerba? s. loquar. what should I make many words?

Forte fortuna domi erat. As hap was he was at home. Haec fors (says Nonius
Mar.) o fors, ab hac forte, is proprely a chance, that so dainly and casually
falls or happens at a time: and Fortuna is the goddess self, that is, the
fortune that every person has given unto him, that such or such things
shall happen to him, or go from him. Accius in Astyanacte: Itera in quibus
partibus, namque audire uolo, si est quem exopto, et quo captus modo, fortuna
ne, an forte reperitur, Tell and rehearse again in what parties, for I would
feign here, whether it be he that I desire to se, or not, and how he was
gotten, and whether he was fou^den by fortune, orels by chance and casualtie.
Ide^ in Andro. Multi, quibus natura praua magis, quam fors aut fortuna obsuit,
Many, unto whom the frowardnes of their naughty nature has done more harm,
then has either chance or fortune. Lucilius in Saty. Cui parilem fortuna
locum, fatumque tulit fors, Unto whom his fortune gave like place and degree or
state of living, and chance gave destynie of death semblable and answereable
to the same. Ibid. Aut forte omnino, aut fortuna uincere bello, Either by
blind chance or else by fortune to get the victory in bataile. Many times
fors fortuna and forte fortuna ar joined to gether by subunion, as says Donat
in the third scene of the third act of Hecyra: and then it betokens bone
adventure or sudden good chance and good fortune. Teren. in Phor. O fortuna, o
fors fortuna quantis co^moditatibus Antiphoni hunc onerastis diem. Oh fortune,
oh most good fortune, with how many commodities and good chances have thou
replenishid this day unto Antiphon. Vbi Donat. Fortuna dicta est i^certa res,
fors fortu^a euentus fortunae bonus. Fortuna is called a thing uncertain, Fors
fortuna is a good chance and end of that thing that was uncertain. And again
in the same place fortuna and fors fortuna be two diverse things: For fors
fortuna is the goddess, whom they serve that live having no occupacion,
whereby to get their living: whose temple was on the fursyde of Tyberis: so
that fortuna is in uncertain and fors fortuna is in good chance. And there of
forte fortuna some time as a nowne and sometime as an aduerbe, is that that we
say in english, In a good hour: or, As good hap was.

Iouem Danaae misisse aiunt quonda^ in gremium imbre^ aureum. They say, that
Iuppiter did on a time let fall into the lap of Danae a shower of drops of
gold.

Impendio magis animus gaudebat mihi, My heart was meruaillous ioy^ul and still
more and more. Impendio aduerbium intendendi is as much as impense, ualde
apprime, greatly, or very much: and it is commonly joined with the comparatiue
degree. Aul. Gel. li. 1. ca. 2. Erat ibidem nobiscum simul adolescens,
philosophiae sectator disciplinae, ut ipse dicebat, stoicae, sed loquatior
impendio, et promptior, There was in the same place to gether in company with
us a young man, student in philosophy, and (as he said him self) of the sect
of the stoikes, but very talkatiue, or toto full of words, and marvelous ready
thereto. And therefore it is red elegantly joined with magis. Cic. Atti. At ille
impendio magis odit senatum, But he toto much hatith the senators or the
nobles of the cite. And also with minus. Plau. in Aul. Atque ille minus minus
que impendio curare, minusque me impertire honoribus, But he set by me still
less and less by a great way, and did me less honor, or showed me less
courtesy.

Ego homuncio hoc non facerem? Should I a fellow of no reputation not do that?

Ego illud feci, ac lubens. I did that same, and that with all my heart.

Pessulum ostio obdo. I sparred, or bolted the door. Pessulus, li, lo.i.

instrument, with which the doors be shit fast. Apuleus. Subdita claui pessulos
reduco. I put the kaye into the hole, and pulled back the bolte. Plaut. in
Aulul. Occlude fores, ambobus pessulis, iam ego hic adero. Shit fast the door

together every one his porcyon.

Perlo^ge est, sed ta^to otius properemus. It is very far hens, but let us
make so much the more speed.

Minime gentium. No, in no wise in the world. Minime gentium (says Festus)
di cebant ueteres pro eo quod est omnium ge^tium iudicio minime esse faciendu^,
The latin men of old time did use and take these words, minime gentiu^, as
who should say thus, a thing as all the people in the world would judge, in no
manner wise to be done. So that minime gentium (as restifieth Valla in annot.
contra Rau.) is taken for minime, and gentium is a voice either emphaticos, or

aliquid iuuare posses, quippe res est in manibus, tu autem abes long gentium.
Not that you could do me any help, For the matier is all ready in hand, and
you ar distaunt a great way from me. Idem P. Cornif. li. 12. ep. fa. Oppressa
omnia sunt, nec habent ducem boni, nostrique long gentium absunt, Al things
ar put down by oppression, and the good and honest men have no man to be their
captain, for that ioly fellows of ours that used to kylle up tyrauntes be
far out of the way. And also with these aduerbes nusquam, unde, undecunque,
ubinam, ubiuis, ubique, ubi, with all other their compou^des, as sicubi. etc.
where note that with these last rehearsed is red joined not only gentium, but
also terrarum, and locorum, and with ubi is also joined so^tymes the voice of
the genitive singular, loci, per subunione^. Plaut. in Cap. Propemodu^ ubi loci
tuae fortunae su^t, facile intelligis, Thou perceyuest very well in manner, in
what case or state thou and all that ever thou have does stand. Ide^ in Mer.
Na^ si istuc ius est senecta aetate scortari senes, ubi loci res summa nostra
publica? For if this be leefull that old folks in their old age may use the
company of harlottes, then where is our great high common weal? And in all
these the compoundes signify no more than the simples.

Vbi primum poterit, se illinc subducet, sat scio. As soon as he may
possibly, he woll privily stele away from thens, I know very well.

In the secunde scene.
Du^ rus eo. As I was going into the co^tre.

Vbi quid in animo est molestiae. wha^ there is any grefe in the heart, or,
when there is any groudge in the stomach.

Coepi mecum, inter uias, aliam re^ ex alia cogitare. By the way as I went I
began to cast in my mind, and to remember one thing of an other.

Du^ haec reputo preterij imprudens uillam. while I recou^ted those things in
my mind I was gone past my house in the country. Villa proprely is a ferme
house, or, a manor house, or any other house, made and set without the city to
dwell in, and to have housbandry occupied, deryued (as Varro L. i. de re
rustic. c. 2. says, a uehendo of caryenge) for that the housband man carries
in thither such fruits as come out of the ground: and semblably carries
them out again, when they must be sold. In uilla most commonly ar two
partis, the one that the fermer or what so ever person else, occupyinge the
housbandrie belonginge unto the same, dwells in, and there makes or keeps
all manner instruments apperteynynge to his housbandrie, as corn, carts,
yokes for oxen. etc. and that was called by the latin men of old time Villa
rustica. The other part is that, which the lord or owner reserueth and
keeps for him self to dwell in for his pleasure, and that was called Villa
urbana, because it was in all points as goodely and as well appointed as
becomed a house standing within the city too be, and was more pleasauntely
builded and more goodly decked, and better furnished with all implementes of
household, and kept more nete and clean then for a house of the country. Varro
li. 1. de re rust. Fructuosior certe fu^dus est propter aedificia, si porius ad
antiquorum diligentiam, quam ad horum luxuriam dirigas aedificationem. Illi
enim ad fructuum rationem faciebant, hi ad libidines indomitas. Itaque illorum
uillae rusticae era^t maiores quam urbanae, quae nu^c sunt pleraeque, Of a very
certaynte a man's ground is the more fruitful and profitable for the housynge
that is builded upon it, if a man order and fashon the buyldinge and framing
and setting up of it after the diligent fashon of me^ of old time, rather tha^
after the riottous and prodigal fashon of men that are now a days. For the
said men of old time made their buyldynges in the countreye, as was most
convenient for the fruits of the ground to be received there into: and now a
days they build for pleasure, that is never ruled by any reason, nor never
satisfied: Therefore their uillae rusticae were beggar and larger than many
uillae urbanae that are now a days.

Long iam abieram. I was all ready gone be yonde it a great way.

Cum sensi, redeo rursum. when I perceived it, I came back again.

Vbi ueni ad diuerticulum, constiti. when I came to the place were the way
turns in, I stood still.

Occaepi mecum cogitare. I began to think in my mind.

Biduum hic manendum est. I must abide here by the space of two days.

Quid tum postea? what then?

Si non tangendi copia est, eho ne uidendi quidem erit? If I may not have
leave to touch it, what shall I not be suffered to look upon it neither?

Si illud non licet, saltem hoc licebit. If I may not do that, yet at leest
way this may I do.

Timida subito egreditur Pythias. Pythias being in fear, comes forth hastily.

In the third scene.
Vbi ego illum scelerosum, atque impium in ueniam? where may I find that
ungracious and wicked fellow?

Ludificatus est uirginem. He begyled the maiden.

Veste^ omnem misere dissidit. He all to cut her cote, that pity it was to se.

Ipsam capillo conscidit. He tore her by the hear.

Vt ego unguibus illi in oculos inuolem. Oh how I would fle on him with my
nails, and scrache out his eyes.

Nescio quid absente nobis turbatum est domi. There has been some business or
trouble, or there has been some shrewed turn done at home, what so ever hit
is, why^e I have been away forth. Here is (says Donat) either absente set
for a preposition gouernynge an ablative case, as when it is said coram nobis,
coram amicis. etc. orels (which I more allow, and think better said) the
figure that is imitation of speaking of the old time. For the antiquite used
absente nobis for absente me, or, absentibus nobis. Plau. in Am. Si in action
ha^c absente nobis inuenerit puer, If the boy found and took her with the
manner in the deed doing, while I was away. And like wise praesente nobis, for
praesentibus nobis. Plau. in Am. Nec nobis praesente aliquis nisi seruus
Aphricanus adest, Neither any man but the servant that came out of Aphrique was
here while I was present. Ibide^. Nec nobis praesente quis qua^ aliquis ausi
sunt, And while I was present they durst not, not any one of them all.
Pomponius. Qui apud forum praesente restibus mihi uendidit, Which sold it
unto me openly in the street before witness. Idem. Sine ergo isthuc, praesente
amicis inter coenam, Let this alone now, we woll speak more of it in the
suppar time when our friends be present. Varro in Marcellum, Id prae sent
legatis omnibus, exercitu pronunciat, He spoke that openly in the host all the
ambassadors being there present.

Quid festinas, aut quem quaeris? why hiest thou so fast, or whom sekest thou
fore?

Abi hinc quo dignus es, cum donis tuis ta^ lepidis. Il speed or ill luck take
you for me with your gifts being so goodly and propre.

Quid istuc est rei? what is the matier?

Rogas me? Do thou ask me?

Quas turbas dedit? what trouble, or what array has he made?

Virgine^ uitiauit. He has deflored a mayde^.

Temulentus es. Thou art dronken.

Vtinam sic sint qui mihi male uolunt. would god that mine evil wyllers were in
that case.

Quidnam isthuc monstri fuit? what a monstre was that? what monstru^ is, it is
showed before.

Ego illum nescio qui fuerit. I know him not what he was.

Hoc quod fecit res ipsa indicat. This that he has done the thing self does
plainly show.

Ille bonus uir nusquam apparet. That honest man can not be seen.

Suspicor aliquid domo abeuntem abstulisse. I mystruste that he stole and took
away somewhat, when he went out of the house.

Nequeo mirari satis, quo ille abire ignauus possit longius, nisi si domum
forte ad nos redierit. I can not marvel enough whither that fuske could go
far, except if per aue^ture he be gone home again to our house.

Vise amabo number ibi sit. Go se as ever I shall love you, or, as ever I shall do
you good turn, whether he be there. Amabo is after some an aduerbe of
exhorting, or after some other an interiection of flateringe and loving, and it
is the same that we say in english, as ever I shall do you good turn, or
pleasure, or as ever I shall love you. Plaut. Noli amabo Amphitruo irasci Sosiae
caussa mea, As ever I shall love you Amphitrou be not angri with Sosia for my
sake. And hit is indifferently referred to one singular orels to many. Idem in
Trucu. Properate, mensam afferte amabo, Hye at ones and bring the table I
pray you. Orators use in the same signification also amabo te, and ama me.
Cic. Cassio, Et amabo te, cum dabis post hac aliquid domum literarum, mei
memineris. And, as ever I shall love you, when you shall from hensforth send
any letters home, remember me. Id. Attico. Amabo te incumbe in eam rem, and ad
me scribe. As ever I shall owe my hearty love, stycke well to that matter, and
write unto me, Eidem. Amame, no^ libenter uidi, sed modo succenset, modo
gratias agit. As ever you may trust, or love me, I saw it not gladly, but
somwhile he is angry, and somwhyle he gives thanks. Se more examples in
Hadrian, De fm. Latino. Linacer says that amabo, and amabote, is enallage,
that is a verb (says he) or a hole sense, for an aduerbe. For enallege is,
when one part of speech is put for an other. And amabo has not the secunde
syllable short, as Calepine and Thesaurus Linguae lati. and others would have
it, setting acutum accentum in prima, but long as Catullus. Amabo mea dulcis
Ipsiphilla. Martial. l. 8. Dic uerum mihi Marce dic amabo. Sidonius ad Felicem.
Dic dic quod peto magne dic amabo. That no man be deceived in accenting that
word.

Tam infandu^ facinus ne audiui quide^. So abominable a deed I have never
herd of.

Pol ego amatores audieram esse mulierum eos maximos. In deed I had herd say
that they were the greattest lovers of women that be.

Illum aliquo conclusissem. I would have shut him up fast in some corner.

In the fourth scene.
Exi for as sceleste. Come forth thou naughty pack.

At etiam restitas? what do thou stop and draw back still.

Prodi fugitive. Com forth thou runaway.

Illud uide os ut sibi distorsit carnifex.i. scelestus. Se yonde how the
slouen knave makes a wrye mouth.

Quid huc redditio est? wherefore art thou come hither again?

Si paululum cessassem, domi non offendissem. If I had tarried a littel longer,
I should not have found him at home.

Iam ornabat fugam. He was even about to run away.

Habes ne hominem amabo? Have you got ten the fellow I pray you?

Hunc oculis sius nostrum nunquam quisquam uidit. Not one of us ever set his
eye on this fellow.

An tu hu^c credidisti esse, obsecro? Did you think that hit had been this
manne, I pray you?

Ne comparandus hic quidem ad illum est. Nay this fellow is not to be compared
with him, or this fellow is not to be likned to him.

Ille erat honesta facie et liberali. He had a goodely and a welfauored face.
or, he was both fair and well favored. For that signifies liberalis,
sometimes joined with facies, as here: or with forma. Teren. in An. Et quia
erat forma praeter caeteras honesta ac liberali, accedo ad pedissequas, rogo
quae sit, And because she was more goodly and more fair and beautyfull than
any of the others, I came unto the maidens that waited on her, and enquered
what she was.

Ita uisus est dudum. So he semid erewhile.

Varia ueste exornatus fuit. He was trymmed in gay apparel. Varia.i.
multiformi et uersicolori.

Nunc tibi uidetur foedus. Now you think him foul and yllfauored. Foedum is
that that is foul ylle favored and lothesome to look on.

Tace obsecro. Hold thy piece, I pray the.

Quasi uero paulum intersiet, for intersit. per epenthesin, As who says,
there was but small difference between them.

Ad nos deductus hodie est adolesce^tulus, quem tu uero uidere uelles. There
was brought home to our house to day, such a young man, as a man would be
glad to se, or such a young man as a man would be the better in his heart to
look on.

Hic est uetus uietus, ueternosus senex, color mustelino. This is an old
rustye thief and rotten and weak, unlusty, and all to ryueled, and as tawny
colored as a weesle. Vetus, is old. Plaut. in Amphitr. Veterem and antiquam
rem, nouam ad uos proferam. I wolle show you an old and antyke thing,
burnyshed and made new again, or, I woll show you a new thing made of an
old and antique thing. And sometime (as witnesses Donatus in this place of
Terence) Vetus is referred to rebukyng and reprouyng. Terentius in prologo
Andr. Qui maleuoli ueteris poetae male dictis respondeat, How he may make
answer to the railyng of that old rusty poet his adversary. Id. in prologo.
Heautont. Tum quod maleuolus uetus poeta dictitat repent ad studium hunc se
applicasse musicum.i. musarum, hoc est bonarum literarum. And further where as
the enuyous old naughty poet allegeth, that this man suddenly applied him
self to the study of good letters. Id. in prologo Phorm. Postquam poeta
uetus, poetam non potest retrahere a studio. etc. Now that the naughty rotten
poet can not withdraw this poet Terence from study. Vietus, Donate
expounds, mollis, flaccidus que, and flexibilis corpore. weke, and lanke, and
limer of body. Vietus, (says Fest. Pomp.) dicitur languidus, sine ui, and
naturalibus priuatus uiribus. weke or weryshe, without any strenghte, or
lacking natural strength. Cicero de senectu. Sed tamen necesse fuit esse
aliquod extremum. and tanquam in arborum baccis, terraeque frugibus maturitate
tempestiua, quasi uietum and caducum, quod ferendum est molliter sapiente, But
yet hit could not be chosen but that there should be sum term and end, and
(like as in the beries of trees, and in the corn growyng on the ground, at
what time they be through ripe) as who should say faintness, wekenesse, and
faylynge in strength, and to be ready to fall and to decay in strength, as
being mortal, which a wise man ought to take patiently, gently, and mekely. So
that uietum is weke, lymer, faynte, and without any strength: and thereof
comes uimina and uimenta oseours, that is the lymer twigs of wyllowes that
the tumelours or coupers ocupy about their houpes, with which they bind their
tubbes or batelles. And uiere is to bind tubbes or barrels or other vessels
with such twigs. And uietor is the coupar that does make and bind them.
Veternosus proprely is he, that has the disese which is called in latin
ueternus, in greek letargus, of Auicen and physicians subetum, or subetium,
that is a disease engendrynge in the hodye contynuall desire of slepynge by
reason of to much rest, idelnes, and ease, otherwise called slaggardy or
slouthfulnes. Which disease because hit is most commenly in aged persons,
therefore ueternosus is much taken and used for him that is diseased with
slepynes, or (as they say drowsynes) so that he has no lust to bestere him,
but rather to sit still as oppressed with contynuall slumbryng and sleep. For
ueternus is taken for unmeasurable and over much sleep, Plin. l. 8. not. hist.
spekyng of bears. Primis diebus bis septenis tam graui somno ursi premu^tur,
ut ne vulueribus quidem excitare queant, tunc mirum in modu^ in ueterno
pinguescunt. The first fourtene days bears be oppressed with so heavy sleep
that they can not be wakened and made to arise though a man wound them right
sore. And And than they wax wonderful fat in that long and contynuall sleep.
Cato takes ueternosum for one having the ydropsy where he says: Veternosus
quam plurimum bibit, tam maxim sitit. He that has the ydropsye the more he
drynketh, the more thyrstie he is. Senex (in this place of Terence) is taken
for rugosus, wythered and ryueled.

Quae haec est fabula? What a tale, or saying have we here?

Eo me redigis ut quid aegeri^ egomet nescia^. Thou bryngest me to that point,
that I can not tell mine own self what I have done.

Venistin' hodie ad nos? Came thou to our house to day?

At ille alter uenit annos natu sedecim. But that other came being of the age
of syxetene years.

Age dum hoc mihi expedi. Come of, tell me this at ones.

Istam, quam habes, unde habes uestem? This garment that thou haste on the,
where gottest thou it? or, how came thou by it?

Quam dudum? How long agone? or, how little while a gone?

Qui cum? With whom?

Noras ne eum prius? Dyddest thou know him before.

Vnde igitur fratre^ meu^ esse sciebas. whereby the^ knew thou, that he was
mi brodre?

Is dedit hanc uestem mihi. He gave me this rote.

Vna ambo abierunt for as. They went forth of doors both to gether.

Iam satis credis me nihil mentitu^? Do you now believe well, that I made no lie?

Certum est uirginem uitiata^ esse. Certain it is and well known, that the
maiden was defloured.

Credis huic quod dicat? Do thou believe such a one as this is, what he
says?

Quid isti credam? What should I believe this peuishe fellow? For iste most
times betokens and imports a certain contempt.

Res ipsa indicat. The matier self shows plainly.

Concede isthuc paululum. Go a littetl haiway. but here, come a little nere
hitehr to me. For isthuc here, is taken for huc.

Dic dum doc rursum* Tell me this yet ones again.

Iuppiter magne, o scelestum, atque audacem hominem. Good lord, oh what a
naughty or ungracious and bold fellow is that?

Vae mihi, etiam nunc non credis indignis nos esse irrisos modis. Alas, do
thou not yet believe, that we have been deluded and scorned shamfully and in
ungoodly manner?

Mirum ni tu credas, quod iste dicat. It is marvel, but you do believe that
this peuishe fellow says.

Possum ne hodie ex te exculpere uerum? Shall I not be able to get out the
treuthe of the er I go? Exculpere proprely is to grave out, or to kerue, as a
man kerueth an image, and per metaphoram it is taken sometimes pro extorquere
to extorte or to get out by violence or punyshement, the truethe, or any
thing that a man desires to know. Plaut. Quot illi bla^ditias, quid promisi
boni, quot admoui fabricas, et quot fallacias in quaestione? uix exculpsi ut
diceret. with what fair words did I handle him, what fair and goodly
promises did I make unto him, how many wyly imaginations, and how many
subtilties, wherewith to begile him, did I set and lay unto him, in examinynge
him? and yet I could uneath get out of him to tell it, for any thing I could do
unto him. Fabrica proprely is a forge or frame of a carpenter, or other work
man, of fabricor, aris, to frame, and per metaphoram to inue^t, or to imagine,
and thereof fabricas here is taken for fallatias, and those two words signify
one thing, and the conjunction copulative and, coming between them, is taken
for id est.

Non potest fine malo fateri, uideo. He can not be made to confess it without
punysshement, I see well.

Sequere hac. Com after me this way here.

Modo ait, modo negat. Some while he says ye, and somewhyle nay.

Iintro. Go thy ways in.

Honest quomodo hinc abeam nescio. I can not tell how to get or how to
depart hens with mine honesty.

Tu me hic nebulo ludificabere? Shall thou mock me here thou knave? or, thou
villeyn shalt thou scorn and make a lawghynge stock of me here?

Parmenonis tam scio esse hanc techna^, quam me uiuere. I do as well know that
this is the crafty imagination of Parmeno, as I know that I am alive. Techna
is a greek word and proprely signifies any craft, and by translation it is
taken for crafty and subtle imaginations. Plau. in cap. Ego erumniatus, de
artuatus sum miser scelesti hominis technis qui me, ut lubitum est, ductauit
dolis, I unfortunate body am brought in misery, and in manner pulled in pieces
through the craftines and suttiltie of this naughty fellow, which has led me
with his traynes and guyles even as lifted. Deartuare, proprely is to cut or
to hew in pieces one part or membre from an other, as traitors be,
deartuati when they be quartred.

Inueniam hodie parem ubi referam gratia^ s. illi. I woll er I sleep find some
thing wherein to requyte him.

Quid nunc faciendum censes? what thynk you best to be done now?

Vtrum taceam, an ue praedicem? whether should I keep it secret, or else utter
it?

Tu pol si sapis, quod scis, nescis. Verily if you wise be, that that you
know, you woll not know.

Hac re et omni te turba euolues, et illi gratum feceris. By this thing doing
thou shall both rydde, wind, and quyte thy self out of all trouble, and also
do him great pleasure.

Id modo dic, abisse Dorum, for abijsse per syncopen. Say thou nothing but
this, that Dorus is gone his way hens.

Cum inde abeo, iam tum inceperat turba inter eos. when I came my ways from
thens, they had already begone to be at strife and to make busynes, or to quarrel
together. Aufer aurum hoc. Have away this gold. Ego scibo ex hoc quid siet. I
woll know of this man here what the matter is.

In the fyfte scene.
Data uerba mihi sunt. I am deceived.

Vicit uinum quod bibi. The wine that I have drunken, has ouercomed me, as who
should say I feel my self drunken.

Dum accubabam, uidebar mihi pulchre so brius. All the while that I sat at the
table, me thought I was very sobre, and in very good tempre. Pulchre.i. ualde,
oppido, minus, admodum.

Postquam surrexi, neque pes, neque men's satis suum officium facit. Now that I
am up, neither my feet, nor my wit seruethe me very well.

Vah quanto nunc formosior uidere mihi, quam dudum. Oh how much fayrer seem
you to me now, than you did while ere.

Verbum hercle hoc uerum est. Certes this is a true saying.

An abijt iam? Is he gone al ready?

Lites sunt inter eos maxim. There is very great strife and debate between
them, or they be at great words to gether. For that signifies proprely lites,
stryuing in words.

Abiens mihi innuit. when he went away, he becked on me.

Nonne id sat erat? was not that enough?

Nesciebam id dicere illam. I knew not, that she meaned that by her saying, or
by her words that she spoke.

Intellexi minus. I understood it not.

Me extrusit for as. He thrust me out of the doors.

Miror ubi ego huic anteuerterim. I marvel in what place I got before this
man, that I saw him not.

In the syxte scene.
Credo illum iam affuturum esse. I think verily, that he wolbe here anon.

Si illam digito attigerit uno, oculi illico of fodientur. If he touch her
with one finger, his eyes shall be pulled out of his heed immediately. Vno digito
a proverb red in chil. Erasmi.

Ego illius far possum ineptias, et magni fica uerba, uerba dum sint. I can
very well bear and suffer his foolyshenes, and his royal high words, as long
as they he nothing but words.

Verum enim si ad rem conferentur, uapulabit. But in feythe if they turue to
deeds, he shall abie, or, he shall smarte. Conferentur.i. transferentur,
conuertentur. s. uerba: And it is a propre and elegante manner of speaking,
says Donat: as if a man should say in latin. He began to do as he said, he may
say it proprely in latyne thus. Verba ad rem contulit.i. id quod uerbis
dixerat, re facere aggressus est.

Iamdudum adsum. I am here and have been a good while. Dudum and iamdudum
betoken and be spoken of shorter time as of one or two, or three, or four
hours. Nuper pridem, and Iampridem of somewhat longer time, as of six months
or years, or more or less as the matter is. But dudu^ and iamdudu^, pridem and
iampridem, have this difference, that dudum, nuper, and pridem, do signify the
act of the verb to be ended and paste, and therefore they be most commonly and
most elegantly joined with verbes of pretertenses, as, he went away a good
while sens, Dudum abiit. He wrote unto me long agone of that matter, Ea de re
pridem ad me scrip sit. He was in the city of late days, Fuit nu per in urbe.
Iamdudum, and iampridem, signify the act of a verb, remaining and
continuing still, and therefore most usually they be joined with verbes of the
present tence thus. The master is in the schole, and has been a pretty while,
Iamdudum praeceptor est in schola. He is a very greatte friend of mine and has been many a day, Iampridem est mihi amicissimus. Yet both these are much and
often times read ioynid with verbes of pretertenses, and contrary wise that
others with verbes of the present tense, as shewith Laur. Vall. l. 2. eleg.
cap. 34.

O mi Chreme teipsum expectabam. O good sweet Chremes I looked for you, and no
man else.

Scin' tu turbam hanc propter te esse factam? Do thou know or consider that
all this busynes or trouble has been for the?

Scin ad te attinere ha^c omnem rem? Do thou remember that all this matter
perteyneth to the? or lies the upon?

Dum tibi sororem studio reddere, et restituere. while I go about and labor to
rendze, and to restore unto you, your sister.

Haec atque huiusmo^i multa passus sum. I have suffered these things, and many
other like, or have had this and much other like trouble. Est domi apd me. He
is at home at mi house.

Hoc tibi dono do. I give this unto you freely. Dono dare, to give freely. For
diverse verbes be construed and elegantly joined with a double datise, of which
one is set in manner aduerbially and much like an aduerbe, and yet is none. As
thou hopest to have laud and preise for the same thing, which thou layst to me
as a fant, Speras id tibi laudi fore, quod mihi uitio uertis. Take thou no care
nor thought for the matter. Ne sit tibi curae. He has laid his cote to pledge
to me, Dedit mihi uestem pignori. He has put money in my hands in the way of
usury, Dedit mihi pecunia^ foenori. He has lent me a grote, Dedit mihi mutuo
drachmam. He has lent me a gown, Dedit mihi uestem commoda to. And so here in
Terence Hanc tibi dono do, for hanc I put hoc, because it is more in use, and
more convenient to be spoken. For which cause I change almost every where in
this book the feminine gendre into the masculine or neutre, as the place best
admits.

Cave ne prius quam hoc a me accipias, amittas. Beware that you lose it not,
before you receive or have it of me.

Cistellam domo effer cum monumentis, Bring forth the little fosser with the
tokens. Monumenta here in this place (after Donat) is taken for that that the
greeks call and of which vocables, the former signifies the tokens, by which
any thing is brought to mind and knowledge, as cognisances, arms, and such
other things, and ar crepundia puerilia, for is the swathynge bond and also
the clothe or bed, in which sucking children ar wrapped and swathed.

Number formidolosus obsecro es? Art thou fearful or false hearted, or does thy
heart faylle the man I pray the? for (as Donate says) formidolosus is the same
that terribilis, metuendus, to be feared, and also timidus, fearful, or false
hearted.

Egon' formidolosus? Nemo est omnium qui metuat minus. I falseharted? there is
no man alive that fears less.

Ita opus est. So is it need.

Haud metuo. I am not aferde.

Quem tu me hominem existimas? i. quale^. what manner fellow thynkest thou that I
am?

Cogitato qui cum res tibi est. Remember, with whom thou have to do. Qui cum.i.
cum quo: For some prepositions at sometime contrary to the nature of
prepositions set after their case: as mecum, tecum, secum, nobiscum, uobiscum,
and not cum me, te, se, nobis, uobis. The matier, where of we co^mened
yesterday, came nothing to pass, as I would hane had it, Res qua de sumus heri
collocuti, minime mihi cessit ex sententia. So ore tenus, Italiam uersus, ad
orientem usque, qua propter. etc. But yet where as quis has the ablative both
quo and qui* Yet I remember not that I have red quo cum, or qua cu^, but cum
quo and cum qua, nor contrary wise cum qui, but qui cum, in all gendres. Cic.
Ser. Sulpit. li. 4. epist. fam. Nemo est omnium qui cum potius mihi, quam tecum
co^municandum putem, There is no man alive with whom I think I ought rather
to commen of mine affairs than with you. And also plurally we say,
indifferentely cum quibus, and quibuscum, quis cum, or, cum quis.

He is a stranger here, and less may he do than you, he is less acqueynted,
and has fewer friends in these parties.

Scio isthuc. That I know.

Quod cauere possis, stultum est admittere. It is a folysshenes to suffer that
ill to be done that a man may avoid. Admittere.i. sieri sinere says Donate,
and cauere here I take for propellere et declinare.

Malo ego nos prospicere, quam hunc ulcisci accepta iniuria. I have lever, or I
had rather that we provide for the matter before, than to be revenged on him
after that we have had a shrewde turn. Prospicere here is taken for
prouidere, to se before, and so to provide a remedy against ill that might else
chance, Cic. de Sen. Multa, cum remissi ac liberi sunt, futura prospiciunt,
when they be at quiet and at liberty they forsee many things that shall
follow and come after. Idem Ser. Sulp. Tanquam ex aliqua specula prospexi
tempestatem futuram, I foresawe the tempest that should follow, as though I had been in sum high place to see every way round. For that signifies proprely
specula, whether it be an hill, or a tower, or a rock, or a stone, or a tree,
or else what being of such height that one may se far every way round about.

Tu abi, atque ostium obsera intus. Go thou, and lock the door in the infyde.

Ego hinc transcurro ad forum. I wol ro^ne or, make a sterte from hens into

is showed before in Andria.

force, violence, or strength of hand, commence a fair actio^ against him, and
goo to the law with him.

Fac animo haec presenti dicas. See that thou speak this with a bold spirit,
as who should say, that thy wits be thyn own, and that thy heart fayse the
not, when thou shuidest speak this.

Attolle pallium. Take up your cloak about you. Pallium here is taken pro
chlamyde.

Huic ipsi est opus patrono, quem ego defensorem paro. He whom I goo about to
make mine advocate or man of law, or defender of my cause, him self has need
of one to defend him. Patronus is he that defendethe any manne, being in
trouble or peril.

In the seventh Scene.
Hanc cine ego contumeliam in me accipiam? Should I suffer such a notable or
shameful despite to be done unto me? hic, haec insignis, et hoc insigne, is
that that is very notable, whether it be in good or in ill, as we say insignis
uirtute, and insignis flagitiis.

Mori me satius est. I were better be deed.

Male mulctabo ipsum. I wolle punysshe him sharply. Mulctabo.i. puniam here,
for mulctare proprely is to punysshe by the pourse.

Imperatoris uirtutem noueram, et uim mi litum. I knew the manlynes or
valiantnes of the captain, and the strength or powar of his soldiers.

Noueram sine sanguine hoc fieri no^ posse. I knew well that this could never

Nimirum consilium illud rectum est, de occludendis aedibus. Certes that is
right good connsayle that I gave you to shut in your doors against him.

Hic nebulo magnus est. This is a greatte lubbarde knave.

Ne metuas. Be not aferde.

Omnia prius experiri, quam armis, sapien tem decet. It is the part of a wise
man to prove and assay all other ways, er he fight for any thing.

Qui scis, an, quae iubcam, sine vi faciat? What know thou whether he woll
do that ^^ others in despite and for a great contumely or check, as now in
this time the Turks call us christen men dogs, and one enemy in time of
war calls any soldier of the contrary part, dog in despyte. And it is
taken of the Greeks for those, whom the latin men call impudentes, shameless
fellows the greeks call proprely.i. canino aspectu homines, men lokynge like
dogs.

Quis tu homo es? what man art thou? or who art thou?

Edico tibi ne uim facias ullam in illum. I charge the that thou lay no violent
hands on him.

Tu me prohibeas, meum ne tanga^? Shall thou let me to lay hand on that,

Hic furti se alligat. He charge him self of felony, or trespass. Alligat se
furti (says Donatus).i. rerum se efficit fraudis. Alligat.i. astringit,
illaqueat, and obnoxiu^ facit. entangleth and brings him self in danger of
impechement. And furtum is not only theste, or robbery, but also all manner
felony, or other injury, fraud, deceyte, guile, or any trespass what so ever
it be, that is in latyne, omne maleficium generaliter.

Satis hoc tibi est. That is enough for the.

Idem hoc tu ais? Sayeste thou even the same to?

Quid nunc agimus? what shall we do now?

Noui ingenium mulierum, nolunt ubi uelis, ubi nolis cupiunt ultro. I know the

good fire.

Iamdudum est animus in patinis. My mind is on my dynar, and has been a good
while.

Out of the fyfthe Act in the first Scene.
Pergin' sceleste mecum perplexe loqui? Do thou stylle yet speak ambiguously
and doubtfully unto me thou naughty pack?

Non tu isthuc mihi dicturus aperte es, quie quid est? wolte thou not tell it

Quid tibi ego dica^? What should I tell the?

Is^huccine interminata sum hinc abiens tibi? Did not I charge the upon a
greatte pain, when I went hens, that this should not be done?

Quid facerem? what should I have done? a propre and elegant locution or manner
of spekyng, and much in use among authors noted in Hadrian de sermon. lat.

Ita ut iuss isti soli credita est. She was left with him alone according to
your co^ma^dme^t.

Oue^ lupo co^misisti. Thou myghtest as well have committed and left a sheep
with a wolf to keep: Ouem lupo co^mittere is a proverb used when so ever we
wol signify any thing committed unto him, for whose cause and for fear of
whom it had rather been expedient and requisyte to have had an other keeper.
Erasmus in chil.

Dispudet sic mihi data esse uerba. I am ill asshamed, that I should be in
such wise beguyled.

Quid hominis illic est? What fellow is that?

Habemus hominem ipsum. We have espied or found very him that did the deed.

Quid illi faciemus? what shall we do unto him? Hadrian has noted that authors
use elegantly this manner of speaking by the dative case, as well by facio, as
also by fio passiuely thus. Quid illi faciemus? Quid illi fiet? for that which
some folyshe fellows (says he) speak thus: Quid de illo faciemus? Quid de
illo fiet? Cicero. in Academ. quaestionibus. Quid enim faceret huic
conclusioni? what should he do to such a conclusion as this is? etc. Idem in
Rullum. Quaero, si, qui uolunt uendere, non fuerint, quid pecuniae fiet? I
demand this question, if there shall be none that wolle selle hit, what shall
be done with the money? And Cato de re rust. uses the same manner speaking
without interrogation. Si ante non deportauerit dominus, uino quod uolet
faciet, If the owner do not carry it down before, he shall do with the wine
what he woll. This notwithstanding I have noted diverse places in Terence,
where he uses to speak by the same verbes joined with the ablative case
without a preposition, as much as with the datife. Teren. in Heauton act. 1.
sc. 2. Quia enim incertum est etiam quid se faciat, For because that in deed he
is yet uncertain or in doubt what to do with him self. Ibid. act. 2. sc. 3.
Cedo, quid hic faciet sua? s. amica, why tell me what shall Clitipho here do
with his own lover? Id. in An. act. 3. sc. 5. Pamph. Nec quidem quid me faciam
scio. Da. Nec equidem me, Pamhil. and in good sothe I can not tell what I may
do with my self. Da. Nor I with my self. Ibid. Quid me fiet? what shall become
of me? I omytte that many of thexemples that Hadrian cites and allegeth, may
be taken as well in the ablative as in the datyue, that no child fear nor
doubt to speak by both cases. Al be it Plautus in Casina (at leest wise if the
book be not corrupt but have the true letter, as all exemplaries do consent
and agree) speaks in the same sense by the accusatyue. Quid agis tu marite?
mi uir? unde ornatu hoc aduenis? quid fecisti scipionem? aut quod habuisti
pallium? what do you husbonde? my good sweet husbond? from whe^s come you thus
arayde? what have you done with your staff? or what clooke have you had? Quid
fecisti scipionem for de scipione, or (more elegantly to speak) scipioni in
the dative, or scipione in the ablative. Scipio, onis, is latyne for a staff:
And thereof the family of the noble Scipiones, in Rome had their first name.
For one Cornelius did lead about his father being blind, and stood him instead both of his eyes and also of a staff, for which thing men took up and
used to call him Scipio, and so all his familye after him were semblablye
named Scipiones of the cognominacion of the said Cornelius.

Vide amabo, si non, cum aspicias, os impudens uidetur. See I pray you, if when
a body looks on him, he seem not to have an impudent look, or a shameless face.

Quae eius confidentia est? How bold he is? or, how great impudency or
lack of shame is in him? Confido, dis, confisus sum, confidere, coufisum, su,
to have sure hope, trust, and confidence, as now we say also in english,
and it is referred as well to the present time, as to the time paste and also
to the time to comme (as witnesses Donat and Valla) And confido, dis, is used
in bonam partem, and yet confidens, and confidentia coming of the same verb
is observed by custom and use of speaking, to be almost ever taken and used
in malo, and very seldom in the good. And fiducia is in manner evermore taken
in the better part.

In the second Scene.
Vterque, pater et matter, quasi dedita opera domi erant, ut nullo modo introire
possem quin uiderent me. Both my father and my mother were at home, as if it
had been appointed for the nones, so that I might by no means get in, but
that they must needs have seen me.

Dum ante ostium sto. while I was sta^dyng before the door.

Notus mihi quidam obuia^ uenit. One of mine acqueyntance came and met me.

Ego me in pedes, quantu^ queo, conijcio. I took me to my fete as fast as I
might rounne.

Miserrimus fui fugitando, ne quis me cognosceret. I was very ill troubled,
encombred, and vexed in runnyng out of the way, that no man might know me. And
it is (as Donatus notes) a very elegant manner of speaking to say miser
fugitando, as miser amando. Albe it he does interpret miserrimus here, lassus,
fatigatus, et languidus, weary, tyered, and faynte, and cognosceret is taken
for agnosceret.

Quid faciam? quid mea autem? quid faciet mihi? what shall I do? tushe what
recke I? what woll he do to me?

Bone uir Door salve. Honest manne Door, god you save.

Satin' id tibi placet? Do thou like hit very well.

Credin' te impune abiturum? Do thou think to escape unpunished?

Vnam hanc noxiam mitte, si aliam unqua^ ullam admisero, occidito. Pardon me
this one offense or trespass, and if I shall ever do so any more slay me: Noxiam
(says Donate) pro noxa, trissyllabum pro dissyllabo. All be it Valla denies
this word noxa to be latyne, saying (as I take him) that hit is no where
founden, contrary to other grammariens. And in deed Calepinus redeth here noxam
and not noxiam. Al be it noxia is in diverse places in Plaut,

Number meam seuitiam ueritus es? Dyddest thou fear that I would be to sharp or
cruel on the?

Hunc metui ne me criminaretur tibi? I was aferde of this man leese that he
would accus^ me unto you. Criminari aliquem is to accus^ a man, and to lay any
thing to his cha^^^ in open court, and crimen is not only the offense or
trespass self, but also the crimination, or accusation for the same. Valla. li
4. elegan. cap. 58.

Vix me contineo, quin inuolem in capillu^, I can uneath refreyne my self from
fleinge upon him to pulle him by the hear.

Etiam ultro derisum aduenit. Besides all the other things, he comes for the
nones (...) laugh us to scorn.

Abi hinc insane. Get the hens mad fellow.

Quid ita uero abeam? why should I get me hens I pray you?

Credin' isti quicquam furcifero? Do you give any credence to this galowclapper?

Missa haec faciamus. Let we pass all this.

Non te dignum Cherea fecisti. Cherea you have done otherwise than becomed you.

Si ego dignus hac co^tumelia sum maxim, at tu indignus qui faceres tamen.
Although I be never so well worthy to be thus spytefully

Quid nunc co^silij capiam, nescio. I can not tell what counsel or way now to
take.

Conturbasti mihi rations omnes. Thou haste troubled all my reckenynges and
accomptes, or, thou haste troubled and dyspoynted all that ever I rekened upon.
Conturbare rations, is the same that we say in english to bring one out of
his recknyng that is to say to bring him out of his purpose and to dispoynt
it.

Dehinc spero aeternam inter nos gratiam fore. From hens forth I trust there
shall be perfyte love between us for ever, or that we shall be friends and
lovers for ever.

Ex huiusmodi re quapiam. Of or by some semblable thing as this.

Saepe ex malo principio magna familiaritas conflata est.i. contracta,
comparata, consiliata. Often times of a lewd beginning has grown greatte
famylyarytie and frendeshyppe.

Quid si hoc aliquis uoluit deus? what if this were the will of god, or of
sum good sayncte?

Equidem in eam partem accipio, et uolo. Truly that way do I take hit, and
would right gladly that it might so be.

Vnum hoc scito. Know and be sure of this one thing.

Scito contumeliae no^ me fecisse caussa, sed amoris. You shall wit, or
understand that I did it not for any despyte or villanye toward you, but for
love.

Ignosco tibi. I forgive or pardon the.

Non adeo inhumano ingenio sum. I am not of so ungentle a nature or facion.

Tibi ab isto hera cauendum intelligo. I well perceive dame that you had
need beware of this fellow.

Nihil tibi quidquam credo. I trust nor believe the nere a whytte.

Ego me tuae commendo, et co^mitto fidei. I commytte and put me hoolely in your
honesty, goodness, or grace.

Ego te oro in hac re mihi adiutrix sis. I beseech you to be my helper in this
matter. Adiutrix is a nowne verbal of the feminine ge^dre, and therefore referred
to the feminine sex: and adiutor is of the masculine, and referred to the manne.

Te mihi patronum cupio. I would feign have you to defend and to help me.

Emoriar, si no^ hanc uxore^ duxero. I pray god I dye but I woll mary her.

Volet, certo scio. He wolle be glad, I know very well.

Iam frater hic aderit uirginis. The brother of the maiden woll be here by and
by.

Domi operiamur potius quam hic ante hostium. Let us tarry for him within the
house rather than here before the door.

Hunc tu in aedeis cogitas recipere posthac? Do you mind to let this fellow
ever com within your house again after this?

Creed hoc meae fidei. Believe this at my word. As who should say, trust me in
this, for I promise you faythefully and lie not, nor I speak not but as I
think and as my fidelity and faith that I owe toward you byndeth me.

Dabit hic aliquam pugnam denuo. This fellow wolle cause sum debate or fraye
again.

Parum perspexisse eius uidere audaciam. You seem not to have well marked nor
considered the boldenes of him.

Neque seruandu^ tibi quidquam dare ausim, neque te seruare. I dare neither
commyt any thing to the to keep, nor yet to take the charge to see well to the.
For seruare here is put, for diligenter obseruare.

Obsecro, abeamus intro. I pray you let us goo in.

Nolo me in uia cu^ hac ueste uideat. I would not that he should see me in the
street with this garment.

I prae, sequor. Go before, and I will com aftir.

Tu isthic mane, ut Chremem introducas. Tarry you there, to bring Chremes into
the house.

In the third Scene.
Quid uenire in mentem nunc possit mihi, qui referam illi gratiam? what might
I now deuyse wherewith to requyte him? qui pro quo.

Move te ocyus. Bystere the apace.

Moueo. I stere.

Video, sed nihil promoues. I see the move or stere, but thou make no way,
Video. s. te mouere, sed. etc.

Been narras. Ye say well.

Illi faueo uirgini. I favor, or love that maiden well, or I bear good mind
and favor to that maiden.

Iamdudum hera uos expectat domi. My dame looks for you at home and has done
a good while.

Parmenonem incedere uideo, uide ut ocio sus sit. I see Parmeno come iettynge
like a lord, but see how idle he is, as one out of all care and thought. v
t. i. quom odo, uel qualiter. Incedo, dis, inessi, dear, incessum, incessu, is
ambulare to walk, that is to go. But proprely incedere differs from
ambulare. For incedere proprely is to go with astately pace, as who should
say, to show a greatte grauytee or majesty in going, as princes do when
they show them selfs in their astate. Seneca. Tenero ac molli passu
suspendimus gradum, nec ambulamus, sed incedimns, we stay and prolonge our
goinge with a nyce or tender and soft, delicate, or gingerly pace, and do not
go as others do, but iette or go like great estates. Of incedo comes a verbal
incessus us, ui, which is used for any manner going, but most proprely it is
the pace, that great princes and noble men use, when they show their estates
or majesty. Ver. Et uera incessu patuit dea, And she showed her self by her
pace, to be a goddess. Valla. li. 5. c. 79. ociosus.i. securus, taking no
thought nor care for nothing.

Si dijs placet. In the name of god. It is a proverb never used in latin
speaking but ironice, and in indignation. Read examples in Hadrian de ser. lat.
There is an other proverb, Si deus uoluerit, if it shall please god, used in
serious matters of any thing to com, the end of which depends or hangethe
in the favor of god. And it is taken out of thepistle of saint James, and
recited in chil. E.

Spaero me habere, qui hunc meo excruciem modo. I think I have found a way
to vex him, and to anger every veyn in his heart, even as I woll my self.
Habere.i. inuenisse, or scire. meo modo.i. ut uolo.

Hunc perterrebo sacrilegum. I woll make this wicked fellow thoroughly aferde.
Sacri legum.i. impium, nefarium, scelerosum. Al be it sacrilegus proprely is he
that steals hallowed things, and sacrilegium stealyng of hallowed things.
Valla li. 6. eleg. c. 40.

In the fourth Scene.
Reuiso quidnam hic rerum gerat. I com again to see what he is doing here.

Astu rem tractauit. He has handeled the matter wylely. Astu.i. astute, and it
is here an aduerbe, but some time it is the ablatife of the nowne astus, tus,
tui. For it follows in the same comedy, An in astu uenit.

Dij uestram fidem. O good lord, it stands always in the place of an
interiection of meruaylynge, and not of calling on, admirantis non inuocantis.

Confeci sine molestia, sine sumptu, sine dispe^dio. I brought it to an end
without any troublous busynes, without any charge or expenses, and without any
loss or damage.

Id mihi puto palmarium.i. palma dignum. For that thing I think my self
worthy to be crowned. Palma, mae, in latin, and in greek is a tree, that was
wont to be given to such as had won any victory. For because that it is
always grene, and (as Plutarchus says) of that propretie and nature, that
there can no weight nor burden oppress it, but that it woll arise under it,
and stand up as it should do, Read chil. Eras. in the proverb, Palmam far.
Mihi is here datiuus. Festiuitatis.i. iucunditatis gratia adiunctus, of which
read in libello de octo partium constructione.

Cum cognorit, perpetuo oderit. After that he knows hit, he woll hate it ever
as long as he lives.

Foeminis, dum foris sunt, nihil uidetur mu^dius, nec magis compositum
quidquam, nec magis elega^s. when women be abroad out of their own howses,
nothing in the world seems to be more clenly than they be, nor nothing more
demure, nor more propre or feate.

Cum coenant, liguriunt. When they eat, they feed nycely or deyntely, and not
but of the best. For ligurire, is furmed (as says Donate) of the greek word,
which is in english sweet. Ligurire somtymes is auide et helluose, that is
gredily and rauenningly or gluttonously to devour very much.

Harum uidere ingluuiem, sordes, inopia^, quam inhonestae solae sint domi,
atque auidae cibi, quo pacto ex iure hesterno panem atrum uorent, nosse omnia
haec, salus est adolescentulis. But to see the rauenynge or cogellyng, the
sluttyshnes, and the penury of them, and how uncleanly and greedy on their
meat they be, when they are alone by them selfs at home in their own houses,
and how they woll slaber or sosse up brown bread with gruel of the leuyng of
the other days before, all these things to know is the preservation of
youth to be ware of them. Hesternus, na, number, is not always taken for the
day before this day, but is mock used for pridianus, na, nu^, that is for
the day before any other day. Cice. Videre uideor alios intrantes, alios
exeuntes, quos dam ex uino uacillantes, quosdam hesterna e potatione
oscitantes, Me thinks I see some goinge in, some goinge forth, some roylynge
by reason of to much drinking of wine, and some yeanynge and gapyng of the
revel that they kept the day before. And semblably cras and crastinus is abused
and spoken of the day after any other day. Verg. in georg.

Si uero ad solemn rapidu^, lunasque sequentes, Ordine respicies, nunquam te
crastina fallet Hora, nec insidijs noctis capiere serenae.

Ego te pro istis dictis et factis ulciscar, ut ne impune in nos illuseris. I
woll revenge or requite the for those thy sayings and doings, that thou shall
not laugh us to scorn and escape free thy self.

In the fyfthe Scene.
Proli facinus foedum. Oh a shameful and abhomynable deed.

O infelicem adolescentulum. Oh unfortunate young man.

O scelestum Parmenonem. O ungracious fellow Parmeno.

Quae futura esse exempla dicunt in eum in digna. How sore and how grievously
they say, that he shall be punysshed to thensample of al others? Exempla
aedere, or, exempla facere in aliquem is to punyshe any body openly to
thexample of others. And exempla edi, or exempla fieri in aliquem is to be
punysshed openly, to thensample of others, as if one be set upon the pyllory,
eduntur, or fiunt in eum exempla. So here in Terence anon after these words,
Quae futura esse exempla dicunt in eum indigna, Parmeno says unto Pythias: In
quem exempla fienty? who is that that shall be punysshed to thensample of all
others?

O Iuppiter, quae illic turba est? Oh Iuppyter what greatte trouble, or what a
do is there?

Perdidisti istum adolescentulu^. Thou haste utterly undone and cast away this
young man.

Studes dare uerba nobis. Thou go about to deceive us.

Scis eum hinc ciuem esse. Thou knoweste that he is of this city here.

Scis frarrem eius adprime nobilem. s. esse. Thou knoweste that his brother is
a very great gentle man.

Ille ubi resciuit factum. He when he knew what was done.

Colligauit eum miseris modis. He bound him fast hand and foot, that pity it
was to se.

Atque equide^ orante, ut ne id faceret, Thaide. Ye and that when Thais desired
and prayed him that he would not so do.

Nunc minatur facturum se id, quod ego nunquam uidi fieri, neque uelim. s.
uidere fieri. Now he manaceth and thretneth to do such a thing unto him, as
I never saw done to any, nor would not see by my good will.

Qua audacia tantum facinus audet? How darethe he be so bold to do such a
peryllous act?

Ne hoc nesciatis. That you may not sey, that you knew not so much before,
or, that you say not, that you were ignorant of this.

Dico uobis, nostrum esse illum herilem filium. I tell you he is our masters
son.

Ne quam in illum Thais, uim fieri sinat. Let not Thais suffer any violent
hands to be laid on him.

Cur non egomet intro eo? why goo not I in my self?

Vide quid agas, ne illi prosis, et tu pereas. Beware what thou do, and that
thou do not him pleasure, and cast away thine own self.

Putant, quicquid est ex te esse ortu^. They think all that ever has been
done to come first of the.

Quid igitur faciam miser? quid ue incipiam? What shall I than do unfortunate
man? or, what shall I first begin?

Video rure redeuntem senem? I have espied the old manne comme out of the
countreye.

Dicam huic, an non? Shall I tell him the matter, or not?

Dicam hercle, etsi mihi magnu^ malu^ scio paratum. In faith I woll tell him,
and yet I know, that I shall surely have a greatte harm or shrende turn
thereby.

Necesse est huic dicere ut subueniat. It is necessary to show this man of
the matter, to the end that he may do some help in it.

Tu isti narrato omnem rem ordine. Show you all the matter unto this man in
order.

In the syxte Scene.
Ex meo propinquo rure hoc capio commodi, neque agri, neque urbis odium me
unquam percipit, ubi satias coepit fieri, commuto locum. Of my ground that I
have without the city this commodity and pleasure I have, that I am never
through weary neither of being in the country, nor of the cite. For wha^ I
begin to be weary of the one or the other, I change places. Odium.i. fastidium
uel taedium. Satias.i. satietas, hoc est taedium ac fastidium.

Quem praestolare hic ante ostium? whom do thou tarry for here before the

I can not speak for fear.

Here, primum te arbitrari, quod res est, uelim. Master first and formeste I
would have you think as matter in deed is.

Quicquid huius factum est, culpa non factum est mea. what so ever has been
done here, it was not done by my fault.

Recte sane interrogasti. You did well to ask.

Oportuit rem praenarrasse me. I owght to have showed you the matter first.

Aliud ex alio malum. One myschiefe on an others neck.

Me impulsore haec non facit. He does not such things as these by my
instygacion, counsel, or setting on. Impulsore.i. authore, consultore.

Isthuc, quicquid est, primum expedi. First tell me this matter quyckely, what
so ever hit is.

Audaciam meretricu^ specta. See the boldness of harlottes or strumpettes.

Nunquid est aliud mali damniue, quod non dixeris? Is there any other myschiefe
or mysfortune besides this, that thou haste not yet told nor spoken of?

Non dubiu^ est, quin magnum mihi ex hac re sit malum. There is no doubt, but
that I shall have sum greatte dyspleasure by this thing.

In the seventh Scene.
Nunquam aedepol quidquam ia^ diu, quod magis uellem euenire, mihi euenit. In
good southe there never happened unto me now a great while any thing, that I
would more gladly should have happened.

Intro ad nos uenit. He came into our house

Mihi rediculo fuit. I laughed well at him.

Quid timeret scieba^. I knew what he fered.

Id prodeo, ut conueniam Parmenonem. I come forth of doors to speak with
Parmeno. Id, hoc est, propter id, hit is eclipsis praepositionis.

express, what sport and lawghynge we have had at the within.

Ilicone credere ea, quae dixi, oportuit te? Must thou needs have believed that
that I said by and by even at the first?

An poenitebat flagitij? Dyddest thou take remorse, or repentance of thy great
offense? Flagitum is propreli scelus flagris dignum, on heinous offense worthy
to have sharp correction and punysshemente. Valla. li. 4. eleg. ca. 58.

Quid illi credis animi tum fuisse, ubi ueste^ uidit illam esse eum indutum
pater? Where was his heart trowest thou, when his father saw him in that
apparel? we may say induor ueste, or ueste^: for induo is one of the verbes
that govern a double accusatife after them, and of al such verbes their
passiues require the later accusative of both. As I teache the grammar, Ego
doceo te grammaticen. By the passyue. Thou art taught grammar, Tu doceris
grammaticen.

Itanc lepidum tibi uisum est nos irridere? Dyddest thou think it such a
pretty sport, to mock us?

others, or that all other shall take ensample by the.

Nullus sum. I am undone, (as who should say) I were as good be deed and out
of this world.

Hic pro illo munere tibi honos est habitus. This honesty, and this promotion
have you gotten by that benefyte or pleasure domge.

Egomet meo iudicio miser, quasi sorex, ho die perij. I am cast away and
betrayed this day by mine own words, like as the rattes by their loud
squeakynge betray them selfs, shemynge where they be. Suo ipsius iudicio
perijt sorex, The ratte betrayed her selle with her own noise, and so was
taken, is a prouerbiall speaking of any body that are betrayed by their own
words. And as Donate thinks, the use of the metaphor, was taken of this,
that the propretie of the the rattes is to make a louder squekyng tha^ do the
myse. See chil. Eras.

In the eight Scene.
Qua spe, aut quo consilio huc imus? In hope of what, or in what entente comme
we hither?

Quid coeptas Thraso? what entende you, or, what begin you to do Thraso?

Thaidi me dedam, et faciam quod iubeat. I woll yield my self unto Thais, and
wol do what she shall command me.

Qui minus, quam Hercules seruiuit Omphale? why not, as well as Hercules did
service unto Omphale? Omphale was a maiden, and queen of the country of Lydia,
whom Hercules did love, and to win her favor, did at her commandment
slay a great serpent about the flode of Sagaris, and than after served the same
Omphale as her womman servant, and as if he had been her bond maiden: In so
much that she compelled him to pycke wolle, and to spynne and card, where as
her self used to shoot, and to bear a mace in her hand, and to were upon her
the heed of a lion (as if she had been a valyant knight) and refused to go in
apparel meet and conuenyent for her sex.

Exemplum placet. I like that example or comparison well.

Vtinam ribi commitigari uideam sandalio caput. would god that I might see thy
palad tanned or made sobre with a slypper.

Quid hoc est mali? what mysfortune is here befallen?

Hunc ego nunquam uideram. This manne had I never seen before.

Quidnam properans prosilijt? wherefore comes he forth so fast skyppynge and
leaping?

In the nynthe Scene.
Ecquis me uiuit hodie fortunatior? Is there any man living this day more
fortunate, or more happy tha^ I am? Hadrian in de ser. lat. has noted that
this particle, ec, has a very great grace in askyng a question, wha^ it is
compowned with quis, quae, quod, uel quid. Cic. Attico, Ecquis unquam tam ex
amplo statu, tam in bona caussa, tantis facultatibus ingenij, consilij, gratiae
tantis prae sidijs bonoru^ omniu^, concidit? was there ever any man suppressed
or undone being of so high degree, having so good and rightful a cause,
having so high a gift and induemert of wit, polycie, and grace to have the
favor of men, and having so great assistence and aid of al good and honest
men? And sometime it is used infinitely with semblable and no less grace or
elegancie. Cic. Attico. Quod quaeris, ecquae spes pacificationis sit, quantum
ex Pompeij multo et accurato sermon perspexi, ne uoluntas quidem est, As
touching that you desire to know whether there be any hope of atonement and
peace to be made between Caesar and Pompeius, as far as I have well perceived
by much and very curious or precise communication with Pompeius, there is no
such mind ne will neither.

Nemo hercle quisquam. In faith no man in the world. Of nemo elegantely joined
with quisquam hit is noted in Hadriane de sermon. latino.

In me plane dij potestatem suam omnem ostendere. In me the goddis have
plainly showed all their hole power, and how much they are able to do.

O mearum uoluptatum omnium inuentor, inceptor, perfector. O thou that haste
ben the deuyser and fynder out, the begynner, and also the fynyssher of al my
plesures.

Scis in quibus sim gaudijs? Do thou know in what great joys I am?

Scis Pamphilem meam inuentam ciuem? Do thou know that my best beloue
Pamphila is found to be free borne of this city?

Scis Pamphilam meam sponsa mihi? Do thou know that my best beloue Pamphila
is promised and made sure to me, to marye with me?

Audin'tu illum? Do thou here him?

Meo fratri gaudeo amorem esse omnem in tranquillo. I am right glad and
joyous that my brothers love is all quiet, and out of trouble.

In clientelam et fidem nobis dedit se. He is become our client, and has put
him self holely in our hands.

Hoc aliud est, quod gaudeamus. This is an other thing, of which we may be
glad, quod.i. propter quod, eclipsis praepositionis. Miles pellitur for as. The
soldier is clean expoulsed, or out of doors, or banysshed the house.

Frater ubi ubi est, fac quam primum haec audiat. Help that my brother may
here of all this at ones where so ever he be. Vbi ubi.i vbicunque. For all
voices that are relatiues, may sometimes be interrogatiues, as when they ask a
question, and sometimes they be neither relatiues nor interrogatiues, but are
put and taken infinitely, and than if they be dowbled, that is to say,
compowned with them selfs, they sygnifye as much as if they were compowned
with this partycle cumque, as quisquis.i. quicunque, qualisqualis,.i.
qualiscunque, quoquo.i. quocunque, quantus quantus,.i. qua^tuscunque, ubi
ubi.i. ubicunque, and so of all others. Quamprimum.i. ualde cito, or
primoquoque tempore, as soon as may be. For quam, in composition signifies
ualde, and therefore is joined with the superlatiue degree. And note that there
is a great difference between quamprimum, and cumprimu^, of which read Laur.
Vall. l. eleg. c. 17.

Numquid dubitas, quin ego perpetuo perierim? Do thou thynk any other, but
that I am utterly undone for ever? or, do thou not think verily, that I am
utterly undone for ever?

Sine dubio opinor. Without doubt, I think so.

Quid commemorem primum? what should I speak of first?

Quem laudem maxim? whom may I most commend or preise?

Dedit mihi consilium ut facerem. He gave me counsel to do it.

O Iuppiter, serua obsecro haec nobis bona. Oh Iuppiter, keep and contynne us
in this good fortune, felicity, or prosperity, I beseech the.

Incredibilia modo narrauit. He told wonders while ere.

Vbi est frater? where is my brother?

Praesto adest. He is even here ready.

Satis credo. I believe well, or I think well.

Nihil est Thaide dignius quod ametur. There is nothing more worthy to be
beloved than is Thais.

Nostrae est omni fautor familiae. He favors or loves all our house well.

Quanto minus spei est, tanto magis amo. The less hope there is, the more am I
in love.

Perfice hoc praecibus, pretio, ut heraea^ in part aliqua apud Thaidem. Bring
this to pass with prayers, or with money, that I may be an hanger on in one
part or other, with Thais.

Difficile est. It is hard.

Si quid collibuit noui te. If thou be well disposed to a thing, I know the
well enough what thou canste do.

Hoc si effeceris, quoduis donum, et praemi um a me optato id optatum feres. If
thou may bring this to pass, wysshe or desire of me what so ever gift or
reward thou wolte, and thou shall have thy desire. Donum est, quod gratis
datur, praemium quod pro meritis confertur.

Postulo, ut mihi tua do mus, te present, te absente, pateat semper. I require
that your house may be open for me at all times, whether thou be in the way, or
out of the way.

Do fidem ita futurum. I promise the faith fully that it shall so be.

Quem hic ego audio? who is that, that I here speak here?

Tu fortasse, quae facta hic sunt, nescis. Thou do not know peradventure
what things have benne done, or have happened here.

Cur in his te conspicor regionibus? why do I se the in these parties or in
these quarters?

Edico tibi. I tell the openly. Edico, edicis, edixi, edicere, edictum, is
proprely to proclayme, and perteynethe oonelye to princes, officers, and
renlers, and thereof hoc edictum, edicti, cto, is the commandment given or
proclaimed by any prince, ruler, or officer. But here edico, is taken for clare
dico, et clare proloquor. To speak or to pronounce out aloude without any fere
or dissimulation, for e, and ex, in composition have much that signification,
as eruo, is to get or to mine a thing out of the earth or any other place,
where it is hard to comme by. Egero, is to cast out, effero, is to bring out,
expello, is to thruste out. Eloquor is to speak out alowde, and so edico here
is to speak out alowde. And in the same signification did Terence use edico
before in the fyfte Scene of this fyfte act, in this same comedy in the
person of Parmeno, saying thus unto Pythias. Dico, edico uobis nostrum essem
illum herilem filium, I tell you, ye and I tell you plainly and boldly, that he
is my masters son: as who should say, I am not aferde to tell it you, but
would that you should well know it, and warn you that you do him no harm.

Si in platea hac te offendero post unquam, nihil est quod dicas mihi, alium
quaerebam iter hac habui, peristi. If it shall be my chance to find the in this
street at any time after this day, it shall nothing avail the to say unto
me, I sought for an other man, or my iourneye lay this way, for thou art but
a deed manne.

Eia haud sic decet. what soft, that is not semynge, or it should not be for
your honesty so to do. Eia is an aduerbe of correctynge.

Non cognosco uestrum tam superbu^. s in geniu^ uel genus, uel animu^, uel
more^, uel in stitutu^. I am not acqueinted with this proud and disdaynefull
facion of you, or I can no skylle of this your. etc. All be it Donate takes
these words, Vestrum tam superbu^, to be put absolutely, that is
substantifely, as uestrum tam superbum.i. uestram tanta^ superbiam. Donate
brings in for his authority a like manner of speaking out of Andria in the
syxte Scene of the fourth Act: Pol Crito antiquum obtines. Of which it is
there sufficiently noted.

Prius audite paucis, quod cum dixero, si placuerit, facitote. First here in
two or three words, and when I have said, if it shall like you, do it.

Tu concede paululu^ isthuc Thraso. Thraso go you and stand a little further
that way.

Ego uos credere hoc mihi uehementer ue lim. I would that you in any wise
believe me in this.

Si uobis prodest, uos non facere inscitia est. If it be for your profit, it
is a folyshenes for you not to do it.

Magis oportunus, nec magis ex usu tuo ne mo est. There is no man more mete for
it, nor no man more to your co^modite. Oportunus.i. idoneus, mete for the
purpose. Here note that three negacions do no more to the sense, nor have no
more signifycation nor strength, than two, as Laur. Vall. notith in the third
book of eleg. and the.27. chapter, as numquam mihi nec obfuisti, nec
profuifti, Thou never dyddest me neither harm, ne good. Cic. in tusc. quaest.
Nescirent nec ubi nec qualia essent, They knew not neither where, nor what
things they were. Ibid. Nihil nec disputare, nec scribere pretermisi, I
omytted nothing neither to dispute and reason, nor to write. Note also that
two or three negations do sometimes deny with more vebemencie. Plin. l. 18.
cap. 4. Oculorum uitia fieri negant, nec lippire eos, qui cum pedes lauant,
aqua inde ter oculos tangant. It is a saying, that they shall never have
diseases in their eyes, nor shall not be bleare eyed, which when they wasshe
their feet, touch their eyes thryse with the same water. Examples be
innumerable, and Budaeus has noted the same largely and copiously in his
annotacions upon the pandechtes of the civil law.

Et habet, quod det, et dat nemo largius. He both has ynowghe to give, and
does give no man more liberally.

Fatuus est, insulsus, tardus. He is a natural fool without any wisdom or good
facion, nor has any quyckenes or lustynes, nor actiuitie or spirit in him.
Fatuus (says Donat) inepta loquens, spekyng folyshe words. For fatuus (says
he) is said and derived a fando, of speaking. And thereof fauni, that is to
say rusticall the goddie of the woddes, which are called in greek Satyri,
were called in latyne fatui, i. (as Seruius upon Vergyll and Donate in this
place expounds it) multum fantes, hoc est multum loquentes, a fando et
uaticinando, So that after Donate fatui be they that are folyshe in their
words and sayenges, Insulsi are follysshe in the herfe, mind, and
intelligence, and after him they err and be deceived that think that fatuus
is animo and cord, and insulsus, in uerbis et dictis. But Laur. Vall. l. 4.
eleg. ca. 13. says in this wise, he is called in latin stultus, that lacks
experience of things, and knowledge of the world, nor has no foresight in
things to come, so that many being no unwise men otherwise, yet may at
sometime happly do stulte, that is foolysshely, or (more proprely to say)
unadvisedly. Fatuus, is he that is a very sole, and has no manner wisdom at
all. And it is by translation taken of the saueryenes of meats, for when
meats be all werysshe and unsavory, they be called in latyne fatui cibi. And
semblably a man that has no wisdom is called in latin fatuus. Martial. li.
12.

Vt sapiant fatuae fabrorum prandia betae,

O quam saepe petet uina piperque coquus.

O how often woll the cook ask and require wine and pepper for to make the
werysh beetes (that smythes and carpenters dyne withal) to be somewhat sauery.
And this seems to be a better reason for this vocable fatuus, than that other,
which certain writers do approve and allow, that is to say, that they are
called in latyne fatui, which being taken with a certain fury or madness
(such as Fatua the wise of king Faunus was much taken with all) do prophecy
things to come, like as she the said fatua did. Stolidus is he that is
folysshe and draws much nygh unto the nature and perceiving or
understanding of sheep or other folysshe brute beasts. Hactenus Valla.
Insulsus is be that has no wisdom, nor wit, nor no grace nor good facion
neither in words, nor gesture, nor otherwise in his behauoure. what sal and
sales signify, it is largely showed and declared in the third scene of the
second act of this same comedy. Of sal comes salsitudo or salsedo: Of
salsitudo or salcedo, is fourmed salsus a, um, a thing that is salt and by
translation, wyttie, sharp and pleasant and also bytynge in words or
otherwise. Contrary unto salsus is insulsus, a, um, without any wyttynes or
pleasant facion, and consequently very foolysshe and such as no man may have
any pleasure in.

Stertit noctesque et dies. He lies routynge and snortynge all day and all
night.

Facile pellas, ubi uelis. You may easilye thruste him out of doors when you
list.

Hoc ego uel primu^ puto. This do I think even principal and chief of al.
Vel.i. etiam.

Accipit hominem nemo melius prorsus, neque prolixius. He enterteineth a man,
no man in the world better, nor more sumptuously. Melius.i. lautius, more
deyntely, For it is referred to the provision and deyntines of cates, And
prolixius.i. largius, copiosius more abundantly and plentiously, for it is
referred to the abundance and plentee of all such things as are provided.

Vos oro, ut me in gregem uestrum recipiatis. I desire and pray you to receive
me into your flock, as who should say, that I may be admytted in to your
company as one of you. See chil. Eras. in the proverb, De grege illo est.

Satis diu hoc iam saxum uoluo. I have labored abonte this long enough now,
if that be good. It is a prouerbial? speaking alludynge unto the fable of
Sisyphus, which (as the poets feyne) was son unto Eolus, and a great thief
in Isthmoo, he used when any strangers arrived there to slay them with stones,
and to toumble them down into the water from the tops of the rocks, at
last he was slain by one Theseus, and when he came to Hell, this
punysshement was qyuen unto him, that he should bear up a great stone unto the
top of an hylle, and as often as it rolled down to fette it up again, but
he could never cause it to to lie, but that it rolled down to the hills
foot again immediately after that he had brought it to the top, and so his
labor is infinite, and of this fable such as have great and the same endless
peines with out any fruit or profit, are prouerbially said in latin saxum
uoluere, to tumble or to roll the stone. Read Eras. in chil.

Isti te ignorabant. These men did not know the.

Postquam eis mores ostendi tuos, et collaudaui secundum facta, et uirtutes
tuas, impetraui. As soon as I had enfourmed them of your conditions, and had
preysed you, according to your acts and virtues or good qualities, I opteyned.

Gratiam habeo maximam. I thank you with all my heart. Habere gratiam is
proprely in the heart when we here well in mind and remember such benefytes as
we have had or received, and have good mind and will to do semblable benifites
ageyn, in recompense of them. Read Laur. Vall. l. 5. eleg. cap. 4 1.

Numquam fui usquam, quin me omnes amarent plurimu^. I was never yet to in any
place, but that eueri bodi loved me very well.

Dixin' ego uobis ni hoc esse atticam eloquentiam? Did not I tell you, that
you should find in this man the most pure and high eloquence that is? Attica,
cae, or At, tes, is a region or countraye in Grecia situate and lyeng between
Achaia and Macedonia, in which countray or region stood the city of Athenes,
where was spoken the most pure and clean, and most eloquent greek, like as
in London is spoken the best and most pure and true english, and in Parise
the best french. etc. and by reason thereof Attica eloque^tia is used for the
most pure true and polyte eloquence, and that eloquence, which the best and
most cunning orators used: which best and chief orators for the same
cause were called in latyne Attici, as who should say, most eloquent, as
coming most nyghe unto the pure eloquence of the Attiques. Al be it here in
this place it is spoken ironice, much like as if Gnato should have said by
Thraso in english, Did not I tell you, that this gentle man rolieth in his
rhetorike as apes do in tails? For he said a little before, that Thraso was
fatuus, insulsus, et tardus.

Nihil praetermissum. s. est. There has nothing ben omytted or let pass.

Ite hac omnes uos. Goo all you thie way here.

FINIS EVNVCHI.
EX HEAVTONTIMORVMENO.
In the Prologue.
NE CVI SIT uestrum mirum. None of you marvel. Id primum dicam, deinde, quod
ueni, eloquar. I wolle first tell that, and afterward I woll show and declare
the cause of my hither coming, quod.i. propter quod, or cuius caussa, cuius
gratia.

Ni partem maximam existimarem scire uestrum, id dicerem. I would tell it, if
I thought not that the most part of you know it well enough all ready.

Nunc quam obrem has parteis didicerim, paucis dabo. Now wolle I show you in
two or three words, for what cause I learned to play this part.

Rumores distulerunt maleuoli. Ill wyllers, or maligners have spread abroad
naugh tie tales. Differo, differs, distuli, dilatum, has many significations,
to differ, to prolonge, or to delay. Lucanus. Nocuit differ pararis. It
has done harm unto many folks, after that they have been ready, to make
longer delay. Sometime to endure as Plin. in epist. did put differ sitim,
to endure thyrste, as who should say, to forbear to drink though one were
thyrstie. Sommetymes differ is to trouble a man, and with sum sodeyne fear
to bring him at his wits end, that he know not what first or best to do.
Plaut. in Pseud* Iam ego te differa^ dictis meis impudice, I woll rattell or
shake the up ere I goo that thou shalt not wot what to do, shameless fellow
that thou art. Id. est in Cistell. Miser, exanimor, feror, differor, distrahor,
diripior, ita nullam mentem animi habeo, I miserable body am almost deed, I
go like a mad manne, I wotte not whither, I am in such grefe that me
thinks I am pulled in pieces, I am haled in sondre, and am torn in pieces, I
have so lost all the reason and wit that was in my heed. So Terence before in
Andria. Orationem sperat inuenisse se, quo differat te, proin tu face ut apud
te sies. He hopethe that he has now found a tale against the, wherewith to
bring the at thy wits end, therefore see thou that thy wits be thine own.
And in this signification differor is much used among the latyne authors, as
differor amore uel cupiditate, I am in extreme peynes for love and desire:
Differor doloribus, I am in such extreme peynes, that I think my self to be
torn in pieces and may no longer endure for peyn: Differor laeticia, I am
rauyshed with ioyfulnes. Some times differo is to sow or to spread abroad in
diverse placis, as differ alicui famam, is to spread abroad a ma^s name in
diverse places. And differ rumorem de aliquo, is to sow and bring up and to
sprede abroad in diverse places a brute, or a noise, or tale of or by any body,
as in this place of Terence. Some times differe is to be unlike, or to be
diverse from an other thing. Rumor, oris, or fama, mae, is a fame, a brute, or
a noise brought up of any new thing, the author or brynger up thereof being
unknown, and whether the same brute or fame be good or ylle. what rumor and
fama signify, and of the use of them, see in Laur. Valla. lib. 4. eleg. c. 10.

Factu^ hic esse id non negar, et se deinde facturum autumat. He here says not
the contrary but that it was so done, and he thinks to do the same ageyn
hereafter.

Habet bonorum exemplum, quo exemplo, sibi licere id facere, quod illi
fecerunt, putat. He has to lay for him the example of good and honest
persons, by which example he thinks and reckeneth that he may lefully do
the same, that they have done before him. Exemplum is the thing that we
follow, or eschew, and exemplar is the thing in which exemplum is contained,
as here in this place of Terence, exemplum is in bonis, and ipsi boni, be
exemplar, or exemplaria. And semblably the eloquence of Cicero is exemplum for
us to follow, and Cicero self is exemplar, in which exemplum of eloquence is
contained, and semblably of all other things, as Laur. Vall. has copiously
and counnyngly annoted. li. 6. eleg. ca. 33.

Omnes uos oratos uolo. I would desire you all.

Ne ille pro se dictum existimet. Think he not that to be spoken in his favor.

Fecit seruo currenti in uia. He did hit unto the servant, as he ran by the
street.

Cur insano feruiat? why should he do service unto a mad man?

Finem maledictis facit. He leueth railing.

Adeste aequo animo. Stand still by, quietly and patiently.

Date potestatem mihi. Give me license.

Clamore summo, et labor maximo. with very high or loud cryeng out or
halowing, and with very great labor.

Caussam hanc iustam esse, animum inducite. Persuade your selfs and think in
your minds, that this cause or matter is good, just, and rightful.

Vt aliqua pars laboris minuatur mihi. That some part of my labor may be
cut of, or that I may have sommewhat the less labor and pain.

Ad me curritur. Every body comes ronnynge to me.

Experimini in utranque partem ingenium quid possit meum. Assay and prove ye
what my wit is able to do in or for both partis.

Nunquam auare pretium statui arti meae. I never set to high a price on my
craft^ or I was never covetous in setting price on my craft.

Eum esse quaestum in animum induxi maximum, quammaxime inseruire uestris
commodis. I have always been content to think and to reckon my most
winning, gaynes, and profit to be, to do all diligent service that I can for
your profits.

Exemplum statuite in me, ut adolescentuli uobis placere studeant. Show an
exaumple upon me, that other young men may be desirous and may labor to be in
favor with you, or to get your favor.

Out of the first Act in the first Scene.
Inter nos nupera dmodum noticia est. It is a very little while gone sithe we
have been acqueynted to gyther.

Agrum in proximo hic mercatus es. You have bought a plotte of ground here
next besides me.

Nec rei amplius quidquam fuit. s. inter nos. And there has been none other
thing at all between us.

Vel uirtus tua me, uel uicinitas, quod ego in propinqua part amicitiae puto,
facit, ut te audacter moneam, and familiariter. Both your virtue, goodness, or
honesty, and also that we are neighbors and dwell nyghe to gether (which
thing I reckon as one of the chief parts and greatteste causes of entiere
amity and frendshyp) causes me to speak unto you, and to show you my mind
boldly and familiarly like a friend. Monere or admonere is to tell a man of his
fault with a certain correction, rebukyng, or chydyng.

Mihi uidere praeter aetatem tuam facere, et praeter quam res te adhortatur
tua. Me thinks you do otherwise than is convenient for your age, and other
wise than is requisyte for a man of your substance.

Annos sexaginta natus es, aut plus eo, ut conijcio. You ar three score years
old, or above, as I suppose. Of amplius elegantlye and indifferently joined
with the nominative, accusative, or ablative case, see in Hadrian de sermon.
latino.

Agrum in his regionibus meliorem, neque pretij maioris, nemo habet. No man in
all these parties has a better plotte of ground nor better land, or more
worth.

Nunquam tam mane egredior, neque tam uesperi domum reuertor, quin te in fundo
conspicer fodere, aut arare, aut aliquid facere. I never go forth so erely in
the morning, nor come home again so late in the evening, but that I see the
abroad in thy ground either dyggynge, or ploughynge, or else some other work
doing.

Nullum remittis tempus, neque te respicis. You are no time unoccupied, nor
pass any thing on your self, or set any store by your self.

Haec non uoluptati tibi esse satis certo scio. That these things are no
pleasure unto you, I am very well assured.

At enim dices. But perauenture you wolle say unto me.

Me quantum hic operis fiat poenitet. Me thinks all the work that is done
here to little. Me poenitet.i. mihi parum uidetur. For poenitere is to be
sorry, to repent, or to forthynke, and because they that are soory, that their
matters or business goes not well forewarde, think all that is done to
little, therefore poenitere is sometimes eleganty taken for parum uideri, to
seem little. Verg. in bucol. aeg. l. 2. Nec te paeniteat calamo triuisse
labellum, And think it not a small thing to have learned to play on the pype
or the recorder. Cicero in prefatione libri primi officiorum. Quamobrem disces
tu quidem a principe huius aetatis philosophorum, et disces quam diu uoles, tam
diu autem uelle debebis, quoad te quantum proficias non paenitebit, Wherefore
thou shall learn and be scoler unto Cratippus, the best and chief of all
philosophers that are at this day, as long as thou shalt be willing thy
self, and so long thou ought to be willing, as thou shall not thynk thy
self to do little good, and to lose thy time, but to profit. So Terentius
before in Eunucho act. 5. sc. 7. An poenitebat flagitij, te authore, quod
fecisset adolescens, ni miserum insuper etiam patri iudicares? Did thou not
think that great offense, which the young man had done by thy counsel and
setting on, to be enough, but that thou must moreover also be the first that
should betray and appeche the poor soul unto his father?

Quod in opere faciu^do operae co^sumis tuae, si sumas in seruis exercendis,
plus agas. If you would bestow that labor in exercisyng you servants, and
setting them to work, and seenge them occupied, which you spend in werkynge
or labouryng your own body, you should do more good, or, you should have more
good done, or, you should have more profyt by it.

Tantum ne est ab re tua otij tibi, aliena ut cures, eaque quae nihil ad te
attinent? Have thou so much leisure and void time from thyn own busynes,
that thou may meddle in other men's matiers, and in such things as
apperteyne nothing unto the?

Homo sum, humani a me nihil alienum puto. I am a man, as other men be, and
think every thing that apperteyneth to any man, to apperteyne also unto me.

Tibi opus ut est facto, face, pro fac. Do thou as is expedient for the to do.

An cuiquam est usus homini se ut cruciet? Is it expedient for any man to
punysshe his own body, and to put him self to tomoche pain?

Ne lachruma. Weep not. Ne, when it is an aduerbe of forbyddyng, may be
indifferently joined with a verb of the subiu^ctiue mode, or else of the
imperative. But non may never be joined with the imperatyue, and with all
other modes hit may, as Linacre has noted.

Isthuc quicquid est, fac ut sciam. Let me know the matter what so ever it
be.

Ne retice. Hyde hit not, or keep hit not in. Donatus has noted, that
reticere, is to keep in and not to utter such things as we are soory and take
thought for. Obticere, is to keep in such things as we are asshamed of.
Terentius in Eunucho. Virgo conscissa ueste lachrumans obticet, The maiden
having her gown al to cut wepethe, and wolle speak never a word.

Tacere is to keep secret things of counsaylle, as before in Eunucho. Potin'
est hic tacere? Can this fellow concele any secretis? or keep any counsel?

Ne reuerere. Be not aferde.

Te aut consolando, aut consilio, aut reiuuero. I wolle surely help you
either by comfortynge you, or else with gyuynge you sum good counsaylle, or
else in very deed.

Hac equidem caussa, qua dixi tibi. In faith even for the same cause that I
have told you.

Istos rastros interea depone, ne labora. Lay down thy rake in the mean
season, and labor or work not.

Quam rem agis? What do you? or what entende you? or what go you about?

Sine me uacuum tempus ne quod them mihi laboris. Let me alone, that I may not
suffer my self to let any time pass void of labor.

Non aequum facis. You do not well or honestly, or as you should do.

Sic meritum est meum. So have I deserved.

Filium unum adolescentulu^ habeo. I have but one son, and he is a young
stryplynge.

Nunc habeam nec ne, incertum est. I am in doubt whether I have one now or not.

Quid ita isthuc. s. dicis? Why say thou that?

Est e Corintho hic aduena auus paupercula. There is here a poor old womanne,
a stranger that came out of Corinthe hither.

Eius filiam ille amare coepit perdite. Her daughter he began to love so
unthriftily that he had almooste cast away and undone him self.

Prope iam ut pro uxore haberet. So that he used her in manner as his wife.

Haec clam me omnia. s. fecit. All this he did unknowing to me.

Vbi rem resciui. Aftir that I had knowledge of the matter. Rescio, rescis,
resciui, rescitum, and a verb frequentatiue of the same Rescisco, resciscis,
resciui, resciscere, rescitum, after Aulus Gel. is to have some preuy knowledge,
and (as we say) an ynklynge of any thing done privily, or otherwise
dissembled and kept from our knowledge. But Valla checketh and reproves the
said Aul. Gel. for that saying, and shows that Rescisco is a plain verb,
and is proprely to have knowledge of a thing after that it is done, of which
thing thou were unknowing when it was done, specially if it apperteyne to
the, or to any of thyn.

Tibi ne haec licere speras facere, me uiuo? Doesth thou think that thou shall
be suffered to do such things as this, while I am alive?

Erras, si id credis, et me ignoras Clinia. Clinia thou art deceived, if thou
so think, and thou know me not.

Ego te meum esse dici tantisper uolo, dum quod te dignum est facies. I wolle
thou be called mine, so long as thou shall do as becomes the, and no longer.
For that is the use of tantisper joined with dum taken for quamdiu, as shows
Val. li. 2. eleg. ca. 48.

Si quod te dignum est, no^ facis, ego quod me in te sit facere dignum
inuenero. If thou do not as becomes the to do, I shall find the means to do
by the, as shall become me.

Nulla adeo ex re isthuc fit, nisi ex nimio otio. Surely this comes of none
other thing but of to much ese and ydelnes. Adeo.i. certe, profecto.

Ego isthuc aetatis non amori operam dabam. I when I was of the age that thou
art, did not bestow nor set my mind on wanton love. The latin authors
use with great grace and much elegancie Id temporis, per id tempus, id
aetatis, hoc aetatis, isthuc aetatis, quid aetatis, absolutely. Whereof read in
Hadrian de sermon. lat.

In Asiam hinc abij propter pauperiem. I was feign to go out of these parties
into the country of Asia for pouerte.

A dolescentulus saepe eadem et grauiter audiendo uictus est. The young man
with often and sore herynge one thing was even done, or was greatly dismayed.

Putauit me aetate plus scire. He thought that I knew more, by reason that I
was older, or, he thought that I could better skylle in things, or, was
better seen in experience of the world, because that I had moo years.

Putauit me beneuolentia plus prouidere, quam seipsum sibi. He thought that I
would provide for him, or foresee what was most expediente for his profit,
better thanne he could for him self, for thentiere and hearty love that I bare
him.

In Asiam ad regem militatum abijt. He is goone hens into the countreye of Asia
unto the king there, to be a soldier, and to goo on warrefare.

Clam me profectus, menseis tres abest. He went away and took his journey
unknowing to me, and has been away now a holle quarter of a year. In words
betokenynge space of time the use of the accusative signifies continuance of
time without intermission or cessynge, secuudum Seruium. Al be it we may use
also the ablative.

Ambo accusandi. s. estis. You are both to blame.

Illud in caeptum animi est pudentis signum. That beginning is a sign or
token of a shamefaste heart.

Vbi comperi, ex ijs, qui ei fuere conscij. When I knew of it by them that
were preuye to it, and of his counsaylle.

Domum reuertor moestus. Home I come again all sad.

Domum reuertor animo fere perturbato, atque incerto prae aegritudine. Home I
come again in manner out of my mind, and uncertain what to do for thought.
Cice. in tusc. quaest. shows, that aegritudo proprely is in the mind, and
aegrotatio in the body, and that animus est aeger, corpus aegrotum. Al be it
tho words are much confounded, that is to say the one used for the other, as
well in the said Cicero, as in Quintilian, Terence, and others.

Accurrunt serui, soccos detrahunt. My servants came rounnynge to me, and
poulled of my pynsons or stertuppes. Soccus, socci, socco, was a kind of
shoes, and hit is formed of saccus sacci, a bag, and had it name thereof
because that when it was fastened upon the foot, it bagged and lay full of
pleytes. And they were used in wearynge both of men and women, but most among
the nobles and rich folks.

Video alios festinare, lectos sternere, coena^ apparare. I see some others
make haste, to lay the table, and to make ready for suppar. Lectus, cti, is a
bed. Festus Pompeius de ryueth Lectum ab alliciendo, that when the body is
weary, it desires rest. And some deryue lectum of the grecke word lectron: All
be hit lectus, ut inquit Varro, dictus est, quod lectis herbis et frondibus
stramenta facerent, Lectus is so called (says Varro) because that in old time
they used to gather grass, and leaves or bowghes, and so to straw them on
the ground, and than to lie down on them. And because they used much to eat
in the same place (for than they had not yet found the use of meat tables)
therefore lectus was also taken for mensa, and is much used in that
signification in Plant. Terence, and all poetis and other writers, that be of
any antiquity, Horat, Saepe tribus lectis, uideas coenare quaternos, A man
shall see often times three tables at ones, and at every table four persons at
suppar, or eating mete.

Pro se quisque sedulo faciebat, quo illam mihi lenirent miseriam. Every body
for his part was as busy as they could be, to ease me of the care that I was
in.

Vbi uideo haec, caepi cogitare. When I saw all this, I began to cast and
think in my mind.

Tot mea solius soliciti sunt caussa, ut me unum expleant? Are so many persons
disesed and troubled for my cause and sake, only to satisfye the pleasure of me
alone? Of mea solius caussa, with others like, reed Laur. Vall. l. 2. eleg.
ca. 1. about the mids, where he does copiously and counnyngely treat
thereof. Vnu^.i. solum.

Sumptus domi tantos ego solus faciam? Should I alone, or being but one man,
spend so much money, or be at so greatte charges in my house?

Gnatum unicum pariter uti his decuit, aut etiam amplius. It was mete that my
only son should have had as much part of these things as I, or else
rather more.

Illa aetas magis ad haec utenda idonea est. That age is more mete to occupy
tho things. When there comith in any latyne clause a gerundiue of a verb
transitiue, that gouer with an accusatife case aftir him, the geru^diue may
very elegantly be changed into a nown participle of the later future tense, and
made to agree with the substantive in gender, nombre, and like case, as the
gerundiue was before it was changed, an example of the ablative case. Cic. in
prefat. li. 1. offic. Oratione^ latinam efficies profecto legendis nostris
plaeniorem, For legendo nostra, Thy latin tongue thou shalt make more full
and more copious by redynge my works, and such books as I have written. An
example of the accusative. Id. l. i. offic. Meminerimus autem et aduersus
infimos iusticiam esse seruanda^, For seruandum esse iusticiam, And we must
remember to keep Justice, that is, to dele justly and truly also with the
poorest and lowest persons that be. An example of the genitive case. Ibid. Vt
nec medici, nec imperatores, nec oratores, quamuis artis praecepta perceperint,
quicquam magna laud dignum, sine usu et exercitatione consequi possunt, sic
officij conseruandi praecepta traduntur illa qui them, ut faciamus ipsi, For
praecepa conseruandi officium, As neither physicians, nor capytaynes in war,
nor orators, though they have substancially well learned all the rules of their
faculte, yet may not possibly at teyne to do any thing worthy great preise and
commendacion, without much exercise and practisynge, right so there be
written and given unto us precepts of our office and duty how to behave our
selfs in our living toward all persons, but that is to the intent that we
must put them in ure and practice the same our selfs. I said a verb
transitiue, that governs an accusative case. For such mutacion or change may
not be done in any verbes gouernynge any other case and not an accusative. For
we may not say placendi praeceptoris studium, but praeceptori, nor in male
dicendo te, but tibi, nor in abstinendis uoluptatibus, but in abstinendo a
uoluptatibus, nor ad abundanda bona, but ad abundandu^ bonis. Therefore when we
say ad haec utenda, children shall note, that the latyne men of old time used
these verbes, utor, fungor, fruor, potior, and sometimes careo, gouernynge an
accusative case after them, examples be every where innumerable apud Plautu^,
Terentiu^, Ciceronem, iureconsultos, et alios.

Eum ego eieci hinc miseru^ iniusticia mea. I have expulsed and driven him from
hens poor soul by mine unreasonable facion or dealing.

Malo quidem me dignu^ quouis deputem, si id faciam. I might well think my
self worthy any mysauenture in the world, if I should do such a thing.

Vsque dum ille uitam illam incolit. pro colit, agit, degit. As long as he
lives such a life as that is, or, as long he lives after that sort, or
rate.

Illi de me supplicium dabo. I woll suffer him to punyshe me, or, I wol suffer
punishment for his sake. Dare paenas, dare supplicium, Luere poenas, luere
supplicium, pendere poenas, and pendere supplicium, is to suffer punyshement,
or to be punyshed. And they be construed with a nominatyue of the thing that
suffers the punysshement, and with a datyue case of the person that does
punysshe.

Nil relinquo in aedibus, nec uas, nec uestime^ tum. I left nothing in the
house, neither vessel, nor garment, nor nothing.

Corrasi omnia. I have scraped up and sold all to gether. Corrasi.i.
compilaui, uendidi. Donat.

Inscripsi aedes mercede. I gave up my house, and wrote upon the doors that
the house was to let, or to be sold. So Plaut. in Trinu^mo. Quia rure dum sum
ego unos sex dies, me absente, atque insciente, inconsultu meo, aedes uenales
hasce inscripsit literis, Because that while I have been in the country, but
one poor six days, he has written upon the door that this my house was to
selle, I being from home, absent or out of the way, and knowing nothing
thereof, and without any counsel asking of me.

Agrum hu^c mercatus sum. I have bought this plotte of ground. The difference
between ager, fundus, uilla, et praedium, read in Valla. li. 6. eleg. c. 41.

Hic me exerceo. Here am I occupied, or here do I exercise my self.

Non fas est ulla me uoluptate frui. I may not take any manner pleasure.

Ingenio te esse in liberos leui puto. I reken you to be of a gentle nature
and tender on your children.

Puto illum obsequentem, si quis recte aut commode tractaret. I reckon him
tractable or eath enough to be ruled, if a man did handle him well, or after a
good sort.

Neque tu illum satis noueras, nec te ille. Neither thou knew him very well,
nor he the: or, neither thou were very well acqueynted with his facion nor he
with thyn.

Nunquam ostendisti, quanti illum penderes. You never showed how much you
set by him.

Nec ille tibi est credere ausus. And he durst not trust the.

Ita res est. So goes the matter, or so hit is.

Illum saluum adfuturum esse confido propediem. I trust verily that he woll
right shortly be here in good health.

Vtinam dij ita faxint. God grannt hit may so be.

Si co^modum est, hodie apud me sis uolo. If you may conveniently, I would
desire you to make merry at my house to day.

Siccine est sententia? Think you so? or, is that your mind or opinion in
deed?

Quaeso tandem aliquantulum tibi parce. I pray you favor or spare your self
somewhat at last after so great labor.

Been uale. Fare ye well, or god be with you.

Lachrymas excussit mihi. He has caused me to weep.

Miseret me eius. I have pity on him.

Mouere oportet me hunc, ad caenam ut ueniat. I must put him in remembrance
to come to suppar.

Ibo ut uisam, si domi est. I woll go to see if he be at home. It is showed
before, that uiso, facesso, capesso, lacesso, with other like verbes in so, be
not desideratiues, as Priscian would have them, and that they signify and
betoken the mouyuge and act of th body: and not the affecte nor desire of the
mind. Yet somtymes they be used for their primitiues, as here uisam is put for
his primitive uideam. And so is hit to be taken as often as it is joined with
any of these words, ueino, eo, is, iui, gratia, caussa, studiu^, or any other
like voice.

Nihil opus fuit monitore, iamdudum domi praesto apud me esse aiunt. He had
no need of any manne to put him in remembrance. For they say that he is at
home at my house all ready, and has been a good while.

Egomet conuiuas moror. I my self cause my guestes to tarry. Moror te (as
testifies Donatus and also Valla) in orators is most taken for retineo te,
or in mora teneo, I cause the to tarry. Quintilian. Quid me ad huc pater
detines? quid moraris abeuntem? Father wherefore do you hold and keep me back
still? Why do you cause me to tarry that would be gone?

Quid crepuerunt fores? Why creeketh the door? or what crekynge makes the
door?

A me quisnam egreditur? Who comes forth of my house.

Huc concessero. I woll stand aside here. Concedo, dis, concessi, concessum,
sometime signifies to goo, or to depart out of one place into an other.

In the second Scene.
Nihil adhuc est, quod uereare. There is nothing yet why thou should be
aferde.

Illum simul cum nuncio tibi hic affuturum hodie scio. I know well that he wol
be here with you anon together with the messanger that went for him. Simul
cum nuncio, as who should say, as soon and with as great expedicion, as the
messanger that was sent for him.

Solicitudinem istam falsam, quae te excruciat, omittas. Let goo that false
care and thought, that vexes and freateth thy-hart.

Qui cum loquitur filius? With whom talks my son.

Opportune aduenis. You come very well.

Hunc Menedemum nostin' nostru^ uicinum? Do you know Menedemus here being our
neighbor?

Mihi magna cum eo iam inde usque a pueritia semper fuit familiaritas. I have
been very familyarly acqueynted with him evermore of a little child.

Voluptatem magnam nuncias. Thou show tidings that be very pleasant.

Quam uellem Menedemum inuitatum, ut nobiscum esset hodie. How glad would I
be that Menedemus had been desired to be in company with us, or at my house
to day.

Cave faxis, non est opus pater. Beware do it not, it is not so expedient
father. We may say Cave faxis, or, cave ne faxis: Cave cadas, or, cave ne
cadas: Fac scribas, or, fac ut scribas: Cura fiat, or, cura ut fiat, ex Valla,
And it is eclipsis coniunctionis.

Incertum est etiam quid se faciat. He can not yet tell what to do with him
self. Of such manner speakynges as this, Quid se faciat, with others like it
is noted before.

Modo uenit. He came but now.

Timet omnia. He fereth all things.

Misere amat. He is very deep in love.

Propter eam haec turba, atque abitio euenit. For her sake has chanced all
this business and going away.

Seruolum ad eam in urbem mifit. He has sent a servant into the city unto
him. Seruolum pro seruulum, per antithesin, which is when one lettre is put
for an other.

Quem minus miserum esse, credere est? Whom should a man think to be in
better case?

Quid reliqui est, quin habeat, quae quidem in homine dicuntur bona? parenteis,
patria^, amicos, genus, cognatos, diuitias. What fauteth, but that he has al
things, at leest wise that in a man are called and rekened good things, that
is to say his father and mother his country, his friends, his stock and
blood, kyne folks and riches?

Haec perinde sunt, ut illius animus, qui ea possidet. All these things be
such, as is the mind of him that has them in possession. Of the elegante
ioynynge of perinde, with ac, atque, ut, quam, quasi, acsi, atque si. etc. Read
Hadrian.

Qui uti scit, ei bona sunt, illi qui non utitur recte, mala. To him that
knows how to use them, they be good, and to him that can not use them as
he should do, they be ylle.

Ille fuit senex importunus semper. That old fool was ever more unreasonable.

Nihil magis uereor, quam ne quid in illum iratus plus satis faxit. I fear
nothing so much as this, leeste that he being moved and bearing him
displeasure, woll do sum thing unto him worse thanne he should do.

Reprimam me.i. tacebo. I would hold my peace.

In metu esse illi est utile. It is expedient for him to be kept in awe.

Quid tu tecum? s. loqueris? What say thou to thy self there?

Vtut erat, mansum tamen oportuit. How so ever hit was, yet he owghte to have
tarried at home, and not to have gone away. The voice of the participle of the
pretertense is much taken and used per enallagen partium, sieve per antimerian,
for the infinitive mode of the active voice, secundu^ Donatu^ or of the passive
voice, secundu^ Priscianum. Salust. Priusqua^ incipias consulto, et ubi
consulueris, mature opus est facto, Before that a man begin any thing, he
must first take good aduysement and deliberation, and when he has so
consulted and taken aduysemente, he owghte to do hit with all celerytie,
speed, and expedycion. Where Priscian interprets consulto and facto.i.
consuli et fieri. Ter en in Hecyra. In arcem transcurso opus est, It were
expedient to run and to make a step to the castle. Transcurso Donat
expouneth pro transcurrere. But in such speakynges as these, Volo datum,
factum oportuit, mansum oportuit. etc. is to be understand (says Linacre) the
infinitive mode, esse: So that hit be the preter tense of the infinitive mode
passive. For by them is vnderstonded not only the action or doing of a thing,
but also the perfection and end of a thing, already brought to pass and to a
fynall end or effect. etc.

Fortasse aliquanto iniquior fuit. Percase he was somewhat hard, streyghte, or
unreasonable.

Quem ferret, si parentem non ferret suu^? Whom should he have suffered or
forborne, if he should not have forborne his own father?

Hunccine erat aequum ex illius more, an illum ex huius uiuere? Was it mete
that this man should live, as he would have him, or else him to live, as
pleased this man?

Quod illum insimulat durum, id non est. Where as he accuses him, or lays to
his charge, that he is hard or streyte, that is not so. Insimulare is proprely
to lay to ones charge, a crime that is not true, but a forged matter.

Parentum iniuriae uniusmodi sunt ferme. The streytenes or hardenes of fathers
toward their children, is of one sort or after one rate for the most part.

Ea sunt ad uirtutem omnia. All tho things be to the furtherance of virtue.

Vbi animus semel se cupiditate deuinxit mala, necesse est consilia consequi
co^similia. When the mind has ones entangled and captiued it self with any
ylle desire or naughty appetite, hit can not be chosen but that semblable
counsayles and purposes must needs follow.

Hoc scitum est, periclum ex alijs facere, ti by quod ex usu siet. It is a
noble and goodly sentence or saying, every man to prove by others, what may
be most expedient and profitable for him self. Scitum. s. dictum.i. prae
clarum et doctrina plenum, quae confert ad uitam cu^ decoro inque officio
degendam. Periclum pro periculum, per syncopen. Siet pro sit, per epentesin.

Ibo hinc intro, ut uideam nobis quid coenae siet. I woll go hens in, that I
may see what we have to suppar.

Vide ne quo hinc abeas longius. See that thou goo not far out of the way.

Out of the second Act, in the first Scene.
Quam iniqui sunt patres in omnes adolescenteis iudices. How unequal judges be
fathers against all young men.

Aequum esse censent, nos iam a pueris ilico nasci senes. They think hit
reason that we even of little babes, should by and by become sage old men.

Ex sua libidine nos moderantur, quae nunc est, non quae olim fuit. They rule,
measure, and order us by their own wylfulle appetite, that they have now, and
not that they had many years gone, that is when them selfs were young men,
as we be now. Libi do libidinis is some time taken in bona^ partem, as Donat
notes. Sal. in Cat. Magisque in decoris armis et militaribus equis, quam in
scortis et conuiuijs libidine^ habebant, And they had pleasure and appetite in
goodly harnes and great horses for war, more tha^ in harlottes, and in
feastynge or bankettynge.

Mihi si unquam filius erit, nae ille facillime utatur patre. If ever I shall
have a son, in faith he shall have a very gentle father of me.

Et cognoscendi et ignoscendi dabitur peccati locus. He shall have time to
know his fault, and to have it pardoned or forgiven. Ignosco is sommetymes a
verb active and tra^sitiue, and governs an accusative and a datine, as
Forgive me this one faut, Ignoscas mihi hoc unum delictum. Of such verbes it
is noted before. Locus.i. tempus, spacium, sufficient time and space.

Mihi per alium ostendit suam sententiam. He declares me his own mind and
opinion under the name and color of an other person.

Adbibit plus paulo. He has dronken a litell to much, or, as (we use to say
in jesting) he has taken a pot of maius.

Sua narrat facinora. He tells of the prankes that he has played in his
days.

Periculum facito. Prove.

Nae ille haud scit quam mihi nunc surdo nar ret fabula^. In faith fulle
little wotteth he how deife I am, or how ill I can here now in this side, on
which he makes all this clatterynge unto me. Surdo narrare fabula^, to tell a
tale to a deife body, is a proverb to be said of them that labor in vain.
And it is the same that we use to speak prouerbially, when we here a thing that
lyketh us not, saying thus. I can not here in that side: which may be said
proprely in latin, Surdo narras fabulam, or, Surdo canis. Verg. No^ canimus
surdis, respo^dent omnia syluae.

Magis nunc me amicae dicta stimulant, da mihi, atque affer mihi. Now at this
time the sayings of my best beloue, go nere my stomach, give me this, and
bring me that. etc.

Quid respondeam nihil habeo. I have nothing in the world, what to make
answer. Quid, pro quod, as quid magnum, for aliquod magnum, or aliquid magni.
And all be it it appear contrary to the nature of quid, (taken and used most
commenly for a substantive, and gouernynge a genitive case after him) yet it is
an elegant manner of speaking, and much used in probate authors, as well
joined with adjectives put substantiuely, as also with substantives, and
agreinge with the same in case, gender, and number. Cato de liberis educandis.
Si quid his datum sit esculentum, If any thing be given them to eat. Cic. l.
2. epi. fam. Grave est homini pudenti petere aliquid magnum ab eo de quo se
benemeritum putet, ne id quod petat, exigere magis, quam rogare, et in mercedis
potius quam beneficij loco nume rare uideatur, It is a greatte pain or grefe
to a man that has any shame in him, to desire any great thing of him, unto
whom he thinks him self to have done and pleasure before, leest that he may
seem that thing which he desires, rather to exact and to require as due,
than to desire, and rather to reckon or account the same in place of a reward
or wages before deserved, than in place of a benefit. And so in other examples
innumerable, which for breuitee I omytte.

Neque me quisquam est miserior. Nor there is any manne living more miserable,
or in wors case, than I am.

Suarum rerum satagit. He has enough to do of his own, or, he has a busye
piece of work of his own to do. Satago, satagis, sataegi, satascum is to
have busynes or matters enough to do. And it is somtymes construed with a
genitive, as here, and somtymes it is put absolutely without any case joined
with it. And sometimes it signifies diligentem esse, seu festinare, To be
diligente or to make busy speed and haste.

Mea amica est potens, procax, magnifica, sumptuosa, nobilis. My best beloue
is a woman of good ability, and she is ever crauynge, magnificent or ladylike,
chargeable or costly, and a greatte gentyl woman. Procax, procacis,.i. petax,
ever askyng and crauynge, formed of proco, procas, which is poscere to desire,
and thereof wowers are called in latyne proci, as (who should say) poscentes
uxorem, desirynge and demaundyng or askyng the wise that they wowe.

Mihi religio est dicere. I dare not say it, or, I have a conscience to speak
hit. Religio.i. metus, Fear, and (as we say) scrupulo sitie of conscience, per
metaphoram. For religio proprely is the true serving and worshyppynge of god,
or of holy things, ex Cice, Read Thesaur. ling. lat.

Hoc ego mali non pridem inueni, neque etiamdum scit pater. It is not long
sith I have perceived this displesure or incommoditie, nor my father does not
yet know hit, inueni.i. intellexi, sensi.

In the second Scene.
Si mihi secundae res essent. If I were welthie, or in prosperity, or, if my
fortune were good.

Vereor ne me absente mulier corrupta sit. I fear leest that the woman has
been perverted or made naught, while I have been away.

Concurrunt multae opiniones, quae mihi animum exaugeant. There come many
opinions to gether, that cause my mind much the more to think. Exaugere is
to increase a thing, and to make it much more then it was, and thereof
exaugere animum is to increase the opinion of the mind, and to cause the mind
much the more to bow and to enclyne to that opinion that hit was in before,
per metaphoram.

Sub imperio cuius est? Under whose rule or ordering is he?

Illi nihil praeter precium dulce est. He thinks nothing sweet but money,
or there is nothing sweet unto him or in his opinion but money.

Hei misero mihi. Alas that ever I was borne. The interiections heu, and proh
govern a nominative case, as Heu pietas, heu prisca fides, proh Iuppiter, and
an accusative as Heu me miserum, proh deum atque hominum fidem. Hei gouernethe
evermore a datyue.

Etiam caves, ne uideat forte te a patre aliquis exiens? Wolte thou beware yet
again leest perchance some body coming forth from thy fathers espy the?

Nescio quid mihi animus praesagit mali. I can not tell how, my mind
gives me, that al is not well, or that I shall have sum ylle chance, or I
can not tell how my heart grudgeth again some ylle to comme. Praesagio,
sagis, praesagiui, is to perceive a thing, that is to comme, before it come.
Of prae, quod est, ante, before, et sagire, hoc est acute sentire, to be quick
of perceiving and smelling, and thereof dogs ar called sagaces, quycke of
smelling or sentynge.

Pergin' isthuc prius diiudicare, quam scis quid ueri siet? Do thou yet
still judge the matter, before thou know what the truth is?

Si nihil mali esset, iam hic adesset. If al had been well, he would have been
here ere now.

Non cogitas hinc longius abesse? Do thou not consider that it is a great
way he^s?

Nosti mores mulierum, dum moliuntur, dum comuntur, annus est. Thou knoweste
the guyse of women, while they set forward, and while they attire, pyke, and
trymme them selfs, it is a holle year, molior, moliris, molitus sum, is to
force a body self to do any thing. Como, mis compsi, comptum, est ornare, to
make gaye or to attire, or to deck the busshe: for in the trimmynge of the
hear consists a great part of the beauty of man or woman.

Respira. Take a good heart.

Eccum Dromonem cum Syro una adsunt tibi. Lo yond Dromo and Syrus, they are
both here together. Tibi est datiuus festiuitatis gratia adiunctus. Lau. Valla
has observed that ecce and en signify one thing, and be construed
indifferently with a nominative case or with an accusative. Al be it he
protestith, that he has not read at leest wise in any orator, ye and few
times in any poet, ecce, gouernynge an accusative, eccum, eccam, eccos, eccas,
ellum, ellam, ellos, ellas, the same Valla expou^dith not by pronownes
(contrary to Priscian and others) saying eccum.i. ecce eum, or ecce hunc, nor
ellum,.i. ecce illum, nor eccam.i. ecce eam, eccos.i. ecce eos, ellam.i. ecce
illa^, ellos.i. ecce illos, but by aduerbes thus, eccu^.i. ecce hic. s. eum.
etc. ellum.i. ecce illic eum. etc. illic. s. eu^. etc. and eccam.i. ecce hic.
s. eam. etc. eccos.i. ecce hic. s. eos. etc. ellam.i. ecce illic. s. eam. etc.
ellos.i. ecce illic. s. eos. etc. And therefore they be joined with an
accusative of the thing that we woll demonstrate or show. Terentius in Eun.
Eccum Parmenonem, eccum me.i. ecce hic Parmenonem, ecce hic me. And so here
Eccum Dromonem.i. ecce hic Dromonem. etc. So ellum Parmenonem.i. ecce illic
Parmenonem, uel potius ecce illic Parmeno secundum Vallam.

In the third Scene.
Ain tu? Say thou so in deed?

Sic est. It is even so.

Interea dum sermoues cedimus, illi sunt relicti. While we have kept and
prolonged communication they be left a great way behynd. Cedimus sermones.i.
miscemus, ex Nonio.

Minime miru^, adeo impediti sunt ancillaru^ grege^ ducunt secu^. It is no
meruaylle that they have been so long in coming, they be so pestred, for
they bring a holle flock with them. Minime mirum. s. est illos tam tarde
aduenisse.

Men' rogas? Do thou ask of me?

Non oportuit relictos, portant quid reru^. It was not well done to leave them
behind, for they bear sum things of charge about them.

Portant aurum, uestem, et uesperascit, and non nouerunt uiam. They have about
them both gold, and apparel, and it is almost dark night, and they know
not the way.

Factum a nobis stulte est. It was foolyshly or unwisely done of us.

Abidum illis obuiam propere. Goo and mete them apace. Abidum, abi, parelcon
est, ut quisnam, pro quis.

Vae misero mihi, quanta de spe decidi. Woe is me unfortunate body that I am,
out of how great hope am I fallen or brought.

Quae res te solicitat? What thing troubles your mind? Solicitare here
betokens inquietare, cura^ inijcere, to disquiet and to make pensife. So in
And. Cur ego meam senectutem huius solicito amentia? Why do I disquiete and
vex mine old age for his folly? Plaut. in Aul. Quia isthuc facinus quod tuu^
solicitat animum, id ego feci et fateor, For this deed that troubles and
vexes thy mind I did my self, and I confess it. Sometime solicitare to show
as well hope as fere. Plin. li. 1. epist. Nulla spe, nullo timore solicitor,
nullius rumoribus inquietor, I am not moved neither with any hope, nor with any
fere, nor I am not disquieted with the rumors or new tales of any man. Ter.
in An. Mis. Orare iussit, si se ames, hera, iam ut ad sese uenias, Videre ait
te cupere. Pamph. Vah perij, hoc malu^ integrascit. Siccine me, atque illam
opera tua nunc miseros solicitarier? Mis. My dame bead me prey you (if you love
her) to come to her by and by, for she says that she would very feign see
you. Pamph. Alas woe is me, this mischief is every day renewed worse and worse:
is it well done, that both I and she unhappy bodies, be thus brouzt in hope and
fere eueri day by the menes of the? Sometime it is to provoke or to lie
instantly upon and to entice one to any thing. Curtius lib. 2. Verumenimuero
cum modo milites meos literis ad proditionem, modo amicos ad perniciem pecunia
solicitet, ad internetionem mihi persequendus est, But yet for as much as he
does egg and entice somwhyle my souldiars by letters to betray me, and
somewhyle my friends with money and rewards to slay me, I must needs pursue
him to death. And solicito is to be written with one single. l. except in
poets which double the same l, per epenthesin metri causa, for it is fourmed
a solo. For what other thing is solicitare then solo citare.i. loco suo
mouere? to move or stere a thing out of the ground that it stood on, and out
of his place. For that solum does signify locum. Who doubts sins that the
etimologie of the latin word exules is, quod dicantur patriae suae solo
pulsi? And thereof solicitare is to turn up the ground in tyllynge or
ploughynge. Tibul. Et teneram ferro sollicitauit humum. And because that solum
is said also of the sea: Therefore solicitare is sometime taken for nauigare.
Claud. Et rudibus remis sollicitauit aquas. For solum is every thing that
bears up and stays any thing, as the water is solum to the ships and to
the fyshes. Verg. Subtrahiturque solu^. Et Ovid. Omne solum forti patria est,
ut piscibus aequor: Et uolucri uacuo quicquid in orb pater. In which verse
Ouide calls the air solum to the birds, and the sky is solum to the
sterres. Ovid* Astra tenent caeleste solum. etc.

Rogitas quid siet? Do thou ask what it is? or, what is the matter quod the?

Nunc demum intelligo. I perceive it now at last, and so I did not before.
Demum et denique idem significant quod tandem.i. post longam moram: after long
taryenge, as in example. When thou haste well and perfitely learned all things,
than at last and not before thou may teach others, Cum omnia perdidiceris,
tum demum, or denique, or tandem docere alios potes. Secondarilye demum is
taken for omnino uel solum, specially when it is joined with these pronownes
hic, iste, ille, is: or with these aduerbes ita or sic, so that demum
conteyneth and imports a certain exception of an other thing thus. Ea demum
est gloriosa laudatio, quae a laudatis uiris proficiscitur, That preyse and
none else is to a man's honor and good name, which comes and ryseth of honest
men and preyse worthy. Ita demum me abs te amari sentiam, si huic homini mea
caussa co^modaueris, I shall by this means and none other, perceive and think
that you love me heartily well, if you do pleasure unto this man for my sake. Tum
demu^ te amicum putabo, quum beneuolentiam erga me tuam re expertus fuero, I
woll then and never before think the my friend, when I have in deed had a
proffe of thy good will and hearty love toward me. etc.

Dij boni quid turbae est? Good lord what a rabble, or train, or company is
there of them? and sometimes it may be englyshed thus. Good lord what array,
or trouble, or business, or a do is there?

Aedes nostrae eos uix capient, scio. Our house will scasely hold them all, I
know well. or, our house will uneath be able to receive them all, I am very
sure.

Quid comedent? quid ebibent?.i. quantu^. How much woll they eat and drink?
or what meat and drink woll they spend?

Eccos quos uolebam. Lo here them that I would have. How eccos is to be
expouned, it is showed a little before.

O Iuppiter ubinam est fides? O Iuppiter, where is honesty or sure and
faithful kepinge of promyses becomme? For fides (as says Cicer. li. i. off.)
est dictorum conuentoru^que constantia et ueritas, ex quo credamus, quia fiat
quod dictum est, appellatam fidem, Fides is the substanciall keeping and the
true and sure agreinge of a man's sayenges and couenantes, and the performance
of the same. And therefore let us believe and think verily this to be the very
true etimologie, that is to say, the very true reason, diffinition, and
interpretation of the word fides, quia fiat puod dictum est, that such
things be done in deed that are promised in word, and when the deeds are
answerable and agreing unto the words and sayings or promyses.

Tu interea loci collocupletasti te. Thou haste enryched thy self in the mean
season, or thou haste gotten greatte goods in the mean time.

Me in his deseruisti malis. Thou haste forsaken me in this adversity or
distress.

Propter quem in summa infamia sum, et meo patri minus sum obseque^s. For whose
cause I am in very great infamy, obloquie, or sklander, and am not ruled by my
father, as I should be, or do not follow my fathers mind as I ought to do.

Nemo est miserior me. There is no man more miserable or in wors case then I.

Hic de uerbis nostris errat, quae hic sumus locuti. This man is deceived by
reason of our words, that we have spoken here.

Aliter amorem tuum atque est accipis. You take your love otherwise then it is.
We say elega^tly aliter atque, aliter ac, or aliter quam, and aliter nisi,
when a negacion goes before. See examples in Hadrian.

Animus erga te idem est ac fuit. My mind toward you is the same that it has
been.

Quantum ex ipsa re coniecturam fecimus. As far as we could coniecte by or
of the thing self.

Nihil rerum omnium est, quod malim, quam me hoc falso suspicarier. There is
nothing in the world that I would be more glad of, then that I did suspecte,
surmyse, and mystrust this thing falsely or untruly.

Anus, quae est dicta matter esse ei ante hac, non fuit. The old womanne that
hitherto has been called his mother, was not his mother.

Ea obijt mortem. She is deed.

Hoc ipse in itinere alteri dum narrat, forte audiui. This did I here by
chance, as him self told it unto an other body by the way.

Mane, hoc quod coepi primum enarrem, post isthuc ueniam. Abide awhyle, let
me first of all tell forth this that I have begone, and than I will comme
to this afterward.

Vbi uentum ad aedeis est, Dromo pultat fores. Whenne we came to the house,
Dromo knocked at the door. Pulto, pultas is the same that pulso, pulsas, to
knock, or to beat, or to rappe: and it is formed of the supine pultum, which
supine the old writers did use, but now it is out of use.

Anus quaedam prodit. Forth comes a certain old woman.

Haec ubi aperuit ostium, continuo hic se co^iecit intro, ego consequor. As
soon as she had opened the door, he here whypte me in by and by, and I after
hard at the tail of him.

Foribus obdit pessulu^. He bolted the door.

Hinc sciri potuit, aut nus quam alibi, quo studio uitam suam te absente
exegerit. By this way, or else by no way at all it might be known how busily
or in what occupation he has passed and led his life while you have been
absent from home. Studio.i. labor, opere. Exigere aetatem or tempus, and agere
aetatem, is to pass and to spend out the years or time. Sometime exigere, is
for as abigere. to drive out of the doors. Plaut. Exegit omnes for as* He drove
every body out of the doors.

De improuiso est interuentum mulieri. We came upon the woman sodeinly or
unware.

Ea res dedit existimandi copiam cotidiane uitae consuetudinem. By that thing
we might eathely judge the daily conversation of his living.

Cotidianae uitae consuetudo cuiusque ingenium, ut sit, declarat maxume. The
daily conversation of living does very eathly and best of all things
show what the disposition of every body is. Maxume.i. facillime, optime, and
there is the figure antithesis, that is when one letter is put for an other. As
scribundis prologis, for scribendis, animum aduortite, for aduertite, so here
maxume for maxim.

Texentem telam studiose ipsam offendimus. We found her at the loome weauynge
full busily. Offendo, dis, offendi, offensum, is sometimes the same that
reperio, to find by chance. Of which verbes read Laur. Vall. li. 5. eleg.
ca. 2.

Offendimus eam mediocriter uestitam, ueste lugubri. We found her meanly or
coursly apparelled in a mourning gown.

Obsecto ne me in laeticia^ frustra conijcias. I pray the do not cast me in to
greatte gladness in vain.

Si haec sunt uera, ita uti credo, quis te est fortunatior? If these things be
true, as I thynk they be, what man is more fortunate, or who has better
fortune then thou?

Magnum hoc signu^ est eu^ esse extra noxa^. This is a great sign that he is
nothing culpable, or faulty. Noxa secundu^ festu^ Pompeium and Valla^ idem est
quod culpa. And thereof comith noxae dedere in the civil law,.i. poenae dare
seu tradere ob noxa^.i. culpa^, to deliver to be punyshed for some fault,
offense, or trespass done. As if a man's servant or bondma^ had done any trespass
against any person, the party pleintife took an action against the master of
such servant or bondsman, and such manner actions are callid in the civil law,
Noxales actiones, That if the master of such servant or bondsman (as aforesaid)
would not meintene him in the said trespass or offense done, he would and lefully
might yield his said servant or bondsman to suffer bodyly punyshement
according to the order of the law, ye and though it were to death, and that
was called noxae dedere. Extra noxam esse, ide^ est quod extra culpam esse, hoc
est, noxa aut culpa uacare, Not to be in fault, but to be gyltlesse or
blameless. Noxa is sommetymes taken for dampnum, hurt or harm. Ovid. li. 15.
Meth. speaking of the waters of a certain lake in the countreye of Arcadia,
which was called lacus phineus, Nocte nocent potae, sine noxa luce by buntur.
If one drink of them in the night they woll hurt him, but in the day time a
man may drink of them without any harm at all. Suet. in Iul. Caesar. ca. 81.
Spurinamque irridens, et ut falsum arguens, quod sine ulla sua noxa Idus
Martiae adessent, quanquam is uenisse quidem eas diceret, sed non praeternsse.
And mocking or scornynge Spurinam, and reprouyng him as foul dectiued, in
that the Ides of the month of March were comme without any his harm, not
withstanding that the said Spurina stylle said and affirmed, that the said
Ides of March in deed were now come, but that they were not yet paste nor
gone. For Spurina being a southsayer had warned Caesar before to beware of
the Ides of March, for he should be slain as that day, and so he was.

Disciplina est, eis them munerarier ancillas primum* ad dominas qui affectant
uiam. This is as a school, or this is the facion, manner, order, or train that
must be used, that is, what so ever person desires to have his way made unto
the mastresses, must first reward or brybe the maiden servants with sembleable
things, as he would give unto the dames selfs. Disciplina, nae, is that that
any disciple or scholar takes of his master, as any facion or sort of
living, or of doing, any manners or other doctrine. And thereof it is called a
schole, as in example. Christ did forbydde that we should put away violence
by violence, and bead us to do good for ylle, but now we have learned an other
schole, Christus uim ui repellere* phibuit, and bona pro malis reddere
praecepit, at nunc alia est disciplina. So disciplina militaris. is the facion
that young souldiars ar before exercysed in, and trained after, to be made
perfect good men of war. Disciplina gladiatoria, is the precepts and way of
traynynge men in the weapens, and the schools that masters of fense keep.
Disciplina scholastica, is the doctrine that scholars be trained in by their
masters. And thereof among the Philosophiers, the diverse sects are called
disciplinae, as disciplina Stoicorum, is the sect of the Stoiques, Disciplna
peripateticorum, is the sect of the Peripatesiques, and so of others, which
had every of them a diverse facion or train from an other. So disciplina
meretricia, is the school and doctrine that the light houswyues and
strumpettes have among them, and teach it to their disciples. Nam ea quoque,
si dijs placet, artis iam nomen obtinuit. Muneror, aris, has here the nature
and signification of a verb deponent. Plaut. and Macrobius used munero, ras,
neutrali significatione. For there be certain verbes, which be neutres in o,
and deponentes in or, under one signification, as adsentio, adsensi, and
adsentior, tiris, adsensus sum, to assente or to grant. Impertio, impertiui,
and impertior, tiris, impertitus sum, to give part. Comperio, and comperior,
comperi (for the preterperfect, compertus sum, the latin me^ have not said in
the actif signification) to have sure knowledge. Iurgo, as, and iurgor, aris, to
chyde. Fabrico, cas, in poets, and fabricor, caris, in orators, to imagine.
Populo, las, and populor, to distroye. Adulo, as, and adulor, aris, to flatter.
Luxurio, as, and luxurior, aris, to be rank, or to be riottous. Lachrymo, and
lachrymor to weep with others mo, which Nonius Marcellus rekeneth up.

Perge obsecro te. Goo forth in your tale I beseech you.

Cave ne falsam gratiam studeas inire. Beware that thou desire not to pyke or
to have a thank of me undeserved, or beware that thou goo not about to make
me thank the for nothing.

Quid ait, ubi me nominas? What would he say, when thou dyddest name me?

Dicimus redisse te, et rogare uti ueniret ad te. We told him that you were com
home agein, and that you desired him to com unto you.

Mulier lachrymis opplet os totu^ sibi. The woman all to washed all her face
with blabrynge and weeping

can not tell where I am for joy, I was so aferd before.

At ego nihil esse sciebam. But I knew that there was no cause why at all.

Adducimus tuam Bacchidem. We bring here with us your sovereign lady Bacchis.

O hominis impudente^ audaciam. Oh the shameless boldness that is in this fellow.

Non fit sine periculo facinus magnum et memorabile. A great act and worthy
memory is never done without peril. Hic et hec memorabilis, et hoc memorabile,
A thing worthy to be had in memory. Plaut. in capt. At erit mihi hoc factum
mortuo memorabile, But this act shall be had in memory, when that I am deed
and rotten. Colu. in pref. Cu^ tot alios Romani generis intuear memo rabiles
duces. When I behold so many noble capitaynes and worthy memory of the blood of
the Romans. Cic. de amicitia. Cum accepissemus a patribus maxim memorabilem.
C. Laelij, et P. Scipionis familiaritatem, When we had herd of our fathers and
ancestors the familiarity of C. Laelius, and of P. Scipio most worthy
memory. etc. Read in Chiliad. Erasm. the proverb Difficilia quae pulchra, Unto
the which this sentence or clause of Terence alludeth.

Hoc uide, in mea uita tu tibi laude^ is quaesitum scelus. See I pray you,
thou go about to get unto thy self preyse, glory, or honor, by the
hasarde and danger of my life, thou naughty fellow. Is quaesitum.i. quaeris.
Hoc uide, is a manner of latin speaking much used in Terence and Plaut.
signifyenge the same that we say in english in indignation or anger, see I
pray you, as before in Eunucho. Illud uide, os ut sibi distor sit carnifex, See
I prey you, how the villein makes a wrye mouth. Id. in Adelp. Illuc uide, ut
in ipso articulo oppressit, Se I prey you, how he has come upon me, and taken
me sodaynely even at the very point of myschiefe. etc.

Si paululum modo quid te fugerit, ego perierim. If thou be ouerseen in any
thing be it never so little, I am utterly undone, or I may give my life for
an halfepeny. Of paululum quid, or paululum aliquid, pro paululum aliquod, with
others like it is showed largely before.

Si sinas, dicam. If you would let me alone, I would tell you.

Quas, malum, ambages mihi narrare occipit? What the dyuell, going about the
busshe begins he to use in telllynge his tale? Malum is sometimes an
interiection, or after Donate an aduerbe of anger and indignation, and is
swetely brought in (says Donate.) Cic. l. 2. off. Praeclare in epistola
quadam Alexandrum filium Philippus accusat, quod largitione beneuolentiam
Macedonu^ consectetur. Quae te, malum (inquit) ratio in istam spem induxit ut
eos tibi fideles putares fore, quos pecunia corrupisses? Philippus king of the
Macedonians did very nobly rebuke and blame his son Alexander, in a certain
epistle, that he wrote unto him, where he said thus? What (the devil) occasion
or consideration has brought the into this hope, that thou should think
that they would be, and continue faithfulle unto the, whom thou had
corrupt with money?

Ad rem redi. Return to the purpose or pythe of the matter.

Enimuero reticere nequeo. Truly I can not but speak.

Multis modis iniurius Clitipho est, neque ferri potis est. Clitipho is
unreasonable many ways, nor any man may suffer or abide his unreasonable
facion.

Audiendum hercle est tace. In faith you must needs here, or, you may not
chose but here, hold your peace.

Vis potiri, tuum esse in potiundo periclum non uis. You would feign have your
desire and pleasure, but you wol abide none adventure in labourynge for to
obtain it. We say potior, poteris, uel potiris, potitus sum, and in latyne
speaking it governs evermore the genitive plurell of this nowne res, when it
is set alone, and not joined with an adjective, and then it signifies to
bear a reule and to have in our dominion, or to govern the empire, as
Augusto rerum potito, totus quieuit orbis, When Augustus had or ruled the
empire, all the world was at rest and piece. And in that signification, that
is to sey, betokenynge to surmounte or to have in our dominion and under our
subjection, potior is read and joined also with certain other genitiues
besides rerum. Plaut. in Capt. Na^ postquam meus rex est potitus hostium, After
that the king my master had surmounted his enemies, and gotten the over hand
of them. Id. in Epidico. Atque hostium est potita, And she has subdued or
conquered her enemies. Sal. Cui fatum foret urbis potiri, Whose desteny it was
to win or to obtain the city, and to be lord of it. But of all other
casual words, ye and also of the said nowne, res, being joined with any
other adiectife then such as may appertain to the signification above noted,
Potior, governs an ablative case, and then it is to obtain or to get any
thing by labourynge, as potitus sum uictoria, I have gotten the victory. etc.
Potior, is also read gouernyng an accusative, as in old time it was used.
Plaut in Asinar. Fortiter malum qui patitur, idem post potitur bonum, He that
suffers, and manfully endures the sour, shall afterward have the sweet, or
he that does stoutly abide the pain for any thing, shall afterward have the
pleasure of the same. Ter. in Adel. Ille alter sine labor patria potitur
co^moda, That mine other brother Mitio with out any his pain or labor has all
pleasures and commodities belongyng to a father, or that a father should have.
Ibidem. Miseriam omne^ ego capio, hic potitur gaudia, I abide all the care,
sorrow, and myserie, and he has all the joy or pleasure. Cic. in Philipp.
Itaque si receptis illis possumus esse liberi, uincamus odium, pacemque
potiamur, Therefore if we may be free, and out of all subjection, when we have
received tho things, than let us overcome hatered or enmitee, and let us
have peace. Potior, is fourmed of potis, and therefore (says Valla) they be
both very like in signification. For we say in latyne Sum co^pos mentis, compos
animi, co^pos rationis, co^pos sanitatis, wha^ I have the things here
rehearsed. Also we say in latin sum compos uoti, co^pos uictoriae, compos
optati, When I have by my labor and industry gotten or obtained the said
things. Impos in signification is clean contrary unto compos.

Haud stulte sapis. You are no small fool. Aut haec cum illis sunt habenda,

Sed heus tu, uide sis ne quid imprudens ruas. But serra, see that you play no
whylde touch ere you be ware, or forgetting your self. Vide sis, the
particle sis is as much as si uis, and is put for hit often times, as sodes
for si audes, or sultis for si uultis. And it is much used for an aduerbe of
exhorting, or else otherwhyles for a voice expletiue, so that it be
parelcon. Plaut. in Amph. Iam sequere sis, herum qui ludificas dictis
delyrantibus, Come after me at ones, thou which mockest me being thy master
with thy folish sayings. It is used sometime also in orators. Cic pro sexto
Roscio. Age nu^c refer animum sis, ad ueritatem, Well, go to now, return thy
mind to the very pleyn truth of the matter. imprude^s.i. incogita^s unware,
vnauised for fault of remembrance, and consideration. Ruas.i. immodeste a gas,

refreine, nor measure the affections, passions, or desires of his mind, but

sorrow, pleasure, orels what. Ter. in An. Adeo impotenti esse animo, ut praeter
ciuium morem atque legem, and sui uoluntatem patris, tamen hanc habete, studeat
cum summo probro? Should he be so far out of reason, beyond him self, or so

cowghyng, and laughyng or gyggelyng, forbere them. Inuerto, it is, inuerti,
inuersum, is to turn the contrary side outward, as of a furre, or of a
cappe, or of any other thing, and thereof inuertere uerba, est praepostere

bounden either to other, that no mysse hap may at any time chance in your
love or frendeshyp, as who should say, that there can no mysfortune befalle
able to break and to undo the love that is between you. Laur. Vall. very well
shows, that Cicero nor Quintilian never used to say neuter neutri, and that
it is no latin speaking, but neuter alteri, nor uterque utrique, but uterque
alteri, as Cic. in prefatione officiorum. Eodemque modo de Aristotele and
Isocrate iudico, quoru^ uterque suo studio delectatus co^tempsit alteru^, And
the self same wise I judge of Aristotle and Isocrates, of whom either delityng
and taking singlar pleasure and felicity in his own study (that is to sey,
Aristotle in philosophy, and Isocrates in Rhetorike) despised the other.
Quintilan. Cum uterque alteri obijciat, palam est utrumque fecisse, Sins that
either of them lays it to the others charge, it is manifest and open, that
both the one and the other of them did it. Yet never the less Terence in
Phormione says. Quia uterque utrique est cordi, Because that both like either
other very well. And also in the tenthe book of the commentaries of the gestes
of Caesar (which book it is doubted whether Hircius or Oppius did write.)
Interim dissensione orta inter Achillem et Arsinoen, cum uterque utrique
insidiaretur, et summa^ imperij ipse obtinere uellet. etc. In the mean season
dissension, strife, and debate arysynge between Achilles and Arsinoen, when
either of them laid wait to distroye the other, and desired to get and have
the chief rule of the hole Empire him self. etc.

Nescio alios, me scio semper fecisse sedulo, ut ex illius commodo meum
compararem commodum. I know not other men, but my self I know, that I have

commodity, by his commodity, or in such wise that it might always stand

seen the facion of thy father, or, as I have seen thy father disposed this
long while, he wolle yet deal hardly, or roughly with the. Duras. s. parts,
as before in Eunucho. Duras fratris parts praedicas, My brother is in hard
case by thy saying. Duras alicui parts dare, is to handle a body hardly: And
it is proprely said in latin. Quisnam hic est, qui intuetur nos? What fellow
is this same, that beholds us, or looks on us?

Amabo quid tibi est? I pray you, what eyleth you. Esi.i. accidit.

touch you, and that you be here?

Ite intro, nam uos iamdudum expectat senex. Go ye in, for the old manne
looks for you, or tarieth on you, and has done a good while. Of dudum,
pridem, nuper, iamdudum, and iampridem, and the use of them in latin
speaking, it is showed before.

Out of the third Act, in the first Scene.
Lucescit. It dayeth, or it is almost broad day.

Cesso pulsare ostium. I am slack in knocking at the door.

Adolescentem hoc nolle intelligo. I perceive that the young manne would not
have this done, or, I perceive that this is against or contrary to the young
man's mind.

Cum uideam miserum hunc tam excruciarier eius abitu. For as much as I see
this poor soul to be in such great sorrow and heaviness or pain, because of
the going away of him.

Coelem ta^ inspaerata^ gaudiu^? Should I keep priuey or hyde from him this joy
so greatly rvnloked for? Caele^. s. eum, for caelo is one of the^ that
governs a double accusative case, albe it we may say in latin, Celauit me
hanc rem, or, Celauit me de hac re, or, Celauit hanc rem, Ye and Terentius in
Phormione joined a dative case with caelo, saying: Si hoc caeletur patri, in
metu sum, If this be kept or hydden from my father, I am in fear. And
Aemylius probus joined coelo with the same case, saying: Id Alcibiadi caelari
diutius non potuit, That thing might no longer be hydden from Alcibiades.

Haud faciam. I woll not do it, or I wolle not so do.

Quam potero adiutabo senem. I wolle help the old man as much as I shall be

companyon, and takes such part as he does in all his matters or business.
They be called in latyne aequales, which be of one age and time, and
especially which have been brought up to gether, as companyons and
playfeers. Inseruio, is, inseruiui, inseruitum, to do pleasure or service for a
man voluntarily or gladly.

Nos senes est aequum senibus obsequi. It is mete for us old folks to do
pleasure each for other, or reason would, that we old me^ help one an other.
Obsequi.i. inseruire.

Ego profecto egregie ad miseriam natus sum. Trewelye I am notablye borne to
myserye, wretchedness, mysfortune, or aduersytie.

Illud falsum est, quod uulgo audio dici, die^ adimere aegritudinem hominibus.
That is a false or untrue saying, which I here commenly spoken emonges men,
that long contynuaunce or process of time takes away care and thought from
men's hearts.

Nam mihi quidem cotidie augescit magis aegritudo. For unto me at leest wise my
sorrow care or grefe wexeth every day more and more. Augesco is not to begin
to wexe or to grow more, but stylle to be every day more and more. For verbes
in sco do not signifye beginning, nor should not be called inchoatiues (as
Priscianus and other grammarians would have them called) but rather
continuatiues, as the which betoken encreasement: as aegresco not to begin to
be sick* but to be sycker and syker. Vergi. l. 12. Aeneid. Haud quaquam
dictis, uiolentia Turniflectitur, exuperat magis, aegrescitque medendo, The
indignation or fiersnes of Turnus might in no wise be bowed, mitigated,
aswaged, or pacified with any the words or counsel of Latinus, but arose,
swelled and stylle wexed worse and worse, and the more phisike of good
counsel that Latinus bestowed on him, to pacify his said indignation or
fiersenesse, the more and more the same still wexed. Inualesco, to wax or to
grow stronger and stronger. Quintil. Tenuit con suetudo, quae cotidie
inualescit, A custom has been taken up and received, which wexeth stronger and
stronger every day. Lactant. Si nostra inualuerint, ut cotidie inualescunt.
etc. If our part get the better, as every day it waxes stronger and stronger.
Conualesco also to wexe stronger and stronger. Cic. Quanto plura ille miscebat,
tanto hic magis indies conualescebat, The mo medicines or drenches that that
other myngled, the stronger and stronger wexed this other. Crudesco is to wax
or to be rawer and rawer. Verg. Sin in processu caepit crudescere morbus. etc.
But if in the process of time the disease wexe rawer and rawer. etc. Sordesco is
to wexe more and more filthy. Consenesco to wexe older, and not to begin to
be old, and so of macesco, acesco, nigresco, albesco, tabesco, with other
verbes in sco: yet here it is to be noted, that many in sco have the
signyfication of their primytifes, and be used for them: as conticesco for
conticeo, adhaeresco for adhaereo, delitesco for deliteo, co^cupisco for
concupio, obdormisco for obdormio, with others mo, as shows Laur. Vall. l. 1.
eleg. c. 22.

Quanto diutius abest, tanto magis desydero. s. eum. The longer it is sith he
has been away, so much more am I desirous to see him.

Ipsum for as egressum uideo, adibo, alloquar. I see him self come forth, I
woll go unto him and speak to him.

Nuncium aporto tibi, cuius maxim te fieri participem cupis. I bring you that
tidinges, which you are most desirous to here of. Nuncius, cij, cio, in the
masculine gendre, signifies both the bringer of any message or tidings, and
also the message or tydyng^s that is brought. Plau. in Sticho. Praecucurri ut
nunciarem, nuncium exoptabilem: I ran to com before to show tidinges, which you
desire to here. Albe it some gra^marians say, that nunciu^, cij, cio, in the
neutre ge^dre, signifies the message or tidinges that is brought, which
vocable Laur. Vall. says that he never read ne found in no probate author.
And sometimes it is read nuncius, a, um, having the nature and place of an
adjective, as nuncia uerba. etc. There is also red haec nuncia, uunciae, in the
feminine gendre, for her that brings tidings.

Nunquidnam de gnato meo audisti? Have you hard any thing of my son?

Vbinam est, quaeso? Where is he I beseech you?

ylle both for thy self, and for him, Or therein thou takeste a very ylle

Satrapes si siet amator, nunquam sufferre eius sumptus queat. A greatte lord
if he were her lover might never be able to bear or to sustain the sumptuous
charges of her. Hic et haec Satrapes, huius Satrapae, or hic et haec Satrapa,
huius Satrapae is a vocable, which the latin men have taken of the greeks, And
the greeks out of the Persians, and it signifies a ruler, a captayn, or
leuetenaunt of any province, as the capteyne of Cales, or the capteyne of the
I Will of wight, or the leutenant of Irelande may be called in latyne Satrapes or
Satrapa. For satrapeia in greek is prouincia.

Ei unam caenam, atque eius comitibus dedi, quod si iterum mihi sit danda,
actu^ siet, for sit. I have given but only one suppar to him and to his train
or company, that if I should make one suppar more, I might be utterly undone by

paste cure and remedy, at leest wise if it be true that she here seythe. Read
in chil. Eras.

Vt alia omittam. To let pass all other things, or though I speak not of

Deteriores omnes sumus licentia. We be all the worse by having to much
liberty. Omnes. s. nos. Where note one of the figures of grammatical
construction, that is called in latin euocatio, which is as oftentimes as the
third person is immediately reduced unto the first person, or else to the
second: as Ego pauper laboro, cum tu dives ludas, I being poor do labor,
where as thou being rich do play. Where note that in euocation be four
things required. First persona euocans, which is evermore the first or the
second person, secundarylye persona euocata, which is always the third
person, thirdly that the said third person be joined unto the first or
second, (as aforesaid) immediately, that is to say, no manner conjunction
coming between. And fourthly that the verb be of the first person or the
second, according evermore Cum persona euocate, as in the example above
alleged, evidently it appears. And euocation is of two sorts, either
explicita, as when both persona euocans, and also persona euocata be
expressly set out, or else implicita, that is where persona euocans is
understood and not expressed. Verg. Coram, quem quaeritis, adsum Troius
Aeneas, I Aeneas of Troy, whom you seek, am here present. Ovid. Penelope
coniux sem per Ulysses ero, I Penelope woll ever during my life be the wife of
Ulysses only. In which both examples ego, being persona euocans is not
expressed but understood. Though Priscian think this oration Ego
Appollonius scribo, to be incongrue. Note further that in euocation persona
euocans, et persona euocata. All be it they be evermore of one case, yet
sometimes they be of diverse nombres, as when, persona euocata lacks the
singular nombre: as ego tuae deliciae isthuc ueniam, I thy golpoll, or, I thy
delight and pleasure wolle come thither where thou art: or else when persona
euocata is a nowne collectiue, that is to sey, when it signifies plurality,
or a multitude in the singlar number. Plin. in praefac. nar. hist. Magna pars
studiorum amoenitates quaerimus, A great part of us seek delectable and pleasant
studies. Also when persona euocata is a nowne distributive. Ovid. In magnis
laesi rebus uterque sumus, We be both offended, ill served, or violated in no
small things. Teren. in adelphis. Curemus aequam uterque partem, Let us both
care equally either for his own part. Where nos uterque sumus, and nos
uterque curemus, be euocation.

even so as the matter is in deed.

Somnum hercle hac nocte oculis non uidi meis, dum id quaero, tibi qui filiu^
restituere^. In says I slept not one wynke this night, studyeng and deuysynge
how I might get bring home and restore thy son to the again. Qui.i.
quomodo. Joan. Calphurnius notes here a propre difference between redditur and
restituitur, saying: Redditur quis cupientibus, ut domino seruus, restituitur
cupiens, ut patriae ciuis: et redditur et restituitur cupiens cupientibus, ut
patri filius. And in these words Oculis non uidi, is a figure of speaking
called pleonasmus, which is when an oration has any superfluity of words
more then needs: as Verg. Vocemque his auribus hausi, I herd a voice with
these ears. Id. Et sic ore locuta est, And thus she spoke with her mouth. For
we do not here, but with our ears, nor speak, but with our mouths, nor see
but with our eyes.

A me nescio quis exit. One, I can not tell who, comes forth of my house, or
some man comes forth of my house, who so ever it is.

Concede hinc domum. Go hens home.

Ne nos inter nos congruere sentiant. Let them not perceive that we be agreed
between our selves.

Paululum negotij mihi obstat. I have a little busynes, that lets me.

Simus and Crito uicini nostri ambigunt de finibus. Sinius and Crito our
neighbors are at a little variaunce or controversy about their lands. De
finibus.i. de Limitibus, of the bounds or marks where their grounds do
part, and be divided the one man's land from thothers.

Me caepere arbitrum. They have made me vmpier and judge between them.
Coepere.i. fecere, elegere. Arbiter (says Donatus) dabatur ijs, qui de

Dij uostram fidem. Oh the faith of the goddis. Vostram for uestram per
antithesin, It is a manner of speaking, used in Poetis for an interiection of
meruaylynge: as proh Deum atque hominum fidem, Proh sum Iuppiter, with others
like.

Ita ne comparatam esse hominum naturam omnium, aliena melius ut uideant et
iudice^t, quam sua? Is it thus true, that it is naturally given unto all men to
see further, and better to judge in other men's matters, then in their own? or,
Is this so, that the nature of every man has this propretie, that they can see
or mark, and also judge other men's matters better than their own? Ita ne. s.
uerum est secundum Laur. Vall. And of such manner speakynges by the infinitive
mode absolutely put, it is in diverse places annoted before.

Eo fit. Thereby it is, it happens or chances, or thereof it comes.

In re nostra aut gaudio sumus praepediti nimio, aut aegritudine. In any matter
of our own we be let, that is to seye, blinded that we can not see or
judge, by reason either of to much ioyfulnes, or else of sorrow, wofulnes, and
disquiete of the mind. Praepediti. s. quo minus uidere et recte iudicare
ualeamus.

Hic mihi quanto nunc rectius sapit, quam egomet mihi. How much wiser is he
now in this case for my behofe and profit, than I am for mine own?

Dissolui me ocyus, operam tibi ut darem. I have dispatched my self hastily or
spedily to wait or attend on you.

In the second Scene.
Hac illac circumcursa. Run about this way and that way.

Inueniendum est argentum. I must find out or get some money.

Intendenda in senem fallacia. s. est. I must find some wyle to deceive the
old manne. It is a metaphore taken of the stretchynge of the synowes or of
strings in a bow, or lute, or other instrument. For Inte^do, dis, inte^di,
intentu^ is to stretche or to reche, as a man does streche the stryng of a bow,
or of a lute. And thereof by translation it is said in latin Intendere uocem to
strain the voice, that is, to speak as loud as a man may reche, and intentio
uocis is straynyng of the voice, Intendere animum aut ingenium, or intendere
neruos animi uel ingenij, is to strain the mind or wit, that is, to give very
exact advertisement of the mind, or of the wit, and to prove the same to the
uttermost. So here intendenda in senem fallacia is as much as if he should
have said in english: I must streyne a synowe or stretche a vein to beguyle
the old man. Of Intendo read L. Vall. li. 6. eleg. ca. 4.

Number me fefellit, host id struere? Was I deceived, when I seyde that these
fellows went about such a thing? Here is also a metaphore taken of buylders.
For struo, struis, struxi, structum is to buyld or to make a frame: and thereof
by translation struere ignem is to make a fire, struere fallaciam to ymagin a
wyle, struere milites, apud Titum Liuium is to set souldiars in array. etc.

Est ille tardiusculus. He is somewhat slow.

Huic nostro tradita est prouincia. The matter is committed unto this fellow of
mine, or to my man here to do. The Romans of old time called in latin
prouinciam, any out region or far countreye that they had subdued unto their
dominion, empire, and jurisdiction, and held in the same their jurisdiction by
a leuetenaunt, sent thither to govern and rule it. And because that tho
persons, which were admytted and sent by the Romans to rule in any province,
were sent thither as officers, and with commission, and with great charge,
therefore the very office self of rulynge in any province was also called in
latin prouincia, and thereof by a metaphore all the burden, labor, or business
of doing in any manner office, or thing to be done, is called in latin
speaking prouincia, as here. And also in Phormione. O Geta prouinciam cepisti
duram, O Geta thou have taken in hand, or take upon the, a great or hard
matter to do. etc.

Perij, numnam haec audiuit? Alas that ever I was borne, has he hard all this?

Quid tu istic. s. agis? Whatte makeste thou there? or what do thou there?
Note here the difference between these three pronownes hic, iste, and ille, with
their aduerbes derived of them, hic, haec, hoc, hic, hinc, huc, hac, horsum,
with all other deriuatiues and compoundes of the same, as hiccine. etc. in
latyne speaking be referred unto the first person, that is to say unto the
speaker. Iste, ista, istud, istic, istinc, istuc, isto, istorsum, istac. etc.
be referred unto the second person, that is, to the party that the speaker
speaks unto. Ille, la, lud, illic, illinc, llac, illuc, illorsum, illo, be
referred unto the third person, that is, neither unto the speker, nor unto
him that he speakethe unto, but to the third from them both, as I writing
from London to my friend being in Oxforde, that we might meet for to ride
together unto York, may write thus unto him. Iampride^ istuc profectus essem,
nisi me hic occupationes meae detinerent. Tu igitur matura istinc te mouere,
atque huc primo quoque tempore aduolare, quo possimus una illo, quo decreuimus,
proficisci, I had a greatte while sens commen thither (that is to Oxforde where
thou art) but that certain busynes that I have, keep and withholde me here
(in London.) Therefore hye thou, and spedily bestyrre the to comme away from
thense (that is from Oxforde before said) and in all haste possible to comme
hither (to London) to the end that we may both together take our iourneye
thither, as we appointed (that is to York.)

Equidem te demiror tam mane (.s. surrexisse, aut foris in publico conspici)
qui heri tantum biberis. I marvel greatly that thou art up, or that thou
come abroad so erely to day, which drankest so much or so depely yesterdaye.

Visa est, quod dici solet, aquilae senectus. Me thought I saw an old egle (as
the proverb says) Aquilae senectus, the old age of an egle, is a latin
proverb used to be spoken of old me^, or others that live more by drynk tha^
by mete. For Plin. li. 10. na. hist. ca. 3. of the nature of egles shows,
that egles dyen or peryshen neither for age, nor by reason of any sycknes, but
for hungre and lack of meat. For the upper part of their bylles or bebes
grows so much and so far over the nether part, that the aduncitie or
crokednesse thereof may not be opened, nor may not gape to receive sustinance of
meat, so that when they be old they live only by drynk, and by suckynge the
blood of such prays as they have killed, and not by eating. And semblably
aged folks for the most part drinken more then they eaten.

Mulier co^moda et faceta haec est. This woman is a gentyl companion, or a good
fellow, and a pleasant, or merry one.

Mulier forma luculenta. A very fair or beautiful woman. Luculenta.i.
egregia, prae clara, insigni, spectanda.

for the love of her. For that is proprelye Deperire in latyne.

Habet patrem quendam auidum, miserum atque aridum. He has to his father a
certain fellow, gredy of money, a wretched fellow in his house, and a very
pynchepeny, as dry as a kixe.

Atque si is non diuitijs abu^det, gnatus eius profu^^^ inopia. His son is
run aweye, and has forsaken the country, as though he had no riches at
all, nor were worth a penye.

Scin esse factum, ut dico? Do you not know, that it is so as I say?

Homo pistrino dignus. A fellow worthy extreme punysshemente.

Tibi timui male. I was curstly or shrewdly aferde on thy behalf. Caueo with
an accusative is to avoid and eschew, as caueo te, I eschew the or thy
company. Caueo tibi with a dative, idem quod prospicio, I am ware and
provided, that thou have no harm.

Passus est id fieri. He suffered that to be done.

Garris.i. inepte loqueris, nugas loqueris. Thou ianglest, thou pratest, thou
speakeste foolysshely.

Haec facta ab illo oportebant. Thus ought he to have done. Verbes
impersonalles, as decet, delectat, oportet, iuuat, with others like be
sometimes changed into personals, especially in poetis.

Eho quaeso, laudas qui heroes fallunt? Ah sir, or, whatte I pray the heartily
do thou allow and commend such as deceive their masters? Elio somtymes
is an interiection of meruaylyng, somtymes of calling unto a body, as Ehodum ad
me: somtymes of asking a question, as here.

behouable.

Qui istic mos est? What manner or guyse is that of thine?

Ita ne fieri oportet? Is hit honesty so to do?

Quid ego feci? What did I? or what have I done?

Vidin ego te modo manum in sinum huic meretrici inserere? Did I not see the
right now put thy hand in this drabbes bosom.

this man, that he mystrusteth not that I wolle do any such thing, or he has
very good trust in me that I wol not serve him any such touch, or play him
any such pranke.

Esto, at certe concedas aliquo ab eorum ore aliquantisper. Be it so, or, I
woll well that, yet in faith go into some place out of their sight, presence,
way, or company for a little while. Laur. Vall. has noted aduerbes compouned
with per, as parumper, paulisper, tantisper, aliquantisper, to be referred unto
brevity or shortness of time. Wherefore they erren and done amysse, that take
and use the said aduerbes for their symples, parum, paulum, tantum,
aliquantum. Esto is used for a voice or aduerbe of grantyng, ex Seruio.

Prohibet me facere tua praesentia. Thy presence, or thy being here lets me
to do it.

Facti piget. s. me. I am sorye for that that I have done. These syx verbes

with an accusative and a genitive: as Poenitet me dicti, I forthynke or repent
my saying. Taedet me uitae, I am werye of my life. Piget me laboris, I am loath
or unlusty to labor. In the stead of the genitive they may have joined with
them an infinitive mode: as Poenitet me dixisse, Taedet me uiuere, Piget me
laborare. Piget me here in this place of Terence is taken for dolet mihi uel
molestum est. Of the jignification of piget read more largely in Adelph. act.
3. scen. 4. in the vulgar Fratris me quidem pudet piget que.

Ne ineptus, ne proteruus uidear. That I seem not folyshe, nor saucy, or

advise or counseyle the, doing therein the office or part of an honest or
friendly and of a sobre or chaste man. Frugi.i. utilis et necessarij, sumpta
metaphora a frugibus. Temperantis.i. sobrij casti. Te^pera^tia is diffined of
Tullie that it is rationis in libidinem, atque in alios non rectos impetus
animi firma et moderata dominatio, Temperancie is a firm and mode rate or
measurable domination and ruling of reason over all naughty and wanton

one way to come to them? or (as we say prouerbially in english) been there no
mo ways to the wood but one?

Hic prius se indicarit, quam ego argentum effero. This fellow woll surely
betray his own counsel, before that I get any money at all. Indicarit pro
indicauerit, per syncopen. And it is as Donatus expounds the future of the
subiunctife set for the future of the indicative. After some grammarians it
is modus promissiuus, the mode or manner of promisinge, that a thing shall be.
Pomponius calls it futurum exactum, which the greeks expound by the
participle of the preter perfect tense joined with the future tense of the
verb substantife esomai. And the latin me^ in verbes deponent, as ero
locutus. And Linacer in his first book De emendata structura or de octo
partibus, makes mention, that Grocinus, which undoubtedly was a man of
most exquisite, exact, and precise both knowledge and judgment as well in
grammatical things, as also in all other kinds and sorts of learning,
divided the times of verbes in this wise, that he put in the verb three tenses,
that is to wit, the present tense, the pretertense, and the future tense. And
every of these he put to be of two sortis, that is to wit, the one imperfect
and the other perfyte. The present tense vnperfet, as Scribo, I write, or I am
in writing: so that the action of writynge is not yet accomplysshed nor
fynished. The present tense perfet, as scripsi, I have written, or I have done
writing: so that the said action of writing is finyshed and done. And in like
wise the preterte^se vnperfet, as scribebam, I did write, or I was in writing,
the action or doing thereof not yet paste. The pretertense perfet, as
scripseram, I had written, or I had done and ended writynge. Also the future
tense vnperfet, as scribam, I woll or shall write, the action of writynge not
yet begone. The future tense perfet, as scripsero, I shall have written, or I
shall have done writing, the action of writynge already begone and entered, but
not yet ended.

Vin tu homini stulto mihi auscultare? Wolt thou be ruled by the counseile of
me a folishe fellow? Vin pro uis ne.

Iube hunc abire hinc aliquo. Beade or command this fellow here to go or to
get him from hense some whither.

Quo ego hinc abeam? Whyther should I go from hens? Abeam.i. abire debeam. For
it is the potenciall mode, which may always be expowned by possum or debeo, or
some like verb: But of the potentiall mode, and of the use of the same in all
tenses, read examples in Linacer, in his first book, De emendata structura,
sieve de octo partibus.

Abi quo lubet Go whither the lusts.

Abi deambulatum. Go thy ways to walk. Deambulatum, the first supine, which
is used alweyes in thactife signification and is englished like the infinitive
mode of the active voice. And when so ever the english of the infinitive of
thactiue voice, comes after any verb or other word, betokeninge goinge or
mouynge to a place, hit shall be put in the first supine.

Abi istac, istorsum, quouis. Go this way, go that way, go whyther so ever
thou wolte.

Recte dicit, censeo. He says or speaks well, I say even the same.

Dij te eradice^t, qui me istinc extrudas. The goddis take a vengeance on the:
or, send the an evil end, which do thruste me out from your company.
Eradicare proprely is to pluck up by the roots, and by translation it is
referred to the utter destruction of any thing.

Tu tibi istas posthac comprimito manus. Hold in, keep down, or tame thou
those hands of thyn from hensforthe. Comprimito is the imperative mode and the
present te^se. For Linacer in the first book De emend. struct. very well
proves, that the imperative mode has no future tense. First for that the
greeks have no future tense in this mode: seco^darily for that the voices of
the imperatif mode, endinge in to, tote, and tor, may be joined with aduerbes
of the future time. Thirdely for that the same voices in to, tote, tor, ben
founden joined with other voices of the same imperative mode, which all
gra^marians confess and sey to be of the present time: as Propertius. Aut si
es dura, nega, sin es non dura, uenito. Ver. Tytere dum re deo, breuis est uia,
pasce capellas, Et potum pastas age Tytere, et inter agendu^ Occursa re capro,
cornu ferit ille, caueto.

Quid illu^ credis facturum, nisi eum, quantum dij dant tibi opis, seruas,
castigas, mones? What thynkest thou that he woll do, except thou awayte,
chastise, and rebuke him with all the help that the goddis may give the (as
who should say) with all the help that thou may have of the goddis?
Seruas.i. obseruas.

Ego istuc curabo. I wol se or look to that: or, I wol provide for that.

Hic tibi adseruandus est. Thou must lay good awayte on him here: or, thou
had need to take good head on this fellow here.

Mihi iam minus minusque obtemperat. He is now every day less and less ruled
by me.

Ecquid de illo, quod dudum tecum egi, egi sti? Haste thou done any thing in
the matter, for which I was in hand with the erewhile. Agere cum aliquo de re
aliqua, is to talk with a man, and (as we sey in english) to be in hand with
him for or concerning any thing to be done. Of ecquid hit is showed before.

Reperisti tibi quod placeat, an non dum etiam? Haste thou found out any
thing to thy mind, or not yet neither?

Frugi es. Thou art an honest fellow.

Aliud ex alio incidit. One thing arises of an other: or, one thing comes in,
or comes unto mind by reason of an other.

Pessima haec est meretrix. This is a perilous naughty queen.

Video quod inceptet facinus. I se what he begins to do, or I perceive
wheraboute he gothe, or I se what a pranke he is about to play. Io.
Calphurnius notes, that incipere and inceptare be referred to great bold and
hardy enterprises: as in Eunuch. Quid inceptas Thraso? What intend you to
enterprise now Thraso?

Huic drachmarum argenti mill dederat mutuum. He had lenned unto this man
syxtene pounds and one mark of ready money. Dram is a greek word, and it
was a certain coin of money in Athenes, and all that countreye of equal and
the same value, as was in Rome the quoyne of silver that was there called
Denarius, which after the supputacion and rekeninge of Budaeus, in that his
warke entitled De ass, is a grote sterlinge or some what more: so that
reckenyng drachmam at the value of a grote sterlyng, mill drachmarum a
thousand grotes sterlyng make the just su^me of.xvi. li. xiii. s. iiii. 8.

Reliquit filiam adolescentulam huic arraboni pro illo argento. He left a
daughter of his being a very young thing, for a pledge or gage unto this man
for that su^me of money. Arraboni.i. pignori here in this place, but arrabon,
nis, and arra, rae, proprely is the money that is given in earneste at any
bargayne making for thassaraunce and ratifienge of all couenantes and
conditions of the same.

Est nunc ad uxorem tuam. He is now with thy wife. ad for apud.

Dubium ne id est? Is that any mattier of doubt?

Ego sic putam. So thought I.

Quid nunc facere cogitas? What are you now advised and minded to do?

Dicam fi redimat magnum inesse in eo lucrum. I wol say unto him, that if he
should bye it, there were great gaynes or wynninge in it, or that greatte money
might be gotten by it.

Erras. Thou art deceived, or thou art out of the way.

Pro Menedemo nunc tibi ego respondeo. I woll now make answer unto the, on
the behalf, or in the name and person of Menedemus, or as though I were
Menedemus.

Optata loquere. Thou spekest joyful words, or as I would have the. Optata the
accusative plurell, neutre gendre, put substantiuely, or else understanding.

Non uerba opus est. It needs not, or it is not expedient.

Quid est, quod tam grauiter crepuerunt fores? What is the mattier, that the
doors have made such great creakyng?

Quid uult sibi haec oration? Whatte mean these words?

Opperibor of opperior, riris. For in old time verbes of the fourth coniugacion
formed the future tenses of the indicative mode in bo and bor: saying scibo,
audibo, opperibor, with others. Examples be many apud Plautum. And some
grammarians note, that opperiri a verb deponent, when it betokens expectare
to tarry for, is written with double pp, for a difference to be had between
it, and operior the passyue of operio, which is to cover.

Dedo patri me nu^c, ut frugalior sim quam uult. I yield my self now unto my
father: or, I put my self now in my fathers hands to be more honest man, and
of better rule tha^ he would have me to be. Frugalior is the comparatiue, and
frugalissimus the superlatiue of frugi, and not frugalis, which is no pure
good nor vsitate latin word, as may be taken of Quintilian li. 1. instit.
orat. but in the stead or place of frugalis, the latin authors use frugi of al
gendres and vndeclyned. And frugi proprely signifies him, that is temperate
and measurable in his diete, or manner of living of his body, and somtymes in
apparel and other semblable things, as in plain contrary signification
luxuriosus is used apud Senecam, who says, Luxurioso frugalitas poena est,
Unto a ryottous person sobre living or good rule is a great pain. And apud
Quintil. who has a declamacion de duobus filijs. frugi, luxuriosoque, of two
sons, the one sobre and of good rule in living, and the other ryottous and of
ill rule. Frugalitas in greek is called sophrosyne: and frugi homines be called
in greek chresimi, that is utiles, sobrij, et necessarij, Profitable sobre and
necessary. Cic. li. 3. Tuscul. quaesti. Of the signifycation of these two
words frugalitas and frugi says thus: Sed quia nec qui propter metu^
praesidium relinquit, quod est ignauiae, nec qui propter auaricia^, clam
depositu^ non reddit, quod est iniustitiae, nec qui propter temeritatem male
rem gessit, quod est stultitiae, frugi appellari solet, eas tres uirtutes,
fortitudinem, iustitiam, and prudentiam, frugalitas complexa est. Ergo frugi
hominem, bonum et uirtute praeditum intelligimus. Cuius contrariu^ est nequam,
cuius significatio una est, quod sit libidinis inte^perans, altera, quod ad
nihil bonus sit, sed plane malus, But for because that neither he, which for
fear forsakes his garrison, which to do is a point of dastardnes or
cowardnes, nor he that for avarice or covetous desire and love of goods,
money, or any other thing, being privily and without any wytnes present, put
and laid in his custody to keep, doethe not restore, but withholde, when it is
required and asked again, which is untrue and vnrightwise dealing, ne yet he
that for temeritie or wylfull rasshnes and lack of discretion, has had ill
luck and mysauenture or mysfortune in his matters or affairs (specially in
battle) which is a token and the propretie of foolyshnes, because that no
such person is commonly or usually called in latin frugi: Therefore this
latin word frugalitas in signification conteyneth and betokens as much as
all these three virtues: that is to wit hardynes, rightousnes, or true and
upright dealing, and also prudence or much knowledge and experience of
things. Then it follows, that when we sey in latin frugi homo, we
understand thereby a good and honest man, and endued with manhood and virtue.
And the contrary of the same latin word frugi, is nequam: the which word
nequam has two significations: in the one signification it is a man that is
lecherouse and of myslyuyng of his body: in the other signification nequam is
he that is good for nothing, but even a very naughty vnthyryfte. Columell.
lib. 1. Eiusdem agilitatis homo frugi, melius quam nequam faciet, If there be
two men of semblable and equal agilitie or weldynes and besterynge of them
selfs, an honest fellow shall do any thing that he is set unto better than
shall an unthrifty fellow or a naughty pack.

In the fyfte scene.
Menedemi uicem miseret me. I have pity on the ill chance of Menedemus. We seye
in the singular nombre uicem, and uice, and no more, in the plurell nombre it
has al cases. Some grammarins derive and form uices, of the word ui, which
in old time was much taken and yet is pro pugnis, for fightinge: as whenne we
say in latyne. Vim mihi intulit, He laid violente hands on me, and fought
with me. Vim sibi intulit, He kylde him self. In the same signification is
uices used in Plaut, where he says: Vices eius memorat, et cicatrices denudat,
He tells of the battayles that he has foughten, and discovers or shows
open the scarres or print of the wounds that he had. Some times uices is taken
pro poenis, et inco^modis, for punishment and mischances, displeasures, or
adversity. Horat. li. 1. carm. Vices que superbe te maneant ipsum. Sometimes
pro periculo, for danger and ieoperdie.

Verg. Nec tela, nec ullas uitauisse uices Danaum. Sometimes pro loco for in the
place or stead. Horat. Vtar uice cotis, acutum red dear quae ferrum ualet exors
ipsa secandi, I woll be in the stead of a wheatstone, which has power to make
knynes sharp, and yet it felfe has no such propretie that it can cut. Laur.
Val. in annotac. contra Raud. touches the difference between Dolere alicuius
casum, and dolere uicem.

Miseret me, ta^tum deuenisse ad eum mali. It pitieth me, that so greatte a
mysfortune has chanced unto him.

Ita magno desyderio fuit ei filius. He has longed so greatly for his son.
Desydero, ras, raui, is to long for, and thereof comes desyderium.

Hosce aliquot dies non sentiet. For these few days he shall not feel it.

Verum ubi uidebit tantos sibi sumptus domi cotidianos fieri, nec fieri modum,
optabit rursum ut abeat ab se filius. But when he shall perceive, that he shall
be daily at so great charges, and therein like to be no mesure nor end, he
woll wysshe that his son were gone from him again. Antonius Nebr. in that his
book, which he entitled Lexicon iuris ciuilis, shows and proves, that
cotidie and cotidianus should be written with, c, and not with q. Ab, in
apposition is read not only set before words beginning with vowels, but also
with words beginning with almost al consonantes: as apud Plautum, Terentium,
Liuium, and others plainly appears.

Syrum optime eccum. Lo here is Syrus meruaylous well, or as well as can be.

Of the use of Iamdudum, it is showed before.

Videre egisse iam nescio quid cu^ illo. Me thinks thou have ben in hand
with him about some thing what so ever it is.

Dictum ac factum reddidi. I dispatched it with a word, or, in the turnynge of
an hand (as who should say) I did no rather move the matter, nor speak of it,
but it was done by and by. Al be it Eras. in chiliadibus interprets and
expounds this proverb to signify all manner diligence and labor necessary
to the doing or bringynge to pass of any thing. For he says, that dictum ac
factu^ is a prouerbiall speaking, by which is signified, that we have not
omytted or let pass any thing belonging to the furtherance or perfourmaunce
of any matter or business. And his example he brings in this place of
Terence, which in that sense may be englisshed thus: I have done as much as
is possible, or as may be done in the matter. Donatus says, dictum ac factum
to be a prouerbial spekyng, be tokeninge celeritie and speed in doing or
dispatchynge of a thing. Teren. in Andr. ac. 2. sc. 3. Haec sola est mulier,
dictu^ ac factum, inuenerit aliquam causam, quam obrem eijciat oppido, This
glycerie is alone woman, Simo wol not fail, but at ones with the turnynge of
an hand, to find some quarelle or other, to drive her out of the town. And
in the first scene of the.5. act, in the same comedy, Dictum factum huc
abijt Clitipho, By and by comes thither Cliti.

Bona ne fide? s. fecisti. Dydst thou it feithfully, substantially, trustily,
or ernestly?

thus. Non possum quin caput tibi demulceam.

auaunte, that it has chanced as thou would?

Non hercle uero, uerum dico. Nay in feith I sey troth. Hercle uero be
aduerbes of co^firmynge and auouchynge.

Ausculta quod superest fallaciae. Here that is behynd more of this subtilte or
falsheed.

Sese ipse dicet tuam uidisse filiam, eius sibi complacita^ forma^ postquam
aspexerit. Him self woll show you, that he has seen your daughter, and that
her beauty or favor lyked him well, when he saw her.

Dicet se filiam tuam cupere uxore^. He wol show you, that he would feign have
your daughter to his wife.

thing.

Argentum dabitur ei ad nuptias, aurum, atque uestem qui comparet. He shall
have money given him to his marriage, wherewith to bye clothe of gold and other
apparel. Aurum here is taken for clothe of gold, and so it is taken in diverse
places of Titus Liuius, and namely in the concions of Cato, and Lucius Valerius
li. 32. ab urbe condita. and Ioachimus Perionius notes the same.

Non ego perpetuo dicebam, ut illi dares, sed ut simulares. s. te daturum. I
seid not that thou should give it unto him for ever, but that thou should
feyne, show a countenance, or make as though thou would give it him.

because that thou had beaden me so greatly or so instantlye erewhyle.

Equidem isthuc aequi bonique facio. Truly I am nothing discontented therewith.
Aequi bonique facere, aequi bonique consulere, aequi consulere, and boni
consulere, been elegant manner of latin speakynges betokenyng the same, that we
say in english, to take well in worth, and in good gree. Examples been every
where innumerable.

Maxim uolo te dare operam ut fiat, uerum in alia uia. I woll in any wise that
thou do thy labor and diligence that it may be done, but yet after an other
way.

Illud quod tibi dixi de argento, quod iste debet Bacchidi. That that I spoke
to you of the money, which this man owes to Bacchis.

Argentum reddendum est illi. He must have his money again, or his money must be
paid unto him ayene.

Neque tu scilicet eo nunc confugies, quid mea?. s. refert. And in feithe thou
shalt not now have any refuge to that saying, (which some men use) what have
I to do therewith, or what perteyneth the matter to me?

Number mihi datum est argentum? Was the money delivered unto me?

Number ille oppiguerare filiam meam me inuito potuit? Might he lay my daughter
in pledge, or to gage, whether I would or not?

Verum illud dicunt. That is a true saying of men. Verum is a nown here in
this place.

Ius summum saepe summainiuria est. The rigor or the extremity of the law,
or of a man's right, is often times the greatest injury and wrong that may be.

or, though it be leful for others, yet it is not leful for the. Si for etsi.

Omnes te in lauta, er been aucta part putant. Al men think you to be one of
them, that live welthyly, and ben of great substance.

Quin egomet iam ad eum deferam. s. arge^tum. Marye I my self woll go bear it
unto him by and by.

Imo, filium iube potius. s. defer arge^tum. Nay, rather beade your son to

Quia enim in hunc translata est suspicio. Mary because that the suspicion of

Ipse adeo adest, abi, effer argentum. He is even here now him self, go thy
ways, and bring forth the money.

In the sixte Scene.
Nulla est tam facilis res, quin difficilis sit, quam inuitus facias. There is
nothing so easy or light to be done, but that it is hard, if a man do it by
co^pulsion, or against his will

Vel haec deambulatio quam non laboriosa, me ad langorem dedit. Even the same
little walking, being nothing peynfull, or being a thing of no labor, yet
has made me all weary and faint. Vel in this place, is not a conjunction
disjunctive, but taken for etiam per enallagen partium. Ter. in Eu. Vel rex
mihi semper agebat gratias, Even the king him self did ever give me thanks.

Nec quicquam magis nunc metuo, quam ne denuo miser aliquo extrudar hinc. And I
fere nothing more now, then yt I shall be shifted or driven from hens some else
whither.

Vt te omnes dij cum istoc inuento, cumque incepto perdiunt. All the gods
take a vengeance upon the with this thy devise, and beginning. Perdiunt pro
perdant, with others like much used in old poets. Vt pro utinam, whereof it
is largely showed before.

Huiusmodi mihi res semper co^miniscere, ubi me excarnifices. Thou do always
deuyse and invent such thnges for me, to tourment and vex me withal. Vbi.i.
in quibus.

I tu hinc quo dignus es. Get the hense to the deuylle. The words sound
thus. Goo hens whyther thou art worthy to goo, (as who should sey) whyther
thou have deserved to go, and because they be used and spoken always in
indignation, they may be aptely and well englyshed, as before, for that is our
most used manner of speaking in english.

Quam pene tua me perdidit proteruitas. How nere thy saucynes had undone me,
or, how thy malopertnes had almooste utterly cast me awey. Of proteruus,
proteruitas, or proteruia, procax, procacitas, petulans, and petulantia read L.
Val. li. 4. eleg. ca. 105.

Vellem hercle factum. In feyth I would it had been so.

Ne me istuc ex te prius audisse gaudeo, quam argentum haberes, quod daturus
iam fui. In feyth I am glad that I have herd that word of thy mouth,
before thou had received the money, which I was ready and about to deliver
now by and by. It may be said ex te audisse, a te audisse, and de te audisse,
as shows Lau. Vall. li. z. eleg. ca. 66.

Iam non sum iratus. Now I am not angry.

Scin' ubi nunc sit tibi tua Bacchis? Do thou know or can thou tell where
now to find thy best beloue Bacchis?

Bono animo es. Be of good chere.

Ludis fortasse me. Percase thou mockest or bourdest with me.

Ipsa re experibere. Thou shalt prove or se it in very deed. It is alredye
showed that in old time verbes of the fourth coniugacion fourmed their future
tenses of the indicatife mode in bo, and bor.

Ne ego fortunatus homo sum. Truly I am a fortunate fellow, or truly I have
good chance and fortune.

Deamo te Sire O Sire I love the with all mi heart. Deamo.i. ualde amo. For the
preposition de, in composition somtymes betokens encreasynge, al be it most
times it signifies diminution or privation.

Obsecundato in loco. Be ruled or follow the appetite of a man at some time.
For locus in such manner speakinges is taken and used also pro tempore, et pro
re. Obsecundare est obtemperare, obsequi et omnia ad alterius uelut nutum
facere.

Cave quidquam admiratus sies. Beware that thou make no maruailing at the
matter.

Quod imperabit, facito. What he shall bead or command the to do, do it.

Nihil est illic quod moremur diutius. There is no cause why for us to tarry
there any long space.

Minas quidem iam december habet a me filia. My daughter has there now alredye
of me ten pounds sterlyng. Mina in Athenes and the countreye of Greece
theraboute was as much in su^me as libra in the city of Rome, and Libra
romana was equalle with our pound sterlynge.

December minas pro alimentis esse nunc duco datas. Ten pounds I reckon now as
given or paid for her table.

Hasce pro ornamentis consequentur alterae. s. december minae. After them must go
other ten pounds for her apparel.

Porro haec talenta dotis apposcent duo. And these two wolle require besides
and above that one hundrede pounds to her marriage. Dos dotis proprely is the
money that is given with any woman, or that she brings with her to her
marriage, and by translation it is taken for any gift of nature or other wise:
as prudence, justice, and fortitude, with other virtues be called dotes animi:
beauty, strength, stature, ben dotes corporis: so dotes ingenij. etc. Of
talentum it is showed before. Note that here is set haec for hae plurally, and
the neutre gendre for the feminine. For next before went alterae december minae.
So Terence before in Enucho, speaking de ancillis Thaidis. Continuo haec
adornant, ut lauet, pro hae adornant. Anon the maidens made al things ready,
that she might wash. Idem in Phorm. Haec illae erant itiones. pro hae illae
erant itiones, This was all the goinges in and out. And the same noten both
Donatus and Io. Calphurnius.

Mihi nunc. relictis omnibus, inueniendus est aliquis, labor inue^ta, mea cui
them bona. I must be feign now, all other things laid aside, to find some
man, unto whom to give my goods, gotten with great labor. Labor inuenta.i.

happy of all men, now that I see the my son returned and come again to
goodness.

Vt errat. How greatly he is deceived, or how far he is out of the way.

Teipsum quaerebam Chreme. I sought for you, and no man else Chremes.

Cedo, quid uis? Tell me, what would thou have? or, show me what is thy will?

what was said between us?

Ea res nunc agitur ipsa. Even very that, we go about now.

Erraui. I was beguiled, or deceived.

Frustra gauisus sum miser. I was glad for nothing unhappy body that I am.

Quiduis iam malo, quam hunc amittere. I woll now suffer any mysaduenture in
the world, rather then lose him here, or, have him go from me. Quiduis iam
malo. s. facere ac pati.

Quid nunc renunciem abs te responsum? What shall I bear word ayene now,
that thou haste answered?

Ne sentiat me sensisse, atque aegre ferat. Lest that he epsy me to have
perceived the matter, and so be discontented.

Nimium isti indulges. You make to much of him, or you cocker him to much, or
you suffer him to much to take his pleasure, and to have his own mind.

Inceptum est, perfice hoc mihi perpetuo. The matter is already ones entered and
begone, go me through with it still.

Dic egisse te de nuptijs. s. mecum. Sey that you have been in hand with me for
or about the marriage.

Dica^, quid deinde? I wol, what then after?

Dic me facturum esse omnia. Seye that I wol do al things.

Dic generum placere. s. mihi. Sey that my son in law lyketh me well.

Isthuc uolueram. That was my desire.

Quam ocyssime ut des. That thou may give it very hastily.

Nae tu propediem istius obsaturabere. In feyth thou shalt soon or shortly
have thy belly full of that gere.

Haec cautim et paulatim dabis si sapies. Thou shalt give these things
warely, and by lyttel and little, if thou wolte play the wise manne.

Abi intro, uide quid postulent. Go thy way in, and se what they lack, or what
they would have. Postulo. las, is proprely to ask or to require.

Ego domi ero, si quid me uoles. I wol be at home, if thou wolt any thing with
me.

Te sciente faciam, quicquid egero. Thou shall be of couunsayle, what so ever I
shall do, or I wol do nothing, but the being of counsel. For Te sciente is
the ablative case absolute.

Out of the fyfte Act in the first Scene.
Ego me non tam astutum, neque ita perspicacem esse scio. I know my self not
to be so crafty, or wily, ne so quyck in perceiuyng or espienge of things.

Hic adiutor meus, et monitor, et praemonstrator, hoc, mihi praestat. This mine
helper, and counseylour, and leader or poynter of the way is above me, or
better than I in this point. Praemonstrator, toris, is he that goes before a man to guide him, and to show him the way, and as who should say, to lead
him by the hand.

In me quiduis harum rerum conuenit, quae sunt dicta in stultum, caudex,
stipes, asinus, plumbeus. All those things may well be said unto me, that be
commonly said against a fool, as to be called a block, or a stumpe, a stock,
an ass, an heuyheed: as who should say, I may well be called a block, a
stock, an ass, a dulheed, with all other such names as be given to foolyshe
and dulle fellows, in despite or in derision. Caudex is the foot and lowest
part of the stock of a tree next unto the roots. Stipes, stipitis, is a
logge, that is set fast in the ground. Plumbum, by, is latin for leed:
thereof plumbeus, bea, beum, a thing made of the metal of lead: and by
translation a man, or any other thing of the propretie and condition of lead,
that is to wit, heavy, blunt, and dulle: whereof is taken a latin proverb:
Plumbeo iugulare gladio, to cut ones throat with a sword of leed, that is to
sey, to go about and to labor to overcome or to convince a man with a vain,
light, and slender reason or argument. The proverb Cicero does use.

In illum nil potest. s. dici. Nothing can be said against him.

Exuperat eius stultitia haec omnia. The folyshnes of him posseth all this.

Desine deos gratulando obrundere. Leave or forbear to dulle the goddis with
geuyng thanks to them for thy good chance or fortune. Gratulor, laris, has
two significations, the one is to make joy, and to say or to testefie in
words, that thou art glad of the good fortune or happy chance, either of an
other man, orels of thyn own self. And in this signification Gratulor wol
have after him a dative case of the party, for whose cause such ioyinge or
testification of gladness is made, whether it be thy self, or else any other
body: as Gratulor tibi, quod tam gratiosus sis apud principem, I am glad,
that you be in such high favor with your prince. Gratulor mihi cui hoc
saeculo tam li terato nasci contigerit, I am glad on mine own behalf, that it
was my chance to be borne in this time, when letters so well flouryshen. Where
note, that gratulor, besides the said dative case, may have after him also, of
the thing that you allege, wherefore you sey that you be glad, an accusative
without a preposition, or an accusative with the preposition, ob, orels an
ablative with the preposition de: as I am glad that you have that office,
Gratulor tibi istum magistratum, or, Gratulor tibi ob istum magistratum, or else
Gratulor tibi de isto magistrato. So Gratulor tibi nouum istum honorem, or ob
nouum istum honorem, or de nouo isto honor, I am glad on your behalf, of
this your new promocion. Al be it the poets sometimes leave out the dative
case, especially when it is a pronown: as Ovid. in ep. Gratulor Oechalia^
titulis accedere nostris. Where the dative is understood, which may be tibi,
mihi, or nobis. Id. de art am. Prisca iuuent alios, ego me nu^c denique natum
Gratulor: Where is understood mihi. Some times also in orators, the dative
is not expressed, but omitted and understood. Quin til. in pasc. cadauer.
Gratulemur iam, quod nulla ciuitas fame laboret, where is understood nobis.
And by reason of such omission of the dative case some grammarians have thought
gratulari idem esse quod gaudere, to joy, to rejoice, or to he glad, alleging
for their authority the examples above written: But Laur. Vall. li. 5. eleg.
cap. 42. does not allow them, well considering, that gratulation may be,
where not only no joy or gladness is, but also entier and hearty sorrow, as a
man may say or testify that he is glad of the promocion of an other man,
(which is in latin, Gratulari alicui noua^ dignitatem) and yet in his heart
be right sorye for the same. Gratulor is also taken sometime for gratias agere,
to give thanks, but that is in manner never, but to the gods immortal. So
that in this signification it is the same that supplicare, to pray and to do
our deuocions to the gods. Titus Liuius. Triumphantes in capitolium
ascendebant, Ioui optimo Maximo, caeterisque dijs gratulatum, Such persons as
triumphed in old time in the cite of Rome used to ascend or to go up into the
Capitole castle, or tower of the city, to give devout thanks unto the most
good, and most mighty Jupiter, and unto the other gods. So that Gratulari Deo
et superis, is to give devout thanks unto god and to his saynctes for any
benefyte, felicity, or happy chance received. And so is gratulando taken here
in this place of Terence, and there is understood eis nempe dijs.

Desine obtundere, nisi illos, ex tuo ingenio iudicas, ut nihil credas
intelligere, nisi idem dictum est centies. Leave dullyng them, except thou
esteem and judge them of thine own propretie, that is, that thou thynkeste
them to perceive or understand nothing, but if the same have been spoken,
repeted, or rehearsed an hundred times.

Quid risisti? Wherefore dyddest thou laugh?

Serui uenere in mentem Syri calliditates. I remembered, or I thought upon the
subtyle or wily deuyses of my servant Syrus.

Itane? Yea, or in deed.

Vultus quoque homninu^ fingit scelus. The ungracious harlotte can facion or
transpose also the countenances and lokes of men. Scelus for scelestus per
emphasin, aut potius auresin, as is showed before. Io. Rinius in his
castigations upon Terence notes these words in this place, and exponneth the
same in such wise that he takes the sense and meaning of them to be this.
Vultus quoque hominum fingit scelus, The ungracious fellow can also transpose or
facion the countenances of men (that is) can make or cause men to look and to
have such countenances as him lysteth, meaning by Syrus, that he had in such
wise taught and enstructed Clinia, that he could facion his look and
countenance at his pleasure, and countrefeate any facion of countenance that
he would him self. And in this sense it best agreth with the words next
following, which ben these. Gnatus quod se adsimulat laetum, id dicis, That my
son makes a countenance as he were glad speak you of that? And fingere
uultum, in the self same sense uses Caesar. l. i. bell. Gall. where he says
thus. Hi neque uultu^ fingere, neque interdum lacrumas tenere poterant, These
men could neither feyne or make a good countenance, nor yet sometimes hold or
forbear weeping (as who should say) they could not hyde nor dissemble their
fere, but that there appeared in their faces and cou^tenances evident notes and
tokens* that in their minds and hearts they were soore troubled and vexed, and
aferde of punysshement. And of the same comes a prouerbiall spekyng: Fortuna^
sibi quisque fingit, Every man makes (as who should say) is causer of his own
fortune be it good or bad, as who should say, they that be good or virtuous or
learned, or have any honest craft or occupation, shall have good fortune, and
shall be sustained thereby, and live well, and contrary wise they that be idle
fellows, nor have any learning, nor occupation, but be flagicious and full of
myschefe, shall not live well, but in misery, whereof they may always thank
them selfs, as causers of their own fortune.

Idem istuc mihi uenit in mentem. I remembered, or I thought upon even the self
same thing.

Magis, si magis noris, putes ita rem esse. Thou would much more think it
to be so, if thou dyddest better know the matter.

Ain tu? Say thou so?

behind, or in the back side in the furmooste part of all my house.

Quid post quam hoc est factu^? What, when that was done?

Huc abijt Clitipho, Bacchis consecuta est illico. Thither goes Clitipho, and
after goes Bacchis at the hard heles of him. Consequi is to follow, as we use
to say on english, cheek by cheke, or at the hard heels. etc.

Vbi abiere intro, operuere ostiu^. As soon as they were gotten in, they
closed or shut to the door.

Clinia haec fieri uidebat? Did Clinia se all this done?

Quid ni? mecum una simul. What else? even to gither with me. Quid ni. s.
uiderit. Vna simul it is the figure plonasmus, of which it is showed before.

December dierum uix mihi est familia. My houwseholde may scacely endure or hold
ten days longer, (as who should say) I shall not be able to continue
householdyng or keeping of an house ten days longer.

Ille operam amico dat suo. He atte^deth upon his friend.

An dubium id est tibi? Haste thou any dout of that?

Quenquam animo tam comi esse, aut leni putas? Thynkest thou any man to be of
so familiar, or so gentyl in heart? Hic haec comis et hoc come, is he that is
gentyl and familiar and nothing statelyke nor high minded or strange. Hic
haec lenis, hoc lene, is he that is not rough nor sharp, nor soon moved to
anger, but is gentyl and sone contented or pleased, and is full of sufferance.

Quo uerba facilius dentur mihi. That I may the sooner be deceived.

Merito mihi nunc ego succenseo. I am angry with my self now, not without a
cause.

Quot res dedere, ubi possim percentiscere, nisi essem lapis. How many things

Nonne id flagitium est, te alijs consilium dare, foris sapere, tibi no^ posse
auxiliarier? Is not this a very noughtye thing, that thou canste give
counsaylle unto others, and to be wise in other men's mattiers, and not to be
able to help or ease thine own self?

Fac te esse patrem sentiat. So do that he may perceive and feel the to be his
father.

Fac ut audeat tibi credere oi^a. So do that he may commit and show v^nto the

secrets, and to keep nor hyde nothing from him.

Fac ne quam aliam quaerat copiam. So do that he may not seek for any other
help.

Fac ne te deserat. So do that he may not forsake the.

Imo abeat potius multo, quouis gentium, quam hic per flagitium, ad inopiam
redigat patrem. Nay mary let him go from hens to the worlds end, much
rather then he should here through his michiefe and ungracious facion of
living, undo his father, and bring him to poverty and need or beggary. Of this
word Gentium how it is added unto diverse aduerbes, hit is largely declared
before.

Si illi perga^ suppeditare sump tibus, mihi il laec uere ad rastros res redit.
If I should give him asmoche money, as he would spend, that would surely bring
me to the rake and the spade: as who should say, it would undo me, and make me
a very beggar in deed: and it is elegantly said in latin, Res mihi ad rastros
redit, I must be feign to take a rake and a spade in my hand, (as who should
sey) to dygge and delfe for my living. Suppeditare illi sumptibus, may
otherwise also be said in latyne, Suppeditare illi sumptus, and this later is
more used.

Quot inco^moditates in hac re accipies, nisi caves? How many incommodities or
displeasures shall thou have in this thing, except thou be ware or take heed?
All be it Io. Riuius in his castigations redeth, Quot incommoda tibi in hac re
capies. etc.

Difficilem ostendis te esse, ignosces tamen post. Thou show thy self
hard, sore, or heavy toward him, yet thou wolt forgive or pardone him at

Duo talenta pro re nostra ego esse decreuisatis. I have determined or judged

Ita dictu opus est, si me uis saluum esse, et rem, et filium. Thou must needs
so say, if thou wolte have my life saved, and my goods and my son. Here is
the figure of construction called zeugma, which is when a verb or an
adjective is reduced and referred unto diverse a nominative cases or
substantives, that is to wit, unto the nominative or substantive that is
next unto it expressly, and unto all the others, by understanding or
repetyng: as Ego et tu uiuis, I and thou live. Where uiuis is reduced and
referred unto two nominative cases, that is to wit ego and tu. And with the
next, that is tu, it accords in number and person expressly, and with the
further that is ego, by understanding thus. Ego. s. uiuo, et tu uiuis. So
coeli mouendi sunt, et terra. Where mouendi and sunt accorden with the next,
that is coeli expressly, that is to say, the verb in noumbre and person,
and the adjective in case, gendre, and number. And with the further terra, they
both accorden not, but by understanding thus, Coeli mouendi sunt, et terra.
s. mouenda est. So Virgil. Hic illius arma, hic currus fuit. Where the sense
and oration is thus to be made perfect. Hic illius arma. s. fuerunt: Hic currus
fuit. etc. Again Ego et uxor mea est docta. The perfect speking is this, Ego.
s. sum doctus, et uxor mea est docta, or else Ego sum doctus, et uxor. s. est
docta. Yet this not withstanding, if there be any comparatio^, the verb or
the adjective may accord with the further. As in example we say not Ego melius
quam tu scribis, but Ego melius quam tu, scribo, I write better then thou. Like
wise if there be any similitude, the verb or adjective shall accord with the
further nominative or substantive: as Ego sicut tu sentio, and not ego sicut tu
sentis, I think as thou do, or I am of the mind that thou art. And in the
psalm Ego sicut foenum arui, and not ego sicut foenum aruit. Also by the
conjunction nisi, thus. Talem filium nulla nisi tu pareret, and not pareres:
but by understanding. And here note, that zeugma, may be three manier ways.
First in person, as Ego et tu uiuis: Secondarily in gendre, as Rex et regina
est irata: Thirdely in number, as Cic. Nihil te hic munitissimus habendi
senatus locus, nihil horum ora, uultus que mouerunt? Has this most strong
place, that the parlyament is kept in, and the faces or countenances or lokes
of these men, being present and beholdynge the, moved the nothing at all? Note
furth^r, that there be three kinds of zeugma. One is called in greek
protozeugma, that is when the verb or the adjective is set in the
beginning: as Dormio ego et tu. An other is called mesozeugma, which is when
the verb or the adjective is set in the mids: as Ego dormio et tu. The
third is called hypozeugma, and that is where the verb is put in the end: as
Ego et tu dormis. But when a verb or an adjective is reduced unto diverse
nominative cases or substantives, and agrees with them both, the grammarians
callen it zeugma locutionis, of speaking, non constructionis, and not of
construction. As in the example of Cicero before, Nihil horum ora uultusque
mouerunt. Ageyn. Ioannes est eruditus et petrus. Zeugma requires four
things: First diverse substantives, as Rex et regina: Secondarily a
conjunction, as et. Thirdely a verb or an adjective, as irata est. Fourthly
that the same verb or adiectife do agree expressly with the next noiatiue or
substa^tiue, as Rex et regina est irata. Where note that the conjunction may be
either a coniunctife, a disiunctife, or else an expletiue, it may be also an
aduerbe instead of a conjunction: as Cubas ubi ego, Thou lie where I do.
Coenas quando nos, Thou suppest when we do. Haec fere de zeugmate Gerardus
Listrius.

Id mirari te simulato, et illum rogato simul quamobrem id faciam. Make as
though thou dyddest marvel thereat, and together there withal demand of
him, wherefore I do it.

Ego uero, quamobrem id facias, nescio. And in deed to, I know not wherefore
thou do hit.

Ego id facio, ut eius animu^ qui nunc luxuria et lasciuia diffluit retundam. I
do it that I may clean dasshe his heart or mind, which now runs at
rouers in riot and wantonness. Diffluere proprely is to ru^ne abroad in diverse
places, as water does, and by translation it is to be ryottous and wild,
rounnynge at large, nothing refreynynge him self. Semblably retundere
proprely is to make dulle or blunt as in a knyfe, when the point or edge of it
is turned. And the same by translation is to abate, to bring down, and (as
we use much to say now) to dasshe, to blanke, and to appall. Luxuria, riae,
and luxus, xus, xui, is latin for riot, and not for lechery. Libido, bidinis,
is latin for lechery, and lasciuia perteyneth to the same. For lasciuus
propreli is he that is lecherous both in living and also in words. Ex Laur.
Vall.

Redigam eum, ut quo se uertat nesciat. I wolle bring him to that point, that
he shall not wotte whyther to turn him. A child may marvel why Terence
says not nesciet, rather then nesciat, saying that our manner of speaking in
english so sowneth as though it should be the future tense of the indicative
mode. But it is to be noted, that this particle ut, is never joined with verbes
of the indicative mode. For ut nesciat in this manner speaking, is the same
that barbarous, rude, and unlearned persons say thus, quod nesciet, but the
latin phrase is otherwise. Therefore in this manner speaking with others like it
is necessary to put the present tense of the subiunctiue mode instead of
the future of the indicative mode. And this is also noted in the little book
De corrupti sermonis emendatione. And this example of Terence is there brought
in, Quo se uertat,.i. quo se uertere debeat, it is the potencial mode.

Mitte me. Let me go, or let me alone.

Sine me in hac re gerere mihi more^. Suffer me in this thing to follow mine own
appetite, or to have mine own mind and pleasure.

Ita ne uis? Wolte thou so? or is that thy mind?

Vxorem accersat. Let him send for his wife.

Dictis confutabitur. He shall be convinced or blanked with words or reasons.
Confuto, tas, is to avoid a man in such wise, that he can nothing more
allege nor say for him self.

Eum si uiuo, adeo exornatum dabo, adeo depexum, ut, dum uiuat, meminerit
semper mei. If I live, I woll so beraye him, and so deck or trymme him, that
as long as he lives, he shall ever remember me, or thynk on me. Depexus, xa,
xum, comes of depecto, which is diligenter pecto, to kembe diligently. Ovid.
l. z. fast. Interea liber depexos crinibus indos Vicit, et eoo dives ab orb
uenit. Per metaphora^, uel potius ironeiam, it is taken and used in the ill
part. So that de pexus, which is proprely well kembed, and having a bushe well
decked, is taken for the contrary, that is ill arayde and ill handled.

Sibi me pro ridiculo, ac delectamento putat. He reputeth me as his laughing
stock, and as one to make him sport and pasty me.

Non auderet haec facere uiduae mulieri, quae in me fecit. He durst not have
done unto a wydowe, or a lone womanne, that he has done ageynste me. Vidua,
duae, is a lone woman and a wydowe, whose husband is decesed: and because
women (especially such as have nohusbandes to help and defend them, from
injuries and wrongs) for the most part be nothing set by, but had in
contempt, and reputed as abiectes and vile persons, which no man cares for,
nor fereth to delude and mock, therefore he uses here that comparison and
example.

In the second Scene.
Omnem de me eiecit animum. He has cast all his mind away from me.

Quodnam ob facinus? For what act, deed, or trespass?

Quid ego tantum sceleris admisi miser? What so great and heinous trespace have
I perpetrate or done unhappy bodi that I am?

Vulgo id faciunt. They do it commonly, (as who should say) every body uses to
do this thing that I have done.

Scio tibi esse hoc grauius multo, ac durius. I know that this thing is to
the much more grievous and hard.

Ego haud minus aegre patior. I take the matter even as grievously.

Nescio, nec rationem capio. I know it not, nor I perceive nor understand not
the reason of it.

Tibi been ex animo uolo. I would the well with all my heart.

Hic patrem astare aiebas? Stood my father here, saydest thou?

Quid me incusas? Why blamest thou me? or why layeste thou fault or blame in
me?

Quicquid ego huius feci, tibi prospexi, et stultitiae tuae. What so ever I
have done in this matter, I did it to help the and thy folyshenes. Prospicere
is to look or to se unto, and to provide or shyft for.

Te uidi animo esse omisso. I saw or marked the to be of a negligente or
rechelesse mind. Omisso.i. negligenti. So in Adelphis. At enim metuas, ne ab
re sint omissiores paulo, Marye but percase thou wolte fear and cast peryls
that they should be negligent about their own profyt, and about getting
money to sustain them or to live by.

Vidi te, suauia in praesentia quae essent, prima habere, neque consulere in
longitudinem. I sal^e or marked the to set most by tho things which be
sweet, pleasant, and delectable for the while, and not to provide for any
space or long time to come.

Coepi rationem, ut neque egeres, neque haec posses perdere. I begone to take
such a way, that neither thou might be brought to poverty, need, or
penury, nor yet myghtest lose this that thou haste.

Eis commisi et credidi. I have committed and put all the matter to them.

Ibi tuae stultitiae semper crit praesidium. There shall be always a refuge and
place of succor for thy folyshenes.

Disperij, scelestus quantas turbas conciui insciens? I am undone ungracious
fellow that I am? how great troublous busynes have I procured vnwittynge?

Emori cupio. I would feign dye, or I would I were out of the world, or I would
gladly be out of my life.

Prius, queso, disce quid sit uiuere, ubi scies, si displicebit uita, tum
isthoc utitor. I pray the, first learn, what it is to live in deed, and after
that thou shalt know it, then if good life shall myslyke the, then use this
facion, that thou do now. Viuere, is here taken for secundum uirtutem
uiuere, to live after the rule of virtue. And uita here is taken for actus et
mores, as who should say, the life actife, moral, and virtuous. So in Phorm.
Quem ego in uita uidi optimum, Whom I have seen meruaylous good, honest, and
virtuous of living.

Quae ista est prauitas, quae ue amentia? What naughty facion is this, or what
madness?

Quod peccaui ego, id ob est huic. That that I have offended, hurts him here.

Ne te admisce. Meddle not thou in the matter. Nae an aduerbe of forbyddynge may
be joined with verbes of the imperatife mode, or of the subiunctife mode
indifferentely. Non in the same signification is joined with verbes of the
subiunctife mode only, and not of the imperative mode.

Nemo te accusat. No man accuses, blames, or appecheth the, or, no man
compleyneth on the.

Nec tu aram, tibi neque precatorem pararis. Neither take seynctuarie for the
matter, ne yet provide get or make any spokesman, peticioner, or intercessor
for the. Pararis for paraueris, per syncopen. And hit is the future tense of
the subiunctiue mode set for the imperative mode.

Nihil succenseo tibi. I am nothing angry with the.

Rogasse uellem unde mihi petere^ cibum. I would I had asked of him, where I
should require my meat and drink.

Nos abalienauit. He has given us over, or, he has cast us of, or, he has
forbeaden us his house.

Irrides in re tanta, neque me quicquam co^silio adiuuas? Do thou mock or
jest in so great a matter, nor helpest me nothing at all with thy counsel?

Ego dicam quod mihi in mentem, tu diiudica. I woll say that is in my mind,
and than judge thou. In mentem. s. uenir, or else in mentem. s. est for in mente
est, per antiptosin, albeit in the mergyn of Basyl imprintynge it is noted (as
founden read in some exempleries) not in mente^, but in mente est.

Inuenta est causa, qua te expellerent. There was a quarrel found, whereby they
might drive or thrust the out.

Est uerisimile. It is like so.

An tu ob hoc peccatum, esse illum iratum putas? Do thou suppose or think
that he is angry for this offense?

Non arbitror. I think not.

Nunc aliud specta. Now mark an other thing, or yet more over consider an
other thing. For I think nunc here to be taken for iam, which very often and
many times is taken for praeterea, insuper, ad haec, Furthermore besides all this. etc.

Matres omnes filijs in peccato adiutrices solent esse. Al mothers vsen or ben
wont to help their sons, when they done any faut.

Suspitionem istam ex illis quere. Dema^de of them and enquire the cause of

shalt anon move and bring them both to pity and compassion.

Recte suades. Thou gyuest me good counsaylle.

Sat recte hoc mihi in mentem uenit. This camme very well unto my mind or
remembrance.

Eum precatorem mihi paro. Him woll I get to be spokesman, peticioner, or
intercessour for me.

Seni nostro fidei nihil habeo. I trust our old man nere a deal, or I have
no trust or affiance at al in the old man my master.

In the third Scene.
Profecto, nisi caves tu homo, aliquid conficies mali. Undoubtedly, except
thou beware thou fellow, thou shalt work or bring up some myschife.

Miror quomodo tam ineptum quidquam potuerit tibi uenire in mentem. I marvel
how any so folyshe a thing could come unto thy mind.

Pergin' mulier esse? Wolt thou be a woman still? as who should say. Wolte
thou never leave thy woman's conditions?

Vllam ne ego rem unquam uolui, quin tu in ea re mihi aduersator fueris? Was I
ever minded or wyllyng to have done any thing, but that thou haste resisted and
been ageynste me therein? Terence in the text, speaking in the person of
Chremes unto Softrata being a woman, says aduersatrix.

Si rogitem iam, quid est quod peccem, aut quamobrem hoc faciam, nescias. If I
would now ask of the, what it is wherein I do amysse, or wherefore I do this
same, thou coudest not tell.

In qua re nu^c tam confidenter restas stulte? In what thing do thou now
withstand me, or strive, and strogle against me, so boldly, or so malopertly
folyshe fellow?

Iniquus es, qui me tacere de re tanta postules. Thou art unjust or unreasonable
that do require, or that would have me to hold my peace and say nothing,
in so great a matter.

Nihilo minus ego hoc faciam tamen. Yet nevertheless I will do this same.

Non uides quantum mali ex ea re excites? Do thou not se how much myschiefe
thou areasest thereby?

Subditum se suspicatur. He mystrusteth him self that he was some
chaungelynge. Subditum.i. subdititium uel suppositum. Suppositus, ta, tum, a
chaungelynge, or a child, that was changed in the cradle, and laid there for
the very true child. Iuuenalis. Transeo suppositos, I pass over and speak
nothing of chaungelynges, or such as were changed in their cradels, as we
say in englysh. Of the same signification is subdititius and here in this
place subditus.

Isthuc inimicis siet. Such chance come to our enemies.

Ego ne confitear meum non esse filium, qui sit meus? Should I confess, or say,
that he is not my son, which in deed is mine?

Quid metuis? What fear thou? or whereof art thou aferde?

Conuinces facile ex te natum, nam tui similis est probe. Thou shalt sone or
eathly prove him to be of thyn own body borne, for he is very like unto the of
conditions. Diverse grammaryans have noted, that similis when it governs a
datyfe case, betokens like in favor, and when it governs a genetyue, it
betokens like of manners and co^dicions. Which observation here in this and
other places (for the more part) is true, but yet not every where.

Illi nihil uitij est relictum, quin id itidem sit tibi. He has no fault or
vice left, but that thou haste even the same also.

Talem nulla nisi tu pareret filium. No woman alive could have brought forth
such a son, but thou. Here is the figure zeugma, of which it is diligently
noted a little before, and this same clause of Terence there recyted.

In the fourth Scene.
Si unquam ullum fuit tempus, cum ego uoluptati tibi fuerim, obsecro, eius ut
memineris. If ever there was any time, that you had any delight or pleasure in
me, I beseech you for goddis sake to call it to mind and remembrance.

Inopis te miserescat mei. Have thou pity or compassion upon me, being a pore
fellow, and without any manner help. For that signifies proprely inops.

Peto parents meos ut commonstres mihi. I desire you that you woll show unto
me my parents, or my father and mother.

Ne isthuc animum inducas tuum. Never think that.

Hoccine quesisti obsecro? Haste thou asked such a question of me I pray the?

Cave posthac, si me amas, unquam isthuc uerbum ex te audiam. Beware if thou
love me, that I never here that word of thy mouth again.

Cave mores posthac in te esse istos sentia^. Beware that I never se or
perceive to be in the again from henseforth such manners or behauour as thou
have used.

Si scire uis, ego dicam. If thou be willing or desirous to know, I wol tell
the.

Nostrum te esse credito. Think thy self to be our own son. So hit is
taken here in this place of Terence, but it may be englished in an other
sense, thus: Think thy self to be our own (as who should say) our friend and in
our good favor.

Non sunt haec parentis dicta. These be not mete words of a father to his
son.

Non, si ex capite sis meo natus itidem ut aiunt Mineruam esse ex Jove, ea
causa magis patiar flagitiis tuis me infamen fieri. Although thou were borne
out of my very heed even so, as they say that Minerua was born out of the heed
and brayn of Iuppiter, yet I wol not, any thing the rather for that cause,
suffer my self to be in infamy and obloquie of men, or to incur and run
in sclaunder of men, by reason of thy abhomynable vices or naughtye facions.
Flagitijs, is ablatiuus causae. Minerua is the goddess of wisdom, of artis
and sciences, and wars, and it is metaphoricalli taken sometimes for nature,
for wit, or for any art or science. Which things because they be high gifts
and only given by god, the poetis feign, that Minerua was the daughter of
Jupiter, and delivered or borne out of his own heed or brain. Whereof Lucianus
the greek poet has a very pretty dialoge in dialogis deorum superu^.

Dij isthaec prohibeant. The gods forbid or defend those things.

Ego, quoth potero, euitar sedulo. I wol do my busy labor as much as I shall be
able to do.

Quaeris id, quod habes, parents, quod abest, non queris, patri quomodo
obsequare, et ut serves, quod labor inuenerit. Thou sekest that, that thou
haste, that is to say, parents, or father and mother, but that that thou haste
not, but lackest, thou sekest not, that is to say, how thou may please thy
father, and how thou may keep that he has gotten with his labor.
Inuenerit.i. parauerit.

Pudet dicere hoc praesente. I am ashamed to speak it in the presence of this
man.

At te illud nullo modo facere puduit. But thou were never a whytte at all
asshamed to do that.

Eheu quam ego nunc totus displiceo mihi. Alas how angry I am with my self, or
how sorry I am. Displiceo mihi in latin speaking is sometimes used in a much
like sense, as we use to sey in english, I am half naught, as thus. I was
weary of trauailyng, or after my journey, and was half naught and more, De uia
fessus era^, mihique totus displiceba^.

Quam pudet. s. me. How greattely ashamed I am.

In the fyft Scene.
Enimuero nimis grauiter cruciat adolescentulum, minusque inhumane. Truly he
vexes the poor young man to soore, and to unkindly or vngentylly.

Exeo ut pacem conciliem. s. inter eos. I comme forth to make peace or
attonemente between them.

Cur non accersi iubes filiam. s. meam. Why do thou not beade or co^mande my
daughter to be sent for?

Mi uir te obsecro ne facias. Sweet husband I pray you for gods sake do not
so.

Pater obsecro mihi ignoscas. Father I beseech you for gods sake, forgive or
pardone me.

Da ueniam. s. mihi. Forgive or pardon me.

Sine te exorem. Let me entrete you. Exorare, est orando impetrare, to
obtain with prayinge.

Sciens no^ facia^. I wol not do it wyttingly.

Id nos no^ sinemus. I wol not suffer it. Nos for ego is much used modestiae
causa, but uos for tu may not be used, ne honoris quidem gratiae.

Si me uiuum uis pater, ignosce. s. mihi. Fader if you love my life, forgive or
perdon me.

Ne tam offirma te. Be not so styffe, or be not so cursed hearted. For that is
offirmare any mu^, albeit it is used sometimes in the good pert.

Ealege hoc faciam. I woll do the thing upon this condition.

Omnia faciam, impera. I woll do al things that you shall think good,
command me. Omnia faciam. s. quae tu censes aequu^ esse ut faciam, for that
went next before.

Ad me recipio. I undertake it.

Haec dum incipias grauia sunt, dumque ignores, ubi cognoris, facilia. Al these
things be hard, till a man has begone or is entered in them, and as long as he
knows them not, but after that he is ones acqueynted with them, they be light.

Rufam ne illam uirginem, caesiam, sparso ore, adunco naso, ducam? Shall I
marye that reed heeded, gray eyed, platerfaced, and hawkenosed wenche? Caesius,
a, um, and glaucus, ca, cum, is blew or gray, as the sky is when it has little
spleckes of gray clouds in a fair day, as it were a plumbet color. Of the
names of colors read Aul. Gel. l. 2. noct. attic. ca, 26. Sparso ore.i. largo,
lato, amplo, large, broad, and (as we use to say in scorn or derision)
platerfaced. Adunco naso.i. in curuo, crokynge or bowynge inward like as the
bil of an egle or of an hauk, and such we call in scorn or derision hawknoses.

Eia ut elegans est. Eih what a minion it is.

Quando quidem ducenda est, egomet habeo propemodum, quam uolo. Sens that I
must needs marye one, I my self have in manner found her that I woll have.

Nunc laudo te gnate. Now I began the thank son.

Perplacet. s. mihi. I am very well contented, or it pleases me very well.

Hoc nunc restat. This now remains.

Syro ignoscas uolo, quae mea caussa fecit. I would have you to perdon Syrus,
of tho things that he has done for my cause, or for my sake. Syro ignoscas.
s. ea quae, etc.
