The Intentions of the ARMY of the Kingdom of SCOTLAND, Declared to their
Brethren of ENGLAND: By the Commissioners of the late Parliament, and by the
GENERAL, Noblemen, Barons, and others, Officers of the ARMY.
THE best endeavors, and greatest works wherein the hand and providence of
God have been most evident and sensible, and the hearts and intentions of men
called to be the instruments most pious and sincere, though they found
approbation with the wiser sort, and such as are given to observation, yet they
have ever been subject to be misconstrued by blind suspicion, to be reproved by
cavilling censure, which makes place for it self to enter where it finds
none, and to be condemned of the ignorant, and of such as are at ease, but most
of all of the malicious, who can not be pleased even when God is best pleased,
and when men seek to approve themselves to eevery ones conscience; But in their
hearts wish rather that the Temple should not be built, Religion never
reformed, and they themselves coutch betwixt the two burdens, then that they
should be in their worldly projects or possessions opposed or troubled. The
deliverance of the people of God of old from the Egyptian servitude; The
redemption of the Kirk by the Son of God, and the planting of Christian
Religion by his servants, and the vindication of Religion from Romish
superstition and tyranny, which are the greatest and most wonderful works of
GOD, have been most bitterly calumniated, and spitefully spurned against by the
wicked.

The nature and quality of this great Work, wherein the Lord has honored us
to be Agents, and the experience which we have found of continual opposition,
since the beginning, may teach us, if we be not as the horse and muse which
have no understanding, that we are to expect the gainsaying of sinners; and
that nothing can be hatched in hell by Satan, or prompted by his Supposts on
Earth, which will not be produced to make us and the cause of God, which we
maintain odious to all men, but most of all to our Neighbors and dearest
Brethren. When we shall now enter into England, it will be laid to our charge,
that we mind nothing but invasion, and that no less has been intended by us
from the beginning, then under the pretext of seeking our Religion and
Liberties, to enrich our selves with their possessions and goods: But our
peaceable carriage many years past, before the time of those late troubles,
our Informations, Declarations, and Remonstrances published to the world,
wherein we have cursed all National invasion, and our willingness when we
were in Arms, to lay them down upon the smallest assurances of enjoying our
Religion and Liberties, will be conceived by the wise and well affected, to be
more plain and sure evidences of our meaning, then all that malice can devise,
or calumny can express against us.

Neither have any new emergents altered, but rather confirmed our former
resolutions. for although both before and since the late pacification, we have
been highly injuried by some Papists, and Prelates, and their adherents there,
who have been, and are still seeking no less then that we should no more be
a Kirk or a Nation, and therefore themselves can not think, but we must
account of them as Gods enemies and ours; yet above all the favors we have
received from the good people and Body of the Kingdom of England, One there
is, which has highly honored them before the world, and endeered them unto us
more then before, which shall never be forgotten by us, and we hope shall be
thankfully remembered by our Children, and Childrens Children after us, to all
generations; That when upon misinformation, the Council of England had
concluded to use force against us, when the Parliament of Ireland had offered
their Persons and Estates for supply against us, when all plots and policies
were set on work, and public Declarations by authority were made, and the
Parliament called for this very end, when we had been traduced and proclaimed
as traitors and rebels at every Paroch Kirk* yet so wise, so grave, so just
was that High Court of Parliament (to their everlasting honor be it remembered)
that no threatenings, nor fears, nor promises, nor hopes, could moove them to
decerne a War, or grant any Subsidy for a War against us; but rather by
their speeches, complaints, and grievances parallel to ours, did justify the
Cause which we defend.

This rich and recent favor does so bind our hearts, that were our power
never so great, we should judge our selves the unworthiest of all men, and
could look for no less then vengeance from the righteous GOD, if we should
moove hand or foot against that Nation, so comfortably to us represented in
that honorable meeting. In this our than full acknowledgment, we desire that
the City of London may have their own large share, as they well deserve by the
noble proofs they have given of their constant affection to Religion, and the
peace of both Kingdoms, notwithstanding the continual assaults of the
mis-leaders of King and Court living amongst them, and always sounding the
trumpet of Sedition in their ears: And if this which does so convince us,
shall not be thought sufficient to satisfy all the good people of England,
We now before GOD and the world, make offer in general, and will make offer
to so many of them as will require it in particular, of the strongest and most
inviolable bond of our solemn Oath and religious attestation of the great Name
of GOD, who is our fear and our dread, and from whom we hope for a blessing
upon our Expedition, that we intend no enimitie or rapine, and shall take no
man's goods, nor engage our selves in blood by fighting, unless we be forced
unto it, which we may look for from the Papists, Prelates, and others of that
faction; but that any such thing shall come from godly men, or good patriots
who love the truth of Religion, or the Kings honor, and their own Liberty,
both the rule of charity, which entertaineth no suspicion, where there is no
evill-deserving, and the rule of wisdom, which teaches, that both Nations
must now stand or fall together, do forbid us to apprehend.

All the design of both Kingdoms is, for the truth of Religion, and for the
just Liberty of the Subject; and all the devices and doings of the enemy are
for oppressing of both, that our Religion may be turned into Superstition and
Atheism, and our Liberty into base servitude and bondage: To bring this to
pass, they have certainly conceived, that the blocking up of this Kingdom by
Sea and Land, would prove a powerful and infallible mean: for either within
a very short time shall we through want of trade, and spoiling of our goods,
be brought to such extremity, poverty, and confusion, that we shall miserably
desire the conditions which we now despise and declyne, and be forced to
embrace their will for a Law, both in Kirk and Policy, which will be a
precedent for the like misery in England, taught by our example to be more
wise. Or upon the other part, we shall by this invasion be constrained
furiously, and without order, to break into England, which we believe is their
more earnest desire, because a more speedy execution of their design: For we
doubt not but upon our coming, clamours will be raised, posts sent, and
Proclamations made through the Kingdom, to slander our pious and just
intentions, as if this had been our meaning from the beginning, To stir up
all the English against us, that once being entered in blood, they may with
their own swords, extirpat their own Religion, lay a present foundation with
their own hands for building of Rome, in the midst of them, and be made the
authors both of their own and our slavery, to continue for ever.

But in this admirable opportunity of vindication of true Religion and just
Liberty, if divine providence be looked upon with a reverent by, and men
fearing GOD, and loving the Kings honor, and peace of both Kingdoms, shall
walk worthy of their Profession, although the enemies have obtained so much of
their desires, as by coards of their own twisting to draw us into England, yet
may their maine design be disappointed, the rope which they have made, brought
upon their own necks, and their wisdom turned into foolishnes, which we have
reason to hope for from that Supreme wisdom and power, which has in all the
proceedings of this Work, turned their devices upon their own pates that
plotted them.

In our Informations, Remonstrances, and the True Representation of our
proceeding; since the late pacification, we have so far expressed the wrongs
which we have sustained, and the distresses which we suffer, as may make
manifest our pressing necessity, to take some other course for our present
relief, then such Petitions, Supplications, and Commissions, as we have used
before, with less success, then could have been expected of a Kingdom from
their own native King. Before we stirred so much as with a Petition, we
endured for many years, not only the perpetual opposition of the truth and
power of Religion by Prelates and Papists, but also the violation of all our
Liberties, and almost the total subversion of our Religion, which was our
comfort in the sight of God, and the glory of this Nation in the sight of other
Kirkes, who by the testimony of their Divines, made our Reformation the measure
of their wishes, and would have redeemed it with their greatest worldly losses.
When gross Popery was notoriously obtruded upon us in the books of Canons and
Common prayer, without consent or knowledge of the Kirk, and the plot of the
Prelates and Papists wholly discovered, how to settle it in both Nations, we
added to our former sufferings, no other Arms but Prayers and tears unto GOD:
and Petitions unto our King, which were utterly rejected; The books and
corruptions against which we petitioned, highly exalted, and by the insolent
advice of those who govern now his Counsels, and labor to establish their
own evil acquired greatness, upon our oppression, and the ruins of our
Religion and Liberties, we were forbidden to insist, under the pain of high
Treason. When we found our selves thus opposed and borne down, still
insisting in our humble desires, we solemnly renewed our National Oath and
Covenant, for preserving of our Religion and Liberties, and of his Majesty's
authority, knowing the violation of that Oath, to be the guiltiness which had
procured our woes, and that our repentance and turning to GOD, were the means
by his blessing for good success. When contrary to our deserving and
expectation, His Majesty was moved by wicked counsel, to march toward us with
an Army, we were very soon pleased, and choosed rather to neglect such courses,
as might serve for our humane safety, then to fall in seeming disobedience to
our King, Or to give the smallest distaste to our dear Brethren in England: And
therefore disbanded our Forces, delivered all holds which were craved in
testimony of our obedience: and so far complied with his Majesty's pleasure,
that notwithstanding the determination of our lawful former Assembly called by
his Majesty, we were contented that a new free Assembly and Parliament should
be appointed, where all things both concerning our Religion and Liberties,
might again be considered and established. When matters Ecclesiastical were
determined in the Assembly, according to the constitutions of the Kirk, in the
presence, and with the consent of his Majesty's Commissioner, and the
Parliament was conveened for perfecting the Work, although we walked therein
so warily, that no just provocation was given to his Majesty, yet contrary to
the Laws and custom of this Kingdom, the Parliament so certainly promised,
when his Majesty was free of those bad Counselors, was by their evil advyce
prorogued; which, to show our invincible obedience, we were content to suffer,
and did sent up our Commissioners to London, to render the reasons of our
demands. When our Commissioners and Petitions of the Parliament, called by his
Majesty, were so far rejected, that they were never seen nor heard, we send
up our Commissioners again with our Propositions, which contained nothing but
what was necessary for the good and peace of the Kingdom, and was granted unto
us before, under his Majesty's hand, yet could they find no answer at all,
which will be wondered at, and hardly believed by so many as are strangers at
Court, and know not that the Bishop of Canterbury, and the Lieutenant of
Ireland, with the assistance of the too too powerful Faction of the Papists,
labor to show their zeal for his Majesty's greatness, by the oppressing the
just Liberties of the Subjects, and the Reformed Religion in all the three
Kingdoms. But in place of the gracious answer which we expected, Our
Commissioners were restrained, and one of the Noblemen imprisoned; Garrisons of
strangers set over our heads, in an insolent and barbarous way, exercising
their cruelty even against women and children; Our ships and goods taken and
sunk, and the Owners stripped naked, and more inhumanely used at the
commandment of abused authority by the subjects of our own King, then by
Turks and Infidels. And great Armies prepared against us, with a terrible
Commission to subdue and destroy our selves, our Religion, Liberties, Laws and
all.

In this extremity for us to send new Commissioners or Petitions, were against
sense and experience; those that govern the Kings Counsels being far from any
inclination or intention to satisfy the just desires and grievances of the
Subjects, as they have made manifest by breaking up of the Parliaments in both
Kingdoms. To sit still in senselessness and stupiditie, waiting for our own
destruction at the discretion of our merciless enemies (which were it not at
this time joined with the cause of God, would move us the less) is not only
against Religion, but Nature; teaching and commanding us to study our own
preservation. To endure continual threatenings, and so great hostility and
invasion from year to year, which is the professed policy of our enemies, is
impossible; and when we have examined our own Strength, more then we are able
to bear. We have therefore after much agitation and debating, with, and
amongst our selves, resolved to have our proceedings, which have been canvassed
by so many, and brought to some point of determination in our own Parliament,
to be better known to the Kings Majesty, and the world, and especially to the
Kingdom of England, that against all false and artificial relations, they
being nakedly seen to be what they are, we may obtain a better grounded and
more durable peace, for enjoying of our Religion and Laws: and as we desire
the unworthy authors of our troubles, who have come out from our selves, to be
tried at home, and Justice to be done upon them, according to our own Laws:
So shall we press no further process against these pernicious Counselors
in England, the authors of all the miseries of both Kingdoms, then what their
own Parliament shall decerne to be their just deserving.

When we look back upon this Work of Reformation from the beginning, and
perceive the Impressions of the providence of God in it, we are forced in the
midst of all our difficulties and distresses, to bless God for his Fatherly
care and free love to this Kirk and Kingdom, and to take courage and spirit to
proceed in patience and perseverance, whither he shall go before us, and lead
us on. When the Prelates were grown by their rents and lordly dignities, by
their power over all sorts of his Majesty's Subjects, Ministers, and others, by
their places in Parliament, Council, College of Justice, Exchequer, and high
Commission, to an absolute dominion and greatness, and setting their one foot
on the Kirk, and the other on the State, were become intollerably insolent,
even then did the Work begin, and this was the Lords opportunity. The
beginnings were small, and promised no great thing, but have been so seconded
and continually followed by Divine providence, pressing us from step to step,
that the necessity was invincible, and could not be resisted. It cannot be
expressed what motions filled the hearts, what tears were powered forth from
the eyes, and what cries came from the mouths of many thousands in this Land
at that time, from the sense of the love and power of God, raising them as from
the dead, and giving them hopes after so great a deluge and vastation, to see a
new world, wherein Religion and Righteousness should dwell* When we were many
times at a pause, and knew not well what to do, the fears, the furies, the
peevishness, and the plots also of our dementat adversaryes, opened the ways
unto us, and taught us how to proceed; and what they devised to ruin us,
served most against themselves, and for raising and promooving the Work.
Although neither Council, nor Session, nor any other Judicature, has been all
this time sitting, and there have been meetings of many thousands, at some
times, yet have they been kept without tumult or trouble, and without excess
or riot, in better order, and greater quietness, then in the most peaceable
times has been found in this Land. When we were content at the pacification,
to lay down Arms, and with great loss, to live at home in peace, our wicked
enemies have been like the troubled Sea when it cannot rest, whose waters cast
up mire and dirt, and will have us to do that which it seems the Lord has
decreed against them. The purity of our Intentions f^rre from base and earthly
respects: The bent and inclination of our hearts in the midst of many dangers:
The fitting of instruments, not only with a desire and disposition, but with
spirit and ability to overcome opposition, and the constant peace of heart
accompanying us in our ways, which bears us out against all accusations and
aspersions, are to us strong grounds of assurance, that GOD has accepted our
work, and will not leave us. We know that the Lord may use even wicked men
in his servic^, and may fill their sails with a fair gale of abilities, and
carry them on with a strong hand, which should make us to search our hearts the
more narrowly: But as this ought not to discourage his own faithful servants,
who out of love to his Name, intend his honor, walk in his ways, find his
peace* comforting them, his providence directing them, and his prefence
blessing them in their affairs; So it cannot be any just ground of quarrelling
against the work of GOD.

Yet all those our encouragements, which have upholden our hearts in the midst
of many troubles, could not make our ^ntry into England warrantable, if our
peace, which we earnestly seek and follow after, could be found at home, or
elsewhere. Where it is to be found, we must seek after it; and no sooner shall
we find it, but by laying down our Arms, and by the evidences of our
peaceable disposition, we shall make it manifest to the world, and especially
to the Kingdom of England, that we are seeking nothing else, and that our
taking up of Arms, was not for invasion, but for defense. No man needs to
plead by positive Law for necessity: it is written in every man's heart by
Nature, and in all Nations we find men have received it by practice; That
Necessity is a Soveraignitie, a Law above all Laws, is subject to no Law, and
therefore is said to have no Law: where Necessity commands, the Laws of
Nature and Nations give their consent, and all positive Laws are silent and
give place. This Law has place sometimes to excuse, sometimes to extenuat, and
sometimes to justify and warrant actions otherwise questionable. And no
greater necessity can be, then the preservation of Religion which is the Soul;
of the Country which is the Body; of our Lyves who are the members, and of the
honor of the King who is the Head: All those at this time are in a common
hazard, and to preserve and secure all, we know no other way under the Sun
(and if any man be so wise as to know it, we desire to hear it, and shall be
ready to follow it) but to take order with our common enemies, where they may
be found, and to seek our assurance where it may be given. The question is not,
whether we shall content our selves with our own poverty, or enrich our selves
in England, that question is impious and absurd. Neither is the question
whether we shall defend our selves at home, or invade our Neighbors and
dearest Brethren, this also were unchristian and unreasonable: But this is the
question, whether it be wisdom and piety to keep our selves within the Borders
till our throats be cut, and our Religion, Laws, and Country be destroyed: Or
shall we bestirre our selves, and seek our Safeguard, Peace and Liberty in
England: whether we shall do or dye; whether we shall go and live, or abide
and perish: Or more largely to express all, whether we who are not a few
private persons, but a whole Kingdom, shall lie under the burden of so many
accusations, as scarcely in the worst times have been intended against
Christians, Receive the Service book, and the whole body of Popery, Embrace
the Prelates, and their abjured Hierarchy, Renounce our solemn Oath and
Covenant, so many times sworn by us, lose all our labors and pains in this
Cause, and forget our former slavery and wonted desires of redemption at the
dearest rate, Tickle the minds of our enemies with joy, and strengthen their
hands with violence, and fill the hearts of our friends with sorrow, and their
faces with shame, because of us, Deserte and dishonor the Son of God, whose
Cause we have under-taken, whose Banner we have displayed, and whose Truth
and Power has been this time past, more comfortable unto us, then all that the
peace and prosperity of the world could have rendered, and draw upon our selves
all the Judgments which GOD has executed upon Apostates since the beginning;
Or shall we fold our hands, and wait for the perfect slavery or our selves,
and our posterity, in our Souls, Bodies, and Estates, and (which is all one)
foolishly to stand to our defense, where we know it is impossible; Or shall we
seek our relief in following the calling of GOD, (for our necessity can be
interpreted to be no less and entering by the door which his providence has
opened unto us, when all ways are stopped beside?

Our enemies at first did shroud themselves so far with the Kings authority,
that they behooved to stand and fall together, and that to censure them, was
treason against the King. But we have shown, that the Kings Crown is not tied
to a Prelates Mitre; and that the one may be cast unto the ground, and the other
have a greater luster and glory then before. Now they take themselves to
another starting hole, and would have men think, that to come in to England,
and to pursue them, although legally, is to invade the Kingdom where they
live; As if the cutting away of an excrescence, or the curing of an Impostume,
were the killing of the Body. Let them secure themselves under the shelter of
their own fantasies; But we are not so undiscerning, as like mad men, to run
furiously upon such as they first meet with, and come in their way. For
although it cannot be denied, but the wrongs done unto us; as the breaking of
the late Peace, Crying us down as rebels and traitors, The taking of our ships
and goods, The imprisoning of our Commissioners, The acts of hostility done by
the English in our Castles: Had they been done by the State or Kingdom of
England, they might have been just causes of a National quarrelling: Yet
since the Kingdom of England, conveened in Parliament, have refused to
contribute any supply against us, have shown themselves to be pressed with
grievances like unto ours, have earnestly pleaded for redress and remedy, and
a Declaration made, that his Majesty our of Parliament will redress them,
which might be a cure for the grievances of particular Subjects, but National
grievances require the hand of the Parliament for their cure* for preventing
whereof, the Parliament was broken up and dissolved. Neither do we quarrel
with the Kingdom for the Injuries which we sustain* nor can they quarrel with
us, for taking order with that prevalent Faction of Papists and Prelates, the
Authors of so many woes to both Nations, let all who love Religion and their
liberty join against the common enemies, and let them be accursed who shall not
seek the preservation of their Neighbor Nation, both in Religion and Laws, as
their own, as knowing that the ruin of one, will prove the ruin of both.

And as we attest the God of Heaven and Earth, that those and no other are our
Intentions; so upon the same greatest attestation do we declare, That for
atchieving those ends, we shall neither spare our pains, fortunes, nor lyves,
which we know cannot be more profitably and honorably spent: That we shall not
take from our Friends and Brethren, from a thread even to a shoe latchet, but
for our own moneys, and the just payment, that we come amongst them as their
Friends and Brethren, very sensible of their bypast sufferings and present
dangers, both in Religion and Liberties, and most willing to do them all the
good we can. Like as we certainly expect, that they from the like sense of our
hard condition, and intolerable distresses, which has forced us to come from
our own Country, will join and concur with us, in the most just and noble
ways, for obtaining our just desires: And when our own moneys and means are
spent, we shall crave nothing but upon sufficient surety of repayment, how soon
possibly it can be made, what is necessary for the entertainment of our Army,
which we are assured so many as love Religion, and the peace of both
Kingdoms, will willingly offer, as that which they know we cannot want, and in
their wise foresight will provide the way to furnish necessaries, and to
receive the surety. This course being kept by both sides, will neither harm
our Brethren, for they shall be satisfied to the least farthing; nor our
selves, who look for a recompense from the rich providence of God, for whose
sake we have hazarded the loss of all things. The escapes of some Soldiers
(if any shall happen) we trust shall not be imputed unto us, who shall labor by
all means to prevent them more carefully, and to punish the^ more severely,
then if done to our selves, and in our own Country. Our professed enemies the
Papists and Prelates, with their adherents, and the receipters of their goods
and geir, we co^ceive will be more provident, then to refuse us necessary
sustentation, when they remember what counsel was given by them, for declaring
all our Possessions to be forfeited, and to be disposed of to them, as well
deserving Subjects. We shall demand nothing of the Kings Majesty, but the
settling and securing of the true Religion, and Liberties of this Kingdom,
according to the Constitutions and Acts of the late Assemblies, and Parliament,
and what a just Prince owes by the Laws of God and the Country, to his
grieved Subjects, coming before him with their humble desires and
supplications. Our abode in England shall be for no longer time, then in their
Parliament our just grievances and complaints shall be heard and redressed,
sufficient assurance given for the legal trial and punishment of the Authors
of our evils, and for enjoying of our Religion and Liberties in peace, against
the invasion of their Countrymen. Our returning thereafter shall be with
expedition, in a peaceable and orderly way, far from all molestation; and we
trust the effect shall be against Papists the extirpation of Popery, against
Prelates the Reformation of the Kirk, against Atheists the flourishing of the
Gospel, and against Traitors and firebrarnds, a perfect and durable Union and
Love between the two Kingdoms: which, he grant who knows our intentions and
desires, and is able to bring them to pass. And if any more be required, God
will reveal it, and go before both Nations; and if he go before us, who will
not follow, or refuse to put their necks to the Work of the Lord?

FINIS.
