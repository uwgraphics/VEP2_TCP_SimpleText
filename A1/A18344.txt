^His play fond a philosopher of theeyent which was named in caldee Eversee
or in gre^e philemetor which is as much to say in englissh as he that ^ouyth
Justice and mesure / And this philosopher was renomed greatly among the greeks
and them of Athenes which were good clerkys and philosophers also renomed of
their connyng / This philosopher was so Just and true that he had lever dye /
than to live long and be a falls flaterer with the said king / For when he
beheld the soul and sy^ful life of the king. And that no man durst blame him
For by his great cruelte he put them al to death that if plesid him. He put him
self in parel of death and ^^iryd and ^^eo^ rather to dye than longer to live.
The evil life and disfamed of a king is the life of a cruel best. and ought not
long to be sustained / for he destroys him that displesith him. And therefore
reherceth valerius. that there was a wise man named theodore (...) whom his
king did to hang on the cross for as much as he repteuyd him of his evil and
foul life / and alwey as he was in the torment he said to the king. Upon thy
counceyllours and them that been clad in thy clothyng and w^y^ were more reason
that this torment should come^ for as much as they d^^ not say to the the
troth for to do Iustyse rightwyslye of my self I make no force whether I dye
on the land or on the water or otherwise / As who says he retched not to dye
for Justice. In like wise as democreon the philosopher put out his own eyes by
cause he would not see that no good might come to the evil and vycious people
with cut right / And also desortes the philosophre as he went toward his death.
His wife that followed after him said that he was dayned to ^th wrongfully the^n^
he answered and said to her^ hold thy pees and be stylle hit is better and more
meritorye to dye by a strong and vnrightful Judgment / than that I had deserved
to dye.

The third chappitre of the first tractate treteth wherefore the play was
founden and maad Capitulo iij


THe causes wherefore this play was founden ben in The first was for to
correct and repreue the king for when this styng enylmerodach saw this play*
And the barons. knights. and gentilmen of his court play with the philosopher
/ he merueylled greatly of the beau^^e and noueltee of the play. And desired to
play against the philosopher / The philosopher answered and said to him that
hit might not be done / but if he first served the play The king said hit was
reason and that he would put him to the pain to learn hit / Than the philosopher
began to each him / and to show him the manner of the table / of the hesse
lord / and the chesse meyne. And also the manners and the condycions of a king
of the nobles and of the common people and of their offices / and how they should
be touchyd and drawn / And how he should amend him self / and become virtuous
/ and when / this king herd that he repreuyd him / he demanded him upon pain
of death to less him wherefore he had founden and maad this play / and he
answered my right dear lord and king. the grettest and most thing that I desire
is that thou have in thy self a glorious and virtuous life. And that may I not
see / but if thou be endoctrined and well manerd and that had. so may thou
bebelo^yd of thy people. Thus than I desire that thou have other government
then thou have had. and that thou have upon thy self first seign^urie and
maistrie such as thou have upon other by force / and not by right / Certeynly
hit is not right that a man be master over other and comalidour when he can
not rewle ne^ may rewle him self / and that his virtues domyne above his vices
/ for seignourie by force and will may not long endure / Then thus may thou
see don of the causes why and wherefore I have founden and maad this playt.
which is for to correct and repreue the of thy tyranny and vicious living.
for all kings ought specially to here her corrigiours or correctours / and her
correccions to hold and keep in mind. In like wise as valerius reherceth that
the king alixandre had a noble and renomed knight that said in repreuyng of
Alixandre that he was to much covetous / and in especial of the honors of the
world / And said to him if the gods had maade thy body as great as is thy
he^^e. All the world (...) not hold the for thou hold in thy right h^nd al
t^^ ^^yent / and in thy lift hand the o^cedent. since than het is ^o or thou
art a god / or a man / or naught. if thou be god. do than well and good / to
the people / as god does and take not from them / that they ought to have / and
i^ theyres. If thou be a man / think that thou shall dye. and than thou shall
do^^oon evil / if thou be naught / forgete thy self. There is no thing so
strong and ferme. but that sumtyme / a feeble thing casts down and overthrow
hit. How well that the lion be the strengest be / yet sometime a lityl by^de
e^eth him / The second cause wherefore this play was founden and maad. was for
to keep him from idleness / whereof seneque says unto lucylle ydlenes without
any ocupacion is sepulture of a man living / and varro says in his sentences
that in like wise as men goo not for to goo / the same wise the life is not
given for to live but for to do well and good. and therefore secondly the
philosopher fond this play for to keep the people from ydlenes / for there is
much people when so is that they be fortunat in worldly goods that they draw
them to ease and ydlenes whereof comyth often times many evil is and gret^
sins / and by this ydlenes the herd is quenchyd whereof comyth good
desperacion. The third cause is that every man naturelly desires to know and
here nouelteets and tidings. for this cause they of Athenes studied as we read
/ and for as the corporal or bodily sight enpessheth and lets otherwhyle
the knowleche of subtyl things. Therefore we read that democrite the (...) put
out his often ^yn / For as much as he (...) have the ^^li^e en^^^d^ment and
vnderst^ndyng ^^ng have been ma^e blind that were great c^e^^is in (...) wise
as has dedimus bishop of o^^^andrie. that how well that he fa^^e not. yet he
was so great a clerk / that gregore nazciz and saint Jerome that were clerks
and mayst^^^ to other came for to be his soo^es and lernyd of him. And saint
anthonye the great her^yce a^m for defre him on a time and among all other
things / he demanded him if he were not greatly dysplesid that he was blind
and saw not. and by answered / that he was greatly abashed for that he supposid
not that he was not displeasid in that he had lost his sight / and saint
anthonye answered to him I m^^uaise much that hit displesith the that thou have
lost that thing which is common between the and bestes and thou know well
that thou have not lost that thing that is common between the and the aungellis
/ And for thise causes foresaid the philosopher intended to put a wey al
pensifne^ and thoughts. and do think only on this play as shall be said and
appear in this / book after

(...) first chapter tre^eth of (...) and of (...) estate Capitulo (...)


TThe king must be thus maad for he must syt^e in a chaye^ clothyd in purpure
/ c^^^ed on his heed in his right hond a ceptre and in the lift ^onde on apple
of gold / for he is the most grettest and highest in dygnyte as love al other
and most w^ethy. And that is signyfyed by the ^^^one. for the glory of the
people is the dygnyte of the King / and above al other the king ought to be
replenysshed with virtues and of grace. and this signyfieth the purpure. For in
like wise as the ro^ee of purpure makes fair and en^e^^ssheth the body. the
same wise virtues makyth that ^owle / he ought alwey thynk on the government
of the royame and who has thadmynyst (...) of Justice / and this should he by
him self pryncipally / This signefyeth the appel of gold that he holds in
his fifth hand / and for as much as it aperteyneth unto him ^ punysshe the
rebels has he the septre in his right hand. And for as much as mysericorde
and troth conserve and stepe the king in his trowne / Therefore ought a king to
be merciful and debonayr for when a king or prince desires or will be beloved
of his people let him be governed by debonayrde And vilerius says that
deboneyrte percyth the hertes of strangers / and amolissheth and makyth soft
the hertes of his enemies. whereof he reher^th that phylostratus that was due of
athenes had a daughter. whom a man louyd so ordantly that on a time as he saw
her with her mother suddenly he came and kyssed her. whereof the mother was so
angry and sorouful that she went and required of her lord the due / that his
heed might be smyten of. The prince answered to her and said if we should slay
them that love us. What shall we do to our enemies that hate us. Certainly this
was the answer of a noble and debonayr prince that suffered that vylonye ^^on to
his daughter and to him self yet more. This prince had also a friend that was
^^med arispe that said on a time as much vylonye unto the prince as any man
might say. And that might not suffyse him. but he ^^atchid him in the vysage.
the prynes suffryd him patiently in such wise as though he had done to him no
vylonye but curtesye. And when his sonees wels have auengyd this vylonye. he
commanded the^ (...) so to dodo / The next day (...) of the right great vylonye
that he had (...) lord without cause / He fyl in dyspay^ and (...) him self /
when the due knew and vnderst^^^e (...). he came to him and said ne doubt the
no thing. and ^^re to him by his faith / that also well he was and s^^^ he his
friend fro the^ forthon as ever he had been before if he would / and thus he
respited him of his death by his de^onayte / and in likewise read we of the king
pirre to whom was reported that they of tarente had said great vilonye of him
for which cause he maad al them to come tofore him and demanded of them if
they had so said. than one of them answered and said / if the wyn and the
candellis had not failed / this langage had been but a Iape. in regard of that
we had thought to have done / Than the king began to law^e. For they had
confessyd that such langage as was said and spoken was by dronkenshyp / And
for this cause of debonayrte the people of tarente took for a custom that the
dronken men should be punysshid / and the sobre men preysed / The king then
thus ought to love humy^i^de and have falsyte after the holy scripture that
speaks of every man generally. For the king in his royame represents god and
god is ^rite. and therefore him ought to say no thing but if hi^ were vecry^able
and stable / Valerius reherceth that Alyxandre with all his doste rood for to
destroy a cite which was named lapsate / When than a phylosophre which had to
name anaxymenes which had been tofore maistre and governor of alixa^dre herd
and understood of hes coming / came again alixander to desire and (...) of him.
And when he sow alixander he supposed to have ^^yd his request. Alixander
broke his demand tofore and swore to him to sort he axid any thing by his

Alixander understood his desire and the oath that he such maad. he suffrid the

A king also ought to hate all cruelte / For we read that never dyed yet any
preious person of evil death. ne cruel person of good death Therefore recounteth
Valerius that there was a man named therise a werkman in metalle / that maad a
b^ole of coppre and a lityl wyket on the side whereby men might put in them that
should be brent therein And hit was maad in such manner. that they that should be
put and enclosyd therein should cry no thing like to the voys of a man but of
an ox.

And this maad he by cause men should have the less pity of them / When he had
maad this boole of copper. he presentyd hit unto a king which was called
philarde that w^^ so cruel a tyrant that he def^^ed in no thing but in

so maad him to go in to the boole and dye an evil does. Therefore says ou^de
there is no thing more reasonable then that a man dye of such death an he
purchases unto other. Also the king ought sou^^raynly keep Justice / who

and this was he that afterward was a good prince and a good Iusticier / The
king ought to be soue mynly chaste / and this signefyeth a queen that is oonly

The second chapitre of the second book and treteth of the form and manners of
the queen capitulo secundo


tHus ought the queen be maad / She ought to be a fair lady sittyng in a chayer
and crowned with a cowne on her heed and cladde with a cloth of gold and a
mantel above furrid with ^rmynes. and she should sit on the fifth side of the
king for the amplexions and enbrasynges of her husbond like as it is said in
Scripture in the Canticles. her lift arm shall be (...) heed and her right
arm shall beclyppe and enbrace me. In that she is set on his lift side is by
grace geuyn to the king by nature and of right. For better is to have a king
by succession then by eleccion / For often times the electoure and chosers
can not ne will not accord / And so is the eleccion left / And otherwhyle
they chese not the best and most able and conuenyent / But him that they best
love / or is for them most proffytable /

But when the king is by liguage and by true succession. He is caught
enseygned and norisshyd in his yougth all good and vertuou^^ ^^tches and manners
of his fader. And also the princes of the royame dar not so hardyly m^ue war
against a king having a sone for to reign after him / and so a queen ought to
be chaste wise. of honest life. well manerd and not Curious in norysshyng of her
children / Her wysedom ought not only to appear in fait and works / but also
in spekyng that is to wete that she be secret and tell not such things as
ought to be holden secret.

Wherefore it is a common proverb that women can keep no counceyl / And
acoordyng thereto Macrobe reherceth in the book of the dremes of Scypyo. That
there was a child of rome that was named papirus that on a time went with his
fader which was a senator in to the chamber where as they held their
counceyl. And that time they spoke of such matters as was commanded and agreed
should be kept secret upon pain of their hedes and so departed / And when he
was come^ home from the senatoyre and fro the counceyl with his fader / His
mother demasided of him what was the counceyl and whereof they spoke and had
tarried so long there / And the child answered to her and said he durst not
tell nor say hit for so much as hit was defended upon pain of death / Then
was the mother more desirous to know than she was to fore / And began to
flate^e him one time / And afterward to menace him that he should say and tell
to her what it was / And when the child saw that he might have no rest of
his mother in no wise / He made her first promise that she should fiere hit
secret. And to tell (...) to noon of the world And that done / he feyned a
lesing or a lie and said to her / that the Senators had in counceyl a great
question and dyfference which was this / whether hit were better and more for
the common well of Rome. that a man should have two wives / Or a wife to have two
b^s^^ondys / And when she had understand this / He defended her that she should
tell hit to none other body / And after this she went to her gossyd and told
to her this counceyll secretly. And she told to another. And thus every wife
told hit to other in secrete^r thus hit happend anon after that all the
wives of Rome came to the senatoyre where the senators were assemblyd and cried
with an high voys. that they had lever / And also hit were better for the common
well that a wife should have two husbondys than a man two wives / The senators
heeryng this were gretely abashed and wist not to say / nor what / nor how to
answer. till at last that the child papire reherced to them all the caas and
fayt how hit was happend. And when the senators herd and understood the matter
they were gretely ahasshyd / and co^mendyd greatly the Ingenye and wit of the
child that so wisely contryued the lie rather than he would discouere their
counceyl. And forth with made him a senator / and establisshed and ordained
fro than forthon that no child in any wise should enter in to the cou^ceyl hows
among them with their ^^ers except papitus^ whom they would that he should
aswey be among them. Also a queen ought to be chaste For as she is above al
other in estate and reverence. So should she be ensaumple unto al other in her
living honest lie / whereof Jerome reherceth against Ionynyan. that there was a
gentyl man of rome named duele^ and this man was he that first fond the manner
to fight on the water / and had first the victory / This duele had to his wife
one of the best women and so chaste. that every woman might take ensaumple of
her / and at that time the sin of the flesh was the grettest sin that any
might do against nature / And this said good woman was named ylie. And so hit
happend that this duele becam so old that he stowped and quaked for age. and
on a time one of his aduersayres repreuyd and reprochyd him saying that he had
a stynkyng breeth. And forth with he went home to his wife al angry and abashed
/ and ^yed her why and wherefore she had not told his defaute to him that he
might have founden remedy to have been pourgyd thereof and she answered that as
for as much as she supposyd that every man had the same fault as well as he /
For she kyst never any man's mouth but her husbondes. O much was this woman
to be praised and have a synguler lawde wenyng that this defaute had not ben
only in her husbond / wherefore she suffryd hit patiently / in such wise that
her husbond knew his defaute sonner by other then by her. Also we read that
there was a wedowe named Anna / which had a friend that counorylled her to
marye^ For she was young fair and rich. to whom she answered that she would not
so do in no wise / For if I should have an husbond as I have had and that he
were as good as he was^ I should ever ben aferd to lose him / like as I lost
that other. and then should I live alwey in fere and dread. which I will not.
And if hit happend me to have a worse^ what should h^t proffyte me to have an
evil husbond after a good. and so she concluded that she would keep her
chastete. Saint Austyn reherceth in the book de Ciuitate dei that in rome was a
noble lady gentyl of manners and of high sy^^ed named lucrecia / And had an
husbond named Colatyne which desired on a time the Emperors sone named
torquyne thorguyllous or the proude^ and he was call sixte for to come dyne
and sport him in his castle or manoyr And when he was entered among many noble
ladies he saw lucrecia / And when this emperors sone had seen and aduertysed
her deportes. her countenance. her manner / and her beaulte. he was all
muysshed and esprysed with her love forthwyth / And espied a time when her
husbond Collatyn went unto the oost of the emperor. and came in to the place
where as lucresse was with her felawshyp whom she received honorably. And when
time came to goo to bed and sleep she maad ready a bed rially for him as hit
apperteyned to the emperors sone. And this sixtus espied where lucrecia lay.
and when he supposid and knew that every body was in his first sleep. he came
unto the bed of lucresse and that one hand set on her breast and in that
other hand a nakyd swerd. and said to her. Lucresse hold thy pees and cry
not. For I am sixte ^arquynus sone. for if thou speak any word thou shall be
deed / and for fere she held her pees. Then he began to pray and promise
many things / and after he menaced and thretened her that she should enclyne to
him to do his will / and when he saw he could nor might have his endente he
said to her / if thou do not my will / I shall slay the and one of thy
seruauntis and shall say him all deed by thy side / And then I shall say that
I have slain you for your rybaudrye. and success that than doubted more the
shame of the world than the death. consentyd to him / And anon after as the
emperors sone was departed^ the lady sent lettres to her husbond her fader her
brethern and to her friends and to a man called brute counceyllour and neue we
to tarquyn / and said to them that yesterday Syyte the emperors sone came in to
mine hows as an enemy in liknes of a frende^ and has oppressyd me / And know
thou Colatyn that he has dishonouryd thy bed / And haw well that he has
fowled and dishonored my body. yet mine heart is not / wherefore I beseech the
of pardon foryes^es and absolucion of the trespass but not of the pain. And he
that has done this sin to me hit shall ben to his myschaunce if ye do your
(...). and because no woman take ensaumple of lucresse and live after the
trespass. but that she in like wise take ensaumple also of the pain. And
forthwyth with a sword that she held under her gown or robe / she roof her
self unto the heart And deyed forthwyth tofore them. and then brute the
counceyller and her husbond collatyn and all her other friends swore by the
blood of lucresse that they would never rest unto the time that they had put
out of rome tarquyn and al his lygne / And that never after none of them should
come to dygnyte / and all this was done / For they bare the deed corpse though
the cite and meuyd the people in such wise. That tarquyn was put in exyle. and
Syxte his sone was slain. A queen ought to be well manerd and among all she
ought to be tumerous and Shamefast / For when a woman has lost shamefastnes
she may ner can not weel be chaste. Wherefore says Symachus that they that been
not shamefast have no conscience of luxurye / And saint ambrose says that one
of the best parementes and makes a womman most fair in her person. is to be
shamefast. Seneque reherceth that there was one named archezylle which was so
shamefast that she put in a pelowe of feathers a certain sum of money. and put
hit under the heed of a pour friend of heys / which dissymy^^ his pouerte and
would not nos durst not be a known of his pouerte. for shame she durst not
give it openly. but fad lever that he should find hit than that she had given
hit him. wherefore otherwhile men should give and help her fomdes so secretly.
that they know not whens it come / for when we keep it secret and make no.
lost thereof. our deeds and works shall please god and them also. A Queen ought
to be chosen when she shall be weddyd of the most honest kynrede and people /
for often times the daughters folowen the tatches and manners of them that they
ben dyscended from whereof wleryus maximus says that there was one that would
marye. which came to a philosopher and axyd counceyl what wife he might best
take. he answered that he should take her that thou know derceynly that her
mother and her grauntdame have been chaste and well condycioned. for such mother /
such daughter comunely / Also a queen ought to teache her children to ben
contynent and keep chasttie entierly. as hit is written in ecclesiastes. if thou
have sons enseigne and teache them and if thou have daughters keep well them in
chastyte^

For helemonde reherorth that every king and prince ought to be a clerk for
to com^unde to other to study and read the law of our lord god / and therefore
wrote the emperor to the king of france that he should do learn his children
senes the seven sciences liberal / and said among other things that a king
not lettrid resembles an ass ^oroned / The Emperor octou^an maad his sons to
be taught and learn to swymme / to spring and lepe / to Just / to play with
the axe and sword / and al manner thing that apperteyneth to a knight / and his
daughters he made him to learn to sewe. to spynne to labor as well in wolle as
in lynen cloth. and al other werkis langyng to women / And when his friends
demanded wherefore he did so. he answered how well that he was lord and Sire of
all the world^ yet wyste he not what should befalle of his children and whether
they should fall or come to pouerte or no / and therefore if they conne a good
craft they may alwey live honestly. The queen ought to keep her daughters in
all chastyte. For we read of many maidens that for these virgynyte have been
maad queen's / For Poule the historiagraph of the lombardes reherceth that there
was a duchess named remonde which had three sons and ij daughters And hit
happend that the king of hongrye ca^t^uus assailed a castle where she and her
chylddren were Inn / And on a day she beheld her enemies / and among all
other she saw the king that he was a well faryng and a goodly man. Anon she
was esprysed and taken with his love. and that so sore that forth with she sent
to him that she would deliver over the castle to him if he would take her to his
wife and wedde her / And he agreed thereto and swear that he would have her to his
wife on that condition. when than the king was in the castle / his people took
men and women and all that they fond / her soones fled from her / of whom
one was named Ermoaldus and was youngest / and after was due of boneuentan and
sithen king of the lumbardis / and the two susters took chykens and put hem
under her arms next the flessh and between her pappes / that of the hete and
chauffyng the flesh of she chikyns stanke / and when so was that they of
longrye would have enforced and defowled ^n^ne they felt the stenche and fled
a wey and so left hem saying fie how these lomburdes stynke. and so they kept
their virgyntyte. Wherefore that one of hem afterward was queen of france / and
that other queen of almayn / and hit happend then that the king catunus took
acordyng to his promise the duchess / and lay with her one night for to save
his ooth. and on the morn he made her comune unto all the hungres / And the
third day after he did do put a staf of tree fro the nether port of her.
through her ^edy unto her throat or mouth / for by cause of the lust of her
flessh she betrayed her cite and said such husbond such wife. and this
suffyseth of the queen

The third chappytre of the second traytye treteth of the Alphyns her offices
and manners capitulo tercio.


tHe alphyns ought to be maad and formed in manner of Iuges sittyng in a chayer
with a book open tofore their eyes / and that is by cause that some causes ben
crymynel / And some ben cyuyle as about possessions and other temporel things
and trespaces / and therefore ought to be two Iuges in the royame / one in the
black for the first cause / And that other in whyt as for the second. Their
office is for to counceylle the king. And to make by his co^masidementis good
sawes and to inform all the royame in good and virtuous manners / And to Judge
and give sentence well and trewly after the aras is had. and to counceyl well and
Justly all them that axe counceyl of hem / with out having of any eye opene
to any person / And to estudye diligently in such wise and to ordeigne all
that / that ought to be kept be obseruyd be fast and stable / So that they be
not found corupt. for yefte for favor no forillgnage ne for envy varriable.
And as touching the first point Seneque says in the book of benefets that the
pour diogenes was more strong than alixandre / For Alixandre could not give so
much as diogenes would refuse. Marcus ^^rsus a romayn of great renomee says
thus. that when (...) had besieged and assailed them of Samente / and
beneuentane which herd that he was pour / they took a great mass and wedge
of gold and sendyd hit to him prayeng him that he would reseyue hit and leave his
assault and siege / and when they came with the present to him they fond him
sittyng on the / earth and ete his mete out of platers and dysshes of tree and
of wode. and did th^n her message / to whom he answered and said that they should
goo home and say to them that sent them that Marcus cursus loves better to
be lord and win richesses than richesse should win him. For by battle he
shall not be overcome and vaynquysshed / nor by gold ne silver he shall not be
corrupt ne corompid. Oftentimes that thing takes an evil end that is untrue
for gold and silver. and that a man is subget unto money may not be lord thereof
/ Helymond reherceth that demos^ene demanded of aristodone how much he had
won for pletyng of a cause for his client. And he answer a mark of gold.
Demostenes answered to him again / that he had won as much for to hold his
pees and speak not / thus the tunges of advocates and men of law ben perilo^^
and do^megeable. yet they must be had if thou wolt win thy cause. for with
money and yefte thou shall win. and oftentimes they selle as well their
scilence / as their vtteraunce. valerius reherceth that the senators of rome
took counceil to geder of two persons that one was pour and that other rich
and covetous / which of hem both were most apt for to send to govern and
Judge the contre of spayn / And sapyon of affrique said that none of hem both
were good ne proffytable to be sent theder. For that one has no thing. And to
that other may no thing suffyse / And despised in his saying all pouerte and
avarice in a Judge. For a covetous man has need of an halpeny. for he is
servant and bond unto money / and not lord thereof but pouerte of heart and
of will ought to be gretely allowed in a Judge / Therefore we read that as long
as the Romans louyd pouerte they were lordys of all the world. For many
there were that exposed al their goods for the common welt. and for that was
most proffitable for the comynalte that they were so pour that when they were
deed they were buried and brought to earth with the common good / And their
daughters were married by the commandment of the senators. but sithen that
they despised pouerte / and begone to gadre richesses. and have made great
bataylles. they have used many sins / and so the common well perisshed / for
there is no sin but that it reigns there / there is none that is so blisful
as he that has all the world in despite / For he is in pees that dredith no man
/ and he is rich that coueiteth no thing / valere reherceth that he is not
rich that much has / but he is rich that has lityl and coueyteth no thing
/ than thus late the Iuges take heed that they enclyne not for love or for hate
in any Judgment for the of cast says that all love is blynde^ there love is.
there can not right Judgment be given. for all love is blind. and therefore
love is none even Iuge^ for often times love Iugeth a foul and lothly woman to
be fair / And so reherceth quinte curse in his first book that the great
godach^s says the same to Alyxandre / Men may say in this was that nature is
evil / For every man is less aduysed and worse in his own feet and cause than
in another mannys^ And therefore the Iuges ought to keep hem well from Ire in
Judgment / Tullyus says that an angry and yrous person weneth that for to do
evil is good counceyl / and socrates says that two things ben contrarious to
counceyl / and they ben hastynes and wrath. and galeren says in alexandrye /
if ire or wrath overcome the when thou sholdest give Judgment / weye all thing
in the balaunce so that thy Judgment be not enclyned by love / ne by yeft. ne
favor of person torn not thy corage^ Helemond reherceth that cambyses king
of perce which was a right wis king had an vnrightwes Judge / which for envy
and evil will had dampened a man wrongfully and against right / wherefore he did
him to be flayn al quyk and made the chayer or siege of Judgment to be couerid
with his skyn / and made his sone Judge and to sit in the chayer on the skyn
of his fader. to the end that the sone should Judge rightwisly / and abhoere the
Judgment and pain of his fader. Iuges ought to punysshe the defaultes egally /
and fulfille the law that they ordeyne. Caton says accomplisshe and do the
law in such wise as thou have ordeigned and given / valerius reherceth that
calen gius a consul had a sone which was taken in aduoultrye and therefore
after the law at that time he was dampened to lose both his eyes. the fader
would that the law should be acoomplisshed in his sone with out favor. but all the cite was meuyd herewyth and would not suffer hit / but in the end his fader
was vaynquysshed by their prayers. And ordained that his sone should lose one
eye which was put out. And he him self lost an other eye. And thus was the
law obseruyd and kept. And the prayer of the people was accomplisshed / We
read that there was a counceyllour of rome that had given counceylle to make a
statute that who some ener that entryd in to the senatoyr and a sword gyrt
about him should be deed / Than hit happend on a time that he came from without
and entrid in to the senatoir and his swerd gyrt about him. whereof he took none
head / and one of the senators told him of hit / and when he knew hit and
reme^brid the statute / he drew out his sword and slew him self tofore them.
rather to dye than to break the law / for whose death all the senators maad
great sorrow / But alas we find not many in these days that so do / But they
do like as anastasyus says that the laws of so^me ben like unto the nettis of
spyncoppis that take no great bestes and sowles but let goo and flee through /
but they take flies and gnattes and such small things / In like wise the
laws now adays ben not executed but upon the pour peple^ the great and rich
break hit and goo through with all / and for this cause sourden batailles and
discordes and make the great and rich men to take by force and strength
lordshippis and seignories upon the small and pour people / and this d^n they
specially that been gentil of lignage and pour of goods / and causes them to
rob and reave / and yet constreyne them by force to serve them. and this is no
marvel / for they that dread not to anger god / ner to break the law and to
false hit / fall often times by force in much cursidnes and wickedness. but
when the great people do according to the law / and punysshe the transgressors
sharply / The common people absteyne and withdraw hem fro doing of evil and
chastises hem self hy their example / And the Iuges ought to entende for to
study. For if the smythes the carpentiers the vignours and other crafty-men
say that it is not necessary to study for the common proffit / And glorefye
them in their co^nyng and say that they ben proffitable^ than should the Iuges
study and contemplaire much more than they in that that should be for the
common well. wherefore says sene^^e believe me that they seem that they do no
thing / they do more than they that labor for they do spirituel and also
corporal werkis. And therefore among artificers there is no plesau^t rest / but
that reason of the Iuges has maad and ordained hit. and therefore angelius says
in / li / atticorum de socrate / that socrates was on a time so pensif that in
an hobe naturel day / he held one estate that he ne meued mouth ne eye ne foot
ne hand but was as he had been died or rauysshed / and when one demanded him
wherefore he was so pensif. he answered in all worldly things and labors of the
same and held him bourgeys and Cytezeyn of the world / and valerius rehercith
that carnardes a knight was so sage wise and laborous in pensifnes of the common
well / that when he was set at table for to ete / he forgate to put his
hond unto the mete to feed him self / and therefore his wife that was named
Mellyse whom he had taken more to have her company and felawshyp than for any
other thing / Fed him to the end that he should not dye for hongre in his
pensifnes. Didimus said to alixandre we be not deynseyns in the world but
strangers / not we ben not born in the world for to dwell and abide alwey
therein. but for to goo and pass through hit. we have done no^n evil deed. but
that it is worthy / to be punysshed and we to suffer pain therefore / and
then we may goon with open face and good conscience. And so may we goo
lightly and appertly the way that we hope and purpose to goo. This suffyseth as
for the Alphyns /

The fourth chappitre of the second book treteth of the order of cheualrye and
knighthood and of her offices and manners capitulo quarto


tHe knight ought to be maad al armed upon an horse in such wise that he have
an helm on his heed and a spear in his right hond / and couerid with his
shield / a swerd and a mace on his lift side. clad with an hawberk and plates
tofore his breast. leg harn^ys on his legges^ spores on his heelis / on his
hands his gauntelettes. his hores well broken and taught and apt to bataylle
and coueryd with his arms. when the knights ben maad they ben ^ayned or
bathed^ That is the sign that they should led a new life and new manners. also
they wake all the night in prayers and orisons unto god that he will give him
grace that they may get that thing that they may not get by nature / The king
or prince gyrdeth a boute them a sword in sign / that they should abide and
kepe^ him of whom they taken their dispences and dignyte. Also a knight ought
to be wise lyberalle / true. strong and full of mercy and pity and kep^^ of the
people and of the law / and right as cheualrye passes other in virtue in
dignyte in honor and in reverence / right so ought he to surmounte all other
in virtue. for honor / is no thing else but to do reverence to another
person for the good and virtuous disposicion that is in him / A noble knight
ought to be wise and prouyd tofore he be maad knight / hit behooved him that he
had long time vsid the war and arms. that he may be expert and wise for to
govern the other / For sithen that a knight is capitayn of a battle. the life
of them that shall be under him lies in his hand / and therefore behooves him
to be wise and well aduysed / For sometime art craft and engyne is more worth
than strength or hardynes of a man that is not proved in arms / for other
while it happeth that when the prince of the batayl affyeth and trusts in his
hardynes and strength / and wol not use wisdom and engyne for to run upon
his enemies / he is vaynquysshed and his people slain. therefore says the
philosopher that no man should chese yo^g people to be captayns and governors /
for as much as there is no certeynte in her wisdom / alixa^dre of macedone
vaynquysshed and conquered Egipte / Jude / calde^ Affrique and affyrie unto the
marches of bragmans more by the counceyl of old men than by the strength of
the young men. we read in the historye of from that there was a knight which
had to name malechete that was so wise and true that when the emperor
Theodosius was dede^ He made mortal war against his brother germayn which was
named Gyldo or Guye. for as much as this said / guye would be lord of affrique
with out leave and will of the senators / and this said Guy had slain the two
sons of his brother malechete / And did much torment unto the christian people /
and before that he should come in to the field against his brother Guyon. he went
in to an isle of capayre and ladde with him all the christian men / that had been
sent theder in exyle. And maad hem all to pray with him by the space of three
days and three nyghtes. For he had great affyaunce and trust in the prayers
and orisons of good folk and specially that no man might counceyl ne help but
god / And three days tofore he should fight saint Ambrose which was deed a
litil tofore apperyd to him and showed him by reuelaco^n the time and hour
that he should have victory. And for so much as he had been iij days and three
nyghtes in orysone and prayers and that he was assuryd for to have victory /
he faught with five thousand men against his brother that had in his company
four soore thousand men. and by gods help he had victory And when the
barbaryns that were comen to help guyon saw the discomfiture they fled
awey- And guyon fled also in to affryque by ship. And when he was there
aryued he was sone after stranglid. These two knights of whom I speak were two
brethern germayns. which were sent in to affrique for to deffende the common
well. In like wise Judas machabeus / Ionathas / and Simon his brethern put them
self in the mercy and guard of our lord god / And ageyn the enemies of the law
of god with litil people in regard of the multitude that were again them / And
had also victory / The knights ought to ben true to their princes / For he
that is not true leseth the name of a knight. Unto a prince troth is the
grettest precious stone when hit is med^d with Justice. Paul the historiagraph
of the lombardes reherceth that there was a knight named Enulphus and was of
the cite of papye that was so true and faithful to his lord and king named
pathariche that he put him in parylle of death for him / For hit happend that
Grymald due of buneuentayns of whom we have touched tofore in the chapter of
the queen. did do slay Godebert which was king of the lombardes by the hand
of goribert due of tarente / which was descended of the crown of lombardes.
And this grymalde was maad king of lombardye in his place and after this put
and banysshed out of the contraye this patharich which was brother unto the
king Godebert. that for fere and dread fled in to hongrye. And then this
knight enulphus did so much that he gate the pees again of his lord patharich
against the king grymalde. And that he had license to come out of hongrye where
he was alwey in parell. and so he came and cried him mercy / And the king
Grymalde gaf him leave to dwell and to live honestly in his contre alwey
forseen that he took not upon him and named him self king. How well he was king
by right / This done a lityl while after / the king that believed evil tongues /
thought in him self how he might bring this pathariche unto the death. and al
this knew well the knight Enulphus / which came the same night with his squire
for to vysite his lord and maad his squire to unclothe him and to lie in the
bed of his lord / and maad his lord to rise and clothe him with the clothes
of his squire / And in this wise brought him out. brawlyng and betyng him as
his servant by them that were asigned to keep the hows of patharich that he
should not escape / which supposid that hit had been his squire that he entreted
so outragyously / and so he brought him unto his hows which Joined with the
walls of the town. And at mydnyght when al men were a sleep. he let a down
his maistre by acorde. which took an horse out of the pasture and fled unto
the cite of ^ast and there came to the king of france And when it came unto the
morn / hit was founden that enulphus and his squire had deceived the king and
the watchemen / whom the king commanded should be brought tofore him / and
demanded of them the manner how he was escapyd / and they told him the truth
/ Then the king demanded his counceyl of what death they had deseruyd to dye
that had so done and wrought again the will of him / Sum said that they
should ben honged and so^me said they should be flayn / and other said that they
should be beheded. Than said the king by that lord that maad me. they ben not
worthy to dye. but for to have much worship and honor / For they have been
true to their lord. wherefore the king gaf hem a great law^^ and honor for
their feet. And after hit happend that the propre squire and servant of
Godeberd slew the traytre Gorybalde that by treson had slain his lord at a
feste of Saint John in his cite of tarente whereof he was lord and du^ / Thus
ought the knights to love to gyder. and each to put his life in adventure for
other. ffor so been they the strenger and the more doubted. like as were the
noble knights Ioab and abysay that fought against the syryens and amonytes and
were so true that one to that other that they vaynquysshed their enemies / And
were so joined to gyder that if the firiens were strenger then that one of
them. that other help him / We read that damon and phisias were so right
parsight friends to gyder that when dionysius which was king of zealle had
Iugged one to death for his trespass in the cite of si^^^^ sane whom he would
have executed. he desired grace and leave to goo in to his contre for to dispose
and ordeyne his testament / And his felawe pledgyd him and was sewrte for him
upon his heed that he should come again / whereof they that herd and saw this /
held him for a fool and blamed him. And he said alwey that he repentyd him no
thing at all. For he knew well the troth of his felawe / and when the day came
and the hour that execucion should be done. his fellow came and presented him
self tofore the Judge. and dischargid his fellow that was pledge for him whereof
the king was gretely abashed. and for the great truth that was founden in
him / he pardonyd him and prayed hem both that they would receive him as their
great friend and felowe^ lo here the virtues of love / that a man ought not to
doubt the death for his friend / Lo what it is to do for a friend. and to lead
a life debonayr / ^ and to be with out cruelte^ to love and not to hate / which
causes to do good against evil. and to torn pain in to benefete and to
quench cruelte. Anthonyus says that Julius caesar left not lightly frendshyp
and amytye / But when he had hit. he retained hit fasts and mayntened hit
alwey. Scipion of affrique says that there is no thing so strong as for to
maynteyne love unto the death The love of concupissence and of lecherye is sone
dissoluyd and broken. but the verray true love of the common well and proffyt
now a days is selde founden / where shall thou find a man in these days that
will expose him self for the worship and honor of his friend / or for the common
well / selde or never shall he be founden / also the knights should be large and
liberal / For when a knight has regard unto his synguler prouffyt by his
couetyse^ he dyspoyleth his people / For when the souldyours se that they put
hem in parel. and their master will not pay hem their wages lyberally / but
entendeth to his own propre gayn and proffyt / than when the enemies come they
torn sone her backs and flee often times / And thus hit happeth by him that
entendeth more to get money than vyctorye that his auaryce is often tymees
cause of his confusion / Then let every knight take heed to be lyberalle in
such wise that he wene not ne suppose that his scarcete be to him a great
wynnyng or gayn / And for this cause he be the less louyd of his people. and
that his aduersarye wythdrawe to him them by large geuyng^ For often time
battle is auaunced more for getyng of silver / than by the force and strength
of men / For men see all day that such things as may not be achyeued by
force of nature ben gotten and and achyeued by force of money. And for so much
it behooves to see well to that when the time of bataille comes that he borowe
not ne make no ^ayllage For no man may be rich that leuyth his own / keeping
to get and take of other / Than alwey al her gayn and wynnyng ought to be
common among exept their arms For in like wise as the vyctorye is comune so
should the dispoyse and botye be comune unto them / And therefore dauyd that
gentyl knight in the first book of kings in the last chappytre made a law.
that he that abode behind by maladye or sekenes in the tents should have as
meek part of the butyn as he that had been in the battle. And for the love of
this law he was maad afterward (...) of Israel / Alixandre of macedone came on
a time like a simple knight unto the court of porue king of Ynde for to espy
thastate of the king and of the knights of the court / And the king receyuyd
him right worshypfully. And demanded of him many things of Alixander and of
his constance and strength. nothing wenyng that he had been alixander / but
antygone one of his knights / and after he had him to dinner. and when they had
served alixander in vessayl of gold and silver with diverse metes / After that
he had eten such as plefid him he voyded the mete and took the vessayl and
held hic to him self and put hit in his bosom or sleuys. whereof he was accusid
unto the king / After dinner then the king called him and demanded him
wherefore he had taken his vayssayl and he answered. sir king my lord I pray the
to understand and take heed thy self and also thy knights I have herd much
of thy great hyghnes / and that thou art more mighty and puyssaunt in cheualrye
and in dispencis than is Alixaunder. and therefore I am come to the a pour
knight which am named Antygone for to serve the^ Than hit is the custom in
the court of Alixander that what thing a knight is served with / all is his
mete and v^issel and cup. and therefore I had supposid that this custom had been kept in thy court / for thou art richer than he / when the knights herd
this. anon they left perus. and went to serve Alixaunder / and thus he drew
to him the hertes of hem by yeftes / which afterward slew porus that was king
of ynde. and they maad Alixandre king thereof. Therefore remember knight alwey
that with a closid and shette purse shall thou never have victory / Ouyde
says that he that takes yeftes / he is glad therwyth / For they win with
yeftes the hertes of the gods and of men / For if Iupyter were an grid. with
yeftes he would be plesid. the knights ought to be strong not only of body
but also in courage. there ben many strong and great of body / that been faint
and feeble in the heart / he is strong that may not be vaynquysshed and
overcome. how well that he suffrith much otherwhyle / And so we believe that
they that be not ouergrete ne over litel ben most corageous and best in
bataylle / We read that cadeus due of athenes should have a bataylle again them
of po^^pe / And he was warned and had a revelation of the gods / that they
should have the vyctorye of whom the prince should be slain in the battle. And
the prince which was of a great courage and true heart took other arms of a
pour man / and put him self in the front of the bataylle to the end that he
might be slain and so he was / For the right true prince had lever dye / than
his people should be ouercomen. and so they had the victory / Certes hit was a
noble and a fair thing to expose him self to the death for to diffende his
contraye. But no man would do so but if he hopyd to have a better thing therefore
/ Therefore the law says that they ^rue in her sowles gloriously that been
slain in the wat^o for the common well. A knight ought also to be merciful^ ^
pietous / For there is no thing that makes a knight so renomed as is when he
sauyth the life of them that he may slay / For to shede and spylle blood is the
condycion of a wild best and not the condycion of a good knight Therefore we
read that scilla that was due of the romans with out had many fair victories
against the romans: within that were contrary to him in so much that in the
bataylle of puylle he slew xviij thousand men. And in champayne lxx thousand /
and after in the cite he slew three thousand men unarmed. and when one of his
knights that was named Quyntus catulus saw this cruelte said to hyin / Sesse
now and suffer them to live and be merciful to them with whom we have been
vyctorious. and with whom we ought to live / For it is the most highest and fair
vengeance that a man may do / as to spare them and give hem her life whom he
may sle. Therefore I^ab ^^deyned when absalon was slain. he sowned a tr^m^^^^
that his people should no more run and slay their adversaries / For there were
slain about xx thousand of them. And in like wise did he when he faught against
Abner / and abner was vaynquysshed and fled. For where that he went in the

/ And the people should entende to their work / For no crufty man may both
entende to his craft and to fight / How may a crafty man entende to his work

knights should keep the people in time of pees in like wise the people ought to
purueye for their dispencis. how should a plow man be sewre in the field / but
if the knights made daily watch to keep them. For like as the-glorye of a
king is upon his knights / So it is necessary to the knights that the
merchants crafty men and common people be defended and kept / Therefore late
the knights keep the people in such wise that they may enjoy pees and get

to bind his hands behind him as a traitor and sede him unto the parentis of

that Hanybal had taken a prince of rome which upon his oath and promise

vastrius rebercith that there was a Judge named sangie which dampened a woman
that had deseruyd the death for to have her heed smyten of or else that she
should dye in prison.

The Iayler that had pity on the woman put not her anon to death but put her in
the pryson^ and this woman had a daughter which came for to see and comfort
her mother / But alwey or she entrid in to the prison the Iayler serchyd her
that she should bear no mete ne drink to her mother. but that she should dye for
honger. than hit happend after this that he meruayled much why this woman dyed
not / and began to espy the cause why she lyuyd so long And fond at last
how her daughter gaf sowk to her mother. and fed her with her milk / when the
Iayler saw this merueyle / he went and told the Judge / And when the Judge saw
this great pity of the daughter to the mother he pardoned her and made her to be
delyuerd out of her prison / what is that / that pite ne amolissheth / much
people wene that it is against nature and wondre that the doughtre should give
the mother to souke. hit were against nature but the children should be kind to
fader and mother Seneka says that the king of bees has no prykke to stynge
with as other bees have / And that nature has take hit away from him by cause
he should have none arms to assail them. and this is an example unto princes
that they should be of the same condycion^ valerius rehercith in his fifthe book
of Marchus martellus that when he had taken the cite of Syracusane / and was
set in the highest place of the cite / he beheld the great destruccyon of the
people and of the cite / he wept and said / thou ought to be sorrowful / for
so much as thou would have no pity of thy self / But enjoy the for thou art
fallen in the hand of a right debonair prince / also he recou^teth when
pomptes had conquered the king of germanye that often times had foughten against
the romans / and that he was brought to fore him bounden / He was so pyetous
that he would not suffer him to be long on his knees tofore him. but he
received him curtoysly. and set the crown again on his herd and put him in
thestate that he was tofore.

For he had oppynyon that it was as worshypful and sittyng to a king to pardone
/ as to punysshe / Also he reherceth of a counceyllour that was named poule
that did to bring tofore him a man that was prisoner / And or he knelid tofore
him he took him up fro the ground and made him to sit beside him for to give
him good esperaunce and hope / and said to the other stondyng by / (...) this
wise / if hit be great noblesse that we show our self contrary to our
enemies. than this fete ought to be allowed that he show our self debonayr to
our caytyfs and prisoners / Caesar when he hard the death of cathon which was
his aduersarye said that he had great envy of his glory. and no thing of his
patrymonye- and therefore he left to his children freely al his patrymonye. Thus
taught virgyle and enseygneth the glorious princes to rewle and govern the
people of rome. and saint Austyn de ciuitate dei says thus / Thou emperor
govern the people pyetously / and make pees ouerall / deporte and forbere thy
subgettio. repreue and correct the proud / For so enseyne and deche the the
laws / And hit was written unto alixaunder. that every prince ought to be
pyetous in punysshyng / and ready for to reward / there is no thing that causes
a prince to be so beloved of his people. as when he spekyth to hem swetely. and
conceruyth with hem symply. and all this comes of the (...) of pity.

We read of the emperor traian that his fre^^^ ^^^^uyd him of that he was to
much pryue and famuller with the common people more than an emperor ought to be
And he answered that he would be such an emperor as every man desired to have
him / also we read of a^^sa^^der that on a time he ladde his host forth
hastily / and in that haste he beheld where satte an old knight that was fore
a cold / whom he did do arise and set him in his own sete or siege. what
wondre was hit though the knights desired to serve such a lord that louyd
better their health than his dignyte. The wokes ought also to be humble and
meke^ after the holy scripture which says / the gretter or in the hyer astate
that thou art / so much more ought thou be meker and more humble. valerius
reherceth in his vij book that there was an emperor named Pu^^lius caesar. that
did do beat down his hows which was in the mids of the market place for as
much as hit was hyer than other howses / For as much as he was more glorious
in estate than other^ therefore would he have a less hows than other / and
scipion of affrique that was so pour of voluntarye pouerte that when he was
dede^ He was buried at the dyspencis and costs of the common good / They should
be so humble that they should leave their offices / and suffer other to take hem
when her time cometh^ and do honor to other. For he governs well the royame
that may govern hit when he will. valerius rehercith in his iij book that
fabyan the great had been maystre counceyllour of his fader his groundfire. And
of his ground^^^^ fader and of all his ancesstours / And yet (...) his pain
and labor / that his sone should never have that office after him. But for no
thing that he (...) ^^^ted her sone for he was noble and wise and more
attempered than other but he would that the office should not alwey rest in the
famylye and hows of the fabyans Also he reherceth in his seventh book that they
would maste the said fabyan emperor / but he excusyd him and said that he was
blind and might not see for age. But that excusacion might not help him /
Than said he to hem / seek ye and get you another / For if ye make me your
emperor / I may not suffer your manners / nor ye may not suffer mine. There was
a king of so subtyl engyne that when men brought him the crown tofore that he
took hit / he remembrid him a litil and said O thou crown that art more noble
then happy / For if a king knew well and parfaytly how that thou art full of
parylles of thought and of charge / if thou were on the ground / he would
never lift nor take the up Remember the that when thou art most glorious^
then have so^me men most envy on the. And when thou have most seignorye and
shedshype / than shall thou have most care / thought and anguysshes / vaspasian
was so humble that when Nero was slain all the people cried for to have him
emperor And many of his friends came and prayed him that he would take hit upon
him. So at the last he was constreyned to taste hit upon him. and said to his
frendys hit is better and more to praise and allow for a man to take thempy^^
against hi^ will than for to (...) have hit and to put him self them. Thus
right they (...) be humble and meke for to receive worship the^fore (...) the

officers / Josephus rehercith that the friends of Tyberius meruaylled much why
he held his office^rs so long in their officers ^^yth out chaunchyng. And
they demau^des of him the cause to whom he answered I would change them gladly.

that been full of my blood / and now shall thou let come other that be hongrye
which shall ^on to me double pain more than the other dyd^ for the prick of the
hongry is more poygnaunt the half. then of the fulle / And therefore said he
I leave the officers in their offices. For they ben al rich / and to not so
much evil and harm / as the new should do and were pour if I should set
hem in her places. They ought also to be pacient in heryng of words and in
suffryng pain on her bodyes^ as to the first / one said to alisaunder that he
was not wor^hy to reign / specially when he suffered that lecherys and ^^yde to
have seignorye in him / he suffrid hit patiently / And answered none otherwise
but that he would correct^ him self / And take better manners and more honest /
also hit i^ re^^^cid that Iulyus Caesar was ballyd whereof he had displasir so
great that he kempt his heer^s that lay on the after poets of his heed forward
for to hy^e the bare tofore. Th^n said a knight to hym^ Cezar hit is lighther
and sooner to be maad that thou be not ballyd / than that I have vsid any
cowardyse in the war of Rome / or she after shall do any cowardyse. He
suffryd hye patiently and said not one (...). another reprochyd him by his
lignage. and called him baker / he answered that hit is better that noblesse
begin in me. them hit should faylle in me / another called him tyrant / he
answered if I were one thou would not say so. A knight called on a time
scipyon of Affrique foul and old knight in arms. And that he knew lytyl
good. And he answered I was borne of my mother a lytyl child and feeble and not a
man of arms. And yet he was at all times one of the best and most worthyest
in arms that lyuyd Another said to vaspasion / and a wolf should so^ner change
his skyn and here. than thou sholdest change thy life. For the longer thou
lyuest the more thou coueytest / and he answered of these words we ought to
laughe / But we ought to amend our self / and punysshe the trespaces / Seneste
rehercith that the king antygonus herd certain people speak and say evil of
him. and there was between hem nomor^ but a couetyne / and than he said make an
end of your evil langage lest the king here you^ for the courtyne heeryth you
well enough than as touching to the pains that they ought to suffer patiently /
valerius reheaceth that a tyrant did do torment Anamaxymenes and thretenyd him
for to cut of his tunge. to whom he said hit is not in thy power to do so.
and forthwith he ^^te of his own tongue / and chewid hit with his tethe and
cast hit in the vysage of the tyrant. hit is a great virtue in a man that he
forgete not to be pacient in correccions of wrongs. hit is better to leave a
gylty man unpunished. than to punysshe him in a wrath or ire / valerius
rehercith that archyta of tarente that was master to plato saw that his
seldes and lands were destroyed and lost by the necligence of his servant /
to whom he said if I were not angry with the I would take vengeance and
turmente the. lo there ye may see that he had lever to leave to punysshe / than
to punysshe mere by ire and wrath than by right. And therefore says seneque /
do not thing that thou ought to do when thou art angrye For when thou art
angry thou would do all things after thy playsi^ / and if thou can not
vaynquysshe thyn ire. than must thyn ire overcome the. After this ought they to
have wylful pouerte / like as hit was in the ancient princes. For they
coueyted more to be rich in wit and good manners then in money / And that
rehercith valerius in his viij book that Scypyon of affryque was accused unto
the senate that he should have great tresour. And he answered certes when I
submysed Affrique in to your p^este. I held no thing to my self that I might
say this is mine save only the surname of affrique. Ner the affriquans have not
founden in me ner in my booder any auaryce / nor that we were so couetouse that
we had ne had gretter envy to be rich of name than of richesses And therefore
says Seneque that the king altagone vsyd gladly in his hows vessels of earth /
And sum said he did hit for couetyse / but he said that hit was better and
more noble thing to shine in good manners than in vasseyll / And when some men
demanded him why and for what cause he did so / he answered I am now king of
Secylle. and was sone of a potter / and for as much as I doubt fortune / for
when I issued out of the hows of my fader and mother. I was suddenly maad rich
/ wherefore I behold the natyuyte of me and of my lignage / which is humble
and meke. and al these things comes of wylful pouerte / For he intended more
to the common proffyt than to his owen. And of this pouerte speaks Saint
Augustyn in the book of the cite of god that they that entende to the common
proffyt. sorrow more that wylful pouerte is lost in rome. than the richesses of
rome / for by the wylful pouerte was the renomee of good manners kept entierly
/ thus by this richesse pouerte is not only corrupt in these days ner the
cite ner the manners But also the thoughts of the men ben corrupt by this
couetise and by felonys that is worse than any other enemy / and of the
cruelte of the people of rome speaks the good man of noble memory John the
monk late cardynal of rome in the decretal the sixte in the chappytre gens
sca^ where he says / that they ben felons against god / contrary to holy
things / trayters one to that other. Enuyous to her neighbors. pr^ud unto
strangers. rebel and untrue unto their souerayns / not suffryng to them that
^^ly of lower degree than they and no thing shamefast to (...) things
discouenable and not to leave till they have that they demand / and not plesyd
but disagreable when they have received the yefte. they have their tongues ready
for to make great boost. and do lityl / they ben large in promysyng and small
gyuers / thyy ben right falls deceyu^^res / and right mordent and bytyng
detractours. For which thing hit is a great sorrow to see the humylite the
pacyence. and the good wysdom that was wont to be in this cite of rome which
is chyef of all the world and is preuerted and turned in to maleheurte and these
euylles. And me thinks that in other parties of cristente they have taken
ensaumple of them to do evil / They may say that this is after the decretale of
seygndrye and dysobeysaunce / that says. that such things that the souerayns
do. is lightly and sone taken in ensaumple of their subgettis. also these
vycayres should be large and liberal. in so much that such people as serve
them ben duly paid and guerdone^ of her labor. For every man does his labor
the better and lightlyer when he sees that he shall be well paid and rewarded
And we read that titus thesone of vaspasian was so large and so lyberal. that
he gaf and promised sumwhat to every man. and when his most preuy friends
demanded of him why he promised more then he might give / He answered for as
much as it aperteyneth not to a prince that any man should depart sorrowful or
tryste fre him / Than hit happens on a day that he gaf ner promised no thing to
any man / and when it was even and aduysed him self he said to his friends. O
ye my friends this day have I lost for this day have I don no good. and also we
(...) of Julius caesar that he never said in all his life to his knights goo
on. but alwey he said come come. For I love alwey to be in your company / And
he knew well that it was less paynt and trauaylle to the knights when the
prince is in her company that loves hem and comfort hem. and also ^e read
of the same Iulyus caesar in the book of truphe^ of philosophers / that there
was an ancient knight of his that was in par^lle of a ^aas hangyng tofore the
Iuges of rome so he called caesar on a time and said to him tofore al men that
he should be his advocate. And caesar delyueryd and assygned to him a right good
advocate. and the knight said to him / O caesar I put no vycay^ in my place when
thou were in paryl in the batayl of assise / but I faught for the. and than he
showed to him the places of his wounds that he had received in the bataylle.
and than came caesar in his pr^pr^ person for to be his advocate and to pl^te
his cause for him. he would not have the name of unkindness. But doubted that
men should say that he were pr^ude^ and that he would not do for them that had
served him / they that can not do so much as for to be beloved of her
knights. can not love the knights. and this suffiseth of the ^ol^es.

he made great sorrow and did to enquere and felt him so much that at last
he was founden in the herrytage And then his fader came theder to him and
said. Dear sone come from thene / thou shall be after my death earl and chyef
of my signage. I shall be soft if thou come not out from thens / and he than
that wist none otherwise to eschew the ire of his fader bethought him and said
Der^ fader there is in your contre and land a night evil custume if but plese

that the labors endende to his labor on the work days for to rauyel and
gadre to gyore the fruit of hye labor and also he ought to rest on the holy
day. both he and lie bestye / and a good labourer ought to norisshe and keep
his bestys. And this is signyfyed by the rod that he has / which is for to lead and drive them to the posture. The first pastor that ever was was Abel
which was Just and true / and offrid to god the lostis unto his sacrefise
and him ought he to follow in craft and manners but no man that uses the malyde
of caym may ensue: follow abel and thus hit apperteyneth to the labourer to
set and graffe trees and vygnes. and also to plant: cut them / and so did
Noe which was the first that planted the vygne after the ^^age and flood / For
as Josephus wherceth in the took if naturel things Noe was he that fond first
the vygne. and he fond him butter and wild and therefore he look four manners
of blood that is to were the blood of a lion / the blood of a lamb the blood of
a swyne. and the blood of an ape and medlid them al to geder with the earth /
And than he cut the vigne and put this about the rotes thereof to the end that
the byttirnes should be put awey / and that hit should be swear And when he had
dronken of the fruit of this vygne. hit was so good and mighty that he becam so

knew well that otherwhile by the strength of the wyn men he maad as hardy as
the lion and yrous^ and otherwhile they be made simple and shamefast as a lamb
/ and lecherous as a swyne and curious and full of play as an ape / for the ape
is of such nature that when he sees one do a thing he enforces him to do
the same / and so don many when they been drunk / they will meddle them with all
officers and matters that apperteyne no thing to them / and when they ben
fasting and sobre they can scarcely accomplisshe their own things / and
therefore valerian reherceth that of ancient and in old time women drank no
wyn for as much as by dronkenshyp they might fall in any filthe or vylony and
as ouyde says. that the wynes otherwhyle apparaylle the corages in such
manner that they ben couenable to al sins which take awey the herdes to do

dronkenshyp is the beginning of all euylles. and corrupts the body / and
destroys the soul and mynyssheth the goods temporels / and this suffiseth
for the laborers /

The second chappytre of the third tractate troteth of the form and manner of
the second pawn and of the manner of a smyth capitulo secundo


tHe second pawn that stondeth tofore the knight on the right side of the king
has the form and figure of a man as a smyth and that is reason / for hit
apperetyneth to the knights to lane bridellys sodellis spores and many other
things maad by the hands of smythes and ought to hold an hamer in his right
hond / and in his lift hand a squire. and he ought to have do his gyrdel a
trowel / For by this is signefyed all manner of weekmen. as goldsmythes.
marchallis. Smythes of all forges / forgers and makers of money and al manner
of smythes ben signefyed by the martel or hamer. The carpenters ben signefyed
by the dolabre or squire / and by the trowel we understand al masons and
keruers of stones. tylers and al those that make howses castles and towers /
And unto al these crafty men / hit aperteyneth that they be true. wise and
strong / And hit is need that they have in hem self faith and loyaulte / For
unto the godlsmythes behooves gold and silver and all other metallye. iron
and steel to other. and unto the carpentiers and masons ben put to their
edefyces the bodies and goods of the people / and also men put in the hands of
the maroners body and goods of the people and in the guard and sewerte of them
men put body and soul in the parilles of the sea And therefore ought they to be
true unto whom men commytte such great charge and so great things upon her
faith and trust. and therefore says the philosopher. He that leseth his faith
and believe / may lose no gretter ne more thing / and faith is a souerayn good
and comes of the good will of the heart and of his mind. and for no
necessyte will deceive no man. and is not corrupt for no mede. valerius
rehercith that fabius had received of hanybal certain prisoners that he held
of the romans for a certain some of money which he promised to pay to the
said hanybal and when he came unto the senators of rome and desired to have the
money lent for hem. they answered that they would not pay nor lene / and than
ffabiue sent his sone to rome and made him to selle his heritage and
patrymonye. and sent the money that he receyuyd thereof unto hanybal. and had
lever and louyd better to be pour in his country of heritage / than of believe
and faith / But in these days it were great folly to have such affyaunce in
much people but if they had been preuyd before / for oftentimes men trust in
them by whom they ben deceyuyd at their need / and it is to were that these
crafty men and werkmen ben soueraynly proffytable unto the world / and without
artificers and werkmen the world might not be governed / and know thou verily
that all tho things that been engendrid on the earth and on the sea. ben maad
and formed for to do proffyt unto the signage of man. For man was formed for to
have generation / that the men might help and proffyt each other / And here in
ought we to follow nature / For she shows to us that we should do common
proffyt one to another. and the first fondement of Justice is that no man should
noye ne grieve other but that they ought do the comen proffyt For men say in
reproach. that I see of thyn. I hope it shall be mine / but who is he in these
days that entendeth more to the common proffyt than to his own / certeynly
none but alwey a man ought to have dread and fere of his own hows / when he
sees his neighbors hows afyre. And therefore ought men gladly help the common
prouffyt / for men otherwhyle set not by a lytyl fire and might quench hit
in the beginning / that afterward makes a great blasygng fire and fortune has
of no thing so great pleasure as for to torn and work alwey / and nature is so
noble a thing that where as she is she will sustain and keep. but this rewle of
nature has faylled long time. How well that the decree says that all the
things that been against the law of nature ought to be taken awey and put a
part / And he says tofore in the viij distinccion that the eight law of
nature defferenceth often times fro custom and sta^^tes establisshyd / For by
law of nature al thing ought to be common to every man / and this law was of
old time. and men wene yet specially that the trojans stepped this law. and we
read that the multitude of the trojans was one heart and one sowle^ and verayly
we find that in time passid the philosophres did the same. And also it is to
be supposid that such as have their goods comune and not propre is most
acceptable to god. ffor ellis would not these religyous men as monks freres
chanons obseruauntes and al other auowe hem and keep the wylful pouerte that
they ben professyd to. For in troth I have my self ben conuersaunt in a
religious hows of whyt freres at gaunt which have al thing in common among
them. and not one richer than another in so much that if a man gaf to a friar
iij d or iiij d to pray for him in his mass / as soon as the mass is don he
delyueryth hit to his ouerest or procuratour in which hows ben many virtuous
and devout freris / and if that life were not the best and the most holiest.
holy church would never suffer hit in religyon / And according thereto we read
in plato which says that the cite is well and Justly governed and ordained in
the which no man may say by right / by custom ne by ordenau^ce. this is mine.
But I say to the certeynly that sythen this custom came forth to say this is
mine. and this is thyn. no man thought to prefer the common prouffyt so much
as his own. and al werkmen ought to be wise and well aduysed so that they have
none envy ne none evil suspetion one to another / For god will that our humayn
nature be covetous of two things / that is of religyon and of wysedom / but in
this caas ben so^me often times decey / ued / For they take often times
religyon and leave wysedom and they take wysedom and refuse religion / And none
may be very and true with out other^ for it apperteyneth not to a wise man to
do any thing that he may repent him of hit / and he ought to do no thing
against his will / But to do al thing nobly* mourely / fermely and honestly /
and if he have envy upon any / hit is folly / for he on whom he has envy is
more honest and of more hauoyr than he which is so enuyous / For a man may
have none envy on another. but by cause he is more fortunat and has more
grace than him self / for envy is a sorrow of courage that comes of this
ordenau^ce of the prouffyt of another man and know thou verily that he that is
full of bounte shall never have envy of another. but thenuyous man sees and
thinks alwey that every man is more noble. and more fortunat than him self /
and says alwey to him self that man wynneth more than I / and mine neighbors
have more plente of bestes / and her things multeplye more than mine / and
therefore thou ought know that envy is the most grettest dedely sin that
is / For she tormenteth him that has her within him / without tormentyng or
doing any harm to him. on whom he has envy / And an enuyous man has no
virtue in him self For he corrumpeth him self for as much as he hates alwey
the welthe and virtues of other / And thus ought they to keep them that they
take none evil suspecion. for a man naturelly when his affeccion has suspecion
in any man that he weneth that he does. hit seems to him verily that it is
don. And it is an evil thing for a man to have suspecion on him self / For we
read that dyonyse of zecyle a tyrant. was so suspecious that he had so great
fere and dread. for as much as he was hated of all men / that he put his
friends out of their offices that they had and put other strangers in their
places for to keep his body / and chese such as were right cruel and felons /
and for fere and doubt of the harbors. he made his daughters to learn shave
and kembe / and when they were great / he would not they should use any iron to
be occupied by them but to brenne and senge his heeris / and menaced them and
durst not trust in them. And in like wise they had none affyaunce in him. and
also he did do enuyronne the place where he lay with great dyches and broad
like a castle. and he entrid by a draw bridge which closid after him. and his
knights lay without with his gardes which watched and kept straytly this
forteresse / and when plato saw this said dionyse king of zecille thus
enuyroned and set about with gardes and watchemen for the cause of his
suspescion / said to him openly tofore all men king why have thou don so
much evil and harm / that the behooves to be kept with so much people / and
therefore I say that it apperteyneth not to any man that will truly behave him
self in his works to be suspecious / and also they ought to be strong and
seure in their werkys / and specially they that (...) masters and ma^^^n^s in
the (...) they be timorous and fearful they should make (...) them that been in
their shippis / that knew not the parilles. and so hit might happen that by
that dread and fere al men should live their labor / and so they might be
perisshed and dispeyrid in their corages. For a ship is soon perisshed and
lost by a litil tempest / when the governor faylleth to govern his ship for
dread / and can give no counceyl to other / then it is no meruaylle. though
they be aferde that been in his governance. And therefore ought to be in them
strength. force and courage and ought to considere the paryls that might fall.
and the governor specially ought not to doubt / and if hit happyn that any
parril fall / he ought to promise to the other good hoop. and hit aperteyneth
well / that a man of good and hardy courage be set in that office. in such
wise that he have ferme and seure mind against the parylles that often times
happen in the sea. and with this ought the maronners have good and ferme
creaunce and believe in god. and to be of good recomforte and of fair langage
unto them that he governs in such parellys / And this suffyseth to you as
touching the laborers.

The third chappytre of the (...) book tends of the office of notaries
aduocate^ s^^yue^are and (...) or (...) capitulo (...)


tHe third pawn which is set tofore the alphyn on the right side ought to be
fygured as a clerk / and hit is reason that he should so be / for as much as
emonge the comune people of whom we speak in this book they plete the
differences contencions and causes other while the which behooves the alphyns
to give sentence and Judge as Iuges / and hit is reason that the alphyn or Judge
have his notarye / by whom the process may be wreton. And this pawn ought to
be maad and figured in this manners He must be made like a man that holds in
his right hand a payr of she^s / or forcettis / and in the lyf^ hand a great
knyf and on his gurdel a p^nner and an y^^^n. and on his tere a pen to write
with / and that been the Instrumentis and the offices that been maad and put be
in writing autentique and ought to have passyd tofore the Iuges as libelles
writes condempnacione and sentences and that is signefied by the scripture and
the pen / and on that other part hit aperteyneth to them to cut clothe
shere. dyght and dye. and that is signefyed by the forcettis or sh^ris / and
the other ought to shave berdis and kembe the heeris. and the other ben
coupers^ coryers tawyers / skynners louchers / and kordwanners^ and these ben
signefyed by the knyf that he holds in his hand. and so^me of these foresaid
crafty men been named drapers or clothmakers for so much as they work with
wolle. and the notaries skynnars Coryours and cordwaners work by skynnes and
hydes. as perchymyn velume / peltrie and cordewan / and the tayllours cutters
of cloth / weuars^ fullars / dyers. and many other crafts ocupyt and use
wulle. and al these crafty men and many other that I have not named ought to do
their craft and mestier. where as they ben duly ordeynyd curiously and trewly /
Also there ought to be among these crafty men amyable company and true
honest countenance / And truth in their words / And hit is to wete that the
notaryes ben right prouffytable and ought to be good and true for the common.
And they ought to keep them from appropryyng to them self that thing that
aperteyneth to the common / And if they be good to them self / they ben good to
other and if they be evil for them self / they ben evil for other And the
processes that been maad tofore the Iuges ought to ben wreton and passyd by
them. And it is to wete that by their writing in the processis may come much
prociffit And also if they write otherwise than they ought to do may ensewe
much harm and damage to the common / Therefore ought they to take good head
that they change not ne corumpe in no wise the content of the sentence / for
than ben they first forsworn / and ben bounden to make amendis to them that by
their trecherye they have endomaged / and also ought they to read visit and to
know the statutes / ordenaunces and the laws of the citete of the contre
where they dwell and enhabite. and they ought to considere if there be any
thing therein contained against right and reason. and if they find any thing
contrary. they ought to admoneste and warn them that govern. that such
things may be changed in to better estate / for custume establisshed against
good manners and against the faith. ought not to be holden by right. For as hit
is said in the decree in the chappytre tofore / all ordenaunce maad against
right ought to be holden for naught / Alas who is now that advocate or notarye
that has charge to write and keep sentence that puts his entente to kept
more the common prouffyt or as much as his owen. but all dread of god is put
aback. And they deceive the simple men / and drawn them to the courts
disordenatly and constrayne them to swear and make oaths not couenable / and in
assemblyng the people thus to gyder they make mo traysons in the cytees then
they make good alyaunces. And otherwhile they deceive their souerayns / when
they may do hit covertly / For there is no thing at this day that so much
greueth rome and Italy as does the college of notaryes and advocates public
/ for they ben not of one accord. Alas and in Engelond what hurt done the
advocates men of law and attorneyes of court to the common people of the royame
as well in the spirituel law as in the temporalle. how torn they the law and
statutes at their pleasure / how ete they the people / how enpouere they the
comynte / I suppose that in all cristendom are not so many pletares attorneys
and men of the law as been in england only. for if they were nombrid all
that long to the courts of the chaunserye^ kings benche^ common place^ cheker
/ ressayt / and hell / and the bag berars of the same / hit should amounte to
a great multitude. And how al these live and of whom / if hit should be vttrid
and told / hit should not be believed for they entende to their synguler well
and prouffyt and not to the common / how well they ought to be of good will to
gyder. And admoneste and warn the cytees each in his right in such wise that
they might have pees and love one with another. and Tullyus says that
frendshyp and good will that one ought to have against another for the well of
him that he loves. with the semblable will of him / ought to be put forth
tofore al other things. and there is no thing so rese^blyng and like to the
bees that maken honey ne so couenable in prosperity and in aduersite as is love.
For by love gladly the bees holden them to gyder.

and if any trespace to that other anon they run upon the malefactor for to
punysshe him. and very true love faylleth never for well ne for evil and the
most sweet and the most comfortyng thing is for to have a friend to who^ a man
may say his secret as well as to him self / but verayly amytye and frendshyp is
sometime founded upon so^me thing delectable. and this amytie comes of young the
in the which dwellith a disordynate hete / and otherwhile amytie is founded
upon honest / and this amytie is virtuous / of the which tullyus says that
there is an amytie virtuous by the which a man ought to do to his friend all that he requires by reason / for for to do to him a thing dishonest it is
against the nature of very frendshyp and amytye And thus for frendshyp ne for
favor a man ought not to do any thing unreasonable against the common prouffyt
ner against his faith ne against his oath / For if all tho things that the
friends desire and require were accomplisshed and done / hit should seem that
they should be dyshoneste coniuracions / And they might otherwhyle more grieve
and hurt than proffyte and aid / And hereof says Seneque that Amytye is of
such will as the friend will. And to refuse that ought to be refused by
reason. And yet he says more^ that a man ought to allow and preise his friend
tofore the people / and to correct and to chastyse him pryuely / for the law
of amytie is such. for a man ought not to demand ner do to be done to his
friend no vylayns thing that ought to be kept secret And Valerian says that
it is a foul thing and an evil excusasion. if a man confess that he has
done any evil for his friend against right and reason. And says that there was
a good man named ^ssyle which herd one his friend require of him a thing
dishoneste which he denied and would not do / and than his friend said to him
in great despyte what need have I of thy friendship and amytes when thou we lt
not do that thing that I require of the. and tassile answered to him. what need
have I of the friendship and of the amyte of the. if I should do for the thing
dishonest and thus love is founded otherwhile. upon good prouffytable / and
this love endures as long as he sees his prouffyt. and hereof men say a common
proverb in england / that love lasts as long as the money endurith / and
when the money failleth than there is no love / and varro rehercith in his
so^mes / that the rich men ben al louyd by this love. for their friends ben
like as the husk which is about the grayn. and no man may prove his friend so
well as in aduersite / or when he is ponre. for the very true friend fails
at no need / and seneque says that so^me follow the emperor for riches / and
so don the flies the honey for the swetenes and the wolf the carayn. And these
company follow the pray / and not the man. And Tullyus says that tarquyn the
proud had a neuewe of his suster which was named brutus^ and this neuewe had
banysshed tarquyn out of rome and had sent him in exyle. And than said he first
that he parceyued and finewe his friends which were true and untrue. and
that he never perceived before time when he was puyssaunt for to do their will
/ and said well that the love that they had to him / endured not but as long as
hit was to them prouffytable.

and therefore ought all the rich men of the world take heed be they kings
princes or ducked to what people they do prouffyt and how they may and ought
be louyd of their people. For cathon says in his book / see to whom thou
geuest. and this love which is founded upon their prouffit which fails and
endures not / may better be callid and said marchaundyse than love / for if we
repute this love to our prouffyt only. and no thing to the pur^ffyt of him
that we love / it is more marchaundyse than love / for he byeth our love for
the prouffyt that he does to us / And therefore says the versefier these two
versis^ Tempore feleci multi numerantur amici / Cum fortuna perit nullus amicus
erit^ Which is to say in englissh that as long as a man is ewrous and
fortunat he has many friends but when fortune torneth and perissheth / there
abides not to him one friend. and of this love ben loved the meadows / feldes
/ trees and the bestys for the prouffyt that men take of them / but the love of
the men ought to be charity very gracious and pure by good faith / And the
very true friends ben known in pure aduersite. And piers alphons says in
his book of Moralite that there was a phylosophre in Arabye that had an only
sone / of whom he demanded what friends he had gotten him in his life And he
answered that he had many / and his fader said to him. I am an old man and yet
could I never find but one friend in all my life / and I trow verily that it is
no lytyl thing for to have a friend / and hit is well gretter and more a man to
have many / and hit apperteyneth and behooves a man to assaye and preue his
friend or he have need and then commanded the philosopher his sone^ that he
should goo and slay a swyne / and put hit in a sa^^^ / and feign that it were a
man deed that he had slain and be^ hit to his friends for to burye hit secretly
/ And when the sone had don as his fader commanded him and had required his
friends one after another as before is said / they denied him and answered to him
that he was a vylayne to require and desire of them thing that was so perilous^
And than he came again to his fader and said to him how he had required al his
friends. And that he had not founden one that would help him in his need* And
than his fader said to him that he should goo and require his friend which had
but one^ and require him that he should help him in his need. and when he had
required him / Anon he put out al his main out of his hows. and when they
were out of the way or a slepe^ ^e did do make secretly a pytt^^^ the ground
/ and when but was ready and would have buried the body / he found ^^t an hog
or a swyne and not a man / and thus this so^e preuyd this man to be a very
true friend of his fader And preuyd that his friends were falls friends of
fortune / And yet reherceth the said piers Alphons^ that there were two
merchants one of bandach and that other of Egypt which were so joined to
geder by so great frendshyp that he of bandache came on a time for to se his
friend in Egypt of whom he was receyuyd right honuurably* And this merchant of
Egypt had in his hows a fair young maiden whom he should have had in marriage to
him self / Of the which maid this merchant of ban^ach was esprised with her
love so ordantly that he was right seek / and that men supposid him to dye. And
than the other did do come the phisisiens which said that in him was no
sestenes sauf passion of love / Then he ^oyd of the seek man if there were
any woman in his howes that he loved and maad all the women of his howes to come
tofore him / And than he chees her that should have been that others wife and said
that he was seek for her. Than his friend said to him. friend comfort your
self / for trewly I give her to you to wife with all the dowaire that is given
to me with her and had lever to suffer to be with out wife than to lose the body
of his friend / And than he of bandach wedded the maid. And went with his wife
and with his richesse ageyn in to his contre And after this anon after hit
happend that the merchant of Egypt became so pour by evil fortune. that he
was constreyned to seche and beg his breed / by the contray in so much that
he came to bandach / and when he entrid in to the town hit was derk night that
he could not find the hows of his friend / But went and lay thye night in an
old temple / And on the morn when he should issue out of the temple / the
officers of the town arestyd him and said that he was an homycide and had slain
a man which lay there deed / And anon he confessid hit with a good will. and
had lever to ben hangryd. than to dye in that miserable and pour life that he
suffryd. And thus when he was brought to Judgment. and sentence should have been
given against him as an homycide. His friend of bandach came and saw him and
anon knew that this was his good friend of egypt. And forthwyth stepte in
and said that he him self was calpable of the death of this man and not that
other / and enforced him in all manners for to deliver and excuse that other /
And than when that he that had d^on the feet and had slain the man saw this
thing / he considerid in him self that these two men were innocent / of this
feet. And doubtyng the dyuyne Judgment. he came tofore the Judge and confessyd
all the feet by order / And when the Judge saw and herd al this matter and also
the causes he considered the ferme and true love that was between the two
friends and understood the cause why that one would save that other and the
troth of the fayte of the homycide. And than he pardoned all the feet holy and
entierly. And after the merchant of bandach brought him of egypt with him in
to his howes / And gaf to him his sister in marriage / and departed to him half
his goods. and so both of hem were rich / and thus were they both very
faithful and true friends. Furthermore notaries / men of law and crafty men
should and ought to love each other and also ought to be contynent chaste and
honest / For by their crafts they ought so to be by necessyte. For they
converse and accompanye them often time with women / And therefore hit
appo^teyneth to them to be chaste and honest / And that they meue not the
women not entyse them to lawghe and Iape by any dysordynate ensigns or tokenes
/ Titus liuius reherceth that the philosopher democreon did do put out his
eyes for as much as he might not behold the women with out flesshly desire.
And how well it is said before that he did hit for other certain cause yet was
this one of the pryncipal causes. And valerian tellyth that there was a young
man of rome of right excellent beaulte And how well that he was right chaste.
for as much as his beaulte meuyd many women to desire him / in so much that he
understood that the parents and friends of them had suspecion in him / he did
his vysage to be kutte with a knyf and lancettis endlong and euerthwart for to
deforme his vysage. and had lever have a foul vysage and disformed. than the
beauty of his vysage should meue other to sin And also we read that there was
a Nonne a virgyne did do put out both her eyen^ For as much as the beauty of
her eyes meuyd a king to love her / which eyes she send to the king in a
present. And also we read that plato the right rich philosopher left his own
land and contre. and chase his mansion and dwelling in achadomye a town /
which was not only destroyed but also was full of pestelence / so that by the
cure and charge and customau^ce of sorrow that he there suffrid. might eschew
the hetes and occasions of lecherye / And many of his dysciples did in like
wise / helemand reherceth that demostenes the philosopher lay ones by a noble
woman for his dysporte / and playeng with her / he demanded of her what he
should give to have to do with her / and she answered to him a thousand pens.
and he said ageyn to her I should repent me to bye hit so dear. and when he
aduysed him that he was so sore chauffyd to speak to her for to accomplisshe
his flesshly desire. he despoyled him al nakyd and went and put him in the
mids of the snow / And Ouyde rehercith that this thing is the left that
may help and most grieve the lovers / and therefore saint augustyn rehercith in
his book de ciuitate dei that there was a right noble remayn named Marculian
that wan and took the noble cite of Siracuse / And tofore ^ he did do assail
hit or be fight hit / and or he had do beshedde any blood he wept and shed
many teeris tofore the cite / and that was for the cause that he doubted that
his people should defoule and corumpt to much dishonestly the chastyte of the
town. and ordained upon pain of death that no man should be so hardy to take and
defoyle any woman by force what that ever she were. After this the crafty men
ought to understand for to be trewe^ and to have troth in her mouths / And
that their deeds follow their wordes^ For he that says one thing and does
another / he condempneth him self by his word / also they ought to see well to
that they be of one accord in good / by entende / by word / and by deed. so
that they be not discordaunt in no caas / But that every man have pure verite
and troth in him self. For god him self is pure verite / and men say comynly
that troth seeks none hernes ne corners^ and troth is a virtue by the which
all dread and fraud is put awey / Men say trewly when they say that they
know. And they that know not truth. ought to know hit / And alwey use
trouthe^ for saint austyn says that they that wene to know troth. and lives
evil and vyciously it is folly if he knows hit not / and also he says in an
other place that it is better to suffer pain for troth / than for to have a
benefete by falsnes or by flaterye. And man that is called a best reasonable
and does not his werkys after reason and truth. is more bestyal that any best
brute^ and know ye that for to come to the truth / hit comes of a reasonable
forsight in his mynde^ And lyeng comes of an outtrageous and contrary thought
in his mind / for he that lies wittyngly / knows well that hit is against
the truth that he thinks / and hereof speaks saint bernard and says. that
the mouth that lies destroys the soul. and yet says saint austyn in
another place. for to say one thing and do the contrary / makes doctrine
suspecious. And know ye verily that for to lie is a right perilous thing to
body and soul / For the lie that the ancient enemy maad eve and Adam to
believe him / made hem for to be dampened with all their lignage to the death
pardurable / and made hem to be cast out of paradyse terrestre / For he maad
them to believe that god had not forboden them the fruit / but only by cause
they should not know that her master knew / but how well that the devil said
these words / yet had he double entente to hem both / For they knew anon as
they had tastyd of the fruit that they were dampened to the death pardurable^

And god knew hit well tofore^ but they supposid well to have known many other
things / and to be like unto his knowleche and science. And therefore says
saint poule in a pistyl^ hit ne apperteyneth to sauer or know more than
behooves to sauer or know / but to sauer or know by mesure or sobrenes / And
valerian rehercith that there was a good woman of firacusant that would not lie
unto the king of Secille which was named dyoryse^ and this king was so full of
tyranny and so cruel that all the world desired his death and cursid him. S^uf
this woman only which was so old that she had seen iij or four kings
reignyng in the contre. and every morning as soon as she was risen she prayed
to god that he would give unto the tyrant good life and long / and that she
might never see his death / And when the king dyonyse knew this he sent for her
/ and meruaylled much hereof / for he knew well that he was sore behated / and
demanded her. what cause meuyd her to pray for him / and she answered and said
to him. sir when I was a maid we had a right evil tyrant to our king of whom
we coueyted sore the death / and when he was deed there came after him a werse /
of whom we coueyted also the death. and when we were delyuerd of him. thou
came to be our lord which art worst of al other. and now I doubt if we have
one after the be shall be worse than thou art / and therefore I shall pray for
the / and when dyonyse understood that she was so hardy in saying the troth /
he durst not do torment her for shame by cause she was so old.

The fourth chap^itre of the third book (...) of the fou^th pa^^ and of the
(...)


tHe fourth pawn is set tofore the king. and is formed in the form of a man
holdyng in his right hand a balaunce and the weight in the lift hand. and
tofore him a table / and at his gurdel a purse full of money ready for to give to
them that required hit. and by this people ben signefyed the merchants of
cloth lynnen and woollen / and of al other marchaundyses / and by the table that
is tofore him is signefyed the chaungers^ and they that lene money / and they
that bye and selle by the weight ben signefyed by the balaunces / and weyghtes
And the (...) and (...) of (...) and of money (...) by the (...) ye that all
they (...) signified by this people ought to (...) avarice and co^^tyse and
eschew brekyng of the ^yes of payment and ought to hold and keep their
promys^ (...) ought also to render and restore that that is given to them to
keep / and therefore hit i^ reason that this people be set tofore the king for as
much as they signefye the receyuours of the tresours tyal that ought alwey to
be ready tofore the king. and to answer for him to the knights and to other
persons for their wages and souldyes / and therefore have I said that they
ought to flee avarice. For avarice is as much to say as an adourer or as
worshyper of fallen images / and hereof says tullyus that avarice is a couetise
to get that thing that is above necessite / and it is a love disordynate to
have any thing / and it is one of the werst things that is and specially to
princes and to them that govern the things of the comunete. and this vice
causes a man to do evil and this doing evil is when hit reygneth in old men
/ and hereof says Seneque^ that all worldly things ben mortefyed and
appetissed in old men reseruyd avarice only which alwey abides with him and
dies with him / But I understand not well the cause whereof this comes ne
wherefore hit may be / And hit is a foul thing and contrary to reson^ that
when a man is at the end of his Journey for to length his viage and to
ordeyne more vitayl than him behooves / and this may well be likned to the
auaricious wolf. for the wolf does never good till he be deed / and thus it is
said in the prouerbys of the wise men that th^uaricious man does no good till
that he be deed. and he desires no thing but to live long in this sin / for
the courtous man certeynly is not good for any thing for he is evil to him self
and to the rich and to the poure^ and fyndeth cause to gaynsay their desire /
and hereof whercith seneque and says that antigonus was a covetous paynce / and
when tynque which was his friend required of him a be saunt / he answered to
him that he demanded more than hit apperteyned to him / and than tynque
constrained by great necessite axid and required of him a penny / and he answered
to him that it was no yefte couenable for a king. and so he was alwey ready to
find a cause naught to give. For he might have given to him a besaunt as a
king to his friend / and the penny as to a pour man. and there is no thing so
litil but that the humanyte of a king may give hit / auariceful of couetise is
a manner of al vices of luxurye and Josephus whercith in the book of ancient
histories / that there was in rome a right noble lady named paulyne / and was of
the most noble of rome. right honest for the noblesse of chastity / which was
married in the time that the wommen glorefyed them in their chastyte unto a
young man / fair noble^ and rich above al other^ and was like and semblable to
his wife in all caasis. And this pawlyne was beloved of a knight named
enymerancian and was so ardantly esprised in her love that he sent to her morny
right rich yeftes / and made to her many great promyses / but he might never
torn the heart of her which was on her side also cold and hard / as marbyll
/ But she had lever to refuse his yeftes and his promyses. Than to intend to
couetyse and to lose her chastyte / and we read also in the histories of rome
that there was a noble lady of rome which lived a solytarye life and was chaste
and honest. and had gadrid to geder a great so^me of gold. and had hyd hit in
the earth in a pytte with in her hows / and when she was deed / the bishop did
do burye her in the church well and honestly / and anon after this gold was
fou^den and born to the bishop / and the bishop had to cast hit in to the
pytte where she was buried. and three days men herd her cry and make great
noise / and say that she brenned in great pain and they herd her often times
thus tormentid in the cherche. the neighbors went unto the bishop and told
him thereof / and the bishop gaf hem leave to open the sepulcre. and when they
had opened hit^ they fond all the gold molten with fire full of sulphre^ and
was poured and put in her mouth and they herd one say. thou desiredest this
gold by couetyse. take hit and drink hit / And then they took the body out
of the tomb / And hit was cast out in a preuy place^ Seneque rehercith in the
boook of the cries of women that auaryce is foundement of all vices / And
valerian rehercith that avarice is a ferdful guard or kepar of richessis. for
he that has on him or in his keppyng much money or other richessis^ is alwey
aferd to lose hit or to be robbid or to be slain therfore^ and he is not
ewrousner happy that by couetise getith hit / and all the euyls of this vice of
avarice had a man of rome named septenulle / for he was a friend of one named
tarchus / and this septenulla brent so sore and so cruelly in this sin of
couetise. that he had no shame to smite of the head of his friend by trayson For
as much as one framofian had promised to him as much weight of pure gold as
the heed wayed. and he bare the said heed upon a staf through the cite of rome^
and he voyded the brayn out thereof and filled hit full of ^eed for to weye the
heuyar / this was a right horrible and cruel avarice Ptolome king of egipciens
poursewed avarice in another manner. for when anthony emperor of rome saw
that he was right rich of gold and silver / he had him in great hate and
tormentid him right cruelly / and when he should perissh by cause of his
richessis. he took al his hauoir and put hit in a ship / and went with all
in to the hye see to the end for to drown and perissh there the ship and his
richesses by cause anthonye his enemy should not have hit / and when he was
there he durst not perisshe hit ner might not find in hyes heart to depart
from hit. but came and brought hit again in to his bows where he receyuyd the
reward of death therefore and with out doubt he was not lord of the richesse
but the richesse was lady over him / and therefore hit is said in proverb that
a man ought to seignorie over the riches / and not for to serve hit. and if
thou can dewly use thy richesse than she is thy chamberer. and if thou can
not depart from hit a use hit honestly at thy pleasure. know verily that she
is thy lady / for the riches never satisfyeth the covetous / but the more he
has the more he desires / and saluste says that avarice destroubleth faith /
poeste / honest and al thise other good virtues / And takes for these virtues
/ pride / cruelte and to forgete god. and says that al things be vendable And
after this they ought to be ware that they lene not to much ner make so great
creat^es by which they may fall in pouerte / for saint ambrose says upon
thoby. pouerte has no law / for to owe hit is a shame / and to owe and not
pay is a more shame. if thou be pour beware how thou lo rowest. and think
how thou may pay and render again if thou be rich thou have no need to
borowe and axe. and it is said in the prouerbis that hit is fraud to take that
thou wylt not ner may render and pay again. and also hit is said in reproach
when I lene I am thy friend / and when I aye I am thyn enemy. as who says /
god at the lenyng / and the devil at rendryng. and seneke says in his
auctorites / that they that gladly borowe / ought gladly to pay. and ought to
furmolite in courage to love hem the better by cause they lene hem and aid hem
in her need. for benefetes and good tornes don to a man / ought to give him
thankynges therefore / and much more ought a man to repaye that is lent him in
his need. but now in these days many men by lenyng of their money have made of
their friends enemies. and hereof speaks domas the philosopher and says that
my friend borrowed money of me / and I have lost my friend and my money there
was a merchant of gene and also a chaungeour w^^s name was albert ganor / and
this albert was a man of great troth and loyalte. for on a time there was a
man came to him and said and affermyd that he had desyueryd in to his bank v
hundred floryns of gold to keep which was not troth for he lied. which v C
floryns the said albert knew not of / ner could find in all his books any
such money to him due / and this liar could bring no wytnes^ but began to
braye^ cry and deffame the said albert / and than this albert called to him
this merchant and said dear friend take here v hundred florene which thou
offer: mest and say that thou have delyuerd to me. and forthwyth told him
and took him to hym^ and lo this good man had lever to lose his good than his
good name and renome ^ and this other merchant took these florens that he had
wrongfully receyuyd. and enployed them in diverse marchaundyse in so much that
he gate and encresed and wan with them xv thousand florens / and when he saw
that he approached toward his deth^ and that he had no children / he
establisshed albert his heyr in all things / and said that with the v hundred
florens that he had receyuyd of abbert falsely / he had gotten all that he had
in the world / and thus by deuyne purueau^ce he that had be a thief fraudelent
/ was maad afterward a true procurour and atorney of the said albert / but now
in these days there be marchau^tis that do marchaundise with other mennys
money which is taken to hem to keep. and when they ben required to repaye hit
/ they have no shame to deny hit appertly / whereof hit happe^d that there was a
merchant which had a good and a great name and renome of keeping well such
things as was delyuerd to him to keep. but when he saw place and time / he
reteynyd hit like a thief. so hit befell that a merchant of without forth herd
the good report and fame of this man / came to him and delyuerd him great
tresour to keep / and this cresour abode in year in his keeping / and after this
three year this merchant came and required to have his good delyuerd to him
agayn^ And this man knew well that he had no record ne witness / to preue on
him this duete / nor he had no obligacion ne writing of him therof^ In such
wise that he denied al entierly and say plainly he knew him not. and when
this good man herd and understood this. he went sorowfully. and keeping from him
so ferce and long that an old woman met with hym^ and demanded of him the
cause of his weeping ^ and he said to her woman hit aperteyneth no thing to the
goo thy way / And she prayed him that he would tell her the cause of his
sorrow / For perauenture she might give him counceyl good and proffytable / and
then this man told to her by order the caas of his fortune / and the old
woman that was wise and subtle demanded of him if he had in that cite any
friend which would be faithful and true to him / and he said ye. that he had
diverse friends. Than said she goo thou to them and say to them that they do
ordeyne and bye dyuerce cofres and chestes. And that they do fylle them with
some old things of no value / and that they feign and say that they be full of
gold silver and other Jewels. and of much great tresour / and then that
they bring them to this said merchant / and to say to him that he would keep
the^. for as much as they had great trust in him / and also that they have
herd of his great troth and good renome / and also they would go in to fer
contre / and should be long or they returned again / and whills they speak to
him of this matter / thou shall come upon them and require him that he too
deliver to the ^ that thou tokest to hym^ and I trow by cause of tho good men
that than shall proffre to him the said tresour / and for the couetise to have
hit / he shall deliver to the thy good again / but beware late him not know
they ben thy good friends ner of thy knowleche This was a great and good
counceyl of a woman / and verily it comes of nature often times to woman to
give counceyl sh^^lly and unadvisedly to things that been in doubt or perilous
and needs hasty remedy. and as ye have herd. this good man did. and did afte^
her counceyl. and came upon them when they sp^ck of the matter to the merchant
for to deliver to him the said cofres to keep which his friends had feigned and
required of him that he had taken to him to keep / and than anon the said
merchant said to him I know the now well. for I have aduysed me that thou art
such a men / and came to me such a time / and delivered to me such a
thing which I have well kept / and then called his clerk^ and bad him goo
fetch such a thing in such a place and deliver hit to that good man / for he
delyuerd hit to me / and than the good man receyuyd his good / and went his
way right Ioyously and glad. and this merchant trichour and deceyuour was
defrauded from his evil malice. and he ne had neither that one ne that other
any thing that was of value. and therefore hit is said in proverb to defraude
the begiler is no fraud / and he that does well follows our lord / and seneke
says that charity enseigneth and techeth that men should pay well / for good
payement is sometime good confession / And this merchant trichour and deceyuour
resemblith and is like to an hound that bears a chese in his mouth when he
swymmeth over a water / for when he is on the watre. he sees the shadow of
the chese in the watre / and than he weneth hit be another chese and for
couetyse to have that. he openyth his mouth to catch th^^ and than the chese
that he bare fallith (...) in to the watre^ and thus he loses both the and in
the same wise was served this merchant deceyuour / for for to have the cofres
which he had not seen / he delyuerd again that he would have holden wrongfully.
and thus by his couetise and propre malice he was deceyuyd. and therefore hit
apperteyneth to every good and wise man to know and considere in him self how
much he has received of other men. and upon what co^dycion hit was delyuerd
to him / and it is to wete that this thing apperteyneth to receyuours and to
chaungeours^ and to all true marchauntis and other what that someuer they be
/ and ought to keep their books of resaytes and of payementes of whom and to
whom and what time and day / and if ye demand what thing makyth them to
forgete such things as ben taken to them to ke^^ I answer and say that it is
great couetise for to have the things to them self and never to depart from
them / and hit is all her thought and desire to assemble all the goods that
they may get. for they believe on none other god / But on her richesses their
hertes ben so obstynat^ and this suffyseth of the merchants.

The fifthe chappiter of the third book ^^teth of physiciens medicynes spycers
and appotiquaries capitulo v


tHe pawn that is set tofore the queen signefyeth the physicien / spicer
apotiquare ^ and is formed in the figure of a man / and he is set in a chayer
as a maistre and holds in his right hand a book and an ample or a box with
oynementis in his lift hand / and at his gurdel his instrumentis of iron and of
silver for to make Incisions and to search wounds and hurtes. and to cut
apostumes. And by these things ben known the surgyens By the book ben
vnderstonden the phisicienes and all gramariens. logyciens / masters of law /
of geometrye / arsmetrique. music and of astronomye / and by the ampole ben
signefyed the makers of pygmentaries spicers and apotiquaries / and they that
make confeccions and confites and medecynes maad with precious spyce / And by
the fferremens and Instrumentis that hangen on the gurdel ben signefyed the
Surgyens and the masters and know ye forcerteyn that a maystre and physicyen
ought to know the proporcions of lettres of gramayre. the monemens the
conclucions and the sophyms of logique / the gracious speech and veteraunce of
rethorique / the mesures of the hours and dayes^ and of the course of
astronomye. the nombre of arsmetrique. and the joyous songs of music ^ and
of al these tofore named the masters of rethorique ben the chyef masters in
speci^^ tyf. and the two last that been practiciens and wakes ben called
physiciens and surgyens / how well they ben sage and curious in these sciences ^
and how well that ma^nys life is otherwhyle put in thordonaunce of the physicien
or surgyen / if he have not sagesse and wysedom in him self of diverse
wrytynges and is not expert / and medlyth him in the craft of physique / he
ought better be called a slear of people than a phisicien or surgyen. For he may
not be a maystre but if he be sewre and expert in the craft of phisike that he
slay not moo than he cures and makes hoole / and therefore says auycenne in
an anforysme if thou curest the seek man. And know not the cause. whereof the
maladye ought to be cured^ hit ought to be said that thou have cured him by
fortune and hap more than by any kunnyng^ And in all these manner of people
there ought to be meurte of good manners / curtosie of werdes / chastise of the
body promysse of helthe^ and as to them that been seek contynuel vysitacion of
them and they ought to enquere the cause of their sekenessys and the signs
and tokens of their maladyes as is rehercid in the books of the auctours by
right great dyligence / and specially in the books of ypocras galiene and of
auycene / and when many masters and phisiciens ben assemblid tofore the
pacient or seek man. They ought not there to argue and dispute one against
another / but they ought to make good and simple colacion to geder in such
wise as they be not seen in their dysputyng one against another. for to
encroche and get more glory of the world to them self than to trete the salute
and health of the pacient and seek man. I meruaylle why that when they see and
know that when the seek man has great need of health. wherefore than they make
gretter obieccion of contrariousnes for as much as the life of man is demened
and put among them / but hit is by cause that he is reputed most sage and wise
that argues and brings in most subtiltees / And all this manner is among
doctors of law that tretith no thing of man's life / but of temporel things
that he is holden most wise and best learned / that by his counceyl can best
accord the contencions and dyssencions of men / and therefore ought the
phisiciens and surgyens leave when they be tofore the seek men al discencions
and contrariousnes of wordes^ in such wise that hit appear that they study
more for to cure the seek men than for to despute / And therefore is the
phisicien duly set tofore the queen. so that it is figured that he ought to
have in him self chastyte and contynence of body / For hit apperteyneth some
time unto the phisicien to vysite and cure queen's duchesses and countesses and
all other ladies and see and behold some secret sekenessis that fall and
come other while in the secretis of nature. And therefore hit aperteyneth to
them that they be chaste and follow honest and chastyte / and that they be
ensaumple to other of good contynence^ For valerian rehercith that ypocras was
of meruayllous contynence of his body. For when he was in the scoles of athenes
/ he had by him a right fair woman which was common / and the young scolers and
the Ioly felawes that were students promised to the woman a besaunte if she
might or could torn the courage of ypocras for to have to done with her / and
she came to him by night and did so much by her craft that she lay with him
in his bed / But she could never do so much that she might corumpe his
chaste living ne defoule the crown of his conscience. and when the young men
knew that she had been with him all the night. and could not change his
contynence. they began to mocque her / and to aye and demand of her the
besaunt that they had given to her. And she answered that hit was holden and
gaged upon an image / for as much as she might not change his contynence she
called him an image / and in semblable wise rehercith valeryan of Scenocrates
philosopher that there lay with him a woman all night and tempted him
dysordonatly / but that right chaste man. made never semblaunt to her / ner he
never remeuyd from his freme purpoos / in such wise as she departed from him
al confused and shamed / Cornelius scipion that was sent by the romans for to
govern spayn / as soon as he entrid in to the castellys and in to the towns
of that land. he began to take aweye al tho things that might stere or meue
his men to becherye. wherefore men said that he drof and chased out of the host
moo than two thousand bourdellys^ and he that was wise knew well that delight of
lecherye corupted and apayred the corages of tho men that been abandoned to the
same delight / And hereof it is said in the fables of the poets in the first
book of the truphes of the philosophres by figure / that they that entrid in to
the fonteyne of the Sirenes or mermaydens / were corumped and they took them
awey with hem / And also ye ought to know that they ought to entende
dylygently to the cures of the infirmytees in cyrurgerye / they ought to make
their plasters according to the wounds of soores if the wound be rounde^ the
enplastre must be round. and if hit be longe^ hit must be long / And other
while hit must be cured by his contrary. like as it apperteyneth to phisique.
for the hete is cured by cold / and the cold by hete and Joy by sorowe^ and
sorrow by Ioye^ and hit happeth often times that much people be in great parille
in taking to much Joy and lose her membris^ and become half benomen in the
sodeyn Joy / and joy is a repleccion of thing that is delectable sprad a
broad in all the members with right great gladness. and al men entende and
desire to have the said right great Joy naturelly / but they know not what
may ensue and come thereof / and this Joy comes other while of virtue of
conscience / And the wise man is not with out this joy / and this Joy is
never interrupt ne in defaulte at no time. for hit ^^eth of nature. and fortune
may not take awey that nature gives / and marcial says that Joys sugetyues
abide not long / but fle awey anone^ and valerian rehercith that he that has
force and strength reasonable. has hit of very matiar of co^plecco^n and that
comes of love / and this Joy has as much power to depart the soul fro the
body^ as has the thondre whereof hit happend that there was a woman named lyna
which had her husbond in the war in the shyppys of the romayns^ and she
supposid verayly that he was deed but hit happend that he came again home. and
as he entrid in to his yate / his wife met with him suddenly not warned of his
coming / which was so glad and Joyous that in enbracyng him she fyl down
deed / Also of another woman to whom was reported by a falls messanger that her
sone was deed. which went hoom soroufully to her hows^ and afterward when her
sone came to her / as soon as she saw him she was so esmourd with Joy that
she deyed tofore hym^ but this is not so great marvel of women as is of the
men. For the women ben lykened unto soft wax or soft air / and therefore she
is called Mulier which is as much to say in latin as mollis aer and in
englissh soft air / and hit happeth often times that the nature of them that been soft and mele. takes so^ner Inpressyon than the nature of men that be
rude and strong valerie rehercith that a knight of rome named instaulofus that
had newly co^querid and subdued the isle of corsilia and as he sat^sfyed his
gods he receyuyd (...) the service of Rome in which were (...) supplications
/ the which when he understood he (...) glad and so enterprised with Joy.
that he (...) what to do / and than a great f^^^^ or smoke yssu^d (...) the

sent a messenger tofore for to tell to them his coming / and commanded him to
say that he came / for they had not long tofore seen him / and that they should

the sone of vaspasian when he had conquered Iherusalem and abode in the contrres
by / he herd that his fader vaspasian was chosen by all the senate for to
govern the empire of rome / wherefore he had so right great joy that suddenly
he lost the strength of al his membris and became al Impotent. And when
Josephus that made the historye of the romans against the Iewys. which was a
right wise phisicien saw and knew the cause of this sekenes of the said
titus. he inquired of his solle if he had in ha^^ any man gretely so much that
he might not here speak of him ne well so him. and one of the seruauntis of
tytus said that he had one person in hate so much / that there was no man in
his court so hardy that durst name him in his presenting (...) Josephus
assigned a day wha^ this man should (...) to be set in the sight of titus /
and did hit to be replenysshed ple^teiously with all dayntees / and ordained men
to be (...) to keep him in such wise that no man should hurt him by the
c^^^^^ment of titus / and ordained bo^t^^^rs / (...) and (...) officers for to
serve him worshipfully like an emperor and when all this was ready / Josephus
brought in this man that titus hated and set him at the table tofore his eyes
and was served of young men with great reverence right curtoisly. and when titus
beheld his enemy set tofore him with so great honor. he began to chauffe
him self by great felonye / and commanded his men that this man should be slain
/ and when he saw / that none would obey him / but that they alwey served him
reverently / he wax so ardant^ and enbracid with so great ire. that he that
had lost all the force and stomach of his body and was al Impotent in all his
members ^ recouerd the health again and strength of his membris by the hete
that entryd in to the wy^es and synewes And Josephus did so much that he was
recoueryd and hoole / And that he held that man no more for his enemy / But
held him for a verey true frende^ And afterward maad him his loyal fellow and
companyoun. And the espycers and apoticaries ought to make trewly such things
as is commanded to them by the phisiciens and they ought accomplisshe their
bills and charge curiously with great diligence. that for none other cause
they should be ocupied but in making medecynes or confecco^ns trewly and that
they ought upon paryl of their soul not to forgete by negligence ne
reche^^snes to give o^^ ^^teryne for an other / in such wise that they be not
s^a^^s of men^ And that they do put no false things in her spices for to
enrayre or encrecyng the weight / for if they so do they may better be called
theuys than espycers or apoticaries / And they that been acustumed to make
oynementis they ought to make it proprely of true stuff and of good odoure
after the receptes of the ancient doctors. and after the form that the
phisiciens and surgiens deuyse unto them also they ought to be ware that for
none avail ne gift that they ought have / that they put in their medecynce no
thing venomous ne doing hurt or scathe to any person of whom they have no
good ne very knowleche to the end that they to whom the medecynes should be
given torn not to them hurt ne damage / ne in destrucco^ns of their neighbors
/ and also that they that have mynystrid the things to them. been not taken
for parteners of the blame and of the sin of them / The surgyens ought also
to be debonayr / amyable / and to have pity of their pacients^ and also they
ought not be hasty to lance and cut apostumes and soores. ne open the
hee^es^ ner to arrache bones broken. but if the cause be apparent. For they
might else lose their good renomee^ And might better be called bouchers then
helare or guarysshours of wounds and sores / And also hit behooves that all
this manner of people a fore said that have the charge for to make hoole and
guarisshe all manner of maladyes and Infirmytees that they first have the cure

The sixte chappitre of the third book treteth of the six^^ pawn which is
lykenyd to cau^ners hostelers and vytayllers capitulo v^



the six^t pawn which stondeth tofore the alphyn on the lyftes side is made in
this form / For hit is a man that has the right hond stratched out as for to
call men / and holds in his lift hand a loof of breed and a ^uppe of wyn.
and on his gurdel hangyng a bondil of keys / and this resemblith the tauerners
hostelers / and sellare^ of vytayl. and these ought properly to be set tofore
the alphyn / as tofore a Judge / For there sourdeth often times among hem
contencion noise and stayf. which behooves to be ditermyned and trayted by the
alphyn. which is Judge of the king / and hit apperteyneth to them for to seek
and enquere for good wynes and good vytayl for to give and selle to the byars^
and to them that they herberowe. And hit aperteyneth to them well to keep their
herberowes and Innes / And all tho things that they bring in to their
lodgyng. and for to put hit in seure and sauf ward and keeping. And the first
of thein is signefyed by the lift hand in which he bears breed and wyn. And
the second is signefyed by the right hand which is stratched out to call men
/ and the third is representyd by the keys hangyng on the gurdel / and these
manner of people ought to eschew the sin of glotonye / For much people come
in to their howses for to drink and for to ete / for which cause they ought
resonably to rewle them self and to refrain them from to much mete and
drynke^ to the end that they might the more honestly deliver things ne^eful
unto the people that come unto them / and no thing by outrage that might noye
the body^ For hit happeth often times that there comes of glotonye* tencions /
stryfs / riottes. wrongs and molestaco^ns by which men lefe otherwhyle their
hands / their eyes and other of their membris / and sometime ben slain or hurt
unto the death as it is wreton in vitas patrum. as on a time kn^^^^^yte went for
to vysite his gossibs. and the devil apo^^^ (...) him on the wey in likeness of
another hermyte (...) ^^mpte him. and said thou have left thyn hermytage / and
(...) to visit thy gossibo / the behooves by force to do one o^ (...) iij
things that I shall say to the / thou shall ^hese wh^^ ^or thou wolt be dronk.
or else have to do flesshlye will (...) gossyb / or ellis thou shall slay her
husbond which in thy gossib also. and the hermyte that thought for to chese
the least evil chase for to be drunk / and when he came unto them he drank so
much that he was very dronk and when he was drunk and eschauffyd with the
wyn^ he would have a do with his gossyb / and her husbond withstood him / and
than the hermyte show hym^ and after that lay by his goss^b and knew her
flesshly. and thus by this sin of dronkenshyp he accomplisshed the two other
sins By which thing ye may understand and know that when the devil will
take one of the castellys of Ihesu Christ. that is to wete the body of a man or
of a woman / he does as a prince that sets a siege tofore a castle that he
would win. which entendeth to win the gate^ For he knows well when he has
won the gate. he may sone do his will with the castle / And in like wise
does the devil with every man and womman / For when he has ^^onne the gate /
that is to wete the gate of the mouth by glotonye or by any other sin.

he may to with the offices of the body al his will as ye have herd tofore /
and therefore ought every man ete and drink soberly in such wise as he may
live / and not live to the glotously and for to drink dronk / ye se comunely
that a great bole is suffisid with right a litil pasture. and that one wode
suffiseth to many olephauntes^ and hit behooves a man to be fed by the earth
or by the sea / nevertheless it is no great thing to feed the belly. no thing so
great as is the desire of many metes whereof Quyntilian says / that hit happeth
often times in great festes and dyners. that we be filled with the sight of the
noble and lichorous metis and when we would ete we ben saciat and filled / and
therefore it is said in proverb. hit is better to fille the belie than the eye.
and lucan says that glotony is the mother of al vices / and especial of
lecherye / and also is destroyar of al goods / and may not have suffysaunce of
lytil thynge^ A covetous honger what sekest thou mete and vytayllis on the
land and in the sea. and thy joy is no thing ellis but to have playnteuous
dysshes and well filled at thy table learn how men may demene their life with
litil thing. and cathon says in no wise obey to glotonye which is friend to
lecherye / and the holy doctor saint augustyn says. the wyn eschauffith the
belly that falls anon to lecherye / the belly and the membris ben neighbors
to lechery. and thus the vice of glotonye provoke lecherye. whereof comes
forgetenes of his mind and destruction of all quyck and sharp reason / And
is cause of distemperaunce of his wits. what sin is fowler than this sin
and more stynkyng ne more do^mageous / for this sin has taken awey the virtue
of man his prowess languyssheth^ his virtue is turned to diffan^^ the
strength of body and of courage is tornes by the / and therefore says basilly
le grant / late us take heed how we serve the belly and the throat by glotanye
like as we were doutl^e bestys / and we study for to be like unto belues of
the sea / to whom nature has given to be alwey enclyned toward the erthe^ and
thereto look for to serve their belyes^ and hereof says / Boecius de
consolacione^ in his fourth book that a man that lives and does not the
conditions of a man^ may never be in good condition / than must he^ needs be
that he be transported in nature of a best or of a belue of the sea / how well
that right great men and women full of meruaylleus sciences and noble counceyl
in these days in the world be norisshed in this glotonye of wynes and metes /
and often times ben over seen^ how suppose ye. is hit not right a perilous thing
that a lord or governor of the people and (...) well how well that he be wise if
he eschaufft him (...) that the wyn or other drink surprise him and overcome
his brayn / his wisdom is lost for as cathon says / Ire enpessheth the courage
in such as he may not keep verite and troth / and anon as he is chauffed
lecherye is meuyd in him in such wise that the lecherye makyth him to meddle
in diverse vylayns deeds / for than his wysedom is a sleep and goon. and
therefore says ouyde in his book or remed^d amoris if thou take many and
dyuerce wynes^ they apparayle and enforce the corages to lecherye^ And Thobye
wytnessyth in his book that luxury destroys the body and mynyssheth
rychessys. she loses the soul. she febleth the strength she blyndeth the
sight and makes the voys hoore and trewe^ he a right evil and foul sin of
dronkenshyp / by the perisshit^ virgyny^^ which is sustes of aungellis
possedyng al goodness and scurte of al Joys perdurable. No^ was one time so
chauffyd with wyn that he discouerd and shewid to his sons his preuy membris
in such wise as one of his sons mocqued him / and that other couerd hem^ and
loath which was a man right chaste. was so ass^^ed by much drynkyng of wyn.
that on a mounteyn he knew his daughters carnelly / and had to do with them
as they had been his propre wyuys / and Crete rehercith that Boece which was
flour of the men / tresour of richesses / synguler house of sapyence / myrrour
of the world / odor of good renomes / and glory of his subgettis lost al
thise things by his luxury. we have seen that dyuerce that were Joined by
great amytie to geder whiles they were sobre^ that that one would put his body
in parell of death for that other and when they were eschauffid with wyn and
drunk / they have run each upon other for to slay hem / and so^me have been
that have slain so his friend / Herodes Antipas had not done saint John baptist
to ben beheded / ne had the dinner ben full of glotonye and dronkship. balthazar
king of babylone had not been chaced out of his kingdom ne be slain if he had
be sobre emonge his people whom tyrus and dares fond* dronken and slew him. The
hostelers ought to be well bespoken and curtoys of words to them that they
receive in to their lodgyng / For fair speech and Joyous chiere and debonayr
cause men to give the hosteler a good name^ And therefore hit is said in a common
proverb curtoyse langage and well saying is much worth and cost lytyl / And
in another place it is said that curtesye passes b^^^^t^^ also for as much as
many parellys and adventures may happen on the ways and passages to hem that
been herberowed with in their Innes. therefore they ought to accompanye them
when they depart and enseigne them the weyes and tell to them the parilles /
to the end that they may surely goo their vyage and Journey. And also they ought
to keep their bodies / their goods. and the good fame and renomce of their
Innes we read that Loath when he had receyuyd the aungellys in to his hows right
debonayrly^ which he had supposid had been mortal men and strangers / to
the end that then should eskape the disordynate and vnnaturel sin of lecherye
of the sodomytes / by the virtue of good faith. he set a part the naturel love
of a fader. and proferd to them his doughters^ which were vyrgyns. to the end
that they should keep them and defend them fro that villayn and horrible sin
And know ye for certain that al tho things that been taken and delyuerd to
keep to the host or hostessis they ought to be sauf and yelden ageyn with out
appayryng^ for the host ought to know who that entrith in to his house for to
be herberowed takith hit for his habitacion for the time he him self / and all
such things as he brings with him ben co^mysed of right in the ward and
keeping of the host or hosteler / and ought to be as sauf as they were put in
his own propre hows. and also such hosts ought to hold servants in their
hows which should be true and with out avarice / in such wise that they
coueyte not to have the goods of their ghestes / and that they take not awey
the prouender fro their horses when hit is given to them / that by tho^musion
thereof their horses perisshe not ne faylle their master when they have need /
and might fall in the hands of their enemies. For than should the seruandes be
cause of that evil. wherefore their masters should see to / for with out doubt
this thing is worse than theft / hit happend on a time in the parties of
lombardye in the cite of Iene that a noble man was lodgyd in an hostelrye with
much company. and when they had given prouendour to their horses. in the
first our of the night the servant of the how came secretly tofore the
horses for to stele awey their prouendes / and when he came to the lords hores
/ the hores caught with his teth his came and held hit fast that he might not
escape / and when the thief saw that he was so strongly holden / he began to
caye for the great pain that he suffrid and felt / in such wise that the
noble mannys meyne came with the host / But in no manner / nor for ought they
could do. they could not take the thief out of the horses mouth unto the time
that the neighbors which were noyed with the noise came and saw hit / and
the thief was known and taken and brought tofore the Judge / and confessyd the
fear and by sentence diffynytyf was hanged and lost his life. and in the same
wise was another that did so / and the hores smote him in the vysage / that the
prynte of the hoar shoo and nails alode ever in his vysage / another caas
right cruel and vilaynous fyl at toulouse / hit happend a young man and his
fader went a pylgremage to Saint James in galies and were lodgy^ in an
hostelrye of an evil host and full of right great couetyse in so much that he
desires and coueyted the goods of the two pilgrims. and here upon aduysed him
and put a cup of silver secretly in the m^^e that the young man ^are^ and
when they departed out of their lodgyng / he followed after hem and said tofore
the people of the court that they had stolen and horn awey his cup and the
young man excused him self and his fader^ and said they were Innocent of that
caas / And then they serchyd hem / and the cup was founden in the male of
the young man / and forthwyth he was dampened to death and hanged as a thief. and
this feet doon^ all the goods that longed to the pilgrim were delyuerd to the
host as confisqued / And than the fader went forth for to do his pylgremage.
and when he came ageyn he must needs come and pass by the place where his sone
hynge on the gybet / and as he came he complained to god and to saint James how
they might suffer this adventure to come unto his sone. anon his sone that
hyng spoke to his fader and said how that saint James had kept him with out
harm / and bad his fader goo to the Judge and show to him the miracle / and
how he was Innocent of that fact / and when this thing was known the sone of
the pilgrim was taken down fro the gybet. and the cause was brought tofore the
Judge / and the host was accused of the trayson. and he confessyd his trespaas
/ and said he did hit for couetyse to have his good. and than the Judge dampened
him for to be hanged on the same gybet where as the young pilgrim was hanged /
And that I have said of the (...) king ^ten / the same I say of the women as
chaumberers and dapsters / for semble^^e caas fyl in sp^^^ at saint done of a
chaumberer. that put a cup in like wife in the scrippe of a pilgrim / by
cause he would not have a do with her in the sin of lechreys / wherefore he was
hanged / and his fader and mother that were there with him went and did her
pylgremage^ and when they came again they fond her sone living / and than they
went and told the Judge / which Judge said that he would not believe hit til a
cok and an hen which roasted on the fire were a live and the cok crewe / and
anon they began to weye a live and the cok crewe and began to crow and to
pasture. and when the judge saw this miracle / he went and took down the sone /
and made the chaumberer to be taken and to be hanged. wherefore I say that the
hosts ought to hold no capsteres ne chaumberers / but if they were good.
meure and honest / For many harms may be fall and come by the disordenate
rewle of servants.

tHe gardes and kep^^s of citees ben signefyed by the seventh pawn which
stondeth in the fyft side to fore the knight / and is formed in the semblaunce
of a man holdyng in his lift hond great lieyes and in his right hand a pot
and an elle for to mesure with and ought to have on his gurdel a purse open.
and by the keys ben signefied the kepars of the citees and towns and common
offices / and by the pot and elle ben signefyed them that have the charge to
weye and mete and mesure trewly / and by the purse been signefyed them that
receive the costumes to^es / sc^wage / p^^g^^ / and duet^^^ of the cy^^es and
towns / and ^yse people ben set by right tofore the knight and hit behooves
that the ga^^^^ and assy^^^ of the towns be taught and ensignad by the knight
and that they know and inquire hell the citees and (...) ben governed which
apertayneth to be kept and defendidy by the knight / and first hit aperteyneth
that the kepars of the cite be dyligent / besy / clear saying and loueres of
the common prouffyt and well. as well in the time of pees as in the time of war
/ they ought alwey to go in the cite and inquire of al things and ought
report to the governors of the cite such thing as they find and know / and
such thing as aperteyneth and to the s^urte of the same* and to denounce and
tell the defaultes and parellys that there be^ and if hit be in time of war
they ought not to open the yates by night to no man. And such men as ben put
in this offyce^ ought to be of renome and fume / true / and of good conscience
/ in such manner that they love them of the cite or town / And that they put
to no man any blame or vylanye with out cause by envy couetyse ne by hate /
but they ought to be sorry and heavy when they see that any man should be
compleyned on for any cause / For hit happeth often times that dyuerce officers
accuse the good people fraudulently / to the end that they might have a thank
and ben praised and to abide stylle in their offices / and trewly hit is a
great and his manner of maltice to be in will to do evil and dysf^me other
with out cause to great glory to him self also the ^epars and officers of

and therefore he worshypyd gladly the pour people with glad vysage and good

dread is not alwey merry or blessed / And her^f says ^^ynt^^^a^ that this dread
furmounteth all other ma^^^tres and euylles / for it is mao^turis of deed
night and day. And it is verite that to him that is doubted of much people. so
must be doubt much / And that herd is less then his servants that
dredyth his servants / and truly hit is a right sure thing to dread no thing
but god and sometime right hardy men ben constrained to live in dread / dread
causith a man to be besy to keep the things that be co^mysed to him that they
perisshe not / but to be to much hardy and to much ferdful. both two ben
vices* the common officers ought to be wise and well aduysed in such wise that
they take not of the people ne require no more tha^ they ought to have by reason
n^ that they take of the sellars ne of the byars no more tha^ the right
custume. for they here the name of a person And therefore ought they to show
them comune to all men / and for as much as the (...) and fellars have sent

diffame him that does hit. a Iogheler on a time behold socrates and said to
him thou have the eyes of corumpour of children and art as a traytre / and when
his dysciple herd him / they would auengyd their master but he repreuyd him by
such sentence saying / suffer my felawes^ for I am he and such one as he
says. by the sight of my vysage / But I refrain and kept me well from such
thing / this same so crates him self was chidde and right foul spoken to of his
wife and she Imposid to him many great Injuries with out nombre / and she was in
a place above over his heed / and when she had brawled enough she made her
water and poured hit on his heed / and he answered to her no thing again sauf
when he had dried and wyped his hied. he said he fine we well that after such
wind and thondce should come (...) and watre. And the philosoph^rs blamed him
that he could not govern twe women / that was his wife and his chaumberer / and
showed him that one ^^ke governed well xv hennes^ he answered to them that he was
so used and acustumed with their chidyng that the chidyngis of them ne of
strangers did him no greef ne harm / give thou place to him that brawleth or
chideth / And in suffryng him thou shall be his vaynquysshour and cathon says
when thou lyuest rightfully / retche the not of the words of evil people / and
therefore hit is said in a romyn prouer^^e^ he that well does retcheth not who
sees hit. and hit is not in our power to let men to speak. and prosper says
that to good men lacks no goodness / ne to evil men tencions stryues and
blames. and patience is a right noble virtue. as a noble versefier says / that
patience is a right noble manner to vaynquysshe. for he that suffers ouercometh
/ and if thou wylt vanquysshe and overcome. learn to suffer. the peagers ner
they that keep passages ought not to take other peage ne passage money but
such as the prince or the law have establisshed / so that they be not more
robbours of money than receyuours of peage and passage^ And hit aperteyneth to
them to goo out of th^e perelous weyes and doubteuous for to keep their office
and they ought to require their passage of them that owe to pay hit with out
noyeng and contencion ^ and they ought not to love the common prouffyt so much
^ that they fall in the hurtyng of their conscience. For that should be a manner
of robberye / and hereof says ysaye / woo to the that robbest. for thou thy
self shall be robbyd. The gardes or porters of the gates of citees and of the
common good ought to be good and honest / and al troth ought to be in them and
they ought not to take ne withdraw we the goods of the common that they have
^n keeping more than aperteyneth to them for their pencion or fee / so that they
that been made tresorers and sic pars len not named theuys / For who that takes

This eight chappytre of the third book treteth of ribauldes. players of dyse
and of messagers and curmurs ca viij


tHe ribauldes players at dyse and the messagers and our rour^s ought to be
set tofore the rook. for hit appreteyneth to the rook which is vicayr of the
king to have men couenable for to run here and there for tenquyre and espy
the places and citees that might be contrary to the king And this pawn that
represents this people ought to be formyd in this manner. he must have the
form of a man that has long heeris and black and holds in his eight hand a
litil money and in his life hand three dyse. and about him a cord instead of
a gurdel. and ought to have a bayeful of lettres / and by the first which is
money ^s understand they that be fool large and wastours of their goods and
by the second which is the dyse / ben represended the plays at dyse /
ribauldes and butters / and by the third which is the box full of lettris. ben
represented the messagers / currours / and he^^es of lettres / and ye shall
understand that the woke which is vycayre of the king when he feeth to fore
him such people as ben sole large and wastours he ^^ bounden to constitute and
ordeygne upon them tutour^ and curatours to see that they ete not ne waste in
such manner their goods ne their heritages. that pouerte constrayne hem not to
stele for he that of custume has had habundaunce of money and goes and
dispendeth hit fo^^ly and wastes hit awey when he comes to pouerte and has
nought^ he must needs beg and axe his breed / or ^llis he must be a thief For
such manner of people / if they have been delycious they will not labor / for
they have not lernyd hit /

And if they be noble and comen of gentylm^^ / they be a shamyd to axe and
beg / And thus must they by force when they have wasted their own prepre

the end that when I am buried and put in the earth ye may demand of them the

his death bed to each church and recluse^ and to pour people a certain
quantite of money by the hands of his daughters husbondes which they did
gladly in hope to have shortly the money that they supposid in the cheste* and
when hit came to the last day that he dyed. he was borne to church and his
exequye done and was buried solempnly. And the seventh day the seruyse
worshypfully accomplisshed. They went for to demand the keys of the
religyous men that they had kept. which were delyuerd to them / and than they
went and opend the coffre where they supposid the money had been Inn / and
there they fond no thing but a great clubbe. and on the handlyng was wreton / I
John of canazath make this testament^ that he be slain with this clubbe / that
leueth his own prouffyt / and gives hit to other / a^^ who says hit is no

that such persons would gladly make noueltees as for to noye and grieve
seignories and meue wars and tencions against them that habou^de in richessis
and goods / and also make extorcions clamours and tribulaco^ns against their
lord^s to the end to waste the goods of the people. like as they have wasted
theyres / and such a wastour of goods may never be good for the common
prouffyt / and ye shall understand that after these wastours of goods we say
that the players of dyse and they that use lordellys ben worst of al other^ for
when the head of playeng at the dyse* and the couetise of their stynkyng

so much the victory as they do the robberye / and they do much harm as
they goo / And they bring lityl gayn or wynnyng / whereof hit happend on a time
that saint bernard rode on an horse about the country and met with an
hasardour or dyse player. which said to him thou gods man wylt thou play at

dyse clefte a sondre in the mids / and on that one part was vj. and on that
other side an aas / and ache of that other was a sise^ And than saint bernard
said that he had worrie his soul for as much as he had cast on three dyse vix

soul to saint bernard and became a monk and finysshed his life in good werkys.

right high / and therefore made the philosopher the bordeur more high than the
tablier. and as the blessed Saint Iherome says upon the prophecy of ysaye /
that is to wete upon a mounteyn of obscurete. which words were said of
babylone which stands in caldee / and no thing of that babylone that
stondeth in egypt^ for it is so that babilone which stondeth in caldee was
set in a right great plain And had so high walls that by the heyght of them
was contynuel derknes enuyronned and obscurete. that none erthly man might
behold and see the end of the highness of the wall. and therefore ysaye called
hit the montaigne obscure / And saint Iherome says that the mesure of the
heyght of this wall was three thousand paas. which extends unto the length
of three mile lombardes / hit is to wete that lombarde mylis and englissh miles
ben of one length / and in one of the corners of this cite was made a tour
treangle as a shield / whereof the heyght extended unto the length of vij
thousand paas / which is seven mile englissh / and this toure was called the
tour of babel the walls about the toure made a woman whose name was semyramis
as says virgilius / As to the third wherefore the common people ben set tofore
the nobles in the field of the batayl in one renge / first for as much as they
ben necessary to al nobles / For the rook which stondeth on the right side
and is vycayr of the king what may he do if the labourer were not set tofore
him and labored to mynystre to him such temporel things as be necessary for
him / And what may the knight do if he ne had tofore him the s^nyth for to
forge his armours^ sadellys axys and syeres and such things as ap^rteyneth to
hym^ And what is a knight worth without horse and arms / cert^ynly no thing
more than one of the people or less pera^^^^^^ / and in what manner should the
nobles ly^^e if no man made cloth and bought and sold marchandyse And what
should kings and queen's and the other lords do if they had no physiciens ne
surgyens / Than I say that the people ben the glory of the crown and sustain
the life of the nobles. And therefore thou that art a lord or a noble man or
knight / despise not the common people for as much as they ben set tofore the

counceyl ought to be taken / Certes the common people ought not to entende to

first draught the nombre of iij p^yntes and when he begins thus to meue from
his whyt point / he has the nature of the rookes of the right side and of the
lift for to goo black or whyt. and also he may goo unto the whyt point where
the gardes of the cite ben set / and in this point he has the nature of a
knight / and thise two manners of meuyng aperteyneth otherwhile to the queen /
and for as much as the king and the queen that be conjoined to geder by
marriage ben one thing as one flesh and blood / therefore may the king meue on
the lift side of his propre point also well as he were set in the place of the
queen which is black / and when he goes right in manner of the rook only and
hit happen that the adversary be not couerd in any point in the second ligne /
the king may not pass from his black point unto the third ligne / and thus he
fortiseth the nature of the rook on the right side and lift side unto the place
of the knights / And for to goo right tofore in to the whyt point tofore the
marchaunt^ and the king also sortist the nature of the knights when he goes
on the right side in two manners. for he may put him in the void space tofore
the phisicien / and in the black space tofore the tauerner. and on the other
side he goes in to other two places in like wise that is tofore the smyth /
and the notarye / and thus as in going out first in to four points he sorteth
the nature of knights / And also the king sortyseth the nature of the olphyns
at his first issue in to two places. and he may goo on boothe sides unto the
white place void / that one tofore the smyth on that one side / and that other
tofore the tauerner on that other side. al these yssues has the king out of
his proper place of his own virtue when he begins to meue. but when he is
ones meuyd fro his propre place. he may not meue but in to one space or point
and so from one to another / And than he fortiseth the nature of the common
people / And thus by good right he has in him self the nature of al / For all
the virtue that is in the membris comyth of the heed / And al meuyng of the
body. The beginning and life comes from the heart And all the dygnyte that the

thise things ascribed unto the honor and worship of the king / in his issue

perfeccion of a royame^ that is to wete the king the queen Iuges knights

begin in his first meuyng of iij points / that he show perfeccion of life as
well in him self as in other / after the king begins to meue he may led with

The second chappitre of the fourth book of the queen and how she yssueth out
of her place capitulo. ter^io


When the queen which is accompanied unto the king begins to meue from her
proper place / she goes in double manner / that is to wete as an alphyn when
she is black / she may goo on the right side and come in to the point tofore
the notarye / and on the lift side in the black point and come tofore the
gardes of the cite. and hit is to wete that she sortiseth in her self the
nature in iij manners first on the right side tofore the alphyn. secondly on the
lift side where the knight is^ and thirdly Indirectly unto the black point
tofore the phisicien. And the reason why / is for as much as she ^ath in his
self by grace / the auctorite that the rookes have by co^myscion. for she may
give and grant many things to her subgettis graciously / and thus also ought
she to have perfyt wysedom as the alphyns have which ben Iuges / as hit is
said above in the chappytre of the queen. and she has not the nature of
knyghtes^ and hit is not sittyng ne couenable thing for a woman to goo to
bataylle for the fragylite and feebleness of her / and therefore holds she not
the way in her draught as the knights done. and when she is me^yd ones out of
her place she may not goo but fro one point to another. and yet covertly
whether hit be forward or bacward taking or to be taken^ and here may be axyd
why the queen goes to the bataylle with the king / cerceynly it is for the
solace of him / and ostencion of love And also the people desire to have
succession of the king / and therefore the tartaris have their wives in to the
field with hem yet hit is not good that men have their wives with hem / but
that they abide in the cytees or within their own termys. For when they been
out of their cytees and lymytes they ben not sure / but holden suspecte they
should be shamefast and hold al men suspect. For dyna Jacobs daughter as long
as she was in the hows of her brethern she kept her vyrgynyte / but as soon as
she went for to see the strange regyone / anon she was corupt and defowled
of the sone of sichem / Seneks says that the women that have evil vysages ben
gladly not chaste / but their courage desires gladly the company of men / and
solinus says that no bestys femeles desire to be touched of their males when
they have conceyuyd / exept woman which ought to be a best reasonable. and in
this caas she lefith her rayson / and sidr^c witnessith the same. and therefore
in the old lawe^ the faders had diverse wives and ancellis to thends when one
was with child. they might take another^ they ought to have the visage
enclyned for teschewe the sight of the men. that by the sight they be not meuyd
with Incontyneyce and dyffame of other / and ouyde says that there ben so^me
that how well that they eschew the dede^ yet have they great joy when they be
prayed / and therefore ought the good women fle the curiositees and places where
they might fall in blame and noise of the people /

The fourth chappytre of the fourth book of the issuyng of the alphyn capitulo
quarto


tHe manner and nature of the draught of the alphyn in such that he that is
black in his propre siege is set on the right side of the king / and he that
is whyt is set on the lift side / and ben called and named black and whyt /
but for no cause that they be so in substance of her propre color / but for
the color of the places in which they ben set / and alwey be they black or
whyt when they ben set in their places^ the alphyn on the right side. going
out of his place to the right side ward comes tofore the labourer / and hit is
reason that the Judge ought to deffende and keep the laborers and possessions
which ben in his Iurisdyccion by all right and law / And also he may goo on
the lift side to the void place tofore the phisicien / for like as the
physiciens have the charge to hele the Infirmytees of a man^ In like wise have
the Iuges charge ^to appese all stryues and contencions and reduse unto unity
and to punysshe and correct causes crymynels. the lift alphyn has also two
ways fro his own place one toward the right side unto the black space void
tofore the marchaunt^ For the merchants need often times counceyl and been in
debate of questyons which must needs be determined by the Iuges and that other
issue is unto the place tofore the rybauldes and that is by cause that often
times among them fall noyses^ dyscencions theft and manslaughter / wherefore
they ought to be punysshed by the Iuges / and ye shall understand that the
alphyn goes alwey cornerwyse fro the third point to the third point / keeping
alwey his own siege / for if be be black / he goes alwey black^ and if he be
whyt he goes

and hit is well reason that when the labourer and husbondman has labored the
feldes. the knights ought to keep them to the (...) that they have vitailles
for them self and their horses / The second issue is that he may move him unto
the black sp^ce tofore the notarye or draper / for he is bounden to deffende
and keep them that make his vestementes and couertours necessary unto his
body. The third issue is that he may goo on the lift side in to the place
tofore the merchant which is set tofore the king the which is black^ and
the reason is for as much as he ought and is holden to deffende the king as well
as his own person / when he passyth the first draught^ he may goo four weyes
/ and when he is in the mids of the tablier he may goo in to viij places
sundry / to which he may venne / and in like wise may the lift knight goo
which is black and goes out of his place in to whyt / And in that manner goes
the knight fightyng by his might / and g^oweth and multeplyeth in his points /
and often times by them the field is won or lost / a knights virtue and might
is not known but by his fightyng / And in his fightyng he does much harm
for as much as his might extends in to so many points / they ben in many
parellis in their fightyng. and when they escape they have the honor of the
game. and thus is hit of every man the more vallyant / and the more honored /
and he that m^keth him self often times shyneth clerest.

The sixte chappytre of the fourth tract^se tr^^^th of the issue of the mostes
and of her progressyon capitulo vj


THe moeuyng and issue of the rookes which ben vy^cayrs of the king is such
/ that the right rook is black and the lift rook is whyt / and when the chesse
ben setes as well the nobles as the common people first in their propre places^
the rookes by their propre virtue have no way to issue but if hit be maad to
them by the nobles ^e common people / For they been enclosid in their propre
sieges

And the reason why is such. that for as much as they ben vycayrs
lieuetenaunted or co^myssyoners of the king their auctorite is of none effect
tofore they issue out /

And that they have begone to euhaunce their office / for as long as they be
within the palace of the king. so long may they not use ne execute their
co^myssyon^ but anon as they issue they may use their auctorite / and ye shall
understand that their auctorite is great / For they represente the persons of
the king / and therefore where the ^ablier is void they may run all the
tablier^ in like ^oys^ as they goon through the royame / and they may goo a^ well
whyt as black as well on the right side and lift as foreward and backward / and
as fer may they run as they find the tablier voyde^ whether hit be of his
adversaries as of his owen felawshyp. and when the rook is in the myddel of the
tablier / he may goo which way he will in to four right lignes on every side.
and it is to wete that he may in no wise goo cornerwyse / but alwey right forth
geyng and coming as before is said. wherefore all the subgettis of the king as well
good as evil ought to know by their moeuyng that the auctorite of the vycayrs
and co^myssyoners ought to be very true rightwys and Just / and ye shall
understand that they ben strange and virtuous in bataylle. for the two wokes
only may vaynquysshe a king their aduersarye and take him. and take from him
his life and his royame / and this was done when Cirus king of perse and Darius
king of medes slew balthazar and took his royame from him. which was neuewe
to enylmoradach under whom this game was founden.

The vij chappytre of the fourth book of the issue of the common people capitulo
septimo
ONe issue and one moeuyng apperteyneth unto all the common people / for they may
goo fro the point they stand in at the first meuyng unto the third point right
forth tofore them / and when they have so done they may afterward meue no more
but fro one point right forth in to another. And they may never return
^^^ward. and thus going forth fro point to poynt^ they may get by virtue and
strength^. that thing that the other nobles find by dygnyte / and if the
knights and other nobles help hem that they come to the ferthest sign tofore
them where their adversaries were set they acquyre the dignyte that the queen
has granted to her by grace /

For if any of them may come to this said sign if he be whyt as labourer
draper / phisicie^. or kepar of the cite been they reteyne such dignyte as the
queen has / for they have gotten hit / and than retornyng again homeward / they
may go ^^ke as it is said in the chappitre of the queen / and if any of the
pawnes that be black^ as the smyth^ the merchant / the tauerner / and ribaulde
may come without do^mage in to the same vtterest sign / he shall get by his
virtue the dygnyte of the black queen / and ye shall understand / when these
comune people move right forth in her sign / and find any noble person or of
the people of their adversaries set in the point on any side tofore him / In
that corner point he may take his aduersarye whether hit be on the right side
or on the lift / and the cause is that the adversaries b^n suspecious that the
common people lie in a wait to noble her goods or to take her persons wha^
they go upward right forth. and therefore he may take in the right angle to ^e^^
him one of his adversaries / as he had espied his person and in the right
angle as robber of his goodes^ and whether hit be going forward or retornyng
fro black to whyt / or whyt to black / the pawn must alwey goo in his right
sign / and alwey take in the corner that he fyndeth in his way but he may not
goo on neither side til he has been in the fardest sign of theschequer / and
that he has taken the nature of the draughtes of the queen / and than he is a
fiers^ and than he may goo on al sides cornerwyse fro point to point only as
the queen both fightyng and taking whom he fyndith in his way. And when he is
thus comen unto the place where the nobles his adversaries were set he shall
be made whit fires and black fires / after the point that he is in / and there
takes he the dygnyte of the queen. and all these things may appear to them
that beholden the play of the chesse / and ye shall understand that no noble
man ought to have despyte of the common people for hit has seen often times seen^
that by their virtue and wit / dyu^rce of them have comen to right high and
great asta^^ as p^^pe^ bishops / emperors and kings / as we have in the
h^^esrye of dauyd that was made king of a shepherd and (...) of the common people
and of many other / and in like wise we read of the contrary / that many noble
men have been brought to myserye by their defaulte / as of gyges (...) wrought

The viij chappytre and the last of the fourth book of the epylogacion and
recapytulacion of this book capitulo viij



FOr as much as we see and know that the memory of the people is not retentyf
but right forgeteful when some here long talis and historyes which they can
not al reteyne in her mind or record. Therefore I have put in this present
chappytre all the things abouesayd as shortly as I have co^ne / first this
play or game was fou^den in the time of enylmerodach king of babylone / And
excerses the philosopher other wise named philometer found hit / and the cause
why was for the correccion of the king like as hit apperith in three the first
chappytres^ For the said king was so tyra^nous and feloun that he might suffer
no correccion / but slew them and did do put hem to death that correctid hym^
and had than do put to death many right wise men / than the people being
sorouful and right evil plesid of this evil life of the king prayed and required
the phylosopher^ that he would reprise and tell the king of his folly / and
than the philosopher answered that he should be deed if he so dyde^ and the people
said to him / certes thou ought so^ner will to dye to the end that thy
renome might come to the people. than the life of the king should co^tynue in evil
for lack of thy cou^ceil. or by fau^^e of reprehension of the. or thou d^rist
not do and show / that thou say. and when the philosopher herd this he
promysid to the people that he would put him in deuoyr to correct him And then
he began to think him in what manner he might escape the death and stepe to the
people his promise And then thus he maad in this manner and ordeygned the
eschequer of lxiiij points as is before said / And did do make the form of
chequers of gold and silver in humayn figure after the ^acions and forms as we
have dyuysid and she wid to you tofore in their chappytres / and ordained the
moeuyng and thestate after that / it is said in the chappitres of theschessys /
and when the pyhlosophre had thus ordained the play or game. and that hit
plesid all them that saw hit / on a time as the philosopher played on hit the
king came and saw hit and desired to play at this game / And then the
philosopher began densigne and teache the king the science of the play and the
draughtes / Saying to him first how the king ought to have in him self pity
debonayrte and rightwysnes / as hit is said tofore in the chappytre of the king
/ And he enseygned to him the astate of the queen and what manners she ought to
have / And then of the alphyns as counceyllours and Iuges of the wyame /

And after the nature of the knights / how they ought to be wise. true and
curtoys and all the order of knight hode / And than after the nature of the
vycayrs and Rookes as hit apperyth in their chappytre / And after this how the
common people ought to goo ^che in his office And how they ought to serve the
nobles. And when the philosopher had thus taught and enseygned the king and
his nobles by the manner of the play and had reprehendyd him of his evil
manners. The king demanded him upon pain of death to tell him the cause why and
wherefore he had made and founden this play / and game / And what thing mouyd
him thereto / and than the philosopher constrained by fere and dread answered.
that he had promised to the people which had requyryd him that (...) and (...)
the king of his evil ve^^^ (...) as ^^ache as he (...) the (...) had (...) that
the king did (...) the saged and (...) that were so h^rdy to (...) me him of
hi^ vices. he was in great an^^^ and ^^^we / ho^^ he might find a manner to
correct and rep^^^ende the king. and to save his owen life and thus he thought
(...) studied that he fond this game or play. which be ^ath do set forth for
to amend and correct the life of the king and to change his manners. and he
adiouseyd with all that he had founden this game for so m^^^ (...) the lords
and nobles habeundyng in de^ices and ^ichess^^. and enioyeng temporal ^^es
should eshewe ydelnes by playeng of this game. and for to give hem cause to
^e^^e her pen^^^nes and ^o^^wes. in auys^ng and studyng ch^^ game / and when
the king had herd al these causes he thought that the philosopher had found a
good manner of correccion and than he thankyd him grecely and thus by then
signement and lernyng of the philosopher. he changed his life his manners and
all his evil conditions / and by this manner hit happend that the king that
tofore time had been vycious and disordynate in his living was made Just and
virtuous / debonayr / gracious and full of virtues unto al people. And a man that
