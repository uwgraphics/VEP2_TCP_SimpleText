Gaudeamus sing we i^ hoc sacro tpere
Puer nobis natus e^ ex Maria virgin

Mary mother come and se
Thy sone is nailed on a tree
Hand and foot he may not go
His body is wrapped all in woe
Upon a tree nailed he is
To bring us all to heaven blyss
For Adam that did amysse
For an aple that was so fre
From his heed unto his too
His skin is torn and flesske also
His body is both wanne and blo
And nailed he is on a tree
Thy lovely sone that thou have borne
Is crowned with a crown of thorn
To save mankind that was but lorne
And bring man but to his liberte
when Johan this tale began to tell
Mary would no longer dwell
But went among the Jews fell
where she might her sone se
My sweet sone that art me dear
why hangest thou on rode here
Thy head is wrythen all in a brere
Lovely sone what may this be.
Mother to Johan I the betake
Johan keep this woman for my sake
On rode I am emendes to make
For sinful man as ye may se.
This game of love I must play
For man's soul it is no nay
There is no man that goth by the way
But on my body he may have pity
This pain yt men have me wrought
For sinful souls I have it bought
Of all this smerte yet rewe I naught
If man would be kind to me.
My blood coleth my flesh does fall
I am athryst after drink I call
They give me eylyll menged with gall
A wors drink may there be none.
Fader my soul to the I betake.
My body dies for man's sake
To hell I must without en make
Mankind for to make fre
God that deyed for us all
Borne of a maid in an ox stall
Grant us his realm celestyall
Amen / amen / for charity.

Of saint Steven
To saint Steue^ will we pray
To pray for us both night and day
OF saint Steven gods knight
That preched ye faith day and night
He told the Jews as it was right
That Christ was borne of a may.
The Jews said in great scorn
That Christ was not of a maid borne
Than said Steven ye are but lorne
And all that believe in your lay.
Now is spronge the well of life
Of Mary mother maid and wife
Therefore the Jews fell at strife
And with steue^ tha^ dyspu^ed they.
The wicked Jews at the last
Stones at Steven they began cast
His head and arms they all to brast
And made his body in foul array.
Steven that was full mylde of mode
Thought he were all reed in blood
In his prayers still he stood
And cryeng to good thus he did say
Lord god for thy myghtfull grace
Forgive the Jews their trespace
And give them grace to se thy face
In the Joy that lasts aye.
To heaven he looks soon on hye
To the father and sone truly
And to the holy ghost he began cry
Receive my soul I the pray.
God received his boon anon
Down came aungeles many one
They took his soul and to heaven did gone
To blyssednesse that lasts ay.
To that bliss that is so good
Them that dyed upon the roode
Grant us for his precious blood
Our salvation at domes day.
Finis.
Of saint John^.
Pray for us to god on hye
Blyssed saint Johan and our lady.
O Blessed Johan the euangelyst
Right dear beloved of Jesus christ
The preuyte of heaven in earth thou wist
As touching to the trynyte.
That prince that is withouten pere
To Johan he took his mode dear
All while ^he lived in earth here
That vyrgyns were both he and she.
This noble Johan that we of read
Informed vz of Christ's deed
The while that he on earth yede
In his gospel so find we.
when Chryston cross hanged so hy
He said unto his mother Mary
Lo there thy sone standing the by
And se thy mother Johan said he
Now pray we to this saint echone
For us to pray to god in trone
Out of this life when we shall gone
To se him in his mayeste

A caroll of the Innocents.
Mark this song for it is true
For it is true as clerks tell.
In old time strau^g things came to pas
Great wonder and great meruayll was
In Israel.
There was one Octauyan
Octauyan of Rome Emperor.
As books old does specyfye
Of all the wide world truly.
He was lord and governor.
The Jews that time lackyd a king
They lackyd a king to gyde them well
The Emperor of power and might
Chose one Herod against all right
In Israel.
This Herod tha^ was king of Iewys
was king of Iewys and he no Jew
For sothe he was a panym borne
wherefore on faith it may be sworn
He reigned king untrue.
By prophesye one Isay
One I say / at lest did tell
A child should come wo^derous newys
yt should be borne true king of Iewys
In Israel.
This Herod knew one borne should be
One borne should be of true lenage
That should be right herytour
For he but by the Emperor
was made by vsurpage.
wherefore of throught this king Herod
This king Herod in great fere fell
For all the days most in his mirth
Ever he fered Christ's birth
In Israhell.
The time came it pleased god
It pleased god so to come so pas
For man's soul in deed
His blyssed sone was borne with speed
As his will was
Tidings came to kynke Herod
To king Herod / and did him tell
That one borne forsooth is he
which lord and king of all shall be
In Israel.
Herod tha^ raged as he were wood
As he were wode of this tydynge
And sent for all his serybes sure
yet would he not trust the scripture
Nor of their councellynge.
Than this was the conclusyon
The conclusyon of his council
To send unto his knights anon
To sle the chylderne euerychone
In Israel.
This cruel king this tyranny
This tyranny did put in ure
Between a day and years too
All men chylderne he did sloo
Of Christ for to be sure.
Yet Herod myssed his cruel pray
His cruel pray as was gods will
Joseph with Mary than did fle
with Christ to Egypt gone was she
From Israel.
All this while this tyrants
This tyrants would not convert
But innocents young
That lay sokynge
They thryst to the heart.
This Herod sought the children
This children young with courage fell
But in doing this vengeance
His own sone was slain by chance
In Israel.
Alas I think the moders were woe
The moders were woe it was great skyl
what motherly pain
To se them slain
In cradels lyeng still:
But god him self has them elect
Has them elect / in heuyn to dwell.
For they were bathed in their blood
For their baptym for soth it stood
In Israel.
Alas again what hearts had they
what hearts had they those babes to kill
with swerdes when they him caught
In cradels they lay and laughed
And never thought ill.
Finis.
This was the tenor of her talking
Timor morris conturbat me.
I asked that bird what she meant
I am a ^et fair and gent
For fere of deths I am all shent
Timor morris conturbat me
When I shall dye I know no day
Country nor place I can not say
Wherefore this long sing I may
Timor mortis conturbat me.
Jesus christ when he should dye
To his father began he cry
Father he said in trynyte
Timor mortis conturbat me
All christen people behold and se
This world is but a vauyte
For therein is but necessyte
Timor mortis conturbat me.
Wake or sleep / eat or drink
when I on my last end do think
For great fere my soul does synke
Timor mortis conturbat me.

Blessed Stephan we the pray
Pro nobis preres funde

I Shall you tell this ylke night
Of saint Stephan gods knight
He told the Jews that it was right

Blessed Stephan. etc.
Then said the Jews with great scorn
That gods sone might not be borne
Stephan said ye be forlorn
And all that byleueth on that lay
Blessed Stephan. etc.
This Stepha^ wha^ he was mostperfyte
In Crystes law illumynate
The Jews him took with great dyspyte
without the town to lapidate
Blessed Stephan. etc.
The cursyd Jews at the last
Stones at Stephan they began cast
They bette him and bound him fast
And made his body in foul array
Blessed Stephan. etc.
When the angel Aue began
Flesh and blood together ran
Mary bare both god and man
Through the virtue of benygnyte.
So says the gospel of saint Iohan^
God and man is made both one
In flesh and breed-blode and bone
One god in persons three.
And the prophet Jeremy
Told in his prophecy
That the sone of Mary
For us should dye on tree.
He has Joy to you granted
And in earth peace has plaunted
when yborne was that faynted
In the land of Galilee
Mary grant us the bliss
Where thy sone dwelling is
And of that we have done amysse
Thou pray for us for charity.
