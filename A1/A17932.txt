Here begins a treatise against pestele^ce and of ye infirmits

A^t^onomye. Ptholomeus.


AT the reverence and worship of ye blessed trynyte and of ye glorious virgyn
saint ma ry / and the conseruacyon of the common well of christian people as well
for them yt be hole as for remedy of them that been seek. I the bishop of
Arusiens in the royalme of denmark doctor of physycke will write by the most
expert end famous doctors auctorysed in physyque some things of ye,
Infyrmyte of ye pestylence which daily enfecteth and sone suffers us to
depart out of this life. First I will write ye tokenes of this infyrmy te /
The second / ye causes whereof it comes. The third remedies for the same.
The. iiii. comfort for the heart and the pryncypall members of the body. The.
v. when it shall be season to be let blood.

First I said ye tokens of this infyrmyte. vii. things ought to be noted in
the same / ye first is wha^ in a summers day the weder oftentimes chau^geth as
in ye mornyn ge the weder appears to rain / afterward it appe reth cloudy
and at ye last wind in the south. The secon de token is when in somer the
days appears all der ke and like to rain and yet it rayneth not / and if
many days so co^tynue it is to dread great pestylence. The third token is
when great multitude of flies ben upon yt earth then it is sign / yt ye air
is venymous and infecte. The. iiii. token is when ye sterres semen oftentimes
to fall / then it is token yt the air is infect with much venomous vapors. The.
v. token is wha^ a blasynge sterre is seen in the element above / then it
should fortune sone after to be great manslaughter. in battle. The. vi. token
is when there is great light nynge and thundre namely out of the south. The.
vii. token is when great wyndes passen out of the south / they be foul and
unclean / therefore when these tokens appear it is to dread great pestylence but
god of his mercy will remeue it.

These things following ben the causes of pestylence. The pestyle^ce comes
of. iii. things / sometime it comes fro the rote byneth other while fro ye
rote above to ye we may feel sensibly how the change of the air appears unto
us / and sometime it comes of both together as well fro the rote above as fro
the rote byneth / as we see a sege or a preuy next to a chamber or of any
other pertyculer thing which corrupts ye air in his substance and qualyte
which is a thing may hap every day / and thereof comes the ague of
pestylence / and about the same many physycyons be deceived / not supposing
this axes to be a pestylence / sometime it comes of deed careyn or corrupcion
of standing water in dyches or sloughes and other corrupt places / and these
things sometime be universal and sometime particular. Fro the rote above it
fortuneth ye causes of the bodies above the air by whom the spyryte of life
is corrupt in man or be as Auice^ce says in his.. iiii. book / by ye form
of thayt above the bodies byneth lightly be infect / for thynpressyons above
corrupts the air and so the spirytes of man be corrupt / this infyrmyte
comes from the rote above / and bynethe when of thynpressyons above the air
is corrupt / and of the putryfaccyon or roten careyne / or of vile places
byneth an infyrmyte is caused in a man / and such an Infyrmyte sometime is an
axes / sometime a postome or a swelly^ge and that is in many things. Also the
air inspyred sometime is venymous and corrupt / hurtynge ye heart / yt nature
many ways is grieved so / yt he perceyueth not his harm for ye vyrgyn
appears fair and shows good dygestyon yet nevertheless ye pacyent is like
to dye / wherefore many physycyens seeing the vryn of their pacyentes yt speak
superfycyally and be deceived. There fore it is need yt every pacyent prove to
him self a good and expert physycyon. These things written be fore are ye
causes of pestylence. But about these thy^ ges two questyons be moeued. The
first is wherefore one dies and another dies not in a town where me^ be deed
in one house / and in another house there dies none. The second questyon is
whether pestylence sores be co^tagyous. To ye first questyon I say it may
hap to be of two causes / yt is to say of ye thing yt does and of yt thing
that suffers / an example of yt thyn ge that does / ye Influence of the bodies
above beholds that place or that place more than this place or this place /
and the pacyent is more disposed to dye tha^ another. therefore it is to be
noted yt ye bodies be more hot disposed of open poores than bodies Infect ha:
uynge the poores stopped with many humors where bodies be of resolucyon or
opening / as men which abusen them self with women or use often times bathes /
or men yt be hot with labor or great anger they have their bodies more
disposed to this great sekenes. To the second questyon I say yt pestylence
sores be co^tagyous by cause of infect humors of bodies and the reeke or
smoke of such soores is venymous and corrupts ye air and therefore it is to
flee fro such persons yt be infect / in pestylence time no body shol de
stand in great prece of people by cause some manne use the remedies following.

In the morning when ye rise / wasshe a little rewe and one or two fylberde
nottes clenc with salt and ete them / and if yt can not be had than ete bread or
a toste sopped in veneger namely in troublous and cloudy weder. Also in the
time of pestylence it is better to abide wtin the house / for it is not wholesome
to go in to cite or town / also let your house be sprynkled specially in somer
with vyneger and roses and with leaves of vine tree. Also it is good to wasshe
your hands often times in the day with water and veneger / and wype your face
with your hands and smell to them. Also it is good always to sauoure ayger
things. In the mount of pessulane I might not eschew the company of people
for I went fro house to house because of my pouerte to cure seek folks
therefore bread or a sponge sopped in vyneger I took with me holding it to my
mouth and nose because all egre things stoppen the ways of humors and
suffers no venymous things to enter in to a man's body and so I escaped the
pestylens my fellows supposy^ge yt I should not live these things I have
proved by my self.

Here follows the co^fortes of ye heart and of ye pryncypall members.
The co^fortes of ye heart be these / saffron anifex plantayn: with other herbs
they open the inward spyryte / and these be good among the common people where
lightly it happeth yt one is infecte of another therefore beware the brethe of
another. Also of an Infect ayet a man's eyes be made dymme if he bear not ye
foresaid things in his hand Also it is wholesome yt ye wasshe your mouth face
eyes and hands oftentimes in ye day with rose water medeled with veneger / and if
ye have no rose water take veneger and so these things used ye may go surely
among the people. Also a natural lax of the belly is a great re medy else
provoke a lax by a supposory craftly / use pypylle pestile^ciales for they be
good / they be in thap potycarye shoppes. Also keep fire always in your hou se
for it lets much the Impressyons of the bodies above and clarefyeth the
air. Also it is profitable as well for and hole seek folks to drink tryacle
therefore take it. ii. times a day with clear wine limphat or with clear rose
water or with clear ale / take a quantyte of trya cle and two sponefull of clear
wine or rose water or ale dyssolue the tryacle in the cup and dry^ke it and
dyne not till ye mids of the day yt the tryacie may have his operacyon / then
chese a good dysshe with mete / and dry^ke clear wine and often times drink in
the day but not much together / for much haboundaunce of drink putryfyeth the
humors. Also beware hot things in metes as peper and garlyke / though peper
purges the brain from the flewme and specially ye members from vesyous
humors / yet it makes much hete / and hete falls in to putryfacion /
bytternes only is more please than hot odoure or sauoure. Also garlyke though
it putgeth flewme and put out all humors and provoke an appetyte to ete and
suffers no dry aper to enter yet it troubles the eyes and makes the head
hot therefore it is not good to ete garlyk. The pestylence grows often times
of an hot cause therefore all metes the more they be light dygestion so much
they be the better / In the morning ere boiled mete at even roasted / forbere
brothe and potage without they be eyger / in ye time of this sekenes eyger meters
be better tha^ other. Also forbere all fruytes but if they be eyger / as
cheryes or pome garnates or a little of a pere or apple by the way of medycyne
/ because all fruit enduceth putryfaccyon / ete conuenyent spyces as gv^ger
synamum common macys and saffro^ / these be the best sauce may be made for rich
people / for poor take rewe sage fylberde nottes percely with veneger my^ste
together these be good and lets putryfaccyon. To be merry in his heart is a
great remedy for health of his body. Therefore in time of this great Iyfyrmyte be
ware ye dread not death but live merely and hope to live long.

For the lettynge of blood.
Lettynge of blood ones in the month may be made / but age or other things
forbede it as pylgryms or feeble persons yt have the flyxe / suffer to be let
blood in ye vain called basilica on ye right or lift side before ety^ge / and
after in cision of the basilisca be merry and drink wine or ale temperatly /
sleep not yt day wha^ basilica is cut / if ye feel yeu grieved to be infect /
than eschew sleep and be walking and moeuynge / for by sleep thynwarde hete
induces poison to ye heart and to other special members / so yt uneath any
herb may take away such poison / which should not be if a man would be
moeuy^ge to and fro / but some would axe wherefore should sleep be eschewed / I
say shortly yt in pestylence time anon after mete if a body list to sleep /
then such a lust ought to be forborne by a space walky^ge in the gardyns or
feldes / and therefore Auicenne writes yt if a man would sleep he must drink a
good draught of ale or wine a^ore / because a man being a sleep draws many
humors / and ye evil humors be put down by thumours of a good draught. But
some would understand how may a man feel when he is infect / I say that a man
which is infect yt day he eteth not much mete / for he is replenysshed with
evil humors / and forthwith after dinner he has lust to sleep and feleth
great hete under cold. Also he has great pain in the forhede but all these
things he may put a way by moeuynge of a place hyder and theder to ride or to
walk he may not for sloth / of the body and the weight of the same. Also a
man which is infect has lust to sleep every hour for the vemyn wtin the body
troubles the spyryte of life so yt always he would rest and sleep and so of
these tokens a man shall know and feel him self infect / and if a body will
not believe this. Abide the mids of ye day / and then anon he shall feel a
swelly^ge under the arm about the share / or about the eres and therefore se
an hye and a good medycyne / forbere sleep because of the things aforsayd /
and it is plain that the spyryte of life rests in sleep and all the body here
and there is venymed. All these things I have proved by my self / these
things known when a man feleth him self infect as soon as he may let him be
let blood plentuously till he swoune / then stop the vain / for a little
letynge of blood moeueth or styrreth vemyn / if a man will not have many veins
cut together / then let him suffer ye vain cut to run till ye blood with draw /
for a little bledy^ge meueth strongly ye venym as it is said before also a man
whether he be infect or not if he be let blo de let him forbere sleep all yt
day till mydnyght folowy^ge / and always let blood ye vain upon yt side of the
body where yt swelly^ge appears. Therefore if a swelly^ge appear under ye right
arm let blood in ye mids of ye same arm in ye vain called mediana / if it
of them may be infect. Therefore wise physycyens in vysyty^ge seek folk stand
far fro yt paciente holdyn ge their face toward ye door or wy^dowe. And so
shol de ye servants of seek folk stand. Also it is good to a pacyent every
day for to change his chamber / and to have the wyndowes open against ye
north and eest / and to spear the wyndowes against the south / for the south
wind has two causes of putryfycicaon. The first is / it makes a man being
hole or seek feeble in their bodies. The second cause is as written in ye third
of Amphyrosmis ye south wind greueth ye heecynge and hurts the heart because
it opens ye poores of man and enters in to the heart / wherefore it is good
to an hole man in time of pestylence when the wind is in the south to be
within the house all day and if it shall be need a man to go out / yet let him
abide in the house till the son be up in the eest passing south ward.

The remedies of pestylence here after follows. Now it is to wete by what
remedies a man may pre serve him self fro pestylence / first se ye writing of
Ieremye ye prophet yt a man ought to forsake evil things and do good deeds
and mekely to confess his sins / for why it is the highest remedy in time of
pestylen ce / penance and confession to be preferred of other medecynes.
Nevertheless I promytte you verily it is a good remedy to void and change
thynfect pleaces. but some may not prouffytably change their places / therefore
as much as to them is possible it is to eschew every cause of putryfaccion /
and namely every flesshely lust with women it to be eschewed. Also ye sothern
wind which is naturally enfecteth therefore spear ye wyndowes axenst the south
as it is said before un to the first hour after the mids of ye day. Then
open ye wyndowes against ye north. Of ye same cause every foul styncke is to be
eschewed / of stabyll stynkynge feldes ways or streets / and namely of
stynky^ge deed carayne and most of stynky^ge waters where in many places water
is kept by. vii. days or. ii. nyghtes / or else there be gutters of water
casten under the earth which causes great stynke and corrupcyon and of this
cause some deye in ye house where such things happen / and in another house
dye none as it is said before. like wise in yt place where be wurtes and coals
putrefyed it makes a noyfull sauoure and stynkynge for as by the sweet odoure
of bawme ye heart and the spyrytes have recreacion / so of evil savors they
be made feeble wherefore keep your house that an infect air enter not in / for
an Infecte air most causes putryfaccyon in places and houses where folk
sleep / therefore let your house be clean and make clear fire of wood
fla^mynge / let your house be made with fumygacyon of herbs / that is to say
with leaves of baye tree Jeneper vberyorgany it is in thappotycary shoppes /
wormwode rewe mugworte and of ye tree of aloes which is best but it is dear.
Such a fume taken by the mouth and eres opens thynwarde parts of the body.
Also it is teschewe all great repleccyons by cause full bodies be lightly
infect / as Auice^ne says in the fourth canon / they yt chargen their bodies
with repleccion / shorten their life. Also common bathes are to be eschewed /
for a little crust corrupts all ye body Therefore ye people as much as is
possible is to be eschewed / leest of infect brethes some man be infect / but
wha^ ye multitude of people may not be eschewed. the^ be risen. But and if yt
he feel any such swelly^ge after his sleep / then upon the contrary part
the lettynge of blood must be made / as for if the swellynge or rysynge
appear in the right arm let him blood in the lift arm in epate or
(basilica) or mediana. And if that a swellynge or a moeuynge ap pere under the
left arm let him blood in the right arm like wise as is be foresaid of
the lift arm / and so of allother places of the body / let blood on the
contrary part of such swellynge or rysyn ge. And that the lettynge of blood
be veraye little and feeble / Then let the pacyente sleep after the mids
of the day / and then always within the mids of the day / for he must be
in contynuelly meuynge riding or going moderatly / and afterward if that the
swellynge grow let him not be a frayde of death by cause such a swelly^ge
puts out all manner of euylles / and makes a man very hole. And that the
sooner a swellynge may be made ripe / take this medycyne as follows. Bruise the
leaves of an elder tree the which ben fair and great and put thereto mustarde
the which shall be well and strongely grounden in a pair of querues and then
when ye have done as I have told you / take and drive a plaster of the
foresaid things good and thycke and after put it upon the sore and swellynge
and it shall aledge him anon of the foresaid sykenes

Also for the foresaid swellynge / or rysynge in the neck / or in ye arm / or
in any other place of a man's body when it appears take fylberde nottes
fygges and rewe and bruise them together in a mortar well and lay it upon the
swellynge. And if that it appear under ye left arm let him blood in ye mids
of the same or in ye vain of ye liver which is above ye little fayger / and if
it, be about the share let him blood about the hele upon ye same side / if
the swellynge be in the neeke let him blood in the vain called cephalica about
the thombe in ye hand in the same side or in the vain called medsana of the
same arm or in ye hand of the same side about the little finger / if ye
swellynge appear about the ere let him blood in the vain called cephalica of
the same side or in ye vayn which is between the long finger and the thombe /
lest many venymous things go in to the brayn / or let blood the vain which
is about the little finger yt is named by physycyons basiuca / and if a
swellyn ge appear in the sholders less it with ventosyte and first lest the
vain called mediana / if the swellynge be on the back / less it upon the
vain called pedia magna) and all these things be made if man sleep not before
ye knowledge of ye swelly^ge. some surgeons will put treacleto ye swellynge But
do not so / for tryacle puts out venym. Thefore dry^ke tryacle for yt put
teth out the same. Also there is another medyeyne ta ke syngreue hysworte other
wise called wild time mawdesyn grafie plantayne and a little rye flower and
break all these together till ye se water come out there of / meddle yt water with
woman's milk and give it to the pacyent fastr^ge before sleep and will work
the better for to remeue the swelly^ge These remedies be suffy cyent to eschew
this great sickness with the help of god to whom be ever lasty^ge laud and
praysy^ge worl de without end. Amen.
