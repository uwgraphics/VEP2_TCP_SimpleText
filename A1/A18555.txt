The love and complayntes between Mars and Uenus.
O Lade ye fowls / of this morrow gray
Lo Uenus is risen among you rows read
And flowers fresshe / honor ye this May
For wha^ the son vpryst then will ye sprede
But ye lovers / taht lie in any dread
Flees / lest wyckde tunges yon espy
Loo yonde the son / the candell of Ialousye
with terys blewe / and with a wounded heart
Take ye your leave with saint John^ to borowe
Appease ye some what / of your sorrows smerte
Time comes often / ye cessen shall your sorrow
The glad night / is worth an heavy morrow
Saint valentyn a foul / thus herd I sing
Upon thy day / er the son began vpsprynge
yet song this foul / I read you all awake
Rnd ye that have not chosen in humble wise
without repentyng / chese ye your make
And ye that have full chosen / as I deuyse
yef at lest / renoucleth your seruyse
Conferme ye it perpetully tendure
And pacyently / take y your adventure
And for the worship / of this hye feste
yet well I in my birds wise sing
The sentence of the complaynt at lest
That woeful Mars / made at departing
Of fresshe Uenus / in a morenynge
when phoebus / with his fyry torches read
Rausaketh had / every lover in his dread
whylom the third heuens lord above
As well by heuenysshe reuolucyos
As by deserte / has won Uenus his love
And she has tak him in subieccyon
And as a maystres taught him his lession
Co^mandyng / that never in her seruyse
He nere so bold / noe lover to despise
For she forbad him Ialousye at all
And cruelt / boost / and tyranny
She made him at her lust so humble and tall
That when her deyned cast on him her eye
He took in pacyence to live or deye
And thus she holds him in her manner
with nothing but with scourgyng of her chere
who regneth now in bliss but Uenus
That has this worthy knight i^ governance
who syngeth now but Mars that serves thus
The fair Uenus / causer of playsaunce
He byndeth him / to perpetuell obeysaunce
And she byndeth her / to love him for euere
But so be that his trespaas it disseuere
Thus ben they knyt / and regnyng in heaven
By lokyng most / till it fill on a tide
That by their both assent / was set a steven
That Mars shall enter / as fast as he may glyde
In to her next palace / and there abide
walkyng his course / till she had him atake
And he prays her to haste for his sake
Then said he thus / mine hertes lady sweet
ye know well my myschyef in that place
For sekerlyetyll that I with you mete
My life stand there in adventure and grace
But when I see / the beawte of your face
There is no dread of death / may do me smerte
For all your lust / is ease to mine heart
She has so great compassyon of her knight
That dwells in solytude / till she come
For it stood so / that tylke time no wight
Cou^ceylled him there ne said to him welcome
That nyghe her wit for woo was overcome
wherefore she sped her as fast in her weye
All most in one day / as he did in tweye
The great Joy that was between them two
when they ben met / there may no tunge tell
There is no more / but unto bed the go
And thus in Joy and blys / I let hem dwell
This worthy Mars yt was of knyghthode well
The flour of fayrnes / lappeth in his arms
And Uenus kysseth Mars / the dod of arms
So Iourned has this Mars of which I read
In chamber / amye the palace pryuely
A certain time / till him fill a dread
Thorugh phoebus / that was common hastily
within the palace yates sturdely
with torche i^ ho^de of which ye stremes bright
On Uenus chamber / knockeden full light
The chamber there as lay this fresshe queen
Depeynted was / with white boles great
And by the light / she knew ye shone so shene
That phoebus came / to bre^ne hem with his here
This sely Uenus nyghe dreynt / i^ teeris weete
Embraces Mars / and said alas I deye
The torehe is come yt all this world will wreye
Up sterteth Mars / he lusts not to sleep
when he his lady herd / so complain
But for his nature was not for to weep
Instead of teeris / from his eyes tweyne
The fyry sparkys / breken out for pain
And hente his hawberke / that lay him beside
Flee would he not / ne he might hem self hyde
He throws on his helm of huge wight
And great him with his swerd / and in his hand
His mighty spear / as he was wont to fight
He shakes so / that all most it to wonde
Full heavy was he / to walken over land
He may not hold with Uenus company
But bad her flee / lest phoebus did her espy
O woeful Mars / what may thou sayn
That in the palace of thy distourbaunce
Art left behind / in paryll to be slain
And yet thereto / dowble is thy penance
For she that has / thyn heart in governance
Is passed half the stremes of thyn eyes
That you nere swyft / well may you weep / and cryen
Now flees Uenus unto Cylenius toure
with void / course for fere of phoebus light
Alas and there / has she no socoure
For she ne fond / ne saw no manner wight
And eke as there / she has but little might
wherefore her seluen for to hyde and save
withyn the cave / she fled in to a cave
Derke was the cave / and smoketh as the hell
Not but two / paces within the gate it stood
A naturell day in derke I let her dwell
Now will I speak / of Mars suryous and wood
For sorrow he would have seen his heart blod
Syn that he might do her no company
He ne rought not myte for do dye
So feeble he wexe for heete and for his woo
That nyhe he swelte / he might not endure
He passed but one steyre in days two
But natheles for all his heavy armure
He followed her that is his lives cure
For whose departing / he took greter Ire
Than for all his brennyg in the fire
After he walks softely a paas
Complaynyng that it pity was to here
O lady bright / Uenus alas
That ever so wide a compass is my spear
Alas when shall I mete you heart dear
This twelfth day of Apryll / I endure
Through Ialous phoebus / this mysauenture
Now god help / Sely Uenus all allone
But as god would / it happed for to be
That while that Uenus made her moan
Cylenius rydyng in his chyuache
Fro Uenus balance / might his palace see
And Uenus saleweth and does chere
And her resseyueth / as his friend full dear
Mars dwellit forth in his aduersyte
Complaynyng ever / on her departing
And what his complaynt was / reme^breth me
And therefore / in this lusty morenyng
As I best can / I will it seyn and sing
And after that / I will my leave take
And god give every wight / Joy of his make
The campleynt. of Mars.
The order of co^pleynyng / requires skylfully
That if a wight / shall plain pytously
There must be cause / whereof he plain
Or men may deem / he pleynyth folily
And causeles / alas and that am not I
wherefore the ground and cause of all my pain
So as my troubled wit / may it atteyne
I will reherce / not for to have redress
But for to declare my ground of heaviness
The first time / alas that I was wrought
And for certain effects heder brought
By him that lordeth each intelligence
I gaf my true seruyse / and my thought
For evermore / how dear I have it bought
To her that is of so great excellence
That what wight / yt first shewith his presence
when she is wroth / and makes of him no cure
He may not long / in Joy of love endure
This is no feyned matter / that I tell
My lady is the very sours and well
Of beauty / lust / fredom / and gentylnesse
Of rich array / how dear men it selle
Of all disporte / in which men friendly dwell
Of love and play / and of benygne humblesse
Of sown of instrumentis of all swetnesse
And thereto so well fortuned and thewed
That through ye world / her goodness is showed
what wonder is then / though I besette
My service on such one / that may me knette
To weell or woo / syn it lies in her might
wherefore mine heart / for ever I to her hette
Ne truly for my death / shall I not let
To ben her trewest servant / and her knight
I flater not that may know every wight
For this day in her seruyse shall I deye
But grace be / I see her never with eye
To whom shall I pleyne of my dystresse
who may me help who may my harm redress
Shall I complain unto my lady fre
Nay certes for she has such heaviness
For feer and eke for woo / as I guess
In little time / it will her bane be
But were she sauf / it were no force of me
Alas that ever lovers mote enduer
For love / so many peryllous adventure
For thought so be / that lovers be as true
As any metal that is forged new
In many a caas / hem tyden often sorrow
Sometime their lady / will on hem not rewe
Sometime / if that Ialousye it knew
They myghte^ lightly their head to borowe
Sometime enuyous folk / with tunges horowe
Deprauen hem / alas whom may they please
But he be falls / no lover has none ease
But what auaylleth such a long a sermon^
Of auentures of love / up and doun^
I will return / and speken of mine pain
The point is this of my destruccyon
My right lady my salvation
Is in affray / and note to whom to pleyne
Of heart sweet lady souereyne
For your disease well ought I swowne and swelte
Though I none other harm ne dread felt
To what fyn made he that sytte so hye
Bynethe him love / or company
And streynth folk / to love magre their head
And then her Joy / for ougha I can espy
Ne lasts not / twynklyng of an eye
And so^me have never Joy / till they be deed
what meneth this / what is this mystyhede
whereto constrayneth he / his folk so fast
Thing to desire but if it should last
And though he made a lover / love a thing
And makyth it steadfast and during
yet put he in it such mysauenture
That rest is there none his yeuyng
And that is wonder / that so Just a king
Does such hardenes / to his creature
Thus whether love break orellys dure
Algates he that has with love to done
Has ofter woo / than changed is the moon
It seems / he has to lovers enemyt
And like a fyssher / as men alday see
Bayteth his angle hook with some plesau^ce
Till many a fysshe is wode / till that he be
Seasyd therewith / and then at erst has he
All his desire / and therewith all myschau^ce
And though the line break / he has penance
For with the hoke / he wornded is so sore
That he his wages has for evermore
Of the broche of Thebes
The broche of thebes / was of such a kind
So full of rubyes / and of stones ynde
That every wight / that set on it an eye
He wend anon to worth out of his mind
So soor the beauty / would his heart bind
Till he it had / him thought he must deye
And when it was his / thnne he should dreye
Such woo for dread / ay while yt he it had
That welnyghe for the feere / he should mad
And when it was for his possessyon
Then had he double woo and passion
For he / so fair a tresour has forgoo
But yet this broche as in conclusyon
was not the cause of his confusyon
But he that wrought it / Infortuned it so
That every wight that had it should have woo
And therefore in the werker was the vice
And in the coueyter that was so nyce
So fares it by lovers and by me
For though my lady have so great beauty
That I was mad / till I had her grace
She was not cause of mine aduersytee
But he that wrought her / also mote I thee
And put such a beauty in her face
That made me coueyten and purchase
Mine owen death / him wit I that I dye
And mine vnwytteth at ever I clambe so hye
But ye now hardy knights of renoun
Syn that ye be of my deuysyon
All be it not worth / to so great a name
yet seyn these clerks / I am your patron
Therefore ye ought to have some compassyon
Of my disease / and take it not a game
The prowdest of you / may be made full tame
wherefore I pray youw / your gentelnesse
That ye complain for mine heaviness
And ye my ladies that been true and stable
By way of kind / ye owentobe able
To have pity / of folk that been in pyne
Now have ye cause / to clothe you in sable
Syn that your emperyce / the honorable
Is desolate / well ought ye complain
Now should your holy teris fall and reyne
Alas your houour / and your emperyce
Is nyhe deed for dread / ne can her not cheuye
Complain eke ye lovers all in fere
For her that with vnfeygned humble chere
was ever ready / to do you socoure
Complain ye her / yt ever has had you dear
Complain ye beauty / fredom / and manner
Complain ye her / that needs your labor
Complain ye thylke sample of all honor
That never did / but all gentylnesse
Lrythe ye therefore on her some kyndnesse
The compleynt of Uenus for Mars.
There nys so high comfort to my plesaunce
when that I am in any heaviness
As for to have leyzer of remembrance
Upon the manhood and the worthynes
Upon the truth / and the stedfastness
Of him / whose I am / all / while I may dure
There ought blame me no creature
For every wight preyseth his gentylnessne
In him eis bounte wysedom and governance
well more / than any manes wit can guess
For grace has would him so ferforth tauau^ce
That of knyghthode / he is parfyght richesse
Honor honouerth him / for his noblesse
Thereto so well / has fourmed him nature
That I am his for ever / I him assure
For eury wight preyseth his gentylesse
And not withstandyng all his suffysaunce
His gentle heart / is of so great humblesse
To me in work / in word / in contenaunce
And me to serve is all his business
That I am set in very sekernesse
Thus ought I well bliss mine aueture
Sith that him list me serve in honure
For every wight preyseth his gentylesse
Now certes love / it is right couenable
That men full dear abye / thy noble thing
As wake a bed / fasting at the cable
weeping to lawhe / and sing in copleyneg
And soon to cast vysage and lokyng
Often to change vysage and contenaunce
Pley in slepyng / and dreme at the dance
All the reuerse / of my glad feelyng
Ialousye be hanged with a cable
She would all know / thuegh her espyeg
There does no wight / nothing so reasonable
That all nys harm / in her ymagenyng
Thus dear abought / is love in yeuyng
which often he yeueth / without ordenaunce
As sorrow enough / and little plesaunce
All the reuerse / of my glad feelyng
A little time / his yefet is agreeable
But full encombrous / is the vsyng
For subtle Ialusye / the deceyuable
Full often time causes destourbyng
Thus ben we ever / in dread and suffryng
In noncertayne we languysshyng in penance
And have full often many a hard myschau^ce
All the reuerse of my glad feelyng
But certes love / I seye not in such wise
That for to skape out of your laas I mente
For I so long have been in your seruyse
That for to let of / will I never assente
Now force / thaugh Ialousye me turment
Suffyseth me to see him when I may
And therefore certe / to mine endyng day
To love him best / shall I never repent
And certes love when I me well auyse
On every estate / that men may represente
Then^e have ye made me through your frau^chise
Chese the best / ye ever on earth went
Now love well her / and look thou never stente
And let the Ialous put it in assaye
That for no pain / would I not say nay
To love you best / shall I never repent
Hehrte to the it ought enough suffyse
That love to the / so byghe a grace has sent
To chese the worthyest / of all wise
And most agreeable / unto mine entente
Seek no further / neither weye ne went
Syn I have suffysaunce / unto my pay
Thus would I end / this complaynt or lay
To love him best / ne shall I never repent
Thenuoye.
Princes resceyue ye / this complaynt in gre
Unto your excellent benygnyte
Dyrect after my little suffysaunce
For elde / that in my spyrite dulleth me
Has of endytyng / all the subtylte
well nygh byrafte out of my remembrance
And eke to me it is a great penance
Sith ryme in englysse / has suhe scarcete
To follow word by word the curyosyte
Of grau^tson flour of him / ye make in france
Explicit the compleyces of Maris and Venus / and of the broche of The bes.
Here follows the cou^ceyll of Chaucer touching Maryag etc. which was sent
te Bucketon etc.
My master bucketon / wha^ of christ our king
was asked / what is troth or sothfastnesse
He not one word answered to that askyng
As who seyth / no man is all true I guess
And therefore / though I hyghte you texpresse
The sorrow and woo / that is in marriage
I dar not write of it no wickedness
Lest I my self / fall efte in such dotage
I will not seyechow that is the cheyue
Of sathanas / on which he gnaweth uer
But I dar seyn / were he out of his pain
As by his will / he would be bound never
But thlke doted fooll / that often has lever
ychyned be / than out of prison crepe
God late him never fro his woo disseuer
Ne noman him by wayle though he weep
But yet lest thou do worse take a wife
Bet is to wedde / than brenne in worse wise
But you shall have sorrow on thy flesh thy lif
And be thy wives trall / as seyn the wise
And if that holo wryt / may not suffyse
Experience shall the teache / so may hap
That the were lever betake infryse
Than often fall of weddyng in the trappe
This lityll wryt / proverbs / or figure
I send you / take keep of it / I read
Unwyse is he / that can no weell endure
If thou be syker / pua the not in dread
The wife of bathe / I pray you that ye read
Of this matter / that we have no hand
God grant you / your lyffrely tolede
In fredum / for full hard is to be bond

The dispocyon of the world.
The monethis varye eueryche has his sygn
And hard it is all wedrs for to know
The time some while is gracyous / and benygne
And upon hyilles and valeyes that benlowe
The four wyndes / contraryous do blow
In every storm / man is here abydyng
Some to relyue / and some to overthrow
How should man then / be steadfast in living
The worldly answer / fortune transmutable
Trust of lordshyp / a feynte sekernes
Every season varyeth / frendshyp is unstable
Now myrthe now sorrow / now hele now sekenes
Now ebb of pouert now flodes of riches
And stont i^ change / now loss / now wynnyng
Tempest in see / and wyndes sturdynes
Make men unstable / and ferfull of living
Tytan somwhyle fresshly does appear
Then^e comes a storm and does his light deface
The soil of somer / with flouris glad of chere
wynters rasour does them a way race
All erthely things suddenly don pace
which may here have no syker abydyng
Eke all estates falls fortune does menace
How should a man / be steafast of living
Behold and see / the transmutacyon
How the season / of grene lusty age
Force of Iuuentus / strong. hardy. as a lion
Time of manhood / wysedom lad of courage
And how decrepitus / torneth to dotage
Cast all in a and alaunce / and forgete nothing
And thou shall see in this life a pylgremage
Ie which there is no stedeast abydyng
The (...) ^yfte up thyn eyes unto heaven
And pray thy lord / which is eternal
That sytte so far / above the sterrys seven
In his ryall place / most Imperall
To grant the grace / in this life mortal
Contricion / shryft / ho wsyll / at departing
And er thou part hens / remssyon fynall
To ward te life / where Joy is everlasting
AMEN
