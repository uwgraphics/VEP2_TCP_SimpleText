HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENCE


To the most High and mighty Princess Elizabeth, by the grace of God Queen of
England, France and Ireland, defendres of the Faith, etc.
YOur Soldier, (most excellent Princess,) having received so many gracious
words for other of his writings, the which it has pleased your Majesty so
favorably to vouchsafe, is not thereby only encouraged, now once again to
betake him to his Pen, but also he is imboldned to present to your gracious
view, this little labor, containing A Pathway to Military Practice. The title
best befitting to come from a Soldier, yet the circumstaunces not
unnecessary to be considered of, by such as be in authority.

And although I know the greatest number (which can not abide to here of
wars) are as unwilling to admit of any thing appertaining to Martiality when
they have so long continued in Peace, yet as in the time of war, circumspect
care of peace may not be omitted, so in the time of peace, such things must
be foreseen appertaininge to the wrrre, that the want of warlike prouiisons,
be not prejudicial to this sweet and quiet peace, for as Valerius Maximus
faith, the custody of blessed Peace consists in the knowledge of War:
Plato praising the Art, commands that children should learn it so soon as
they were of ability, Cirus said it was as necessary as husbandrie^,
Augustine and Barnarde, both Catholic doctors of the Church do approve it.

The Romans appointed a long and spacious field which they called Campus
Martius, wherein they exercised their youth in the knowledge of Martial
feats: They likewise invented glorious triumphs, which was to no other end
but to stir up the minds of their people to magnanimity and martial
exercises. Cambises the father of Cyrus being asked by what means countries
might best be kept in safety, answered. If the governors of the same
countries, thinks they can never be wary enough of their enemies.

And although Solomon, (who in the holy scriptures is called Rex Pacificus)
being promised by the mouth of God a peaceable reign, and was still busied in
the building of the holy temple, forgot not yet to furnishe himself more
strongly with all manner of warlike provisions, then his father David had done
before him, notwithstanding he was still exercised and busied in the wars

Here I could allege infinite examples, and as many probable reasons might
be geathered, all in defense of martial practice, for he that takes away the
knowledge of feats of arms, works the overthrow of his own country and
common wealth: And as by the knowledge of war and exercise of arms, Empires
have been purchased, Kingdoms enlarged, Princes preserved, Justice
maintained, good Laws protected, and the Common wealth defended, so in
neglectinge martial exercises and laying aside of their weapons, how many
kingdoms has been brought to calamity, how many countries ruinated, and
how many florishinge Cities sacked, beaten flat to the ground, covered over
with moulde, and almost worn out of memory. But as your majesty, having most
prouidentlie furnished every part of your Realm, withal manner of warlike
provision, in such sort, as none of your predecessors has ever heretofore
come near, so could I wish, that in England we were as well furnished, with
practiced Soldiers and expert warriors, although I do not mean, that they
should be war loouers.

And as it is most apparaunt, that the regard your majesty have had (even
since you first became our sovereign) in all manner your princely proceedinges,
has so wonderfully blessed your estate, that all Christian Princes do honor
and renown you, so we your loouinge subjects (feeling the benefit of your
peaceable government) have no less cause to give God all honor and glory,
and daily to pray for the long continuance of so gracious a princess. And as
it has pleased God, so wonderfully to defend your majesty, from such several
practices, intended against your royal person by Papists, let their treasons
(most humbly I beseech you) be made examples (as well for your own safety, as
also for the benefit of the whole common wealth of England) whom your majesty
may hereafter trust.

These be the men (O most gracious Princess) that he sworn your mortal
enemies, these be the men, O noble England that seeks thy wrack and
overthrow: Let the^ have no government within your majesty's dominions, let
them bear no sway in any part of your territories: Pluck him from the bench
though he sit robed in purple, dismiss him the bar, though he be called
Sergiant at the Law, put him out of commission, though hebeare the name of
Justice of Peace: pardon me (most gracious Princess) in discharging my duty,
though simply yet truly, Soldiers are but blunte, but sure they love
plainnes.

Thus desiringe God most earnestly and according to my duty, that as he has
hither to wonderfully preserved you in most magnificent and Princely regality,
(in dispite of all the enterprises and practices of traiterours Papists) so he
would continue your majesty long to reign over us, to the great comfort of
all your loouing subjects, and for the prosperity and flourishing estate of
the common wealth of England.

Your Majesty's Soldier most humble and dutiful to be commanded: Barnabe
Rich.

To the most noble Captains and renowned Soldiers of England, health to
their persons, and happiness to all their honorable attemptes.
ALthough I have undertaken (honorable gentlemen) to set down directions for
young Soldiers not yet fully perfected in Military Practice, yet for the
better experienced (of who^ my self would gladly be instructed) as I have not
presumed to offer them prescriptions, so I hope they have no cause to mislike
of this mine enterprise. It is now 24. years ago, since I first undertook
Arms and served at New haven, under that most honorable Earl of Warwick (a
father to Soldiers at this day) sith which time, what I have either
practiced by experience, seen by example, or gathered by History concerning
Martiality, I have here set them down, to the benefit of my country men, that
are not yet practiled in so honorable and exercise, what faults I shall
commit through ignorance. I hope you will pardon of curtelie, when they shall
proceed rather of the zeal I have to please, then of any desire I have to
offend: thus submiting altogether to your discreet corrections, I end.

Yours as his own, Barnabe Rich.

To the freendly Readers in general, Barnabe Rich Soldier, sends greeting.
IT may be (friendly Reader) that thou will think my labor might very well
have been spared to write of any thing appertaininge to wars where every man
is desirous to live in peace, I know will rather purchase dislike then win me
love, yet as I am not ignorant, that quiet peace is to be preferred before
bloody war, so in the time of peace, warlike disciplines must not be omitted
in a well governed common wealth, where so many evil neighbors are so ready
to incroch but especially when both Prince, Country, religion, law, justice,
subjects and altogether are under the protection of arms.

Where is become the dominions of the Assirians, Persians and Grecians, or
what is become of the glory of that learned City of Athens, or what has
wasted the renown of the City of Rome that it had not been perpetual, but
only when in the time of peace, they fell to inordinate riot and delicacie,
neglecting the feats of war, laying aside their arms and weapons: For to
doubt and fear nothing was more hurtful to commonweals, then their very
neighbor enemies, the fear of whom was their safety and assurance. For this
cause Scipio though it unnecessary that Carthage should utterly be destroyed,
fearing that after the subversion, the Romans leaving of their martial
minds should fall to idleness, riot and outrage, and as he looked for so it
came to pass, as it was testified after by Saint Augustine, who in a book
which he had written entitled, De ciuitate Dei, has these words.

More hurtefull was the City of Carthage to Rome after his destruction, then
duringe the whole course and season of the wars which the Romans had with
her, for that whylest they had enemies in Affricke, they knew not what vices
meant in Room. In the time of peace therefore, there must be had special
regard to the disciplines of war, and not only provisions of warlike
furnitures to be made, but also men of service and practiced Soldiers to be
had, relieved, and maintained: for what should you do with arms, weapons,
munitions and furnitures, when you have not men of experience to use them King
Phyllyp of Macedon used the like comparison to that noble Captain Antipater in
these words.

What, fear thou the Cittyzens of Athens, the Gallyes and their peer, are
but trifles unto me, for what account is to be made of those fellows that
give themselves to daunsinge, loytring, banqueting and to belly cheer, but if
Demostines only were not amongst them, I would sooner make account to win
Athens, then either Thebes, or Thessalia of which I am already possessed.

By these premises it may be perceived that it is the Soldier, that
protecteth the Prince in his seat, it is the Soldier, that defends the
Divine in his pulpet, it is the Soldier, that vpholdeth the Judge in his
place of Justice, it is the Soldier as Varo says, that resists the outward
force of enemies, that represseth domestical seditions, and defends the
liberty of subjects: If his service be then so beneficial to all, O what
pity, he is not better considered of by some, that are so bountiful in
rewarding pipers, parasites, singers and dauncers and other like ministers of
their pleasures, and suffer poor Soldiers to beg, and will sooner affoorde
him a payer of stocks, then a single penny for his alms.

Epaminondas Captain general of the Thebanes, understanding of a very rich
man that had no care of the poor, sent a needy soldier unto him, commanding
him under great penalty to give 600* crowns to this poor man, this Citizen
receiving this commandment, came to know the cause, it is (quod Epamino^das
because this man being honest is poor, and thou which have lived by the spoil
of the common wealth art rich. O that our Usurers in England might sometime
have such messengers sent unto them, I think the errande would neither offen
de God nor man: Neither can I see why there should not be a general
contribution given through the realm, for the mayntenaunce of men of war,
when their service concerns such public profit: The Prince is not able to
recompense all, and the soldier must fight in defense of all, why should he
not be maintained by the help of all.

But here some will think I speak for my self, and I confess it, soldiers
must learn of other men to speak for them selves, for there is no body else
that will: What trade or handicrafte have you so simple, but if it begin a
little to decay, but by and by it pleades poverty, runninge to the Prince or
Parliament for relief, either by repelling some statute, by making some
privilege, or by attayning some consideration: And if upon any occasion
between Nations trafique be stopte, how clamerous is the Merchant in the
ears of his Prince, till he has his passage again freely set open:

The Lawyer will permit no Edicte to come forth that makes against his own
profit, though otherwise it be beneficial for the whole common wealth: The
Divine finds fault that their spiritual promotiones should so many ways be
bereaved them, and (I think) complains of it not without some cause: If
every profession hauelybertie to say for them selves, give soldiers leave to
speak, when by the unkindness of their countrymen they are brought to the
worst, and yet as profitable members to their common wealth, as they that
thinks them selves best: Is it not the Soldier by hasarding his life
abroad, that vpholdeth the Artificer to sit quietly by his work at home. And
what would it avail the Merchant to speak for foreign gain, if the
soldier were not to defend him from domestical spoil. The Lawyer makes no
plea but for private profitte, and burldes goodly houses, and purchases whole
countries about him.

The soldier serves his country for a small stypende, and would be contended
with alowance but to buie meat, drink, and cloth: And that very religion
which the divine but coats down in his quiet study without any peril, that
very religion the soldier maintains with the loss of limme and life. How
much more might here be alleged in the behalf of soldiers and their
service, yet these be they that the politic wise man (him I mean) (that is
better practiced in Machauils policies, then studied in the new Testament)
would have to be kept under. But leaving profane histories, out of the which
great volums might be written, have we not examples out of the holy Scriptures,
how valiant minds have been rewarded, and men of service liberally
gratified: in the 14. Chapter of the book of Numbers. Caleb was promised
reward by Gods own mouth for his own constancy and courageous persuasion to
the children of Israel: The same Caleb to gratify Othuiel his brothers son,
for taking the City Cariathe, bestowed of him his faier daughter Athsah:
David likewise received great riches with the daughter of King Saul, for
killing Goliath: David him self promised great rewards to such as should
overthrow the Iebusits, and Jesus the son of Syrach says: There be two
things that grieve my heart, and in the third is a displeasure come upon me,
when an expert man of war suffers scarsenes and poverty, when men of
understanding and wisdom are not set by, and when one departes from
righteousness to sin.

But is not that country to much ungrateful which has no manner of remorse
to those men whose blood has scarletted the grownd so much to their glory, and
no less to their preservation: If soldiers must be had (as of necessity they
must) how would you have them live, will you set down no course: Give me
leave then to say my mind I speak but in sport, but that it might come to
pass I would wish in good earnest. Leaving many presidentes, let us fetch our
example from the people of the low Countries, who being generally given to
drunkenness, has such an excise imposed both of Beer and Wine, that it well
near suffiseth to pay all their soldiers during the time of the civil
wars.

Now our people of England being as generally given to inordinate lawing, if
the like imposition might be raised for every action they should commence, for
every writ they should fetch forth, and for every sentence in law that
should be pronounced with them both, or against them, no doubt it would
maintain a great many of soldiers to grade them, whereby they might the more
safely follow their law, and when they had spent all amongst Lawyers (as a
number of them already has done) they might have some color to crave
gratification from the Prince or Country for their good service, as if you will
bear with me, I will show you the like president. About ten years ago,
(upon occasion) being in Hollande at a town called Gorcum, a good fellow
coming to the States, craved of them some recompense, for his endeavors, which
(as he said) had been wonderfully beneficial to their state and government.

The States willing him to make repition of his service, and he should find
them ready to consider of good desert, this good fellow then so well encouraged
begins his tale.

It is not unknown (quod he) that within these seven years, I was worth
4000. Guilders, sith which time until this present (so long as I had one
stiuer left) I am sure there is no man that ever saw me go sober to bed: Now
gentlemen, if you will wisely consider of this, how beneficial my drinking
has been to your common purse of excyse, and not only what my self have
spent of mine own, but also by my drawing in of many other good drinkers in my
company, I doubt not but as you must confess I have been a good member to my
commen wealth, so you will not fail to gratify me, according to my desert.

Now, if the like excise were set of the Law, why might not a fellow that
had beggerd him self by lawing, crave like consideration, and by as good
desert: I speak not against the trial for title of lands, which I know must
be decided by the verdit of a Quest, or the discretion of a Judge, but I speak
against these unkindly Actions of Trespass, commonly commenced for the
speakinge of a word, for a neighbors goose that shall but look over a hedge,
and for other such like occasions, wherein they will not stick to spend more
pounds, then for the relief of a soldier, or defense of their country they
are willinge to give pence. But as it is necessary such clyentes should be a
little wrong by the purses, so such counsaylers should not go scotfree, that
are the annimaters to such causes. I remember long since, (when I was a
little bookishe,) I read a History in our English Chronicles, and although I
can not set you down the place, yet as I can I will tell you the matter.

A Prince of this realm (upon what occasion I know not) fined all the Lawiers
of this land, for their extortion bryberie and deceit, but to one amongst the
rest, that was found to be uncorrupted there was given 300 pounds. If it
pleased her majesty to follow this example, and to fine every Lawyer but at
ten pound, that has cozoned his countrymen at the least of renscoore, to
them that shall be found free from corruption, she might double her benevolence
and make the three hundred pound 600. in Gods name, and yet save an honest
portion for the maintenance of her wars: It was sometime though that one
Lawyer, and one Gossehauke were enough in a whole shyre, and as Plato
concludes, it is a token of a corrupted estate, where there are many Lawyers,
and many Physicians, because the multitude of Lawyers are maintained by the
contention of people, and such store of Physicians, by their excess in diet,
drunkenness and gluttony. But pardon me here I pray you, the tellinge of a
merry tale that comes but now sodainelye in my mind, and thus at follows.

There was sometime a Lawyer dwelling far in the North that had served a writ
of a poor Cumberland man, for his appearaunce at Westminster in the beginning
of the next Term, this poor man for want of a horse coming to London on
foot, and by the way as he passed, where he saw a sign he was sure to find
meat, drink, and lodging for his money, but coming to London, and by fortune
hitting into Holburne, seeing a sign at every man's door, began to make
doubt, and calling to a Boy that passed by, asked him where he might find
an Inn, the Boy (disposed to play the wagge) points him to one of the Innes
of Court, the poor fellow going in, and seeing many Tables covered in the Hall
(for it was almost dinner time) thought with him self there was good cheer
toward, walks up and down, till the gentlemen came in, and sitting down,
he fell in amongst them to the Table, the Steward (who to see good orders)
perceiving one without a gown and a cappe, comes to him and tells him how
that was no place for him, and wills him to arise, the poor man aunswers him,
good fellow I ha siller in my purse ayse pay for what I take, but the Steward
seeing his simplicite and how he was deceived, aunswers him again, my friend
this is no place for you to spend your siller in, this is for gentlemen
Lawyers, and there comes no other here but such the poor fellow heering his
words arose from the boorde, and in a great chafe answers thus.

Now the foul ill tae them, be all thure lawyers, marry had I kende that, I
had rather have eat no bread these two days, then have come among sayke a
company; thus as he was hastily goinge forth of the doors, the gentlemen
sporting at his folly, followed him laughing, which when he perceived, calling
to the porter he said, ay say, my good fellow slot to the door, by the bread
a gad and all thure may once break out, there is near a poor man in England
that shall live in whayet by them. Now here letting slip the simplicity of a
Clown, let us return again to speak of soldiers, who as they are little
provided for in the time of peace, so they are as smally cared for in the
season of war, and this is not a little to be meruailed at, that when any
occasion of service does happen, some be appointed for Captains as knows
not how to place 100. men in good order of array, unless it be (peradventure)
to march them 3, or 5. in a rank, as they use to fetch home a may pole.

We do find in the holy scriptures and that in several places, both in the
books of Moses, in the book of Joshua and others, where they have used not
little regard as well in the chosing of their Captains, leaders and conductors,
as also in prescribing laws and disciplines of war, which sometimes were
appointed by the almighty God him self: Phillip King of Macedonia, did
marvel why the Athenians did every year choose new Generalles and
Captains of the wars, when he him self had found but one good, namely
Permenyo: Alexander admitted none to the room of a Captain under the age of
60.

But in England, we never number his years, we neither consider his knowledge,
we little regard his worthiness, we less esteem his experience, we scarce
examine his honestye: Our Captains are appointed, more for favor then for
knowledge, more for feendshippe then for experience, more for opinion then for
desert: God grant we never come to make trial of the service of such
Captains as I have seen some, if we should, there were great fear of
unhappy success.

And this is to be lamented amongst us, that we can be so provident in
matters of no importance, and such causes where in our own safeties does
especially consist, we either neglect them altogether, or else perform them
with little care and less foresight. If the matter were well examined we
should find that the safety both of Prince state, country, subjects, and
altogether consisted in the worthiness of the Captain: and to this most fitly
agreed the saying of that noble soldier Sir VVylliam Drury, who many times
would use these words.

The want of a horse shoe nail, may be the loss of the shoe, the loss of
the shoe, the spoil of the horse, the spoil of the horse, the loss of the
man: the loss of a man, the overthrow of an army: the overthrow of an army,
the loss of a Princes crown: If small things thus by degrees, may conclude
such great prejudice in the wynding up, (as it can not be denayde) what
success is to be looked for, where captains and leaders are so utterly
ignorant, that many of them knows not when it is time to charge, nere when it
were good to retire: and as Socrates says, the boldenes of the ignorant
ingendreth many euilles, and Agesilaus affyrmeth, the lack of experyence
breeds the lack of courage: And as histories make mention, more feeldes have
been lost for want of government, then for want of strength.

To give a brave charge, is a thing proper to every ordinary soldier, but to
make a good retreat in time, and in order, therein consists the skill of the
Captain: The inexpert Captain, and the unlearned physician, do buy their
experience at to dear a rate, for it is still purchased, with the price of
men's lives: The place of a Captain is honorable, and ought not to be given
but to men of experience, of valiaunce, and of virtue, and yet I have heard
tell, where they have been made marchandyse of, and bought and sold for
money, but I dare not say that I have known it my self, for paraduenture I
should offend.

But I hope soldiers shall not be still illegitimate, they shall be esteemed
according to desert. The Divine for tellinge a learned discourse in a Pulpette
is rewarded with a Bishopric, and but according as he is worthy, the Lawyer
for making a good Plea at the Bar, is brought to the Benche, and it is done
with consideration.

The Soldier that watches, that wards, that trauelles, that toils, that
makes his body a defense for Cannon shot, and fears no perrylles for the
love of his Country, I trust will be better considered of God has
wonderfully blessed us with sweet and quiet peace but let us not be secure, as
though we had it by patten we have enemies abroad if they had opportunity, but
take heed of papists here at home, they are more to be feared, then he that
was borne in Spain.

Have they not made sundry profers to stir up seditious tumultes, nay what
do they leave unattempted, to disturb this happy government: But would you
have some special marks how you may know them, then listen, and by these
means you may easily smell them out: You shall have them inquiring of news,
spreading of rumors, lying, forging, counterfeiting and dissembling, what
action has there been so honouraly performed, sith that noble Earl of
Leicester undertook these low country services, which has not been defaced
(here at home) by our slaundering Papists.

What good news has there come over which they have not paraphrased, what
enterprise so justly attempted, which they have not eclipsed, or what exployt
so bravely accomplished, which they have not methamorphised: Such is the
devotion of our religious Catholics, that they strain no courtesy to forge
lies, to practice treasons, to commit murders, to stir up rebellions, nay
what outrage is there so mischeeuous, which they will not enter into to do
their holy father service. These be their works meritorious which so many
times they boast of, and by this ladder they think to clime up to heaven
gates, where saint Peter stands watching ready to let them in. O how many
ungodly practices, have they intended against our most gracious princess, how
are they continually busied in conspiring against her: but that almighty God
who first planted her to their subversion, has not failed still to protect her
(no doubt) to their confusion. Were not the fury that ouerruleth them more
then extreme, they could not be such enemies to their own discretion, but
that they might well discern, it is Gods blessing, that so mightily defends
her against the Popes cursing, and although his holiness has taken great
pains, in sending forth his Jesuits, his Seminaries and other his ministers
(from time to time) with so many conspiracies, and such several practices
against her majesty, yet at their departure when they come to crave his
fatherlye benediction, (God be thanked) he blesses them al to the gallows.

And although that accidents are many times sufficient to serve their turn,
either to confirm, either to confound religion according to the event, I
wonder they cannot as well condemn a Papist in his ill success that is sent
over with so many hallowed bulls, as they will do a protestante, for the
least misfortune that may befall him, but if this light were sufficient for men
to judge colors by, who more blessed then our gracious Elizabeth who so
happily has reigned over us this 28. years, how mightily has God preserved
her, from the conspiracies of Popish traitors, how many foreign princes have
sought to her for succors, that like as ancient Rome (while the government
rested in the soldier) was the very refuge for such as were distressed by
oppressing Tyrants, so the greatest part of Christendom, has thought their
states the better assured, when they have combyned with her Majesty, and
shrouded them selves under her gracious protection, with what peaceable
government has she continued her subjects, how has England flourished sith
she became our sovereign, what would you more, of her self she is merciful,
her noble Counsaylers careful, her loouing subjects dutiful, that to
conclude, if these presidents be testimonies of the love of God (as without
all question they are) then O thrice happy England that do enjoy so
excellent a Princess.

Now contrary wise, let us but consider of the Popes best belooued the King of
Spain, how has he been shaken in the most parts of his dominions, his
Indies (the fairest flower in his Garland) the inhabitants whereof, are so
oppressed with the tyranny of the Spanish government, that they let not daily
to enter into rebellion, seeking all means to shake of that servitude, by
reason whereof, the great sums of treasure he was wont to receive out of
those parts, begins to deminish, and is like to decrease every day less
then other: For the regimentes in Italy, who knows not how discontentedly they
endure the Spanish government, but the garrisons so keeps them under, that
the poor Italians must be contented for a time to bear the burden, although
it be so much against their wills.

In Spain it self, the Gospel of our savior Jesus Christ has taken such
effect in the hearts of a multitude, that the King is busied in nothing more
then in keeping under of his Protestants and questionles, as it has pleased
God to suffer it to take rooting, so in time it will bring forth fruits, let
my masters of the holy house look to it as wisely as they can.

The tyranny the Spaniardes used in the low countries, the cause of the
peoples revolt, is so welknowen to all, as I should but waste the time to make
a new repitition, but this I may not omit that the King of Spain (being so
mighty a monarche as they would make him) could not by force of honorable
war, in so many years subdue the poor prince of Orange, but in the end
setting aside all dignity, honor and reputation be fitting a King (in most
shameful and infamous manner) practiced his death by murder, the matter is so
fresh in memory, as I need spend no loger time to repeat it: Be these the
examples of Christian humanity, nay undoubted confirmations of Turkysh
tyranie, but (as they say) such Carpenters such chippes, such Saints, such
relics, such tree such fruit, even so it may be said, such quarrel, such
conquest, And has not the Prince of Perma, made the like conquest in
recoueringe again of Sutphen Scance, and in taking of Deuentre: the one the
Earl of Leycester won from him by honorable and brave assault, the Prince
being at at hand with his whole force within the hering of the battery, so
that it cannot be said it was stolen upon him, Deuentre in like case (hanging
but in doubtful Ballaunce) was asured by the Earl, at that very instante
whiles he lay before Sutphen: neither practiced by deceipte nor compassed by
treachery, but performed by honorable polycie, the Prince being in the field
and had continual intelligence of every action that was attempted, so that it
may be said, every thing was done before his face: But he taking his time
while the Earl was out of the Country, recovered them again by the like
stratageme, as he uses to atrayne the rest of his conquestes, which are ever
obtained by tyrrannie, by treason, by corruption, by murder, and by such other
deuillishe practyses, both detestable before God, and dishonorable amongst
men: but this is best befittinge men of their religion, and iumpe correspondent
to their holy fathers doctrine.

I would nor here be mistaken, neither do I mean (by any thing before
said) that where a Prince is perturbed by war of otherwise, that such
euentes are for tokens of the displeasure of God toward him, but this I
infer, that where the cause of such troubles do proceed through his own
tyranny, although, I know the Pope may well bestow his blessing in such a
cause, yet God with his own mouth has cursed the cruelty of such
oppressors, and the executours of so notorious outrage.

There rests now no more, but that we be provident for our own safeties,
our enemies looks about, they watch but opportunity, let us be as vigilant,
least they hap to catch us napping, the enemy is by no means sooner
repulssed, then when he shall perceive we be already well provided for him: we
have already committed some errors and a little trodden awrie, we have let slip
oportunities, we have fostered serpents in our own bosoms, and although they
have bitten us yet we can not beware, but let us lament follyes under more
covert terms, for the world is given to see too much, our continued peace
has been the nourisher of many vices, we have entertained pride new fangled
fashion, and monsterous atire, what extortion is found to be in the mighty,
what oppression in the wealthy, what vnsariable desire of having, what
unreasonable practice in gettinge. What corruption of such as give bribes,
what persurie of such as take bribes, what buying of oaths in the one, what
selling of conscience in the other What greedy speaking Law against Justice,
what deuillish counsel given for money against law, what envy in the clyent,
what craft in the counsayler, what covetousness in both: What impyetie in
tale herers, what impunity in tale tellers, what malice in the one to seek
them, what flattery in the other to bring them.

What pride and disdain in the higher sort, what stubburne disobedience in
the lower sort, what lack of love in the one, what neglect of duty in the
other, what froward heart in both: What making and repellinge of many laws,
what contempt and breach of all laws, how many Justices in every place, what
want of Justice in all places.

What Marchandyse is made of law, what buyinge and sellinge of Justice,
Offices that were wont to be rewards of good desert is now set to bargain
and sale for who will give most, yea the blood of poor innocents is sometime
bought and sold for money: The honesty of the suter is not regarded, the
equity of his cause is not examined, if he will bestow any Crowns they
shall be viewed: we punish iniuryes offered to ourselves, but we omit
such offenses as are dyrectlie against the honor of God, if this that I have
said be not enough, to say any more would be to much. I will therefore
conclude, humbly beseechynge God long to preserve her Majesty to raygne over
us, God confound her foes and bring to light all Popish Conspirators, and
Traiterous confederates that practyse against her. God so bless her noble
Counsaylers that in all their consultations, they may determine nothing but
that may redounde to the safetye, honor and renown of noble England.

Amen.
A Path-waie to Militay Practice, first of the election and choosinge a
General.
AS sweet and quiet peace is the blessinge of God, and is especially to be
preferred amongst true Christians, yet as Cicero says, we must sometime
take wars in hand, to the end that we may the more safelye inioye this
happy peace, and Verro likewise affirms, that arms are many times
necessary, to resist the outward force of enemies, to repress domestical
seditions, and to defend the liberty of subjects: and it is holden for a
principle in common policy, that it is better to offend then defend.

That Princes in policy should use all possible means, for the defense of
true religion, for the safety of his own estate, for the maintenance of his
loving subjects, for resisting the crueltyTyrantes, is both warranted by the
opinion of all politic writers, and in of the holy Scriptures, not only
tolerated, but in many places expressly commanded. In the 14. of Genesis
Abraham entered into arms for the recouerye of his brother Lot, in the 31. of
Numeri Moses is willed to make wars upon the Madianites, by the express
commandment of God, Saul in the first book of Kings the 15. Chapter has
the like commandment, in the book of Judges Chapter 2. the children of
Israel were blamed for making of peace with the Cananites: A prince therefore
that minds to enter into arms, is first to consider of the equity of his
cause, then making choice of a General, such a one as fears God, is likewise
to fortefie him self with the goodness of his quarrel, neither is there any
mean more rather to incite men to valiaunce, then when they shall remember
they go to the fight in a righteous cause, for fortitude ever fights for
equity and justice, and valiaunce without justice is to be accounted rashness,
but every virtue has his counterfeite follower, as deceit sometime creeping in
is called policy, so rashness shrowdeth it self under the title of fortitude.

And as Plutarche says, all valiant men are hardye but al hardy men not
valiant: the distinction grows, where men will oppose the^ selves into
perril, sometime without justice, sometime without judgment, according to this
saying of Plato. That not only the knowledge which is severed from Justice, is
rather to be called subtlety then wisdom, but also the courage which is
forward to danger with out judgment and for a common profit, may rather
bear the name of lewd hardines then valiaunce.

A General thus fortefied in his own conscience, with the justice of his
quarrel, is now to satisfy his whole company with the example of his virtue,
and as the eye (above the rest of our senses) is least mistaken, and the mind
apter to receive impresion by what the eye sees, then by that the ear
hears, so there is not a more speedy mean, to make inferiors to embrace
virtues, then when they shall see the governor or General, give first example
in his own person. A General therefore must especially both love and fear
God, he must not be without learned Preachers and Ministers of gods word, which
must instruct and teach the Army, practicing them as well in the fear of God,
as in duty and obedence to their Commanders, Captains and Officers.

In his own person he must be magnanimious, courteous, gracious, easy to be
spoken with, constant in his counsayles, quick in his executions, and secreete
in his determinationes, that his intentes may be kept close. Thus shall he be
honored, not for fear of his power, but for the loone of his virtue, the good
opinion whereof being settled in the hearts of his soldiers, is of wonderful
eficacie, for the accomplishment of al his attemptes and enterprises. When
Scipio had undertaken the subversion of Carthage, in marchinge on his way
toward the execution, a noble man demanding of him wherein his hope
consisted for the performaunce of so difficulte an enterprise, Scipio
answered, in the love of my Soldiers, which I know to be such toward
me, that if I shall bid them to cast them selves from the height of yonder
Rock, they will not refuse it, when it shall redounde to my honor and
reputation.

Mercy and Justice in a General, be two precious ornaments, as well to win
the love of his own people, as to draw the hearts of his very enemies, and
many times have been of greater effect to subdue them, then the force and
strength of mighty arms: there is no one thing more requisite in a General,
then a a francke and liberal mind, which makes a souldidiour more profitable
to the battle in the day of fight, then a miserable unthankful wretch, with
multitudes of treasure. He must be mild, courteous, gentle and loving amongst
his soldiers, preferring the safety of his own people before the killing of
his enemies: A General thus adorned in his own person, is now to make choice
of his counsel for the wars, his great Officers for the feelde, his
Captains, leaders and conductours of his army.

His counsalers should be men of quick capacity, ready wit, and sound
judgment: and here (according to the mind of the Philosopher) I would wish
a general should rather be advised by such as looues him, then by those that
are best belooued of him self: the first he shall find faithful and firm
for his honor, the other perhaps may flatter and speak to please humors.
His Officers, Captains and leaders, must be chosen for virtue, not for
oppinion: for knowledge, not for favor, for experience, not for freendshippe.
They should not be men detected with vices, for pride breeds disdain,
covetousness, extorting both of Prince and Soldier, swearing brings
hatefulnes to all honest ears.

Cato being Censurer to make choice of a General of the Pannonian wars,
said with a loud voice that he would dysmisse Publius, because he had
seen him walk the streets of Rome perfumed, but in my oppinion it is a
president of some error, to see a Captain that shall go all to be gilded,
and to see his poor Soldiers follow, with neither Hose to their legs nor
Shoes to their feet.

Good persuasion, and to know how to speak well is a most necessary virtue
both in General, Officer and Captain, some time by oration to add
encouragement to their Soldiers, some time it contains them in order and
diseipline, and many times it more prevails to bring the enemy to
composition and agreement, then their squadrons and troops were able to win
by force.

Cineas, by the excellency of his oraforie, brought more towns in subjection
is his master Phyiihus by his tongue, then Phyiihus him self could do by his
valor. Generalles are now to provide for all manner of warlike munitions and
provisions, both offenciue and defeneiue, as well for the feelde as the town:
he must be prepared of pay, of victual, artilerie for all pur poses, of
poulder and short, as well for the Cannon as the Caliuer, of match, of armor,
of weapons, of cariages, of all manner of tools, for cutting, frenching,
mining, scalinge, fortefying, al these and many furnitures about the
Ordenaunce, and belonging to the charge of the master of the Ordenaunce, the
General must first provide for, and that in such sort, as when he shall
think him self to be best furnished, yet to have care of the time that is to
come: he must be furnished with Inginers, Armourers, Carpenters, Smithes,
Masons and Pyoners.

But a General must especially be well provided for the payment of his
retinewe, for the want of pay, does not only infeeble and abate the courage
of souldyours, when they shall be pincht both with hunger and cold, but it
breeds mutinies, it causes dysorders, it neglects service, and lettes slip
oportunities. To set down in particulers what great prejudice has happened
for want of pay in several armies, would ask longer discourse then were
requisite in this place to stay upon.

There is nothing that better maintains discipline amongst soldiers, then
to see them well paid and to have them well punished, and I dare undertake that
where a Prince has occasion of service, 10000. men that should be truly and
duly paid, should be able to do more and better service then 30000. as I
have seen, for want of pay scarce able to go of their legs. A general
therefore that would expecte the regard, duty, obedience, and love of his
soldiers, must see them well paid, so shall his prescriptions, orders and
disciplines be inuoyolably kept, him self duly honored, and his soldiers
able to serve: here might much more be said of a General touching his
eperience, learning, and knowledge of Arts, behouefull for many purposes, but
this may suffice, and a general thus appointed as I have said, shall be both
honored, looued, followed and served.

The Lordhigh Marshall.
THe Lord high Marshall ought to be a man of such perfection and knowledge,
that of his own experience he may as well instruct inferior officers in
their duties, as correct and chastise the^ for their misdemeanors: to his
office appertains the administering of justice, the punishing of abuses, the
correcting of all disorders, and to give every man his right. The high
Marshall is to appoint the camping place, where in he must have this ordinary
consideration, for wood, water and forage. He is to quarter the camp,
assigninge to the quarter Master where the regimentes of footmen shall be
lodged, and where the horsemen shall like wise have their places: He must
appoint the watch, and surueying the places of greatest peril, he must give
order to his inferior Officers to have them furnished with requisite guard,
directing the scout to places of most conuenience.

The order that is observed in the Low Countries, where the Sentinel is
relieved by the Corpse de gward, every two hours, is both better and easier,
then where they use to make them stand the whole night. When the Camp shall
remove, he is first to appointe the Scoute Master to send out discouerours
which way the army must pass, that must wearely survey straightes, copses,
and all places fit to hide ambushmentes, and according as they find
occasion, so to give intelligence. He must then signify to the master of the
Ordenaunce, and in like manner to the Caryage master, that the artilerie,
munitions, and all other carriages may be made ready and set forwards. He
must then give order to the Sargiant Mayor in what form he will have the
battle to march, wherein he has to consider both of straightes, and otherwise
of the nature of his passage, assigning both guides to conduct them, and
Pyoners to mende or make ways for the cariages and army the easier to pass.

It is not good that an army should march long iournies, but upon urgent
occasion, to the end they may come timely to their lodginges, to build their
Cabbens, to fetch in forage and all manner of necessaries. As the Lord high
Marshal in his own person is to determine matters of greatest importance, so
of necescitie he must have a Provost, with other inferior ministers, that
must likewise be skillful in laws and orders of the field, and must still be
attendaunt in the Camp to decide petty brables, and small controversies as
they shall happen to arise: and because the Provost is an apendaunt to the Lord
Marshall, I think it best in this place to set down his charge.

Of the Provost.
THe Provost is to have the charge of the Marshal sea he must be provided of
Fetters, Gives, handlockes and all manner of Irons, for the safe keeping of
such prisoners as shall be committed to his keepinge.

He is to see due execution of all malefactors, having received sentence of
death from the General or Lord high Marshall. He is to keep the peace, to
see justice, to punish abuse, and to apprehonde the authors of any disorder:
He must rate the prizes of such victual as shall come into the Camp in such
reasonable sort, as both the Uictualer may be a computent gainer, to the end
he be not driven to shun the Camp, and also that the soldier be not to
much exacted on, to the end his little pay may be able to find him, he must
have care that the Uictuall be good and wholesome, and in any wise he must not
suffer the Uictualer to receive abuse, because there is nothing more
beneficial to a Camp, then that it be followed with great store of
Uictualers. He is to see the Camp cleanely kept, neither anoyed by unmannerly
Slouens that have no regard where they ease them selves, nor by any other
filthe or garbege of beasts that shall happen by butchery, he must have like
regard that the waters be clean and purely kept, and not only to forewarne
but surely to punish, as many as shall be found offenders in the premises: the
watch being set, he must not suffer any noise or great stir in the Camp, as
many times it happens where soldiers be merry, and at convenient hours
must cause all victualers to shut up their doors, that all things may be
hushed, quiet and still.

Of the office of the Lieftennaunt or General of Horsemen.
THe General of the horsemen or Caualary, which has been divided in four
kinds, the first men at arms, themselves armed Complet, and their horses
likewise barbed, and were to give the first charge to disorder the squadrons or
batalions of pikes. The second lances, lighter armed with corselets, and to
break in with the men at arms where they had made way or otherwise as they
could see advantage. The third light horsemen, commonly armed with a coat of
plate with a light staff charged on the theigh, serving for many purposes, as
to scoute, to discover, to break foreray, or to follow a chase that is put to
a retreat: The fourth and last called shot on horseback, but now lately called
Carbines, commonly light horsed without armor serving either with Pistol or
Petronell: and as the shot one foot being charged do retire for succors
to their pikes, so these Carbines may skyrmidge loosely and delivering their
volleies, are not able to stand any charge but must retire to the lance for
his safety. The General of the Horse having the roles of all the bands, with
the names of their Captains, is to divide them so equally for every service,
that such as be employed in the day must be relieved in the night, and those
that have served in the night must have rest in the day, other wise the Horse
will so suddenly be infeebled, that he will be serviceable but a very small
time: In the day of fight he is to divide his companies into wings and
troops, appointinge who shall first give charge, who shall come to second
them, who shall stand for rescues, and thus to direct them, that every man
knowing what he has to do, may the rather hope of victory, or at least keep
them selves in safety.

The General of Horse ought to give warninge through his companies, that they
neither disarme themselves, neither vnfadell nor vnbridell their Horse, till
the Camp be impalde and scoutes put forth. The General of the Horse, must
not be unprovided of Smithes, Farriers or Horseleaches, Sadlers, in like
manner every Captain of Horsemen furnished in his cariages with Sickles
Sithes, Combs, Cords, Betles, stocks, etc. The General of the Horsemen may
have his Leiftenaunt, a man sufficient in skill both to assist him in all
occasions, and in his absence, to command in every thing with like authority
as his general might do, and is called the Lieftenaunte of the Horse.

The Colonel general of the footmen, or Eanteri.
A Colonel General is a place of great authority, and is to command all
other Colonelles of foot regimentes, if the General shall have occasion to
use companies for any service, the Colonel general is to appoynte them which
they shall be, he must therefore have a role of all the Colonelles and Captains
of every other regiment, to the end he may order and deuyde them as upon
occasion he shall see meet, he is only to be directed by the General or Lord
Marshall, and after they have determined, he him self directs all the rest.
Upon occasions of service where honor is to be won, he is to use all the
regimentes with such indifferency, as they have no cause to grudge or repine.

Of the high Treasurer at VVarres.
THis Office amongst the rest is of great recconing, he is ever of the
counsel, and may freely speak his opinion, concerning any action or
enterprise, he is to make payment upon the receipt of the Generalles warrant to
all Colonels, Captains or Officers what so ever, but yet defeating of all
arereges wherewith he shall be charged either by the master of the Ordenaunce,
the Uictualer, or clarke of the chek. He is to receive from the Muster master
the perfect number and true charge both of Horse men and foot men, and of all
the rest that takes pay through the whole Camp, then geathering a proportion
of the charge as it monthly amounts unto, he is to present it to the
General, to the end he may make provision for pay accordingly.

The office of the Serieant Mayor.
THis Officer should be a man of most exquisite knowledge, thoroughly examined
in all manner of fourmes and proportiones of imbatteling, he must have the
perfect number of every sort of weapon that is brought into the field, so
shall he orderly martial them with the quicker expedition and lesser confu
sion. In the day of fight he must have consideration to ye nature of the place,
and in fourming of his battle take any advantage that the ground will afforde
him. He must likewise consider of the forces of the enemy, and whether his
strength more consists in Horse men or in footmen, and as he shall find
them prepared, to dispose of his own order thereafter: and as by aduauntages
of grounds many helps may be taken, so in the plain where there is nothing
to trust but order, I cannot think any proportion more defencible against both
Horse and foot then the just squadron, for that it is strong every way a like.

We have many fourmes of battle (as hereafter I mean to write on) some
altogether unnecessary, other some though very excellent, yet very dangerous
to be ranged before an enemy, where Soldiers are not more exceeding perfect,
then commonly we have them in England. But the just square is a most sure
fight, plain and not curieus in orderinge, and in the plain field as service
holds at this day, I know no form that may be justly said to better it.

The Sarieant Mayor, has for his assistauntes the four Corporalles of the
feelde, which should be men likewise of good experience, and should still be
attendaunt to the direction of the Sarieant Mayor, helping him in every
quarter, and at every season as he shall give them instructiones. The day when
the army shall remove, he must repair to the Lord high Marshall or Colonel
general, to know in what order the army shall march.

Of the Master of the Ordenaunce.
THis Office is of great reputation, and asks both judgment and experience,
he takes charge of the Artillery and all other munitions, the which in the
Camp he must see safely internched, and in the day time conveniently guarded
with a ward, and in the night time as surely watched. He must have knowledge
in fortification, to plant his ordenaunce in places of most advantage, as well
for the guarde of the Camp, as to make battery in beseeging either Town or
Forte.

He must not only have his Ordenaunce well and strongly mounted, the cariages
and wheles surely bound with Iorne, but he must be likewise furnished with
spare axeltrees, wheles, cariages, ingens to mount them, ladels, rammers,
sponges, crows of Iron and leauers to use them. Many other things he must be
furnished of about the drawing of them, whether with Oxen or Horse, they must
have Carte ware ropes and other necessaries which the Cannoners are to look
for, but the master of the Ordenaunce must make provision for the same.

He must have from the Marshall, Pyoners and Laborers to go with the
ordenaunce, as well to make or mende ways through Moors or Fennes as they
shall happen to pass, but also if by casually a piece should be overthrown
there may be help ready to mount it. He must be provided of skillful
Cannoners, Inginers, Smithes, Whele wrightes, Carpenters and such like. There
are many other things that concerns this office, as for sundry occasions to
be provided of fire works, and all such simples and necessaries fit to
compound them: with inginyng, myninge, trenchinge and such like, are to be
directed by the master of the ordenaunce, and for his better help is allowed a
Leifetenaunt, which should be a man well seen and exercysed in the premises.

The Master Gunner.
THe master Gunner being an officer depending of the master of the
Ordenaunce. I will therefore in this place set down his charge, he ought not
only in him self to be exactly perfect in his Piece, but also make trial of
the rest that be under him, that he may be assured they be able to discharge
their places, he must be like assured that they be still attendaunt in their
place of charge, and to have all things in readiness to take oportunities.

He should practice them to beat such places usually traded by the enemy,
that he may the better know his mark when he shall see occasion: which is very
beneficial to such as are beseeged, and defending of some passage may much
annoie a Camp. His wantes of poulder, shot, ladels, sponges, rammers, and
other like necessaries concerning his art, are to be supplied from the
master of the Ordenaunce.

The Trench master.
TH Trench master is likewise appendaunt to the master of ye ordenaunce: for
the intrenching of a Camp, it is commonly staked out as well the curtines,
ringes as flankers: his greatest care must be so to convey his trenches, either
before a Town or Fort that shall be beseeged, that the enemy do not flank
them, for that the castinge and conueying of Trenches orderly, does concern
great safety to so many as shall have occasion to pass to and fro.

The Munster master.
IN making of Musters, this Officer is to survey ever Soldier, whether Horse
man or Footeman, not only of the ability of the person, but also of the
sufficiency of his furniture, as well Horse, Armor, Weapon, and altogether, and
either to pass or defaut them as he shall find reasonable cause, and to make
certificate accordingly to the Treasuror, yt he may stop such defautes of
their pay. The Munster master is to make out warrantes by his book for so
many as be in pay, from the first of his enterie forth on from time to time
under his hand, which being signed by the General is sufficient to the
Treasuror.

The Scoute master.
THe Scoute master every evening upon the soun ding of the Marshalles Trumpet
to the watch, must receive by assignement from the General or Liefetenaunt of
the Horsemen a sufficient number to scoute, the which by him self must be
directed into cross ways and other places of perrill in every quarter of the
Camp, he must exhort them still to silence, and to have regard to look about
them, and not to forsake their places appointed, till discouerers be put forth
in the morning to the field: He is in the morning (by like assignement) at
the discharginge of the watch, to receive a competent number of men to
discover, the which he must likewise appoint to places of most conuenience for
the purpose: in like manner when the Camp does march, he must be still
scouring before to see the coast be clear.

The Forage master.
THe Forage master is likewise to receive from the Liefetenaunt of the Horse,
an able company of Horsemen for the guarde of forragers and such as shall
fetch in necessaries, the which upon the sound of a Trumpet must altogether
go forward, not suffering them nor any other to straggle out of his company
further then he is able to rescue them, and if they be far from the Ca^up^,
not to suffer any to depart home ward till they be all provided, and then as
they came forth, so to return all again together.

The Carriage master.
THe Carriage master in like manner is as well to have a Cornet of Horsemen from
the Liefetenaunt of ye Horse for his guard, as also loose shot from the
Colonel General, or else to march with all his baggage between the troops
of footmen for his more surety.

Of a Colonel.
THe place of a Colonel is of honorable reputation, and therefore besides
experience, he should be a man of credit and good countenance, and as that
most noble Gentleman, Sir William Russell, (a Parragon of Arms at this day) is
many times accustomed to say, that he which wants liberality, is possessed
with all the vices in the world, so that Colonel that has not a bountiful
mind, and a francke disposition to lend relief to a poor distressed
Soldier, especially of his own retinue and regiment, is unworthy to have the
comaunding of men, and not fit to have government nor bear office in a
Camp.

In places where Soldiers are not levied by the Princes Commission, the
general is to make choice of his Colonels, men both sufficient in
countenance and credyt, for the leuying of such companies as the General
shall commit to his charge, then receiving his commission with impressed, the
Colonel in like case is to make choice of his Captains, impresting every of
them likewise for the raisinge of their several companies.

But in England upon occasion of service, Soldiers are ever levied by the
Princes commission, where if such consideration were had in the choosinge of
them as there ought, it were the more safety for the service, better for the
Captain, and much more beneficial for the Soldier, considering his
furniture is allowed him by the Country, which other wise is cut of from his
pay if he be not able to furnish him self The Colonel has the commanding
of all such Captains under his own regyment to direct upon any occasion of
service as he shall see good: A Colonel may have his Liefetenaunt Colonel,
his Sarieant Mayor, his Provost, and his Quarter master, within his own
regyment. A Colonel may correct misdemeanors of his Captains, he may call a
Marshall Court of his own officers, for the punishing of offenses, or for the
administering of Justice.

Of a Captain.
THe place of a Captain is not lightly to be considered of, upon his skill and
knowledge consists the safety or loss of many men's lives, but especially
service standing now as it does most commonly in skirmidges, where the
Captain most ordenarily is not helped but with the advantage of his own
experience.

In the old time many years ago, when armies many times used to appoint the
field, where their whole forces were brought to encounter: the weakness of a
Captain might the better be borne with all, when their were so many superior
officers to dyrect him: and yet in those days they used circumspection in
nothing more, then in choosing of their Captains, but service standing as it
does at this instant over it was then, we ought to have three times more
regard then they had, and yet we use ten times less then they did. And I
wonder how so many insufficient men dare oppose them selves to undertake a
matter of so great importance, whose inexperience, besides (by cyrcumstaunce)
that it concerns the loss of a country, so in it consists the hazard of
many men's lives, if it were more but his own, the matter were the less, for
he may value of that as him self shall see good, but remorse of conscience
should touch him to consider of his Countrymen, when his want of knowledge,
shall sometime breed to much rashness, and sometime again to little courage. A
Captain that might be thought worthy, should as well have knowledge how to
govern, as experience how to train, wherein he is to use great diligence,
instructing them in their order of array, the use of their weapons, teachinge
them to know the soundes of Drums.

He must in no wise be injurious to the Soldier for his pay, but as
carefully he must use diligence to get it, so as cheerfully he must pay every
may his due, he that neglects this, neglects his own credit and
reputation, nay more his honesty, neither is it fit he should go
unpunished, yt barreth or deminisheth a soul diour of his pay. A Captain
should be loouing and comfortable to his company, and as he is to correct
and punish them for their faults, so he is to commend and encourage them in
their well dooinges: some consideration a Captain should have, for the
carriage of convenient necessaries for his soldiers, when they go to the
field, yet no more then must needs he had, he should have some store of
Hatchets to cut bowghes to make their Cabbines, for want of which they break
many Swords, to conclude, a Captain that can carefully consider of his
Soldiers necessities, and leuinglie provide to furnishe their wantes, shall
have both unfeigned love, and dutiful obedience of his Soldiers, without
the which, he is not only assured to loose his credit, but many times in more
perrill of his own company then of the enemy.

Of a Liefetenaunt.
THe Liefetenaunt of a company, in his Captains absence has authority to
direct all, and in his Captains presence to disburthen him of some inferior
toils: His place requires knowledge in the field, trust to his Captain,
freendship to his inferior officers, and love to the Soldiers. In
discharging his duty, his office is painful, and thereafter to be considered
if his Captain be grateful.

The Ensign.
AS the Ensign in the field is the honor of the band, so the Ensign bearer
in like case should be honored by his company, and this reputation is best
attained, by his own courteous demeanor toward ye soldiers, the love of
whom concerns greatly his own safety, in all perrilles and attempts. M.
Furius Camillus seeinge his army begin to stagger and to stand at a stay,
thrust his Ensign bearer amongst his enemies, in whose recovery, the
Soldiers taking courage charged again a fresh. The Ensign bearer therefore
should be a man of courteous disposition toward the Soldiers, courageous and
cheerful when he is before the enemy, in any distress resolute rather to
loose his life, then to loose his Colors.

Of the Sarieant.
IT is requisite in every band, that besides a Captain a Lieftenaunt and an
Ensign, there be for every hundred men a Sarieant: this Sarieant should be a
man of good experience of quick and lively spirit, and able to take pain. He
should be a father among Soldiers, making the Captain or Leifetenaunt
privy to their wantes, and to see all things equally distributed amongst
them that there be no cause of discention: he ought in gentle and freendly
manner to appease all strifes and contentious quarrelles that shall fall out
amongst Soldiers, and if by courtesy he can not perswad the^, let him then
bring the offenders to punishment. He must be ready to train and practice such
as he shall find to be imperfect in their weapons, gentely to show them the
best and readyest way: He must see them to march straight in their ranckes
carrying their weapons orderly without any communication, or loud speaking
amongst them. A good Sarieant in a bad company, shall find business more then
enough tell they be well trained, and is therefore to be considered of by his
Captain.

The Drums.
IT is necessary that every company have two drums, the one to be still
resident with the Colors the other to march with the Troops, as upon
occasion they shall be drawn forth. These Drums must be perfect to sound
a call, a march, a charge, a retrait, a larum, and such like points of war:
And for that they are many times sent on messages to the enemy about prisoners
or other causes, it were convenient they should be discreet and sober, least
they should be undermined.

The Chyrurgion.
A Good and skillful Chyrugion is a necessary man to be had in a company,
such a one as should work according to art, not practisinge new
experimentes upon a poor Soldier, by mean whereof many have been utterly
mayned by a Chyrurgions practice, that other wise might have done very well. A
Chyrurgion knows what salues, oyntmentes, oils, balmes, and instruments,
are requisite to be had, and must have them in readiness, he should not
likewise in the time of service be without his bauldricke that he might be
known, it serves his turn likewise in the night to pass the watch without
the word, when upon occasion he must go to his cures.

The Clarcke of the Band.
THe Clarke of the band is to be placed by the Captain a man of great trust,
and has to keep the Countes and recconinges between the Captain and his
Soldiers: His greatest commendation is to write, to read, to cast accountes,
to be honest and just between the Captain and his Soldiers.

Of the Corporal or Launceprezado.
IT is much beneficial for the redines for service, that accompany of men
should be divided into four squadrons, the weapons equally divided, and to be
committed to the charge of four Corporalles, who is not only to exercise them
in the use of their weapons, to see them continually furnished with all
necessaries, and the shot to be still provided with poulder, match, bullets,
and such like, but especially to have care to the keeping of their furniture
clean and serviceable: A company that is thus divided, and the Corporal
dutiful in his place, is very ready either to watch or ward, or to many
other purposes where one or two squadrons are to be drawn forth, and may
suffice for some services. A wise Corporal, that thinks to come to credit,
will use diligence in his place because it is his first step of preferment,
and for his more ease he has his Launceprezado or deputy to assist him.

Of a private Soldier.
IN the choice of a Soldier, his manners and conditiones is first to be
respected, otherwise you may make choice of an instrument of many mischeefes,
the composition and ability of his body is then to be considered, in the like
manner his sufficencie for years.

In England when service happens we disburthen the prisons of Thieves, we
rob the Tauernes and Alehouses of Tospottes, and Ruffines, we scour both
Town and Cuntrie of Rogges and vagabons. And is not a Captain that is
furnished with such a company like to do great service, and to keep them in
good discipline. In other Countries where they use the service of malefactors,
they admit them not for soldiers, but they send them to their Galleys and to
other places of like slavery: And those Captains that has made trial of such
Soldiers, would gladly be rid of his charge to be eased of his trouble.

The first thing therefore that is to be respected in a Soldier is the
honesty of his mind, which being lincked with religion, there is no doubt but
that Soldier will be brought both to the fear of God, to the obedience of
his Captain, and to the obseruaunce of discipline. The Romans who for their
martial observation were most renowned, the rather to keep Soldiers under
awe and discipline, they adjoined to their own laws and ordinances the
authority of God, and used with great; ceremony to make them swear to keep
the disciplines of war. The Grecians in like manner, their soldiers being
armed and brought to the Church received this oathe.

I will not do any thing unworthy the sacred and holy wars, neither will I
abando^ or forsake my band and Captain to whom I am appointed, I will fight
for the right of the Church and safety of the State: I will not make my
Country to be in worse case then it is, but I will make it better then I
found it: and I will ever frame my self reverently to obey those laws also
that the State shall hereafter by common assent inacte or set down, that if
any one shall change the laws or not obey them, I will not suffer him to my
power, much less will I allow in so doing, but I will be a sure defender of
right as well by my self alone, as when I am with others, and I will ever more
honor the religion of my Country. To these my sayings I call the Gods to
witness. These and such other like cathes the antiquity administered to their
Soldiers to nourishe obedience, for besides valiaunce, a soldier must be
adorned with these special virtues, which are silence, obedience and truth: a
good soldier must have special regard to the keeping of his furniture clean
and serviceable, in steed of dicing, drincking and swearing, let him use
running wrasteling, leaping, or such other like exercises of agility, let him
keep his own quarter and not depart without the license of his officer, a
Soldier thus disposed may comfort him self with hope of aduaunceme^t.

Of Disciplines.
AS these considerations in the choosing of Captains officers and soldiers,
have ever been especially regarded amongst the most renowned, and best
experienced warriors, so an army being thus chosen, ye like respect must be
had in the appointing of laws, disciplines and orders, the which ye General
by advise of his counsel is discreetly to set down, and to have them openly
published by sound of Trumpet, that the whole Camp may take notyce thereof: and
being thus proclaimed, he must use as great severity to have the^ maintained,
for what will it avail the making of good laws where there is no care had to
see them surely kept.

We do find in the holy scriptures, and that in many places, as well in the
book of Moses as the book of Joshua, where laws and disciplines of war,
were many times appointed by ye almighty God him self, and that he would not
suffer disobedience to escape unpunished, it is evident by Corah, Dathan and
Abiram that were swallowed up in the earth, for mutiny. But the Romans who
above the rest did most exceed for their martial prescriptiones, so they were
as severe in punishing the offenses, of such as should infringe and break
their laws of arms: They punished with death him that lacked in the watch, he
that forsook the place that was given him to fight in, he that carried any
thing hid out of the Camp, if any man should say he had done some worthy
thing in fight and had not done it, he that for fear had cast away his
weapon, and when it happened that the whole Legion had committed the like
fault, their names were taken and put together in a bag, and every tenth man
as they were drawn were executed.

When Marcus Cato (after a token given) had loosed from the coast of his
enemies, where he had lain a certain space and saw one of his Soldiers
left on the shore, crying, calling and beckoning to be taken in, he cast
about with his whole Navy to the shore again, and commanded the same
Soldier to be taken and straight put to death: willinge rather to make him
an example to the rest, then that he should be slain by his enemies with
reproach and infamy. The Romans punished nothing with more severity, then
those actions that were either attempted against commandment or enterprised
against reason, but as they punished those victories that were attained by
lewd hardines, so misfortune deminished not his reputation, that attempted
with discretion, neither attributing cowardlines to ill success, nor valiaunce
to good fortune, for the event of such enterprises commendes not the execution,
neither is it the success that makes us perfect wise, but to attempt with
reason and judgment, confirms we seem to have wisdom.

Papirius Cursor being Dictatour required, that Fabius Rutilius, should first
be beaten with rods, and then be beheaded, because he fought without his
commandment (notwithstanding he had the conquest,) neither would he forgive
the punishment, for the contention or entercession and request of the
Soldiers, neither (per suing him to Rome whether he fled) would he there
remit this dreafull sentence, till Fabius him self with his father fell both on
their knees, and yt also the whole Senate and people made intercession for him.
This were a hard world for some hare brainde Captains, that are ready to
choppe upon every chance, like a gudgion that is ready to bite at every
bait, never fearinge the hook till she be hanged by the lips.

Manlius Torquatus caused his sons head to be stricken of because he had
forsaken his place, and went to fight with an enemy that had challenged him
and stue him. And Salust does report, that there were more soldiers put to
death amongst ye Romans, for setting upon their enemies before they had
license, then for running out of the field before they had fought. And as the
Romans were thus precise in maintaininge their discyplines severely, so their
Camp in those days was a School of honor, Justice, Obedience, duty and
loyalty: where now a den of deceipte, treachery, theiuery, injury, and all
manner of impiety.

Hereafter follows sundry Stratagemes, and many good instructions practiced
by the antiquity, and necessary for diverse purposes.
What is to be respected before you enter Battle.
THe most renowned Emperor Augustus, gave these instructions for Captains as
follows, that although a Prince were mighty, yet if he were wise, he would
never give battle, unless there were more apparent profit in the victory, then
loss if the enemy should overcome. And the most approved Captains held
this opinion, that it were not good to bring their men to fight, except they
had advantage or else brought to it by constraint. The aduau^tage grows by
the Situation of the place, by order, or having of more or better men: The
necessity happens, when they shall perceive by deferringe of Battle it must
needs fall out to their discomodity, as when famishment were ready to assail
them, or when the enemy looks for some new supply, in these causes it were
better to attempt Fortune where she may favor rather then by deferringe, to
see thy certain ruin: Vigesius gives counsel never to bring an army to
fight except they hope to have the victory, for what greater sign is there to
loose, then not to believe to be able to win: to add encouragement
therefore to Soldiers there has been several practices used by diverse. L.
Silla in the wars against Archelaus, Mithridates Liefetenaunt at Pirea,
perceiving his Soldiers had little stomach to fight, so weried then with
continual labor, that they were glad to desire to fight.

Q Fabius, knowing the Romans to be of so liberal and honest nature, that by
spiteful and contumelous dealing they would be soon moved, vexed and grieved,
and looking for no honest nor equal dealinge of ye Persians who were his
enemies, sent unto Carthage Ambassadors to entreat of Peace, which was
consented unto, but with such proud and unreasonable conditions, that the
whole army of the Romans, were thereby stirred and encouraged to fight.

When Agesilaus, had pight his field not far from Orchomeno, a City that
was in league with him, and perceiving that many of his army had their
treasure and chief riches in the Camp, he commanded the towns men to
receive nothing into the town belonging to his army, to the intent, his
Soldiers might fight the more fiercely, knowing they should fight for lives
and goods. Fabius Maximus, fearing that his soldiers would not continue the
fight manfully, by reason they might quickly fly to their ships, commanded
they should be set on fire before he would begin the battle. Some have
constrained their men to fight through necessity, taking away from them al
manner of hope of saving them selves unless they did overcome.

And there is nothing to concitate the minds of men more to encouragement then
persuasion, for him that knows how to speak well, for it kindles the mind
and human passions of a man, it takes away fear, it ingendreth obstinacy
to fight, it discovers deceiptes, it shows perrilles and the way to avoid
them, it prays, it promises rewards, it reprehendeth, it threateneth, it
incourageth the minds either of hope, either else of despair. Epaminondas
being ready to enter battle with the Lacedaemonians, to the end that the
strength of his Soldiers might be helped by some ser uent mean, pronounced
to them in his exhortation, that the Lacedaemonians had determined (if they
got the victory) to slaie all their men, to make their wives and children
bond for ever, and to beat down the City of Thebes flat to the ground:
these words did so move the Thebanes to such heat and fury, that at the
first encounter they overcame the Lacedaemonians. It is much beneficial for
Captains advisedly to consider of the Captain of his enemies, whether he be
rash or politic, whether he be fearful or hardy, whether he be more
strong in horsemen or in footmen, and there after to use his own advantage.

Hannibal, perceiving that Fuluius the Roman Captain was negligent, and
attempted many things unadvisedly, taking the advantage of a miste that had
some thing obscured the air, he made a small troop of his Soldiers to
show them selves to those that kept watch in the Roman tents, Fuluius
hastily rushing toward them with his Host, Hanniball on the the other side
invaded his Camp, and breaking out in the back of the Romans slew their
captain with 8000 of their best men at arms.

Iphicrates of Athens having knowledge that his enemies were accustomed to eat
still at one time of the day, he therefore commanded that his own people
should take their repast some thing more timelier, then raunging forth in
battle in that instant that his enemies should have fallen to their
victualles, he so dalied with them as he would neither give them battle
neither suffer them to depart, when it drew toward night, with drawing him
self as though he went to his lodging, and keeping his men still ready armed,
his enemies being as well wearied with long standinge and with long fasting,
made have to refresh them selves, and to betake them to their victualles,
Iphicrates bringinge forth his army again on the sudden, setting on his
enemies easily over came them.

It is many times behoueful for Captains to (...) from fight, when the enemy
is brought into some desperate passion through famine or other like natural
necessities, and this caused the Lacedaemonians, (being certified by their
spies) that the Messenians were set on such a rage that they came to the
battle, men, women and Children, which caused the Lacedaemonians to to defer
the fight.

Like wise when Caesar in the cyuill war had enclosed the Host of Affranius
and Petricus, within a trench, that they were pyned with thyrst, in so much
that they became desperate, destroying all that would withstand them or
proffered them fight, which being perceived by Caesar, kept in his men
supposing it then no time to begin. The like respect is to be had that in fight
they bring not the enemy into any extreme desperation, so to enclose them
that despair should make them fight, which caused Hanniball, (when he had
enclosed the Germans at Tarsimenus by which constraint they fought exceeding
feercely) to open his army and to make them away to get out, beating them
down as they fled with out any perrill to his own people. The like was used
by L, Marcius a Roman Knight, when he had enclosed the Carthaginenses, and so
did Agesialus with the Thebanes.

When Themistocles had vanquished the power of Xerxes, he would in no wise
agree that the bridge should be broken, over the which they should return,
saying it were better to drive them out of Europe them to fight in despair:
All things thus considered, and a willingness, setteled through the army to
fight, let them force that the charge be not given in a fury, which yet was
never seconded by virtue, for it breeds disorder and breach of araie, that
if victory be not had at the very first brunte, their confidence begins to
quail, and then follows present discomfiture: Now other wise where
resolution with order is observed there is no difficultye that may arise, but
will be an occasion to confirm and strengthen their courage with hope of
victory, which is never wanting where order and resolution are linked
together.

Hanniball never gave fight but he was still prepared with some Stratagem,
wherewith to amaze his enemies, which many times did stand him in steed for
the attaining of several victories. The spreading of rumors (duringe the
fight) affirming the Captain of the enemies to have been slain has many
times helped, as Iugurth, in the battle against C. Marius by the same policy
made the Romans to give back, so did Mironides of Athens against the
Thebanes, whereby he got the victory.

When Valerius Leuius fought against Pirrhus, and had kilde a private
Soldier, holding up his sword all bloody, made both the hosts believe that
he had killed king Pyrrhus, wherefore his enemies supposing them selves to be
destitute by the death of their Captain, all abashed theygaue over ye fight.
When a barbarous alien (in battle) had brought word to Q. Sextorious, that
Herculeius was slain, he slew him straght with his dagger, least he should
have borne those news any further to have discouraged ye army. Captains are
in like case well to consider how they follow their enemies till the battle
be performed, for he that with his people disordered persueth the enemy, may
sometime give the conquest from him self, as Q. Fabius Maximus consul, being
sent to succor the Sutrines against the Hetruscines, the whole force of his
enemies assayling him, he dissembling as though he feared them made show of
flight til he had gotten the advantage of ground, the other following out of
order, were by him not only surprised but also bereaved of cheir Camp.

Observations, as well for the victor as conquered.
WHere victory is attained it is most necessary (especially for Christians)
reverently to give thanks to the most high almighty God, humbly to ackowledge
his grace and goodness in all their accomplishmentes, and this to be done with
all humility upon their knees yet enery man to keep his place, wherein the
Captain is to use great respect, and not through ye affiaunce of his victory
to leave him self disordered, for so sometimes from a victor he may become va^
quish^: as T. Martius a Roman knight, being governor of the residue of the
host that remained after the death of the two Scipioes, this T. Martius
perceiuinge the two hosts of the Persians not lyinge far from him, careless
and out of order through affiaunce of their victory which before they had
attained, persuaded with his Souldieurs to set upon the host that lay next
unto him in the midde of the night, where they made such a slaughter that
there was not so much as a messenger left alive, to bear tidinges of this
miserable mischaunce: then giving his soldiers some small respyt to refreshe
them, the same night with all speed preventing the same of any thing done,
invaded the other army, and thus twyce in one night inioyed like happy chance
of Battle, and still following opportunity, be every where destroyed the
Persians, and restored Spain again to the Romans.

The victor after fight is so to divide the spoil as there may fall out no
contention, he must not forget to bury his dead that shall be slain in the
conflicte, he must ransom home such of his Soldiers as the enemy holds
prisoners, to deal favorably with his enemies that are taken prisoners by him
self, not only wynneth their hearts but makes him the more renowned. These
things thus performed, he is either to follow the advantage of his service,
or else to retire to some: place of securitye where they may rest: The persued
have used to scatter money in the way, to hinder the followers. By this mean
Triphon King of Siria escaped Antiochus Horse men, and when the Gaulles should
fight with Attalus, they delivered all their Gold and Silver to be kept of
certain men that might scatter it abroad if it happened they were put to
flight, to the intent they might the more easily escape, their enemies being
hyndred with the gathering up of the pray, but Galltroppes were to a more
purpose to hinder Horse men, and were better chepe to be scattered about, then
either Gold or Silver. When Q. Sertorius was put to flight of Quintus Metellus
Pius, he supposed it not a thing sure enough to fly, but also he warned his
Soldiers to disparple them selves diverse ways, assigning them a place
whether he would have them to resort.

Some to prevent the worste, would begin the fight a little before night, to
the end that if they were overthrown, through the darkness of the night they
might the better escape away. What might farther be said, I leave to the
discretion of the skylfull Captain, and will breefely speak of other
necessaries not amiss to be remembered for some other purposes.

Marching through unknown places.
AN army that shall march through places that be unknown, (but especially
being in ye enemies country) must use great diligence for being belayde
either as they are to pass rivers, straights, or other places of advantage
fit to hide ambushes. Alexander used to have such places discribed in mappes,
which should be hanged in the Camp, to be viewed by all, whereby they might
learn to know the places, the distaunces, the ways, the hills, the Rivers,
the fennes, the straightes, the wooddes, and all places of peril: fit for
the enemy either to take aduauntages, or to hyde ambushes.

Ambushes have sometimes been discovered, by the raising of great dust, or
when Dooues or Birds has been seen to fly about in flocks, turninge to
and fro and has not seemed to light, but the surest way is to have wise and
diligent scoutes and banquerers to view those places to see the Country clear.
And as troops may fall into these dangers by marching thus unawares so they
must wisely fore see that they be not trained into them by craft, as the
Fideniens, who lying for Romulus as he should pass, which he by espiall
gettinge intellgence of, laying part of his army in secreet ambushe, then
approaching where his enemies were, from whom he feigned fearfully to fly, and
they hastily persuinge him, he brought them where his ambushes were laid, who
assailing them on every side easily slew them: Some of purpose has put forth
a pray and by suffering the enemy to take it, has belayed their passage which
way they should drive it and by this means have intrapped them. They must
therefore take heed, and not hastily to bite at every bait or unadvisedly
chop upon such things as are contrary to reason, if many of the one side be
driven away by a few of the other, or if a few on ye one side assault many of
the other, or if some sudden flight be made not standing with reason, let the^
in these causes judge the worst, so shall they be assured to be least beguiled.

To pass Rivers and Straightes; what has been practiced.
TO pass Rivers, some have cut out a Trench like a rain how or half moon,
filling it full of wood and settinge it then on fire by these means have
passed. This policy was used by Q Sextorius in Spain, likewise by Pelopidas a
Theban against the Thessalonians, When Cressus might not wade over the River
Hal is, neither yet could make Boat nor bridge he cast a ditche behind his
army and turned the course an other way.

Caesar in France took the benefit of a Wood where in he left certain
companies; which after he was marched away cast a Bridge over a River that he
was to pass, the which they likewise fortified till his coming and that he
was passed: When Pericles of Athens, being driven by them of Peloponesus into a
place environed with sleep hills where was but two ways to escape, before
the one way, where he intended to get out, he caused a ditche to be cast of
great breadth, under pretend to shut out his enemies, and to the other side
he lead his Host as though he would there have broken forth, wherefore his
enemies beleeuinge he might in no wise escape that way, where he him self had
cast the ditche, withstoode him with all the power on the other side, then
Pericles having bridges prepared for the purpose cast them over the ditche on
the other side, where he conveyed over his army, no man being there to let him.

When Spartacus was enclosed by L. Varinus, he pitched up stackes here and
there before the entering of his Camp and set thereon dead carcasses clad and
Harnised, to make a show unto them a far of, that watch and ward was
dilligently kept, and leaving fires in every quarter of the Camp, by this
couller he deceived his enemies conueying away his Host by night without
interruption. Darius to deceive ye Scithes at his departing left Dogs and
Asses in the Camp, whose barking and braying caused the enemies to think how
Darius had still remained there: With the like error the Genowayes blinded the
Romans.

Fugitives and Runnagates.
HAnniball having certain of his men that were lately fled, and knowing the
enemy to have spies in the Camp, he pronounced openly that those runnagats
were gone by his assignement to harken and spy what his enemies intended, the
Roman spies returned these news to their companies, whereupon these fugitives
were taken, their hands cut of and thus sent back again to Hanniball.

When Hanno understood that 4000. Gaulles which he had hired would leave him
and go to the Romans, because they were unpaid of certain menthes wages, he
durst not punish them for fear of sedition, but promising them very
liberally, to reward the injury they had sustained by their long forbearinge
of their pay, which for the time did some what appease them, then presently
sending his most trusty Steward to Otacilius Consul, this Steward fayning to
fly away about a controversy happening between his Captain and him in a
certain account that was between them, he told him further that the next
night 4000, Gaulles should be sent out to get pray and pillage, if it pleased
him to take any advantage, Otacilius neither hastily creditinge this
runawaies tale, neither thinkinge it a matter to be dispysed, laid an ambushe
for them of his best approved Soldiers, and incou^tering the Gaulies which
Hanno of purpose had sent forth, put them all to ye Sword, and in the fight
were some of themselves slain in like manner, which satisfied the expectation
of Hanno accordingly.

Observations as well for those that shall beleager, as for the beseeged.
FOr the surprising or taking either of Town, Fort, or Castle, it is either
to be done by Composition, by Mininge, by Famine, by battery and so by
assault. But of al other, that victory is to be accounted most worthy that is
obtained by honorable composition, rather then by spillinge of blood. Mining
(if the Situation will permit it) is next to be preferred both for expedition
and lightness of charge. The Captain that minds to surprise either Town,
Forte, or Castle by famine, is sometime enforced to it, when the Situation is
so strong as it admits no other forceable mean: other whiles, they use it
of policy for the safety of their own people, but it is necessary in their
setting down to entrench them selves so surely every way, that neither
behind they might be indaungered by any force that should purposedly come to
annoy them unawares, neither from the town they might receive prejudice by
issuing out upon any sudden Canuazado: Where battery is to be presented, the
flankers are first to be displaced, the breach being after made, the assault
must then speedily be given, that they neither have respite to fortefie the
breach, nor leisure to strengthen themselves within.

I speak not here of Treasons or other corruptiones whereby many towns has
been bought and sold, the be seeged are well to consider of that, and to
keep good watch and ward to prevent many other practices, let them like wise
take heed of stalles how they be drawn forth, for by such means they are
many times betrayed: the like respect they must have whom they receive in,
neither trusting to any apperaunce of outward show, nor to any pretense that
they come for their succors, till there be good assurance had what they be,
for Towns have some times received their enemies, under the Ensigns of their
friends that should have come to their aid.

Allarmes.
IT has ever been a custom amongst Soldiers of experience, sometimes to
give Allarmes to their friends, whom they would either praise or discommende
according to the readiness they found to be amongst them, and although they
used this as a necessary mean, to induce their Soldiers to be the more care
full, yet still in this sort to deceive them, is a mean rather to make them
secure then heedefull, when they shall find them selves to be so often mocked:
The Allarmes that are given by enemies, are most usually for the accomplishment
of some exployte, sometimes to train to ambushe, sometimes to cast some
bridge, sometimes to plant ordenaunce, sometimes to make discovery, either of
order, number or strength: but when any Alarm shall be given in the night it
is very expedient to change the word.

There be many skillful Soldiers that thinks it better upon occasion, to
make secreetepreparation and readiness, and not to take Alarm in such sort as
the enemy should perceive it, and to maintain their opinions they aleadge
sundry reasons the which Iomitte, with many other matters until my opportunity
may better serve.

A CALENDAR containing the square root of any number from 100. to 10000.

Serving for the orderinge of just squares and sufficient for the Imbatteling

Malui me diuitem esse quam vocari.



Fourmes of Battles, which necessary and which unnecessary.
THe antiquity long since before either Muskette, Caliuer or Hargubuse was
known, armed their people with Crosbowes, Targettes, Long swords, Glaues,
Partisines, Halberdes and such other like short weapons, in the ordering
whereof, he ever had the advantage that in the form of his imbattelinge,
could bring most men to fight, whereupon they framed many proportions which
were both requisite and beneficial as the service then required, but as time
has now altered the manner of fight, would serve to no purpose at all.

For example, the one if he had seen the enemy imbattailed in a Triangle, he
would presently have ordered himself into a sheare battle, incounteringe one
of the corners of his adversary according to this figure.

diagram of battle formation

Again for the incounteringe of a Sheare battle, they used an order which
they called a Saw battle as appears in this form.

diagram of battle formation

THese with many other proportions which they used as their half moon, their
worm, there D. their G their S. with such like are not worth ye fyguring forth
as the service now stands. Their hearse battles, their broad squares, their
baase squares their bastard squares are very good, but best to be used upon
advantage of ground, and although my leisure will not now permit me, to set
them down proportionable to every number, yet I hope in the mean time you
will accept of some few that shall hereafter follow. The Cross battle (the
figure whereof is this ensuing) is a most excellent fight, but to order it in
due proportion to every number is a little difficult and asks longer time
then I can now stand about, and will there fore leave it till some other
opportunity.

The Cross Battle.
diagram of battle formation

THere be other fourmes of battles framed of many battalions, impaide with
sleeves and fillets of Pikes, which as they are very excellent against the
enemy, so they are most dangerous for that they are quickly disordered, where
Soldiers be not most exquisitely trained. But the fight now only consisting
in Shot and Pikes, there is no form of imbatteling to be preferred before the
just square, or if your numbers be sufficient to order them into 2. 3. or 4.
squadrons according to these figures.

A battle of 2. squadrons.

A battle of three squadrons.

A Battle of 4. squadrons.
diagram of battle formation Front. Flank. Flake. Rereward.



THese fourmes for pickes, when they are winged and trouped with shot
accordingly, as (in the plain field) there is no other order that does
exceed them for strength, so they are better for other purposes as hereafter
shall appear, but this is to be respected that where there is not at the least
2000, pikes in place, they should not be divided into more squa drons the^ one,
unless it be to keep some straight or gap or upon some other advantage of
ground, neither were it good to divide the pikes into more then three
Squadrons, where there is not five or six thousand in the field, nor into
four, squadrons, where there is not ten or twelve thousand: for this has
ever been observed for a principle amongst soldiers of the best experience,
the stronger your pikes are together in number, the battle is accounted to be
the more forceable, but the shot to be divided into many troops, are the
better to maintain fight, and the apter for service.

I have hitherto made no mention of our old English weapons, namely the Bow,
the brown Byll, or Halberd, sometimes had in great reputation, amongst us, the
bow is already set aside, yet there be some that thinks it to be a weapon of
wonderful service, and to maintain their opinions, will aleadge sundry reasons,
many of them scarce worth the speaking of, but this might suffice, that men
of judgment and daily experience, finds them to be to so little purpose, that
we see they never call for them, yet this I will say, (and it cannot be denied)
that where bows may be brought to serve against horse, they might be very
well, and stand in some stead, but so many ready shot that were placed in
their rooms, would do a great deal better, and more dangerous to the
enemy. In like manner our brown Bill, Halberd, or other short weapon, are
most natural for our Englishmen for where they may be brought to dealing of
dry blows, I think there is no other Nation that were able to stand against
them, but the child that is but this day borne from his mothers womb, shall
never live to see two battles encounter pell mell, the one with the other, as
here before they have done, and to what end then should so many short
weapons serve, that are ever placed in that part of the battle which should
be most strong, where they can never be brought to do service. But such as
will needs have such store of short weapons, were better to place them in some
winge, ready to be drawn forth upon any execution, for which purpose they
might be very requisite: and yet if any invasion should be made in our own
Country, I would neither mislike of bodies nor bylles for a readiness, our people
being so much inclined, and best practiced in the^ and might be so ordered with
the help of other weapons, as might do service for ye present: but ye very
strength and bulwark in the field, is the stand of pykes, which being impald
and trouped with shot orderly, are defensible both against horse and foot, but
so many short weapons placed in the middle of the battle, does wonderfully
weaken it, and make it more easse and paceable for ye Lance: I have sometimes
seen squadrons so placed, as their short weapons have made division of their
pykes, running quite through the body of their battle from flanck to flanck,
and the pykes but only guarding the fore and rereward, the which kind of
imbattelling is neither strong nor formal, but if you will needs have short
weapons placed in your squadrous, let them be impald every way a like as well
with pikes as with shot. And that the just square is especially to be
preferred, may easily appear by these considerations.

First it is not very curious in placyng, second it is easy for Soldiers to
march, especially if they have to pass any straights through the which they
may be drawn by 5. or 3. in a rank (if the place will affoorde no greater
scope) and be suddenly brought again into their first proportions without any
manner of confusion: but especially the just square is most defencible and
strong, both against horsemen and footmen, where there is no advantage to be
taken of ground, either of hedge or dytch, river, hill, or other like.

To this end I have set down a Calendar with the true root of every number,
from 100. to 10000. by the help whereof, knowing how many armed men be in
place, they may suddenly be brought into a just square 2. 3. or 4. as the
numbers will suffice to make them strong, the which being once placed, as an
easy workman (the foundation being first laid, finds it no great dificulty
to go forward with the residue of the building, so the armed men being thus
placed in just proportion, then after to impale with shot to proportionatly,
according to the number of the pykes, and to divide the overplus of the shot
into several troops ready to be drawn forth upon any occasion, the matter is
so easy to be performed, as a Soldier that is but of one months trayning,
will never err nor stumble in the executing.

A Calendar for the imbatteling of just squares, the first collumne is the
number of men the second how many should be added, from the first number to the
second, and so forth to all the rest to make them square numbers, for example,
the first number in the first collumne is 100. (the root whereof is 10,) as in
the third collumne is showed, to the which 100. add 21. and it makes the
number 121, the true root whereof is 11. and thus you are to proceed through
the whole.

Here follows the broad squares, baase squares, and bastard squares, for
certain even numbers, from 100. increasing by 100. to 4000. a very good manner

Some occasion of business at this instant calling me from my pen, has made me
conclude with more brevity then at ye first I intended, where I have erred
through ignorance, I hope you will pardon of courtesy, when opportunity shall
better serve me, and that my leisure may permit me, I doubt not but so to fit
you with some conceit, wherein (if peradventure) you shall find but small
pleasure, yet I will assure you it shall bring some profit. In the mean time,
accept to these so freendly as I have meant them, and I will rest thankful.
