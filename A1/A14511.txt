By the Counsel of Virginea.
WHereas the good Ship, called the Hercules, is now preparing, and almost in
a readiness with necessary Provisions, to make a supply to the Lord
Governor and the Colonie in Virginea, it i^ thought meet (for the avoiding of
such vagrant and unnecessary persons as do commonly profer themselves, being
altogether unserviceable) that none but honest sufficient Artificers, as
Carpenters, Smiths, Coopers, Fishermen, Brickmen, and such like, shall be
entertained into this Voyage: of whom so many as will in due time repair to
the house of Sir Thomas Smith in Philpotlane, with sufficient testimony of
their skill and good behavior, they shall receive entertainment accordingly.
