A pleasant new Court Song, Between a young Courtier, and a Country Less,
To a new Court Tune.


V^on a Summers time,
in the middle of the morn,
A bonny ^asse I spide,
the fa^rest ere was borne,
Fast by a standing Poole,
within a meddow green,
She laid her self to cool,
not thinking to be seen.
She ^athered lovely flowers,
and spent her tune in sport:
As (...) to Cupids bowres
she daily did resort.
The fields afford content
unto this Maiden kind,
Much time and pains she spent,
to satisfy her mind.
The Cowslip there she cropped,
the Daffadill and Dazie:
The Primrose looked so trim,
she scorned to be lazy:
And ever as she did
these pretty posies pull,
She rose and fetched a sigh,
and wished her apron full.
I hearing of her wish,
made bold to step unto her:
Thinking her love to win,
I thus began to woo her*
Fair Maid, be not so coy,
to kiss thee I am bent:
O fie, she cride, away,
yet smiling gave consent.
Then did I help to ^lucke
of every flower that grew,
No herb nor flower I ^^st,
but only Time and Rue.
But she and I took pains
to gather flowre^ (...),
Until this Maiden said,
kind Sir, I Will have no more.
Yet still my loving heart
did proffer more to pull.
No Sir, quoth she I Will part,
because mine apron's full*
So Sir. I Will take my leave*
till next we meet ag^ine:
Reward^* me with a ^isse
and thanks me for my pain.
The second part,
To the same tune.


IT was my chance of late,
to walk the pleasant fields:
Where sweet tuned chirping birds,
harmonious music yields.
I lent a listening ear
unto their music rare:
At last mine eye did glance
upon a Damsel fair.
I stepped me close aside,
under a Hawthorne bryer:
Her passions laid her down,
o're-rul'd with fond desire.
Alack fond Maid she cride,
and strai^ht she fell a weeping,
Why suffer^st thou thy heart,
within a false ones keeping?
Wherefore is Venus Queen,
whom Maids adore in mind,
Obdurate to our prayers,
or like her fond^ing blind:
When we do spend our loves,
whose fond expense is vain?
For men are grown so false,
they cannot love again.
The Queen of Love does know,
best how the matter stands,
And Hymen knows* I long
to come within her bands.
My Love best knows m^ (...)*
and love repaies with hate:
Was eue^ Uirgins love,
so much unfortunate?
Did my love fickle prove,
then had he cause to (...):
But I Will be judged by (...),
I loved him constant^y.
I hearing of her bowe^,
set bashfulnesse a part
And strived with all my skill,
to cheer this Maidens heart.
I did instruct her love,
where love might be rep^^d:
Could I, quoth the (...) love,
I were an happy Maid.
I straight in love replide.
In me thou love shall find:
So made the bargain sore,
and eased the Maidens mind.
FINIS*
