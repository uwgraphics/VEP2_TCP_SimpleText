portrait of John of Ley, merchant tailor and elected King of Munster, styled
New Jerusalem, with hat and crown, chain of office, scepter and crossed swords

There has been hitherto many and manyfolde letters and writings / of the
wonderful deades / and intencyons of the rebaptisers / of Munster in westuaell
haeth been written of many great assautes and batailes / the which haeth been
done of boeth parts as well from without the cite as from within. So is now
the most shorteste concluded all things how it is and haeth been because not
to be grievous unto the Reader / and in especial how all their deades and
intencions after the cite was taken is ended.

HOw be it that it is well known unto all people and manifest that the
rebaptisers of Mu^ster in westuaell haeth chosen among them a king whose name
was Ihon of Ley a teylloure etc. the which they have crowned with a costly
crown of gold / and straight fourth have taeken him for their rueler and
worldly lord and have knowledged him for a king of the hoole world and so
have taken him / and has also in all things been willinge obediente and
obeissante unto him / for they have delyured hi^ al their money and goods / and
when they had now a long season continued a wonderful Rule of the which there
was never none such seen / nor hard / and have fortified and maede strong
the cite of Munster in such manner / that unto the^ another with gonne shot
nor assaute in no manner of means might no hurt be done unto them / for many
lords and other men of war haeth proved it

When now the people the which that lay before the cite did daeyly abide and
suffer great skaethe and loss / and the lords and ruelers considered that no
schaethe nor hurt might be done unto them of Munster sauinge oonly by
famyshinge / agreed the bishop of Munster with the lords kapteins and men of
arms and maede before the cite very ney seven bolwarkes / the which ware well
kept twelf monthe and moore with men of war and soogers and did so great
skathe and horte unto them of Munster / that they might get no provision nor
vittaels be no means in to the cite / nor noone from without the cite cowde nor
might succor nor help them the which is now well manifest and known unto all
people.

When now they cowde nor might have of no body help nor comfort of vitayles
or norishment for the body / and that daily a great substance of vitayles was
spent and eaten by the multitude of people / and the time ran fast on from day
to day / that the common people had eaten and spent their vitayles of meat
and drink / In so much that thear was no moore man's food within the cite
sauinge oonly in the kings place or pallaeis.

Now had they in the cite in all void places open the walls and about the^
where was any void room sowed most with peasen and Raepes whereby the comen
people louede a great while unto the time that they had eaten and spente the
straw of the peason and the greane of the Raepes / and that all was eaten op
that was in the cite saeuinge oonly three horse / and there was none other man's
food in the cite / then horse and oxen heads / the which they took and cotte
them small and did syethe them with water whyls they ware tender / and did
then eat them for to sustain their life there with all / For they ware daily
conforted through their head rueler caled kneppetelling that thear should come
provision in the cite / and when that thear was none other comfort among the
commen people but to dye for hongre / they desired to depart out of the cite /
the^ was the tromme stricken about the cite / that whosoever desired to depart
out of the cite / and that would tarry no longer there in / they should come to
the king and he should give them a token that they should be let owte.

And straight forth gathered thear togider a great multitude of women young
maidens and childerne / the which came before the king and desyerd to depart
out of the cite / and then caused the king the to be searched and to taeke
away from them all that they had and left none of them moore than oone
rayme^t and said to them now go your ways to the heretics. And when they
ware out before the gates without the cite between the cast walls and the
tre^sches opo^ a large place there were they feign to abide / for they that lay
upon the bolwarkes let none pass through the trensches / and there most they
eat leaves and grass unto the time that it was commanded them to depart out
of the contre and thear was many of them found dead the which had dyed for
very honger. But all the sougars or men's persons that came out of the cite were
al killed and set upon carte whiles about the cite / for the hegges and the
trensches ware so hey and so strong that it was not possible to escape.

Ite^ two and fyfty sowgers that lay in the cite of Munster when they saw that
the honger was so great and was but small provision they agreed together and
with a commen agreement to depart out of the cete toward the winge of saint
Mauricius and desyrede to come unto the bischope him self / and when they had
showede their minds unto the sowgars that ley upon the bolwarckes and
trensches / and desired to help them over the hedges and trensches / then
haethe the sowgars of the Bischop Reached them their haelbards and have draewne
them so over the hedges and tre^sches like as they had promesed them and that
they should help them to the bischop / and when that they ware now helped over
the hedges and tre^sches / the^ did the sowgers of the bischope see that the^
they that ware com out of the cete ware all cloothede with dubbelettes of
silcke and veluette and some of them had on clothe of gold like as they had
taeken yt out of the churches / when they ware now all within the trensches
then was thear noone oether counsel but drew out their swords and killede
the^ all / the^ was theare oone the which came Runnynghe behind and was no
yette over / and when he came ney unto the hedge and trensches and hard how
they delte with his fellows / not withsta^dinghe he Ra^ne to the hegde and
boore half a haggebosche the which fyred him self / and when he came ney to
the hedge / oone offerede him his haelbarde to help him over as the oether his
fellows had been helped over butte he proferede him his gonne and shot him
that he tomblede and ran back agaeyne into the cete / and then was the king
in his haele with his duekes the which he had maede butte a little before /
with his gaerde and pete captains and oether that had daeyle their lyuinge out
of his cowrte / and cast among them that they had no longar vittaelles butt
for tow months Deuysinghe and cownselinge the oone the oether / how that they
might ghitte help and vittaelles. Then was theare oone among them all the
which was calede hans of the long streate a watch maester and oone of the
ruelers that the king set much be and gave him great credit / the which
had been a long season before with the bischope oone of the maesters of the
trensches / and was goone from thence in the cete to the rebaptisers / and this
hans was very good teller of his taele and a great taellaer in commenycatio^
and onder toeke and boostede him self in the presense of the king and the^
that had charge of the ruele of the cete / that as far forth as he could or
might have charge of the king he knew the means for to ghitte prouysio^ of
vittaeills within fowretene daeys and to bring in by that time three hu^derde
me^ of war or sowgers in to the cete where with the king and his cownsell
ware well co^tente and pleasede / and poynted a daey when this should be to
onderstande opon midsommer night / and then was ha^ske^ of the long streate
as at that time a watch maester i^ the cete / and had been of the oether side
withowte the cete a maester of the tre^sches. In somuche that he knew boothe
the ma^nar without the cete and within the cete and had veuede boothe by daey
and by night te circuyte and the bolwarckes and the diches abowte the town
wheare they ware deapeste or shall loweste wheare they ware broodeste or
narroweste / and wheare the cete was stro^geste / and feebeleste. In somuche
that he knew all things / and as soene as he was let out of the cete knew
he straight the right waey thorrowe the hedge and over the tre^sches of his
aduersaris the which he must pass / and so went four leegs from Mu^ster in
a little town caled ham / and belo^ghethe unto te duke of cleeue And straight
fourth he sent for oone the which was naemede my lord of the dame and had
his dwellinge theare / and had been oone of the heads of Frysla^de / unto the
which he saeide that he knew well that he was in great indingnacyo^ with the
reuere^de bischop of mu^ster / for beacawse that he had lefste the la^tsknechts
sowgers unto the Bischope and was goone into the cete / and he onder toeke as
far forth as the bischop would pardon him and give him free gooinghe and
coming he would give his reverence a mattar to knoelege wheare as land and
people laey on and as soene as my lord of the dame had hard such nyews he
haethe not taryede long. Butte haethe given the bischope knoelege thear of
and then haethe the bischope given him free goeynge and co^minghe / and haethe
poyntede him a plaece wheare he should come to him / and so is the bischope and
his cownsell sown determinede and be co^ unto ha^ske^ of the brood streate
opo^ the plaece apoyntede togedder / and have desyrede to hear the mattar /
and the^ haethe ha^sken saeide unto the bischop and unto his cownsell that he
would show the^ the matter and as far fowrthe as the mattar went forward
then dorste he never in his live daeys come among no lantsknechts nor sowgers
/ and as far forth as the Bischope would the^ keape him all his life daeis
or give him as much as he might mantene him self opon dueringhe his life /
that then he would deleuer unto the bischop opo^ midso^mer night at ten of the
clock the cete of mu^ster drey foetede / wheare opon the bischope and his
counselers haethe taeken and holden a short cownsell / and be soune agreede in
the mattar / and as far forth as the mattar came to affecte then would the
heads with all oether ruelers by in the forward / whear opon the bischope
haethe kept a commons opon every bolwarcke / and given also knoelege of the
mattar unto every man / how they ware myndede for at such an owre should the
cete be openede how they ware myndede theare to / and whether that they would
auonture yt / for all noble men lords gentell men and they that have charge of
oether shall and will be of the furst / and theare with was the comme^te very
well content / and cried all with one voice Ie / Ie / Ie / we have layne long
enough in the straw we will also sleep oones upon beds / and so haeth the
byshope conte^ded according to his promise unto hansken of the long streate
after his own desire and Request as had been devised. And so are concluded in
oone and have appointed together that they should be opon the set owre reddy
and come before the cross gaete / and then would he give them a token and when
they should see the same / that they might then come hardely for all things
should be clear the^ After that went hansken of the long streate into the
cite again / and made the king beleaue that he had brought all things well
to pass and that at the owre that he had appointed should come in three hundred
sowgers with prouysion and vitailes. Then was the king and all that were
about him very glad and yoifull and maede the one the other good chyere /
And now when the appointment was made fowrtene days a fore midsomer night /
have the folk of the bishop prepared in the mean season all things necessary
there to like as skaelles and ladders and other hooks / and be come at the
owre appointed before the gate and then did hansken of the long streate give
them a token that al things were clear / then have they set forth / for
hansken of the long streate had been the eaueninge before with the watch that
watched that night upon the rondel of the tower / and said unto the^ for he was
a watschemaster / this night shall many folks and provision come into the cite
sleep hardely / and be of good chiere and be still and take no hyde unto the
people that come in / and as now the folk of the bishope thronge on soore then
came to the ditches of the cite ney unto a litel gate the which was shut and
locked and theare they most neades over the diche / for there was no place
about the cite where the diche was narrower then theare as ha^sken had told
them before / and there they cast their ladders over the diche and maede a
brigge unto the wall of the cite and when now many of them were over the diche
went they forth till they came to the tower of the ro^del the which is caled the
cross gaete / and thear cast they their ladders the which were a man's le^ghte
to short so that they could do nothing there / from thence cast they their
Ladders opon the bolwarke of the rowndel and when some of the^ were upon the
bolwarke they drew the oother op with their halbardes that they ware thirte
strong. Then went they unto the preuy watsche where as every night watsched
two / and eight upon the tower of the rondell unto the which hansken of the
long streate had been before / the first watcher that met with them they
axed what the watsche word was / then spoke the watsche man and said earth /
and straight with all was thear oone with a two handed sword and hew him in
two pieces / for the watsche word of them of Munster within the cite was earth
/ and of the^ that were without the cite their watsche word was Mary the
mother of God / and they had for their feelde token / a straw wische upon
their arms. And then leaped forth the other watschman and axed them what the
watsche word was and the folk of the bishope answered in like wise earth and
theare with was he conte^te / and the^ went two or three of them foerth like as
watschers and when they were passed killed they the oether lykwyse. After that
went they straight foerth to the other watschers of the tower and axed them
lykwyse the watsche word / and they said also earth them they killed lykwyse
/ and then knew they the watsche word well / and had taeken in the tower of
the rowndell with all the gaetes and bolwarckes so that they cowde not well be
let nor greaued. Then went they backwarde again to the bolwarcke / wheare
as they would have fastened their ladders that ware a man's lenghte to short /
but reached the other their halbardes and so drew op the oether upon the wael
of the cite till they ware two honderd and fyfty strong / and then preased they
that ware out of the cite so sore that the brigge the which they had maede over
the diche brake. But when they see that they ware two honderd and fifte strong
within the cite / then went they in the dead of the night and said / now on
gentil brethren follow us and mente that they that ware yet out of the cite /
should have followed them / and went forth and found the gates of the cite
standinge open / and so went foerth still whils they came to the markette place
/ and then began the day to apere and al their trommes did strike and they
cried all alerm alerm / and spread abroode seven banners / and then was the
king and the citesens first aware that their ennemis ware before and in the
cite / and by and by had they also gathered them together / and bette their
ennemis with strong hand from the market place back again unto the gaete
where as they ware come in at / in the mean season had one of the citesens
locked the gaetes that they could not out again. Then cried the king
gentill and dear lantsknechtes lay your weapens from you and go again out at
the gates / you shall have no harm done unto you / and straight withal Ran
the women upon the waelles and cried to the sowgars that they should fetch
their banners and there head again / for that kared nothing the folk of the
byshope but struck upon the gaetes with hamers and with axes / and as soon as
they had gotten the gaetes open / ran they straight to the tower of the
Rondell / and put forth their bannar out at the tower toward the bolwarckes
from without the cete now ware the oether that might not come ouerthediche
because the brigge braeke Ran back again to their bolwarckes / for because
of the great shuetinge and assault that they hard / in the cete and also
they went that all their fellows had been slaeyne / But when they sae the
bannar opon the waell then concyderede they well that their compae^gions waere
yett alive. Then Ran they all to gedder in the cete and bette the king with
all his rebaptisers again from the markete plaece till unto cathedral court
/ and thear they put the^ self again in defense / and ware driven again
from thence till unto saeinct Michells chapel opon the which they did
great hortte with shuetinghe / wheare thorrowe the bischopes folk sufferede
great skaethe and gave back becawse of the great gonne shot behind the
cathedral church / and so laey they opon saeinct Michells chapel whilles
ten of the clock before noene / and in the mean season was the king taeken
the which was given back opon saeinct Gillia^s gaete the which was the
most strongheste gaete of all the cete. After that they desyrede to keape
speech with the oppermoste captain / the which was graented them.

And was so much done a boothe sides that every oone should goo hoome unto the
coming of their most redoutede lord and bischope / then should theare
moore be spoken of the which was graentede and promesede unto them and opon
that went every oone in to his house / and when now the lantsknechts that had
leyn under the bischopes Bannar had sustaynede great loss and skaethe and the
most vallianste and extymede gentill men and dubbell sowgers that ware slain
to the nombre of a honderde and fyste / Ra^ne they with and angrey mind in to
the howses and when are they fownde any them drew they be thy hear upon the
streate / and hewed them to pieces and so killed them. Schortely after was the
trome stricken about that they should kill no moo. Butte wheare any ware found
them should they bring to the oppermoste Ruelar / and when they ware brought
thedder then was their head stricken from their body / four daeys after
causede the captain to be stricken abowte with the trombe / that all weemen
young and old should comme to the do^me which is the cathedral cherche and
when they ware all thear and gaddered to gedder / was it commanded them that
they should by and by void the cete. And so they voyded all young and old to
a great number / opon the fealde and that lastede to the third daey. Butte
whoo that cowde agree with the lord for his wife or daughter or set seurte
for the^ they ware sufferede to come in again / and when they had been about
eight daeis in the cete agaeyne they saeyde that they would abide by their
oolde sect / and then was the trome stricke^ about agaeyne that all the weme^
that ware come in to the cete again should come in the moerninge At nine of
the clock to the plaece of the cathedral church.

Then was given unto them a co^mandmente of a nyew that they should by and by
void the contre ionge and oelde and whoo so ever housede or logede the^ should
be in treatede as tho he ware a Rebaptiser him self he or she and if theare
ware any sowger that had any such woman in his company / he most be son
set put her awaey feo^ him / or he hi^ self should suffer such
ponuyshme^te of his bode as she should. Shortley after ware letters set upon
all church doors all gaetes of litell tounes and villaeges that ley about
Mu^ster that no bode should another house nor loge no such folks for they that
should be fownde so doeynghe they should be ponnisshed as a Rebaptiser / so kan
noman tell wheare that people is become. Item after that Iohu^ of ley a
taellior and king of the Rebaptisers of Mu^ster / the which of all the
rebaptisers was choosen a king of nyewe Iherusale^ and of all the universal
world Is first after that the cete was all gotten taeke^ presonner / and the^
ware causede to be maede tow Ieron colors with long linckes of Ieron opon
them / oone for the king and oone for his felloue knep pertellinge / the
which ware stricken about their necks / and fast reuetede three daeys after
that they ware taeken presonners / and ware so had between tow men of arms
like beasts / three leaghes of Munster in a little town caled Rybergh / and
after that that the armey braeke op at Munster / they ware brought unto a
castle caled dulem also three leaghs from thence and thear passede many sowgars
for by when they braeke op at Munster / and than was the king and his fellow
kneppertellinge set a fore the gaete of the castle because that the sowgars
should yet oons moore se them in the passinge for be the castle.

And the Bischope of mu^ster came unto the castle first unto the king and
unto his lyftennante kneppertrllinge / and as soene as the Bischope saewe te
king / spaeke hy to the king and saeide O you wretsches hoe piteously have
you distroyede my and my pouer subgests. Tha^ a^werde the ki^ge spytfully and
skoornfully add saeide thou preeste I have notte distroyede the. I have
deleuerede the a strong cete the which is agaeinste all assaults and
opru^niges And I have maede you pour I will maeke you rich again as far
fourth as you will follow me cownlel. Then axede the Bischope him hoche cede
maeke him rich / then saeide he to the bischope / I know well that you will
put me to a shaemefull death. That he should cause to be maede for him and
for his lyfeten na^te kneppertellinge a kaege of Ieron keuerede over with
ledder and set the^ boothe thearin / and cause the^ be carriede thorrone all
contres / and who sever desyrede to see the^ that they should give a stuyuer
the which is tow pence flemische / they should ghite moore mo^ne than the
bischope had laeide owte and then the hoole bischope Rick was worth / and so
is the bischope depaerted from them

Item when te bischope had now the cete again and all the rebaptisers boothe
men and women ware goone some slaeyne and some voeydede the contre and dreuen
awaey / and the lords and the sowgars ware agreede for the depaertinghe of the
bowte so that the sowo^ars should have the oone half and the lord the
oether. The^ was theare stricken about with the trome that noone of the
sowgars should keape as much as the vallewe of half a gold ghildren and who
that ware found the contrary should be ponnyschede of body and goods / and
thear to ware.xxi. partinghe maesters ordenede of every bannar three that should
sell the good and maeke yt to monne / then mente the men of arms a horsbacke
to have their paerte alsoo / the which the sowgars would not co^sente in no
wise wheare of they ware long at strife and debaete / and when the paerte
maesters should now depart the bowte and had not so much monne as the
sowgars had countede / then toeke they the paerte maesters every oone and
put the^ in the mids of a ringe of the^ all as the maunar of them is / and
demaended and axede of them wheare the monne and goods ware become / and when
the paerte maestres would not show the^ according he unto their mind / caused
they the hangman to come in the mids of the ringe among them / the which
drew tow of the part maesters opo^ a laddar a fore all the common sowgars and
yette would not they beknowen and this lastede whills after noene / and then
did the lords set owte the maetter till the next daey and in the mooringe
ware all the part maesters goone / and then came the hagman in the ringe and
saeide that it was forbidden him be the lords that he should axe no moore
rigorosly / co^cyderede that he had rackede the daey before and that they had
not confessede. Then sent they by and by of every bannar tow sowgars / and the
hangman with them to the king and kausede him also to be axede with tourmentes
what he knew of the bowte and when the hangman had tourmentede him threyse
knoelegede he of a barrel of gold and oether yewells and and golden ringes /
te which all was not so much worth as the sowgars would feign have had.

In conclusion then was the bowte depaertede among them so that every sowgar
had no moore but eghtene eemde ghildeius of four shillings flemmische the
piece. Then faeide the head me^ of the sowgars they knew a good remedy for as
soene as they came owte of the gaetes they knew wheare to have mo^ne and a
noether lord / and so went the sowgars awaey now ten now twente / and went
so awaey that theare aboode butte five honderde sowgars in the cete / the
which the bischope held to keape the cete / and who that ought oone anoether
they gaeue each oether noothinge

Item whoo that had letten him to be Rebaptisede in Munster and given his
goods to the king that was perfection in their law / and him did the king
hang a tooken abowte his neck maede of copper with three letters thearin
A.d.w.f the which betookene the so much the word is become flesche. Ite^
before the king of mu^ster was borne the ma^nar of a ronude boule with a
golden cross theare opon / and before that tow swords and that betookenede as
much with the^ as a ki^ge of the hoole universal world his cloothinge and
lifrey was broune and greane partede in four quarters / and upon the right
arm had he in mannar of an appell with a cross and tow swords thutroe yt and
theare with had he cloethede all his gaerde and household servants. And when
common people in the cete of Munster had not had no bread in three weckes / is
theare nevertheless fownde after that the cete was gotten in the kings court
seven to^ne of wine and oone tonne of bier and oone tonne of flesche and a
tonne of meele / and they ware well in the cete of Munster fyftene honderde men
stronghe and when the cete was won they ware not paste a thousand and are of
boothe sides be the war that was before the cete and within slaeyne nigh opon
eght thousand I beseech Ihesu heaven king to send us hence fourth unite and
peace Amen.
