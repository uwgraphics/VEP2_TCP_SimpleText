THE PREFACE, To the Right Honorable, right Worshipful, whether more or less
dignified, who have been or hereafter may be my Patients, as also to the
courteous or discourteous Reader.
YOur Honor, Worship, or other Worthiness whatsoever (good Reader) has often
heard it spoken from the mouth of many a well-read and experienced man in
Physic, That (Urina est meretrix, vel mendax) the Urine is an Harlot, or a
Lier; and that there is no certain knowledge of any Disease to be gathered
from the Urine alone, nor any safe judgment to be exhibited by the same: You
have been (likewise) often told, by Physicians, that it were far better for
the Physician to see his Patient once than to view (...) (who tell you so) to
entertain the Urine as the only Index and discoverer of Diseases to prono^^^^
their opinion of the (...) Disease by it, and to accept of being accounted
skillful (...) learned Physicians (...) written dive^s Tracts therein (...)
dangers of taking Physic (...) sight of the (...) dispossess men of that fond
opinion, of a Physicians discerning diseases by it, wherewith they have been so
long time deluded. To this purpose has Dr Cotta written a Book (called, A
short discovery of the unobserved dangers of several sorts of ignorant and
(inconsiderate practisers of Physic in England) wherein, amongst other Tracts
of the (...) abusers of Physic, he has written one Tractate of the
Conjectours by Vrines: therein showing the falsehood, and (...) judgment of
Diseases by the Urine. He has also therein set down the ingenuous confession
of a dying Physician (made to him being then present with him some three or
four days before his departure) (...), who, being requested to commend unto
(...) that skill by which he had been so (...) admired and esteemed, for
judging (...) to be with child by their Urine, made this ans^er. I have (says
he) long with the felicity of a good opinion exercised it, and with tried
certainty know it to be uncertainty, and certain deceit: It is therefore
unworthy posterity, and the name of Art. Read the Tract above mentioned, and
you shall see this confession further amplified. If you please to take my
confession too, you shall have it: I for mine own part have been so fortunate
herein, that I have seldom failed an my predictions of determining a woman to
be with child by the Urine, as I have made them believe, when the messenger
has been able to certify me of the state of the Woman's body, and could answer
me to certain other questions touching other signs of conception. Above all
the rest, I was once magnified by a Counselors wife for this cunning cozenage
(I am not ashamed to term it so) at a festival meeting at Canterbury, in the
presence of two (as I take it) other Doctors of Physic: She told them to
their faces that I was the cunningst Doctor in all the Town, for I had told
her by her water that she was with child, and just how long it was since she
conceived of it* But had the woman showed me (that brought it) no more than the
Urine did, I should scarce have adventured to have pronounced her to have been
with child: Yet I might (knowing the Gentlewoman, how long it was since she
had a child, and the distance that she commonly kept in childbearing, as also
that she nursed her children her self) have pronounced her, and that upon some
probable conjecture, to have been with child, though the messenger could not
have answered me to such interrogatives (as we use to demand of them before we
pronounce a woman to be with child) nor the Urine show (as it does not) any
thing concerning conception at all. I dare say, that the good Gentlewoman is
very confident that I determined her to be with child by the sight of her
Urine only, because I did not intimate any thing to the contrary: Neither is
she to be so much blamed for her credulity, as I for my juggling. But to make
her and other good women amends (whom I have thus beguiled) I have in this
ensuing Tract set down the fallacies, by which I judged her, and every other
Physician does judge every other woman to be with child; as also, by which we
give judgment of the Disease, Sex, and the like, seeming to do it only by
the Urine: which have not heretofore been published (though too much practiced
of most) by any man in the English tongue. Doctor Heart (in his Book entitled
The Anatomy of Urines) has by sufficient argument and demonstration, confuted
the Pisse-Canons, or Conjectures of Vrines, taken from the several accidents
of the same (as the several colors, parts, contents, substance, quantity,
smell) and showed their falsehood in all these, and the many absurdities that
have been committed by pretending knowledge of Diseases by all these; I thought
it likewise fit to set down the fallacies; by which judgment of Diseases is
given by the Urine, to the end that the writings of other men (who have written
against this base custom of Water-prophesying) may gain the more credit, and
for the further satisfaction of such as yet remain doubtful whether there be
any judgment to be taken from the Urine sufficient to determine the disease. To
this end therefore I have set down the fallacies which have upheld this
custom of prating, and predicating strange things by the Urine: And I have
penned them in the English tongue, because that mere Englishmen (I mean the
common people) who understand English only, are and ever have been most subject
to be deceived (...) deluded. I hope therefore that no Artist will be offended
hereat, for I dare say that there is no ingenuous man, but is of mine opinion,
and would as gladly (as I my self) that this base custom, of Lecturing upon
the Urine, were overthrown and abrogated. What I have therefore done to this
purpose, I entreat the courteous Reader to accept in as good part, as I have
been willing to impart the same: And for as much as I have been guilty of this
fraud, though I have not long used it, let it suffice that it repents me of
the same, for I mean never hereafter to show my cunning, or rather cozening,
upon the water, and hope that other men will help to beat down this custom,
or else all that I have written will be to little purpose. However it will some
thing delight the understanding and impartial Reader, and might profit the
ignorant, if they ^ould make use of it to that end for which it (...) penned.
As for the style, and method of (...) it is poor and mean; but such as best
(...) with such a poor, base, and stinking (...) I have been enforced a little
beyond my (...) nature, and disposition, to be somewhat (...) in lecturing
upon the Urine, for which cause I may incur censure of the graver and more
modest people: If I have herein offended, I crave their pardon, for I could not
well avoid it: And let them not tax me of levity, or lasciviousness, for my
life and conversation has, and shall for ever testify the contrary. Howbeit I
can claim no privilege from backbiters, nor immunity from malignant tongues;
I refuse to be tried by a prejudicate opinion, or the malignant spirit of
contradiction; and appeal unto the learned, judicious, and impartial Reader,
to whom (if I have erred) for it is Humanum errare) I submit for censure; if
need be, for correction. And for as much as (I fear) that the greatest
detractours that I shall find (though it be an old saying that the Arts,
Nullum habent inimicum praeter ignorantem, have no enemy but the ignorant man)
are offenders in this kind; I admonish you (brother Pisse-Prophet) that you be
not too busy in playing the Critic upon me, because I have (in confessing
mine own folly) reproved your wickedness, which you will hardly forsake. As
for the censure of the ignorant (whom you help to retain in this prejudicate
opinion) I regard it not. Hos oblatrantes caniculos cum contemptu, (...) I psse
by these barking Curres (as the lion does) with (...) But if you (...)(whose
galled back i have rubbed, and whose sore I have lanced) who are conscious to
your self of your own guiltiness herein, I shall rub harder and lance
deeper: and yet (if you kick overmuch) I shall find a Lash to quiet you. I
pray therefore let me have your good word, lest you need mine. And so in hope
that the learned, judicious, and impartial Reader will pardon my errors, and
that the ignorant Reader will become wiser, and that the delinquent Reader will
become honester, I rest*

Yours, T. B.

The Pisse-prophet.
CHAP. I.
Wherein is showed the error of the common people (who think that Diseases
are to be discerned by the Urine) and the fallacies of the Physician, who
intimate the same unto them: As also, what is to be considered of the Physician
before he pronounce his judgment of an Urine.

THE vulgar sort are so strongly prepossest (by reason of their ignorance) that
Physicians can discern (by the Urine) the Disease, the conception, the sex,
the parties age, with many other such absurdities, that I fear it will be an
hard matter to dispossess them of that opinion. And Physicians (the more too
blame they) have intimated and pretended this knowledge unto them so far, as
that they will hardly acknowledge their errors, and relinquish this basery:
But when it shall appear that the Urine is altogether (...) shall be showed
and set forth by me in this ensuing Discourse: Let the ignorant choose whether
he will believe his lying oracle or no, and let the Physician choose whether
he will be honester than to use such deceit. Yet (I hope) the one will blush
to have been so deluded, and the other to have his conjecturing discovered. And
now me thinks you long to hear how it is (the Urine giving no certain
knowledge of any Disease in the world) that Piss mongers (for they deserve not
the name of a Physician that pretend knowledge of Diseases by it) do give
judgment of it, and make thee believe that they discern Diseases by it, than
the which nothing in the world is more false. But would you so feign know how
this can be? Why thus it is, for I will now hold you no longer in expectation;
I must therefore give unto your special consideration two things, (and then I
will descend to all the particular Quillets and fallacies that deceive the
ignorant) used in the contemplation and beholding of an Urine, which make a man
presume to give judgment of Diseases by it. Observe now with me, that the two
things to be considered are these; namely, that Diseases are either acute, The
differences of diseases.
sharp, and violent, as the Plurisie, Peripneumonia (which is the
Apostumation, and inflammation of the Lungs) the Phrenzie, Iliaca Passio, the
small Pox, Pestilence, and every sharp Fever: Or else diseases: they are (...):
(that is of continuance) (...) such as proceed from the ill temperature of the
humors and disposition of the constitution of the body, such as are the
Consumption, Dropsy, Melancholy. (...) Palsy. Falling Sickness, Chachexia
(which is a depravation of the humors of the body, where by it takes away, in
man or woman, the appear from meat makes the body unfit for exercise, and
marres the liveliness of the spirit and countenance) and this disease in women
is commonly called the Green Sickness, and it makes both men and women Green
indeed. But (to omit all circumstances that may be) the Physician always
bears these two considerations in m^^de. namely, that diseases are either
Acute, Sharp, and Violent, or Chronicall, and of continuance, and more gentle,
as aforesaid, etc. Now, for the most part, the common sort of people come (...)
send their Waters unto Physicians for Acute, Sharp, and Violent diseases: as
the Countryman or Handycrafts-man (who use to labor) for some Surfeit (as
they call it) taken by carching cold (as they think) after sweating at their
several labors, and your better sort of people (as they think themselves,
because they use no labor) for a Surfeit taken by idleness, as sitting in the
Sun, walking, sporting, drinking of Wine, eating over much or such meat as
their stomach has not well digested, and the like. The nature of a sharp
disease.
You must likewise note, that every sharp disease has an hot and burning
Fever joined with it, and that the Urine (for the most part) in a burning Fever
is of an intense high red color; and this color; amongst all the other
uncertain signs of Urine (which seem to show a disease, to put a difference
between sharp and Chronicall diseases, and to discover a Fever only) is the
most certain of all other, and yet uncertain in it self. Such a Urine being
brought unto a Physician to cast (as they call it) and being of a red high
color (as I said before) he presently conceives it to be a sharp and violent
disease, How the Physician judges of such diseases by the Urine*
and then knows for certain, that there is a Fever joined with it; so he is
now quickly prepared to give his judgment of it, and needs now to do no more,
but to give a description of a Fever, to make the messenger believe that he
perceives the disease in the Water; but yet he comes to the true knowledge of
the disease, by some such par^y and expostulation had with the messenger, as
shows the symptoms and affects of the sick party (though he seem to have
named them in the description of the disease to the messenger) which truly
determine the disease: and then he names the disease, looking upon the Water
(as if it were there to be found) in such manner as shall be hereafter showed;
which makes the messenger to believe so indeed. Now the description of a Fever
(and indeed one description will serve for any Fever, and for all sharp and
violent diseases) is but to reckon up the Symptoms and signs of a Fever (the
which we know before that ever we look upon the Water) which are these:
namely; great oppression of the stomach by choler, or some other humor, which
causes want of appetite to meat: Signs of a sharp disease.
oppi^ation and obstruction of the liver and spleen, causing great heat (which
causes great drought, and much desire of drink) causing great pain in the
head and back, which likewise causes want of sleep and rest, from whence
proceeds (oftentimes) raving, frantic doting senseless and idle talk. Now
to say that the sick party is this affected (for indeed so they are for the
most part in every respect, but at the least in some kind, in every violent
disease) makes the messenger to think, that the Doctor does perceive (that
the party is so affected) by the Urine which (by Yea and by Nay) is no such
matter: for he dares not always trust to this high red Urine, That a high and
red colored Urine is not always one in^allible sign of a Fever.
as an insallible sign of a Fever; for it may chance to be of such a color by
some other accident, when the party that made it, is free from a Fever. But
admit that the high red color of the Urine did always (as it does for the most
part) import a Fever, yet the Symptoms and companions of a Fever (as heat,
drought, thirst, pain in the head, want of sleep, oppression of stomach, want
of appetite, oppilation of the liver and spleen, or any one of these) are not
therein to be seen, though it please his worship to play the Anticke with the
Water, pretending that there are such marks in it, as show all these things
that I have named. Neither does he presume to name these Symptoms (as heat,
drought, thirst, etc.) from any signs thereof in the Urine, but for that he
knows by daily experience, that the forenamed Symptoms and companions of a
Fever (as heat, drought, thirst, etc.) are necessary consequences, and
inseparable concomitants of a Fever: And yet (oh the pride of man, in seeming
to be what he is not!) the Pisse-Prophet does pretend, that he perceives all
these things in the Water. These things being premised, I hope thou will be the
better able to judge of that which follows, and perceive how easy a thing it
is to give judgment of diseases by the Urine (though it be not there to be
seen) and wilt conceive the fallacies that uphold this custom, and so learn
to put a difference between an honest learned plaine-dealing Physician and a
prating Empirick, and a Rogue. I will now (for this once) imagine my self to
be one of them and, to be in my Chamber or Study ready addressed to come forth,
to give my judgment upon that high red Water (that imports a Fever, and so a
violent disease) that I last spoke of, and will plainly show you (by the
examination of three such several Urines, brought by three several
messengers) in three several Chapters, how to give judgment of all acute,
sharp, and violent diseases, by the last description of the Symptoms of a
burning Fever.

CHAP. II.
What manner of persons your Pisse-messengers are, how they are handled,
deluded, and made to show how the sick party is affected, and yet to believe
that the Doctor perceives the Disease by the Urine.

I Have here already such a Messenger (attending my leisure to give my
judgment upon such a Urine) who, being conducted to my presence, salues my
worship with good morrow Master Doctor, and indeed the morning is the most
usual and fit time for the viewing of Urines: The Queen at Darkin has gotten
that Art, that she would not prophecy thereof after eleven of the clock: And
having thus saluted me, presents me the Urine, saying, Sir I desire your
opinion of this water, and to tell me (though the sick party know that too too
well already) what the party ayleth, and what the Disease is; the messenger
(whether man or woman) you must note, is one who is, as it were, made out of
wax, whom a Physician cannot deceive (neither would he if he could) nor yet
learn any thing out of him touching the Disease, unless he himself first
have named it, and yet he will make a shift to mould him into any form^ that
shall fit his purpose best, and make him by impertinent questions (as he shall
think) to tell him any thing, concerning the sick party, that he shall
desire to know, and yet (like Hocus Pocus who makes his ignorant spectatours to
think that the Balls are under the Cups, though he have conveyed them away by sleight of hand, and when they see that, to deem him a Conjurer) to think
that he has discovered nothing, and me to be a skillful Physician and an
honest man, when as indeed there is no such matter; for neither is Hocus Pocus
a Conjurer, though by his nimble conveyance he have deluded his silly beholder,
or so much a knave as they think him, because he has not done it by any
unlawful assistance; neither am I so skillful a Physician, though I have made
the messenger believe that I perceive strange things by the Water, because I
do but deceive the messenger; nor so honest a man as I am esteemed, though I
carry the matter very fair, because I do not ingenuously confess to the
messenger, and so to every body else when I shall have occasion to discourse
about it, that there is no certain judgment of any disease by the Urine, but
out of pride pretend knowledge of diseases by it, and to back this knowledge
blush not to use such deceit and fallacies as hereafter follow. But now to
return to the Urine from the Physician and the fool, The manner of the
proceeding of Vrine-gasers.
the Messenger: This Urine, if brought out of the Country, is for the most
part in a glasse-bottle, but (if ones in the City) it is brought in an
Urinall; it is likewise red and high of color, and that (for the most part) be
tokeneth a Fever. I now therefore (before that ever I can pour the water out
of the bottle, or take the Urinall out of the Case) rip up all the Symptoms of
a Fever, and say, This party has a great oppression of stomach and no
appetite to meat, a great oppilation and obstruction of the Liver and Spleen,
is very hot and dry, desires much to drink, has a great pain in the head
and can take no rest, and was taken in the manner of an Ague with a grooving in
the back and pain in the head, first cold and then hot, reckning up all these
things (as if I saw them there so soon as ever I look into the water) so fast
as ever I can make my tongue belie my heart. And with this description I have
made the messenger admire my readiness and skill in judging of Urines, and he
verily believes that I have espied these things in the water; but it is far
otherwise; for these things (that I have reckoned up) are but the usual
Symptoms and companions of a Fever, and the most of them are joined with every
Fever, and all of them and many more at once are complicate with many a Fever.
These things being so, I cannot but have hit the nail on the head, for some of
those Symptoms that I have reckoned up, must needs accompany the disease; and
when I have once named them, the messenger presently answers, that the party
is just so affected as I have said: But (as yet) I have not named the disease,
and perhaps omitted something which is expected that I should have named: and
the messenger is as ready then to ask me if I perceive nothing else by the
water, as I was to pronounce my judgment of it before: To whom I answer, yes
if you will give me leave to tell you; and then perchance asks me if I do not
perceive a stitch, and whether the party have not a Plurisie, I answer (looking
upon the water as if it were there to be perceived) yes I well perceive the
stitch, and some cough too; and I say, that when the cough takes the party,
the party is much pained in the side; and for as much as I did not name the
stitch at first, I tell the messenger that we use first to declare the cause of
the disease before we come to every passion or affect of the disease, or before
we name it: I further add that I was not yet come to speak of the stitch (no
nor should never have found it out of the water, had not the messenger bolted
it out) because I had named the cause thereof, namely, the oppression of the
stomach and obstruction of the Spleen, and mesentery, and that the stitch was
nothing else but a flatuous and windy humor proceeding from thence to the
place affected; so now I determine the disease to be (as they suppose) a
Plurisie; And indeed they can better define their own diseases by the
Symptoms and passions that they suffer, than any Physician can do by the
water only. But now as I have been happy in my predictions of the disease, and
rightly determined it to be (as it is indeed) a Plurisie; so now I must proceed
to the prescription (as it is required) of such remedies as may cure this
Plurisie: And now I am here as far to seek (though I know the disease to be
a Plurisie) as if I knew not the disease at all, nor had seen the Urine,
because I do not therein perceive the scope and grounds of prescribing fit
remedies (according to the rules of Art) in every respect proper to the
disease; Indication of curing.
The which scope and grounds are these (namely) the parties age, the sex, the
constitution of the body, and the strength of it at this time, with diverse
other accidents, as whether the party be bound in his body, or have a flux and
scouring, or the like: All the which nor any one of them can be discerned by
the Urine, and yet I must find them there if the messenger refuse to tell me
(but that they seldom refuse to do after that I have given them a description
of the disease, and showed them in some part how the party is affected) or
else I must needs err in my prescription; for if I should prescribe (not
knowing the age of the party) such a quantity of blood to be taken away from
a young youth (suppose ten or twelve ounces) in a Pluresie, which is the
disease in hand, as should be taken from a man in his full strength, the party
might perish thereby; or if I should take but four or five ounces of blood
from a lusty young man (in this disease) at his full strength, I should do him
no good, and so he might perish on the other side: I might likewise err in the
dose, if (not knowing the parties age) I should prescribe more or less than
were proportionable to the parties age in prescribing purging Potions or
Clysters in this case; I might likewise commit no less error if (not knowing
the sex) I should in the forenamed disease prescribe blood-letting to a woman,
her natural courses being broke forth upon her; for I might by that accident
expect a solution of the disease without blood-letting. I might likewise err,
if (knowing the sex) I should prescribe purging Physic for a woman in this
case (not knowing whether she be with child or no) of such a quality as might
cause her to miscarry: I might err concerning the constitution of the body if
I should (not knowing the same) prescribe that for a weakly constitution of
body which were fitter for a robustuous and strong constitution: and so on the
contrary. I might likewise err if I should (not knowing the strength of the
body at this time) prescribe too strong a Potion, or too much blood to be taken
away, when the disease has overcome the strength and the party is too much
debilitated, or if I should prescribe too gentle a potion, or too little blood
to be taken away when the strength is not yet dejected, but stands in equal
contestation with the disease. I could show a thousand ways more how I could
err, and how most Physicians do err that prescribe Physic by the sight of
the Urine only: But my intent is to show how many thousand ways I could
deceive thee and make thee believe that I discern all these things by the
Urine (as thou think I do) namely the disease, the parties age, sex,
strength, constitution of body, and the like: I have therefore digressed herein
from my purpose (since my intent was not to show the errors that are committed
by such as pretend knowledge of diseases by the Urine, but to show the
fallacies and juggling that they use in giving judgment of it) and so frustrated
thy expectation of this dainty Art; but I hope it shall be to thy profit, for
thou shall hereby be the better able to give thy Physician such instructions as
he shall require, and shall perceive the danger of taking Physic prescribed by
the sight of the Urine only: And now to the purpose indeed; but first imagine
with me, that the last messenger, having received good satisfaction by the
description of the parties disease for whom he came, was ready to certify me
of all the forenamed circumstances that were requisite for me to inquire of, as
the parties age, sex, constitution of body, present strength, how long the
party had been sick, etc. And I have sent him away with Medicaments for a
Pleurisy.
such remedies as were most proper for his Pleurisy, directions for
blood-letting to mitigate his Fever, some pectorall Physic to ease his cough,
with a Liniment to mollify, and to dispell wind, to anoint his side withal
for his stitch, and wish him to repair unto me again within a day or two to
certify me of the success of the Physic, and how the party stands now
affected, that if need require, I may supply him with further advise. Now in
all this (I hope) I have not erred, save only that I forgot to tell the
messenger that the party was very dangerously sick, and would hardly recover,
but yet I have prescribed him the best means that can, by the art of man, be
for his recoverie, and I pray God to give his blessing, and so I have quite
dispatched this messenger. And now whether the party live or dye I shall be
sure to be magnified for my skill; if he die, for that my predictions prove
true; and if he live, for that I recovered him of so dangerous a disease. And
now I am ready to encounter with the next messenger, who likewise brings me
another Urine of an high red color, in giving judgment upon which I will
plainly show how a man may give judgment of all other sharp and violent
diseases by the water (though it do not certainly show any Symptoms of any
disease, which determine the same) and how thou shall get out of the messenger
every circumstance necessary to the judging and determining of a disease, as
the age, sex, and strength of the party, and to the guiding of a man in
prescribing of fit remedies, and yet he shall not perceive but that thou
find them in the Urine; Sed hoc est decipere, non judicare; but this is to
juggle, and not to judge.

CHAP. III.
The craftiest messengers must be the more craftily handled: the action and
gesture of the Physician in giving judgment of an Urine: that we come to the
knowledge of the disease, and sex by impertinent questions (as they think)
(...) to the messengers, and not by the Urine: the cunning tricks that
Physicians have to make the messengers confident of their (falsely) pretended
skill; and the flammes that they have to evade censure, if they chance to err
in the pronouncing of their judgment.

SUppose this next messenger to be some Nurse or tender of sick persons, who is
commonly versed, and accustomed in carrying sick folks Urines unto Physicians;
and she salute me, with Master Doctor, I have brought you a Water, and desire
your opinion of it: and now I am like to have a hard task of it, and to be so
put to my trumps, that (if I play not my cards sure) I shall lose the set,
miscarry in my judgment, be accounted a dunce, and lose my patient for ever;
but I will be aware of that, I warrant you. I now therefore take this carfty
wench to do, How crafty messengers may be deceived.
and I will handle her as craftily; I take the Vrinall of her, and bid her come
from the door of my Parlour, Study, or Chamber (where they commonly stand,)
unto the window, or light, where I commonly give my oracle; and indeed, a man
had need of a good light, and a better sight, that shall perceive all these
things that I must find out of this Urine. Being come to the light (as I am
uncafing the Urinall to look upon it,) I ask the Nurse a question, not whose
water it is (for that she is enjoined, any conjured, not to tell me, especially
if it be a woman's, nor any thing else, unless I first find it out of the
water) but my question is; How long the party has been sick; And she out of
modesty and good manners, can do no less but answer me to this question, for
she thinks this question to be but words of course, and that I can gather
nothing from hence touching the parties disease; and so she answers me a
week, a forthnight, two or three days, or more or less. But from hence I
collect and have strong presumptions that it is an acute disease; and if she
say, A forthnight, I shall think it to be only an acute disease and of the
less danger, unless there have another Physician been employed already, the
which I shall be sure to know, and if there have, I shall go near to strike
his nose out of joint, and gain the patient to my self, and then (if I
recover him) I shall get immortal fame; but if he chance to die, I will make a
shift to shuffle off the disgrace upon my brother Doctor, for that (as I will
say) such and such means were not used at the first, though happily he have used
as good a thode as my self could have done: But if she say that the party has
been sick a week, I shall think it is a more acute disease, whether there
have another Physician been employed or no. But if she say three or four
days, I then presume that it is a most sharp disease, and now I will so plant
and interest my self in the party, as that I will prevent another coming
there, unless it be to a person of quality, and then I will be as ready to
desire another Physician to be called, as the sick party shall be to request
it, not so much that I desire his aid, or would have him partake with me in
the booty, as in the disgrace, if the party should chance to die. And now I
know (by this question, as also the Water, being high and red, witnessing the
same) that it is an Acute disease: And now I take the Urinall in my hand, and
hold it up to the light, and (looking very little upon it) I shake it together,
and set it down very artificially in the window asloop, as if I meant to
inquire further of it anon, and that it must stand so a while; and indeed it
must stand so a while, and I must look but lightly upon it at first, or else I
shall not have so good an evasion if I err never so little, nor so fit an
opportunity to propound another question to the setting me forward in the
pronoucing of my opinion, or to the inquiry of some other circumstance
(necessary to the guiding me in prescribing fit remedies) as the parties Age,
Sex, Strength, and the like, for this wench will be sure to hold me to my
text. And now go along with me still, and conceive with me that it is asharp
disease (as appears by her answer) and that I have no sooner asked her how
long the party has been sick, and set down the Urinall in the window (as I
said before) but that I presently say, This party has a great oppression of
Stomach, no appetite to meat, with a great oppilation of the Liver and
Spleen, is very hot, desires much to drink, has a great pain in the head,
and can take no rest, and was taken in the manner of an Ague (as they call it)
with a grooving in the back, and pain in the head, first cold and then hot,
as I said in giving my judgment upon the last Urine; and indeed this
description will serve for any acute disease, whether it be the Pleurisy, the
small Pox or Maisels, a fit of the stone in the Kidneis, the Squinancy,
Frenzy, Iliaca Passio, the Arthritis, or what other sharp disease soever, Why
uniformity in judging is not to be used.
wherewith there is a Fever always complicate, or whether it be a simple Fever
which is primarily the disease it self; but yet I will not always use the
same description to all comers, because diverse messengers may come to a
Physician, and may stay for companies sake to go away together, and might fall
to questioning with each other what the Doctor said unto them, and so might
think (if I should use the same description unto them all) that I could say
nothing else. I therefore vary my description of the disease, and am sometimes
shorter in the same, and then (if I find by expostulation with the messenger
that I have omitted any thing that I should have spoken of) I say that it
proceeded from such a cause as I had already named, and that I should have come
to speak of that anon; I am sometimes likewise larger in my description, as I
am here in relating how the party is affected, for whom this Nurse comes: and
she is as ready to take me up for the same, and says, that it is true indeed,
that the party can take no rest, has no appetite to meat, and was taken (as I
said) in the manner of an Ague, but complains not of her stomach at all, but
cries out, My head, my head, and complains altogether of want of rest; To whom
I reply, that the pain in the head is the chief of the passions that the
party is affected withal, but yet that it proceeded from the oppression of the
stomach, and oppilation of the Liver and Spleen, which being obstructed, send
a choleric fume unto the brain, which infiame the Animal spirits, and cause
this pain which hindered rest, and that (if rest were not caused) it would make
the party rave, be frantic, and burst forth into senseless, and idle talk.
Thus having answered this objection, I now begin to touch the Urinall, to see
if it have settled enough, but finding it not to have settled enough to my
purpose, and to show me those things that I must find out of it, I set it
down again very tenderly, saying, it must yet settle alittle better; and then
I fall to questioning with the Nurse concerning something that may show me the
sex, for I must find that out of the water too; And now I ask her, what the
party uses to do in the time of health, and this is a question that may (she
thinks) as well be answered without giving me any light of the sex, as the
former question (which was, How long the party had been sick) of giving me
any light of the disease; but you shall hear what I collect from thence. She
answers, I demanding what the party uses to do, that the party uses to do
little, save only to go up and down the house, to work about the house, to
walk up and down abroad, to keep a shop, to labor, or the like; and from
all these I have my several collections. Now if she say, that the party uses
to do little, save only to go up and down the house, I presume that it is
the Mistresses of the house, or the good-wifes, or one of their daughters, or
some Gentlewoman in the house, but for certain, that it is a woman's water, or
a maids, for they should, and commonly do (if their shoes be not made of
running leather) keep their house, and their work is to walk up and down the
house; but if she say, the party uses to do such work as is to be done in or
about the house, it is most likely that it is a maidservant, but if she say to
walk abroad, I then presume that it is a man's water, and that it may be the
Master of the house, or his sons, or some other Gentleman's, whose work and
employment is only to walk abroad and take his pleasure; but if she say, to
keep a shop, I suppose it to be the Masters thereof, or an he Apprentice his;
or if she say, that the party uses to labor, I imagine it to be a
manservant, or some hired laboring man's; so by her answer to this question,
namely, what the party uses to do in the time of health, I discern the sex.
And now I take the Urinall again in my hand (for by this time it has stood
long enough to settle) and now I say that it is a woman's water, suppose that
her answer to my question (What the party used to do in the time of health)
did infer as much, that she has a burning Fever, is so dangerously sick
that she will hardly recover, unless such and such speedy means be used, and
yet that All will scarce do; and this danger I will always pretend in every
Violent disease, though there be no deadly sign at all; but not to the sick
parties (for that they cannot endure to hear of) but secretly to the
messenger, or some near friend, or by-stander, if I be present with them; and
then if the party live. I shall not so much as have my judgment called in
question, for saying the party would die, but be magnified for that I have
recovered her of a dangerous disease; nay, to be sure to be happy in my
predictions and prognostics concerning the life and death of my Patients (for
they must always have a hint of that, although the thought of death be an
unwelcome guest) I will deliver mine opinion both ways; I will threaten, or
rather pretend the danger of death to the sick party (if my opinion be
desired,) with a But if such and such means be used, you may happily recover:
and to some by-stander or hanger on, I will secretly whisper that there is no
danger at all: or else I will promise life to the Patient, which is altogether
wished, and threaten death to some other inquisitour: and thus was a learned
Doctor in Physic over-matched by a meaner Practicant in Physic, at Ashford
in Kent who used this policy in his prognostics. I have for mine own part and
office, herein delivered my self well enough to this Nurse in my prognostics
concerning the event of the woman's sickness, for whom she is come: I have told
her how the woman is affected, what the disease is, and what will be the event;
and the Nurse is reasonable well satisfied herewith, but yet I have omitted
something, that she will be sure to tell me of, for since she has undertaken
the matter, she will not go without her errand. So, now she asks me if I
perceive nothing else by the water, and I imagine well enough what it is else
that I should perceive by it, for when that question is propounded, it is to
know whether the woman be with child or no: to whom I answer, that there are
many more things to be perceived by the water (but not at all times) as whether
a woman were with child or no, which is that you look for; but it is no now to
be seen in this water, because her body is all out of temper, and her water
troubled and discolored, but yet I think her to be, and well I may, if she
her self think so; I further tell her, that I could have certainly told,
(but yet I lie,) if she had brought her water in the time of her health: and so
she is satisfied for that matter, and confesses that she is with child indeed.
Having thus satisfied her in all these things, told her that it is a woman's
water, in what manner she was sick, what was her disease, that it was likely
that she was with child (which proves true) and that she would scarce recover
(which is no great matter whether she do or no) I now begin to close with her,
and ask her whose water it is; but she will not tell me, and commend her for
it, for she was forbid, and therefore has vowed the contrary; and indeed she
was sent only to hear mine opinion of the water, the which, if she like,
shall happily hear further from the party, but if not, she has order to go to
another Pisse-Prophet, and so if she like not his opinion neither, from him to
another, until she come to him that hits the disease rightest (as she
conceives) by the water, and he (I dare say, the most fool and knave of all
the three) is the man that shall be made choice of to cure this woman; and this
is thought great policy in making choice of an able Physician. It behooves me
therefore to be my crafts master in this Art, for else you see here how I am
like to be nosed of a Patient, and to have my skill called in question; for (if
I cannot find the disease by the water) they will soon conclude that I know
not how to cure it. This Nurse tells me indeed (but if she had not told me, I
should have perceived it) that she came to hear mine opinion of the water, and
that the sick party would send to me again, when she had heard (she should
have said, If she liked it) what was mine opinion, and I think I have fitted
her, and now tell the Nurse, that it had been fitter they had sent for some
present remedies, than to know the disease, or to hear mine opinion of it, so
I have her away with her oracle, bid her be sure to deliver it so as I had told
her, and tell (but not to the sick party) to some of her near friends, how
dangerously she is sick, and that I would (if she think good to make use of
me) use the best means to recover her that Art could lead me unto; and now I
bid her make all the have that may be, but yet (before I let her go) I thus
bespeake her; in faith Nurse, I commend thee that thou will do thy errand
handsomely, and make a Physician find the disease out of the water, and not be
gulled (to tell how the party was affected) as many a fool would have done,
but I hope I have showed thee truly how the party is affected, and what is her
disease, and given thee such satisfaction as will content them that sent thee:
lo therefore here is for thy pains, because thou have put me to it so
handsomely, and so I give her, (fearing lest I should have erred, that she may
maintain my credit, and in hope of receiving a better fee, for being sent for)
the crackd groat, or the Harry groat that was sent in stead of six pence, for
casting this water; nay, if it chance to be six pence indeed, she shall have
it all, and so I shall be sure to have my message well done, and perhaps she
will tell me that which she denied before; but if not, she will magnify me for
my skill, and I shall be sure to hear further from the party, and have the
casting of all the waters that she can bring me; so I now send her away and
laugh at her, and the Devil at us both: I laugh at her because I have cozend
her, and the Devil, that he has cozend us both, by making her to believe that
I discern all those things by the water that I told her, and making me to back
my pretended knowledge by such fallacies. But do not now imagine that I have
been so long in hand with this Nurse, in giving judgment of this Urine, as I
have been in penning the circumstances with the several actions and gestures
that I use in the examination of a Piss pot, The diversity of actions to be
used in giving judgment from the Urine.
which I have set down to help thy understanding, or so long as thou have
been in reading them; but that (as if she had been but now new come in) I take
the Urinall of her, propound the first question, set down the Urinall in the
window, and pro^ounce a description of the disease: then propounding the other
questions in order (as I have done before) define or determine the disease,
tell her that such and such means ought suddenly to be used, and so send her
away; suppose therefore that she came but newly in, and is but now new gone
out, and so I have done with her, and sent her away in a trice, and am ready
for the next commer. But stay here a little, let that messenger tarry, and
conceive with me how one may give his judgment of any sharp disease by the
water, (though it be not there to be seen,) in pronouncing my judgment upon
this last Urine, for I cannot stand to instance upon many particulars: mark
therefore the description that I gave to the Nurse of the last disease, which I
determined to be a Fever, after that I perceived by the Nurses answer to my
first question (which was, how long the party had been sick) that it was a
sharp disease; The Symptoms of a sharp disease.
now my description was this; that the party had a great oppression of stomach
and no appetite to meat, a great oppilation of the Liver and Spleen, was very
hot, desired much to drink, had a great pain in the head, and could take no
rest, and was taken in the manner of an Ague with a pain in the head, and
grooving in the back, first cold and then hot, the which description may serve
for any sharp disease in giving judgment of a water; yet I do not affirm,
that in every sharp disease the party is just thus affected in every respect,
but for the most part, for if it chance to fail and be excepted against, I
have showed, how to make it good to the messenger, and to serve the turn to
satisfy him, and not the Physician and practicant in Physic. Mark further,
that in describing the disease, and showing how the party is affected, I do
not yet define, determine, or name the disease, till I have expostulated with
the messenger so far, that I perceive the disease from thence, and have
sounded enough out of him, to tell him any thing that he shall desire to know
of me; and then I determine the disease to be (as the symptoms, when I have
strictly examined them, shall agree with the messengers relation.) A Fever, the
small Pox, or Maisels, a Pleurisy, or the like, looking still upon the Urine,
as if I found it there, whereas I hope you well perceive my fetches, which
help me out, or else Dun might have stuck full fast in the mire. I hope also,
that you perceive how easily a man may give his judgment of any other acute
disease by the water, though it do not show it; and now a word or two with
this other messenger, and then I shall have done with acute, sharp, and
violent diseases.

CHAP. IV.
The rude simplicity of such as send their Urine unto a Physician without any
instructions how the party is affected: And the desperate hazard, that they
put their lives in, who adventure to take Physic prescribed only by the sight
of the Urine.

NOw this messenger is as rough-hewed as he that sent him and is a very plain
fellow in his holy day Jacket and his busking Hose; he was called from making
of Faggots, or from thrashing, to go to the Doctor and carry this Piss that
is put up in the Vinegar bottle, and brought to me to judge of; and it is a
very turbid water of a very high, dark, red color, by which as also by the
messenger, (for I can better tell, by the messenger, his gesture, time of
coming, haste to be gone, and other circumstances, what the party ayleth, how
long he has been sick, and whether it be a man's or woman's water, than I or
any Physician can do by the Urine, especially if I lived in a Town or City
where I had much Country practice) I conceive it to be some Country Farmers,
his sons, or man's, his Hubber de hoy which is his man-boy, or half a man and
half a boy: But which of them soever it be, he has borne it out with head
and shoulders (for so your Country people use to do before they send to a
Doctor) and wrastled so long with the disease, and been so often foiled out,
for they do not observe the orders in Moore or Lincolns-Inne fields, where if
a man be three times foiled out, it is to stand for a fall, and he is to
wrestle no more for that time, as that he can no longer stand, and yet he is to
have one bout more with the disease who has a cruel second in this Duel,
even death it self: And now (if nature be not assisted by Art) this fellow,
whose second I must be, is like to be put to the worst, and the disease is like
to give him a flat fall upon his back in his Grave, never to rise again
until the resurrection. Therefore if I have any skill, I must show it now or
never: I now therefore take the water to examine it, and think to question
with this messenger (as with the former) How long the party has been sick,
whose water it was, and to put him such other questions as might show me such
other circumstances which might show me the disease, and guide me in the
prescribing fit remedies for the same; but he cannot answer me one question,
not whose water it is, nor how long the party has been sick, no nor whether
it be a man's or a woman's water; much less the constitution of the body, the
present strength of it at this time, or whether the party be bound or loose in
his body, with diverse other such circumstances, all the which are so necessary
for me to know, as that without the knowledge thereof I cannot safely prescribe
any Physic, and yet this fellow cannot tell me one word, for he says that he
was not told, but was only hired to bring me the water, and to bid me send
something to help the party, and has brought eighteen pence or two shillings
with him to pay for that which I shall prescribe or send; and all that he can
say, is, that such a man's servant came to him to get him to come, but did not
tell him whose water it was, nor how long the party had been sick. And now
what, on Gods Name, shall I do in this case, for it is presumed that I know
the disease by the water, and all other circumstances belonging to the same,
which are requisite for to guide me in the prescribing of fit remedies, and I
have pretended as much, and helped to nurse up folks in this folly, (as other
Physicians have done before me) by giving my judgment of diseases by the
sight of the Urine, and backing my pretended knowledge by such fallacies as I
have spoken of, without the which neither I nor any Physician in the world can
give any judgment of a disease, nor come to the knowledge of such
circumstances (unless the messenger, that brings it, tell us) as may guide us
in the prescribing of safe medicines every way proper unto the disease. I must
tell you therefore (for mine own part) that I have already, and do for ever
hereafter mean to steer a new course; yet I must, for this one time,
prescribe for this fellow, who (being all this while out of breath with his
last Arthleticke combat, and having caught such a wrinch, (though he played
strong play, as that he will go near to fall the next bout) is expected to
enter the sands, to revive the quarrel, and to undertake the last encounter. I
now therefore take the Urinall (since the messenger can tell me nothing) and
look better upon the water, as if I could tell miracles by it, for I must now
make all the haste that may be to set him on foot, What is to be done, when no
instruction can be had from the messenger.
since he is so earnestly expected by his adversary: Now looking upon the
water, I perceive it to be very crasse, thick, and turbid, in all places
alike, of an intense, high, dark, red color; and from thence I conceive, that
according to the fopperous Pisse-maximes, and rules of our great
Pisse-prognosticatours, there is a great commixture of superabundant humors,
which the substance of it (as they say) being crasse, thick, and turbid,
shows; and that nature is not yet able to concoct these humors, for then
there would be some separation in the Urine, and it would not be in all places
alike, but would have sediment in the bottom, and be transparent in the upper
part; I conceive also that he has a great Fever, for that the color shows,
being red and high, and that there is great danger, for it is of an high dark
red color, tending to blackness. But yet I cannot tell what manner of Fever
it is, for I cannot discern by the Urine (as common people suppose) the
passions and affects of the sick party, that determine the disease, and should
guide me in the prescribing fit remedies, and therefore I cannot tell whether
it be best to let him blood, to give hive him a purging potion, or Clyster, or
whether his body would now bear any of these, or whether I were best to give
him something to make him sleep, or some cooling Juleb, or some Cordial
Antidote to expel noxious humors from the vital parts; now which of these
methods I shall best use (for the messenger can tell me nothing) I know not,
but however the matter is not great, for the party ventureth but his life, and
why should not I adventure my skill against it? I now therefore pronounce the
party to be sick of a bastard Pleurisy (for, it is no matter what I say to
this messenger,) or a Fever, and that the party would hardly recover, further
adding, that he should have been let blood a week ago, and that I feared it
would now be too late, but yet I wish it to be done, for if any thing in the
world recover him, it must be that; and if that do it, it is but Hab, Nab, but
yet however, I must put it in practice; so now I have away the messenger to get
a Surgeon to let him blood; and tell him where, and in what quantity it must
be done, and now it is a question whether the disease, or the life be let out
by this blood-letting: if blood offending in quantity, or corrupt blood
(offending in quality) putrified by choler in the lesser veins, be let out,
the disease may chance to be let out with it, and so Mors or Death may tarry
for a sacrifice, till some other sickness take him upon more advantage. But if
the good blood, seeming to be inflamed, be let out, when this Fever proceeds
from choler in the greater veins, or from Phlegm, or other mixed humors in the
stomach, Spleen, or Mesentery, which ought to be purged, the life (instead of
the disease) may be let out, by loss whereof the debt to God and Nature would
be paid. But happily (instead of blood-letting, I prescribe at random, (for so I
must do in either) some purging Potion, and so set the disease and a medicine
together by the ears and leave the success to fortune. And now whether the
party live or die, I care not: for if he die, I have taught them to blame their
own negligence, in not sending any sooner; but if Nature be of such for^e,
that she be able to withstand the conflict between the disease and the
Antidote, and start up, and take part with the Medicine, so that the party
recover, I shall have more attributed unto me, (as the only cause of his
recovery) than I have deserved, or than to God, who in his providence, had
been pleased (by the work of Nature, more than by any skill of mine) to spare
and recover him: and thus you use to overvalue the means, whereby (as you
suppose) you have been recovered, although used so desperately (as I have
prescribed for this fellow) by a methodicall Physician, professing knowledge of
diseases by the Urine, or used quite contrary to the rules of Art, by some rude
Empiricke and Quack-salving knave, especially, if you chance to recover; and to
under-value the best means in the world, used by the most grave and learned
Physician, if the party chance to die: never satisfying your selves, when
things are so come to pass, that it was Gods providence, saying, (sic placuit
Domino,) it was Gods will it should be so, and so resting your selves
contented, but still tormenting your selves further, in thinking that this
child, that friend, this brother, or that sister might have been recovered, if
the best means had been used, as if God would not have directed thee unto
that means, had it not been his will now to take this party unto himself.
And now, I hope that you perceive by these few instances, how a man may deceive
the wisest messenger that you can send unto a Physician with a water, and show
you the disease by the same, although it be not there to be found, and how
great danger they put their lives in, that adventure to take Physic
prescribed by the sight of the Urine only: and so I have done with all sharp
and violent diseases, and am now coming to speak of Chronicall, lingering, and
diseases of continuance, wherein I mean to show you how to give judgment of
them by the water, though in those diseases, it show less than in sharp and
violent diseases.

CHAP. V.
A Recapitulation of those things which have been spoken, touching the giving
of judgment of the Urine in Acute and Violent diseases: and a Praecapitulation
of some things necessary to be premised touching Chronicall and diseases of
continuance, before we come to the examination of the Pisse-messengers, as we
have done in Sharp and Violent diseases.

AND now, whereas I showed you (before that I came to instance and show my
cunning in giving judgment upon Urines in violent diseases) that diseases are
either sharp and violent, (the which I have spoke of) or Chronicall and of
continuance, such as I am now to speak of next; and that, in sharp diseases,
the Urine is for the most part of an high red color, and that there is a Fever
always joined with every sharp disease; so I showed you that one may give a
description how any sick party is affected in any violent disease, by rekoning
up the common Symptoms and companions of a Fever (which are oppression of
stomach, want of appetite, Heat, Thirst, Pain in the head, want of sleep,
etc.) and make the messenger believe that I perceive the disease by the water,
because I show how the party is in some kind affected, the which neither I, nor
any Physician in the world can perceive in, or by water, but gather by
consequence, when we once conceive that it is a violent disease; for then we
know that there is a Fever joined, and that there are some of those Symptoms
(that I named) joined with it, but yet I do not know what kind of Fever it is,
nor what violent disease it is (and therefore I do not name or determine it)
until I have expostulated with the messenger, in such manner as I have already
showed, and thereby come to the knowledge of some specificall note, or
difference, which determine the same.

I must now likewise give you to understand (before that I come to examine some
few Urines, to show you how I give my judgment of Chronicall diseases) that in
Chronicall diseases (such as are the Drop^e, Gout, Palsy, Falling sickness,
Scurvey, French Pox, Green sickness, Malacie, which is the disease of women
newly conceived with child, Cough, Headache, Mother, and such like) the Urine
is no way faulty, but represents the Urine of healthful; nay, oftentimes the
most healthful men in the world: And yet the Physician (such a Urine being
brought unto him) must sentence the party that made it, to be sick, upon no
other proof but only this lying strumpet, and false witness (the Urine)
suborned by the beguiled and so selfe-conceited vulgar, and connived at by the
Pisse-Justice or Judge, before whom she is brought, who is corrupted for a
testar, sometimes for more and sometimes for less, and is contented to accept
of her evidence for truth, when he knows it to be a palpable lie that she
comes to affirm. She is indeed the dumb messenger between the Doctor and
his Patient, who (instead of passing the relation of his disease in writing, or
by some discreet messenger) pisseth his mind in his water, and expects an
answer; but if I should write him an answer in a letter written in the same
language, I doubt he would scarce read it. How then shall I do, who must
answer his expectation, since the Urine in this case shows no disease at all?
Or what oracle shall I give? Shall I say (such a water being brought unto me) I
do not perceive by this water that the party that made it is sick, or ayleth
any thing: far be it from me for thinking so: If I should return such an
honest plaine-dealing answer, both the messenger and he that sent him would
perceive me to be diseased in my brain, without the casting of my water, and
would presently say that I were troubled with the simples: For why (would they
say) have I sent or brought this Urine if the party be not sick? Is not this
a wise Doctor that cannot tell the Disease by the water? This Doctor shall
give me no Physic, for I have gone to such a Doctor (Rogue or Knave you
might call him) that has told me my disease directly by the water, and he
shall be my Doctor; and (for me) so let him: And thus you grumble at your
Doctor, if he honestly tell you that the Urine does not certainly show any
disease, and begin to examine whose water it is, and how the party is
affected, as also the age, sex, constitution of body, the present strength of
it, and such other circumstances as should show him (he not seeing the party)
the disease, and guide him in the prescribing fit remedies, you presently
suspect him of ignorance, and think that he should tell you these things by
the Urine. And thus was I lately taxed by a Gossip at East Greensted in Sussex
(where I lived and began my practice) because I was strict in examining the
state of her body that I might not err in prescribing her something to give
her ease of that which she complained of; for it was very suspicious that she
was with child, and she pretended that she desired to take something by my
prescription, but because I asked her so many questions (the which she thought
I should have resolved my self by the water) she would none of mine advise,
but reported that I had no skill in waters, and said, I asked her many
questions, but could tell her nothing from the water. I spare to name her, yet
I wish that she may chance to read this Story, wherein she may perceive that I
could have cozened her, that she may blush to think that she was so much a
fool, and thank me that I have canonized her for a foole-Saint, by no other
name, but the name of a Gosssip and so let her know that I wanted not wit to
have deceived her, had not my will been restrained by a better resolution than
to use such base deceit (to fit the humors of my Patients) as is used to
delude the vulgar, who think that there is no disease nor symptom thereof,
belonging to the body of man or woman, but that it may be discerned in the
Urine: Yet it is far otherwise, for in these Chronicall diseases (for the
most part) the water seems not to import any disease at all, and yet the
party is irrecoverably sick: So likewise the Urine is oftentimes of an high
red color, and seems to import a violent Fever when the party is not sick
at all: It may be also of so good a color and consistence, in a violent
disease, as imports no disease at all, and yet the party sick unto death:
for confirmation whereof, I will give you two or three instances out of mine
own experience, and refer you to Doctor Hari for further satisfaction, who
in his Book entitled, The Anatomy of Vrines, has set down many examples out
of his own observation, as also out of the most ancient and authenticke
Writers, which confirm the same which I affirm: First, therefore to confirm
this point, That the sick party is often irrecoverably sick of a most Acute
and violent disease, when his water seems not to import any disease at all; I
had a Urine brought me (when I lived at East-Greensted in Sussex, where I was
then a young practicant in Physic) which did not seem to import any disease,
but was of a better color and consistence than mine own, who was in perfect
health, in so much that I could not discern thereby that the party was sick;
much less that he was sick unto death of a violent disease: But I did not
tell the messenger that brought it, that I did not perceive by the water, that
the party was sick, for then I might have showed my self to have been a
fool, and to have had no skill in waters, as that Gossip thought me that I
last spoke of: But thus I handled the messenger; I asked him how long the
party had been sick, and he answered me, a week; from whence I knew that it
was a violent disease, for else I should (if I had not put him that question)
have thought it to have been a Chronicall disease, and so should have given a
wrong description of the same, because the water seemed to import no disease at
all: So when I had gathered, by his answer to that question that it was a
violent disease, I likewise knew that there was a Fever joined, and gave him
but the description of a Fever, to show him how the party was affected, and he
was very well satisfied therewith, and thought I perceived the disease in the
water. Now having given this description how the party was affected, and that
he had a Fever (and indeed a man needs not to say any more, what kind of Fever
soever it be) I fell to some conference nearer to the matter (with the
Messenger) whereby I came to understand the disease better than by the Urine;
and now I begin to tell him the danger that the party was in. and he desires
me (for the messenger was kinsman unto to the sick party) that I would be
pleased out of charity (for the sick man was poor, by profession a
Shoemaker, by name John Lintell) to go along with him, and to see him; the
which I granted, and went along with the messenger to see this sick party,
whom I found, lying in his bed not able to stir himself, sick of a
peripneumoniacall Fever (which is the Apost^mation and inflammation of the
lungs) with all the signs of death in his face, upon the eighth day of his
sickness, with sharp nose, hollow eyes red cheeks, a great pain in his back
between his shoulders, and a great oppression of his stomach and pectorall
parts, in so much that he could scarce breathe or speak, but with rattling in
the throat; all the which when I had well observed, I put him in mind of his
mortality and present imminent danger, gave him the best instructions that I
could to prepare himself for that sudden change of this life for another that
was like to be, and so took my leave of him: But before I could get away, I
was desired by some of his friends that were about him, to tell them (for they
think that we can surely tell, or else that we are not our craftsmasters)
whether he would dye, or no; and I took upon me to determine his death before
eight of the clock the next night, within half an hour of which time he
dyed. But (before I could get out of the chamber) they began to whisper, as the
manner is and to scoff me to my face, saying amongst themselves, that they did
nor perceive but that he might live as long as I; but my predictions proved so
true, and were so soon accomplished, that I came off from that their censure
with more than ordinary credit, for as much as I had prefixed so short a time
of his life, and the event (death) following now so near the utmost bounds and
limits of the time. Yet I confess ingenuously, that I was too peremptory in
determining his death within so short a time, or by such an hour, for I had
told them* that he could not live until such an hour (which was ^ight of the
clock) and that, if he should escape that hour, he would recover; but yet
both of these predictions might have proved false, for he might both escape
that hour, and yet might not recover (though I said he would, if he passed
that hour) but dye within a few days or hours after. Neither did I pronounce
my judgment from any grounds of Art, that did determine his death within such
an hour, but only by conjecturall probability; for your cunning men, or
Conjurers, nay the Devil himself, cannot otherwise than upon conjecture,
determine a sick man's life unto an hour, unless you make him one of the
Almighties scoret counsel. Nay I dare affirm, that the Devils may, and often
are deceived in their conjectures and calculations touching the life and death
of men, and yet their natural knowledge is far more than men's, for they are
spirits; and their acquired knowledge is as much beyond men's, because they are
ancienter than men (even from the beginning of the world) and are not subject
to the same mortality that man is, who (before he come to begin to have
understanding) is in his Grave. I say therefore, that no Physician, nay the
Devils (who are ancienter than Aesculapius or Hippocrates, or any of that
race) cannot determine the life and death of a man, but upon conjecture, and
may be deceived; but yet you look that a Physician should be able to do it,
and not to err, because such an event does oftentimes accidentally follow such
a peremptory conclusion as this of mine was, that this party would dye within
such an hour. It is true indeed, and I might truly say (the nature of the
disease, and the strength of the body, with all other signs of death being
well considered) that I thought the party would scarce live until such an
hour: but if I should say (without any qualification of the sense) that the
party would not live until such an hour, and that he would recover if he
should pass that hour, you might think that I spoke without my book, for I
could not say so, but that I must speak more than I know, and so derogate from
the providence of God, in assuming that knowledge unto my self that belongs
only to him. I was likewise called to another lusty young man (one John
Duffield by name) in the very same Town, very shortly after, who was sick of
the very same disease, in the same manner, whose friends were very importunate
at me to be tampering with him, and to use my best skill to recover him, but I
perceived that there had another Quack been tampering with him before, who had
omitted the opportunity of letting him blood, and found him so far and in such
case debilitated that now there was no place for bleeding unless I had been
contented to have undergone the scandal that would have soon ensued; so I
wished them to send for the Physician of the soul, and told them there was no
place for my Art: For, had I caused him to have been let blood, he would have
gone near to have dyed under the Chirurgians hands, and then they would not
have stuck to have said that I had killed him; for it was afternoon, and almost
night when I was called unto him, and he dyed before the next morning: Yet (as
I said before of the incertaine judgment of diseases by the water) his water
was of as good a color and consistence every way as any healthful man's, yet
notwithstanding I gave my judgment so upon this Urine, as that I satisfied the
messenger; for I asked the messenger, how long the party had been sick, who
answered almost a week; from whence I gathered that it was a violent disease
although the water did not witness the same, and so gave the description of a
Fever which showed how the party was affected, and made the messenger think
that I perceived his disease in the water; but you (I hope) well perceive how I
did it, and how a man may be sick unto death, his Urine showing no disease at
all, and if a Physician can satisfy the messenger and seem to describe the
disease by the Urine, notwithstanding. So now I proceed to sit in judicature
upon this modest harlot (the Urine) who in Chronicall diseases seems to
import no disease at all, and yet she is caught ipso facto in her close tricks,
for which she is come to public censure: But first, before I come to examine
this strumpet, I must further show you how I come to know certainly whether it
be a Chronicall disease or no, since she is (namely the Urine) so perfidious as
that there is no credit to be given to any thing that she comes to give in
evidence concerning the state of any sick or well bodies water whomsoever: How
a lingering disease is found out.
Now that I discern (namely whether it be a Chronicall disease or no) by the
same question that I propounded in giving my judgment upon Urines in violent
diseases; and that question was this; I only asked the messenger how long the
party had been sick, by answer whereunto I am certified, or at least have
strong presumption, whether it be a Chronicall or violent disease; for if the
Piss Post say a week or less, I then presume that it is a violent disease:
But if the Pisse-bearer say that the party has not been very well a good
while (which is their answer commonly in a Chronicall disease, when we ask how
long the party has been sick, for indeed they are not sick in most
Chronicall diseases, but are illish or not well) I dare say then that it is a
Chronicall disease; and when I have once received this answer to the forenamed
question, (let the water be of what color soever it will, or whether I (...)
or no, I care not) I know how to give an answer that shall please the
messenger, and fill his bag, but put nothing in it; and though the water show
no disease at all, (for so it falls out for the most part, as I have already
told you, in these Chronicall diseases, that I am now to speak of next;) yet I
will find the disease (for which the party sent it) out of it: nay, (if the
party should have no disease at all, but send his Urine to see if he be not
inclining unto some such hereditary disease as his Parents have dyed of, or
been subject unto, as the Gout, Stone, Consumption or the like) I will shake
it into the danger of falling into the same, or some other disease of no less
danger, for that they always fear, and love to be warned of, though they have
obtained such a constitution of body as is not obnoxious unto their Parents
diseases; and thus I must do, if an Urine be sent, though the party be well,
or but a little out of tune, by reason of the least distemper that may be* for
there is no such constitution of body, but that it has its proper infirmities,
the which must be discerned (since there is such a custom) by the Urine; and I
will find them out, and more than there are, by it, if once I come to lecture
upon it, or else let them blame my judgment; so then (I trow) there will be
work for the Tinker to prevent an hole in Nature, where there was never like
to be a breach. But (I pray) may not this Physick-tinker (who pretending such
knowledge by the Urine, is constrained to back his pretended knowledge by such
base fallacies) may not (I say) nay, will he not, think you (under pretense of
fortifying that place where you fear a breach) grate an hole in another to let
in diseases, to make himself continual work, the which (at last) will let
out that precious liquor of thy life, that thou would be loath to lose? But I
leave that to thine own charity to judge of; and so betake my self to my
Study, to come forth from thence in my gown and my cap, to entertain the next
Pisse-bearers, who now begin to come thick and threefold; I must therefore be
gone to my Study, from whence you shall see me come forth presently, and hear
me pronounce true judgment, upon the false evidence of the suborned witness
(the Urine) on the delinquent (the sick party) though he be absent, and not
here to speak for himself.

CHAP. VI.
After what manner (if diverse Pisse-messengers come together) they must be
examined: How to show (by the Urine) the Sex, whether a woman be with child or
no, how long it is since she conceived of it, and whether she s^all bring forth
a boy, or a girl, although the Urine show none of all these.

AND now I am in my Study indeed, and you think (I suppose) at my book in
earnest consultation with Hippocrates, or Galen, or some other learned Physic
Author; but, if I be looking upon any book at all, it shall rather be
Gordo^ius his tractate of the Cautions of Urines, wherein he teaches a
Physician, (though I think his intention was to teach him not to be deceived
by the Urine) to deceive the people by the same: otherwise I am meditating how
to handle every Pisse-pot-bearer upon any occasion whatsoever: and my mind
being now set more upon the benefit that comes to my self by the Pisse-pot,
than to others by my study, I mind my gate or door more than my book, though
I am in my Study (where happily, my name being up, I have a bed and am lying upon
it, and should have lain there till noone, had I not been interrupted) and
hear a great knocking at my gate, and must my self (in my man's absence) be
feign to go see what the matter is: so to my gate I trudge, in all
precipitious have, with a quick pace and a sharp look, importing greater
business than to examine a Pisse-pot, where I find three or four
Pisse-messengers at once, (with their Urinals under their aprons) whom I usher
into my Hall, and there begin (before I take them aside, apart, to Lecture upon
their waters) to look very sternely upon them, and ask them very hastily, (to
the end that I may dash them so far out of countenance, that they may not be
capable of conceiving whether I err or no in giving my judgment on their
waters, and to make them the more ready to tell me whatsoever I shall demand of
them) what they would with me, where they live, whose water it is for whom they
come, etc. And they are all ready to present me their waters, looking who shall
be dispatched first: but before I take any of their Urinals of them, I sound
them how far I shall be puzzled with them, dispatching them first, that I
shall be least troubled withal. To the first therefore I say, where live you?
and she answers, at such a place, naming it: I further ask her whose water it
is? and she says her Mistresses: I ask her also who is her Mistress, to
which she answers me very orderly, and is now ready to put forth her Urinall
unto me, but I do not yet take it, nor I ask her no more questions, for she
will be ready to tell me whatsoever I shall demand: I come therefore to a
second, and ask her where she dwells, and (she having told me) I likewise ask
her whose water it is that she has brought, and she says a Gentlewomans, who
desired her to bring it unto me, and she is ready to give me her Urinall, but I
refuse it: I go now to a third, and ask her (for they are for the most part,
She-pisse-bearers in a great Town or City) where she dwells, and that she is
contented to tell me: but when I ask her whose water it is, she pauseth here,
and begins to make a doubt whether she were best to tell me that, or no; and
therefore answers, that it is a friends of hers: I then ask her what friends
it is, and whether it be a man's or a woman's water; and she tells me, that I
shall perceive that by the water, (thinking that I can or ought to do so
indeed) when I look upon it, and holds forth her Urinall unto me, in hope that
I will dispatch her first, but I refuse to take it, for I am like to be puzzled
with her, and it will require more time and Art to answer her than both the
other, and therefore she shall tarry to be the last answered for that trick.
I now therefore take the Urinall of her that told me that it was her Mistress
water, and single her out from her fellows, and bid her follow me into another
room (for I must not let several messengers hear what I say to each other)
because I may chance to stop two gaps with one bush, and to give the same
answer and description of the disease to them all three, (and indeed one
description will as well serve for all Chronicall diseases, as the description
of a Fever for all violent diseases, as I have showed you) and then they would
think that I pulled the bush out of one gap to put it into another, and that I
could say nothing else. I having therefore took the maid into another room,
bid her come to the light, and as I am taking the Urinall out of the case
(perceiving it to be of a subcitrine or pale color, which seem not to import
any disease) I presently say; maid, thy Mistress goes up and down: and she
answers, yes forsooth; and imagines no less now, but that I perceive the Idea
or shape of her Mistress in the water, and thinks that I can tell any thing
else by the same, so that I shall not now need to trouble my self in asking
her any more questions, for she tells me that her Mistress goes up and down
indeed, and that I had said very right, and tells me that her Mistress desired
that I would certify her whether she were with child, or no; so I now set
down the Urinall in the window, and tell her that it must stand so a little
while, and settle, and then I will tell her presently. Ordinary times of
conception.
In the mean time, I fall to parley with the maid, and ask her whether her
Mistress have had any child or no, and how long (if she have) it is since she
had one; and she says, a year, a year and an half, or almost two years:
and (indeed) most childing women go a year, or near upon, and many a year
and half, and some two years before they conceive with child again,
especially if they nurse their children themselves. I ask her likewise, if she
can tell whether her Mistress have her natural courses monthly or no, or when
she had them; to which (...) answers, that her Mistress bid her tell me, that
she has not had them this ten weeks, and therefore tells me that she
thinks she is with child, but would desire me to resolve her: The sign of
conception in married women.
And I may quickly do it without any more looking upon the water, for the tale
(that this wench has told) shows plainly that she is with child, and the
sudden stopping of the courses in a married woman (that enjoyed them monthly
before) is the most certain token in the world, that I know, that a woman is
with child: it is likewise the aptest time for a woman to conceive
immediately after she has had them, neither can I nor any other Physician tell,
but by this token, (which is the most certain of all the rest) agreeing with
other signs of conception, which the water shows not, whether a woman be
with child or no, and yet for fashion sake, I take the Urinall in my hand
again, and fall to peering into it (as though I looked for some little child
there) And say now to the maid that her Mistress is not very well in her
stomach, Other signs of the same.
has no appetite to meat, is ill in her stomach in a morning, and apt to
vomit after meat (and so are most childing women at this time) and say, that
she is a quarter gone with child, which jumps just with ten weeks, according
to the common computation of a woman's go in forty weeks: but do not say, that
she is ten weeks with child, or just so long as since she had her natural
courses last, for that would make them so cunning (in time) that they would not
send their waters to a Doctor to cast, to know whether they were with child or
no, but I say, she is a quarter gone with child, which is but as much as to
have said she is ten weeks with child, or just so long as since she had her
courses last, which was (as the maid told me) ten weeks ago. I further say,
that she is with child of a boy, and to say so, is an even lay; yet, lest it
should prove false, How you are to deal with those who desire to be resolved
whether the child is like to be a boy or a girl.
I say (looking upon the water very earnestly) that if it had been brought
when it had been warm, or when she had been quick with child, or some such
like flamme, I could have told her certainly whether she were with child of a
boy, or of a girl, but I verily think it will be a boy; so now, if it chance
to be a boy indeed, it will be granted that I knew for certain that it would
be a boy, and I shall be accounted one of the rarest Doctors in the Town; but
if it chance to be a girl, the flamme, that I gave to the maid, and the truth
of my predictions in determining the Gentlewoman to be with child, and telling
her how long she was gone with child, will help to bear out the other, so that
I shall not have my skill one jot abated thereby. I now therefore tell the
maid, (as if she had come in but now) that her Mistress is not very well in
her stomach, has no appetite to meat, is inclinning to vomit after meat, is
with child a quarter gone, (and as I think) of a boy, and that it were very
convenient for her to take some corroborating Electuary to strengthen and
settle her stomach though she be with child, nay, I tell her that it will be
good, not only for her, but for her child also, and I bid her tell her
Mistress, that it will make her child to prosper the better within her, and
make it the more lively, so that she shall be the better able to bring it forth
with the more ease; nay, I tell her that it will make her bring forth the more
wise and understanding child. And so I have done with the maid, bid her
remember me to her Mistress, and be sure to tell her what I had said: and now
I am sure that I shall get a fee for my self, and a feeling for mine
Apothecarie; for what woman (being with child) would not have it to prosper
within her? but would she not more gladly bring it forth with ease, and most
gladly (it being brought forth) have it prove a wise and understanding child? I
dare say she would, though for no other end but (merely out of pride and
emulation) to have it wiser (that is wittier, and more sharpe-vvitted) than her
neighbors, and not so much out of desire that it should attain true wisdom;
but whatsoever her drift be, it skills not; I must bethink my self of
something to perform that which I promised, for this Gentlewoman will repair
unto me for such an Electuary as I spoke of (...) to which purpose I have the
most admirable receipt in the world, learned it of a proud gossip very lately,
into whose company I light bychance who was very inquisitive to learn where
she might get some Quinces, and in a proud scornful manner questioned with
me concerning the nature and virtue of them: who told her that they did
corroborate the stomach, and were cooling and restringent, and therefore good
against vomiting, and fluxes; at which she seemed to scorn, and said, that she
had heard a learned Doctor say, that they being eaten of a great
bellied-woman, would make her bring forth a wise child, as if I could not as
well tell how fa^re they conduce to the producing of a wise child as her
learned Doctor. But suppose Marmalade, or some other confection of Quinces
alone to be admirable for the purpose, yet I have learned more wit than to tell
this Gentlewoman so, or to give her a box of Marmalade, and bid her eat often
of it in the morning fasting, and before and after meat, no, she would then
under-value my skill, and scarce think me worthy of a fee; but I prescribe her
an Electuary, wherein Marmalade, or some other confection of Quinces is the
chief ingredient, but I mix therewithal some species or conserves to seem
to prescribe some rare curious thing though Marmalade alone would have done as
well: I shall serve this Gentlewoman even so, and shall prescribe her such an
Electuary, which may happily stay her vomitting, and corroborate her stomach, so
as she may have a better appetite to meat, and her child may become the more
lively and prosper the better within her; but whether it will make the child so
wise as to know its own father or no, I know not; I dare not promise: but
let her now send when she will, for I am provided for her; and so I have
done with her maid, and sent her away, and am ready to encounter with the
second (and to send her away as wise as she came) who told me that it was a
Gentlewomans water that she had brought.

CHAP. VII.
That Physicians are often feign to reckon up most of the Symptoms that
accompany all the Chronicall diseases of all the parts of the body (from head
to heel) until they hit upon that which the messenger looks for, because
the Urine (for the most part) in a Chronicall sickness, seems not to
importan^ disease at all: and that a Physician (if he give a false description
of the disease, so that he be taken up by the messenger for the same) must make
it good however.

I Am now come forth with the maid whom I have dispatched, and bid the second
messenger follow me into the same room where I gave my oracle unto the maid:
where being come, I say, come (good woman) give me thy Urinall, and tell her
(the Urine being of such a color, as imports not an Acute disease, that is
of a high red color) that this Gentlewoman walks up and down, has a crude
stomach, no appetite to meat, and is (if she feed liberally) ill after it, and
by reason of the ill disposition of her stomach, is often pained in the head:
and here she stops me before I run any further (for else I might chance to
reckon up most of the Symptoms that accompany Chronicall diseases, till I hit
upon that which the messenger looked for) and so takes me off, and says she is
troubled with a great pain in the head indeed, but does not complain much of
her stomach: and then I reply that the pain in the head proceeded from the
stomach and parts thereunto adjoining, and that the stomach is always
accessory to the diseases of the head, and that I named the illness of her
stomach, first, because it was the cause of her disease: and having once given
a description of a disease I must be sure to make it good, whether it be true
or false; for if I had (for a description of a disease) said that she had been
troubled with an oppilation of the Liver, and pain in the head (the messenger
answering, no Master Doctor, she is troubled with an illness, and pain in
the stomach) I would have said, it is very true indeed, and I should have told
you so, had you not interrupted ^he, but yet I would maintain it very
confidently, that it came from the head (for the stomach and head do mutually
offend each other) and what could she have said to the contrary? or if, when I
had given a description of the disease, she had said, Master Doctor, she is
much as you have said, but do not you perceive that she has a very weak
back? to which I answer, yes marry has she (for else why should she ask me?)
and something else too, which I shall tell you presently; and then I take the
Urine and look upon it and shake it together and set it down in the window to
settle, pretending that it will show me something else anon: In the mean time
I gather by conference with the messenger, whether it be a married woman's or a
maidens water, and the^ I take the Urinall and say, (if it be a married woman's)
that she has a very weak back indeed and that she is troubled with the
Whites, which is a disease that very many women are trouble withal, that
complain of weak backs: so no^ I have made amends for not naming it at the
first amongst the other Symptoms: and now she^ thinks that I have found it out
by the water, never dreaming that I conclude, that she has weak back, from
her question, and add, that she^ has the Whites, as a disease that follows
the weakness of back, but thinks (because I look^ in the water) that I find
it there: but if this water chance to be a maiden-Gentlewomans, who^^ either
troubled with a pain or heat in her back and the messenger ask me if she be
not troubled with one of them, I presently conjure them bo^^ into the water
(for they commonly go both together) by shaking and looking into it, as also
(...) setting it down a little to settle, and taking it (...) again
straight-wayes (for it is quickly found) and then I say, that she has a great
pain and heat in her back too, and (according to her ripeness, and
readiness for the man) that she would have the Stone, or rather the Stones,
if she could tell how to get them: I further add (naming the disease for which
she has sent her water, though she ayle nothing save only that Cupid has hit
her with his golden arrow) that this Gentlewoman wants a good husband, and
that she dreameth often of her sweetheart; and bid the woman bid her be of
good cheer, and tell her that her sweetheart will come very shortly; and with
this message she is so delighted, that she is more than half well again, and
thinks to her self (though she say nothing to her that brought me her Urine)
that I am a very cunning man, and that I can as well tell, whether she shall
enjoy him whom she is taken withal, as I have guest by her years and
constitution of body (but she thinks I have done it by her Urine) that she is
in love, and that I can help her to something to make her sweetheart as far
in love with her, and means to try me for some Love powder, or some other
devise to catch her Lover in a Cleft stick; for she has heard of such
tricks, and some that have professed Physic, have taught that Art, and diverse
both men and women have repaired unto such Knaves, (and by practizing such
wicked means as has been taught them) have obtained their Lovers; but yet if
she repair unto me again for this purpose (though I have been very youthful
in descanting upon her water) I will read her a graver Lecture, for I disclaim
such knowledge (though happily I know more than such a Rogue as shall practice
it) and detest such wickedness at mine heart. But now this long Parenthesis,
or discourse concerning this maiden-Gentlewoman, may seem to have hindered the
dispatch of the woman that came for the married Gentlewoman: yet if you do
suppose that she came in but now and that I have but now taken her to do, and
have gathered (after that I have once pronounced a description of the disease)
by parley with her, that the Gentlewoman is married, and such other
circumstances as I would know, you shall not perceive but that I presently
dispatch her; taking the Urinall in my hand and from the water (though she have
told me all) pronounce the disease, and say, that the Gentlewoman has a very
weak back, is troubled with the Whites, and that this disease had hindered (for
you must conceive that the woman told me that this Gentlewoman has not had any
child, this three or four years) her conceiving with child, and that she
would have no more children, unless she were freed of them; and now I must
think upon something (against she send) to cure this Gentlewoman, for I am sure
she will to it again for the the other boy: and now I am ready for the third
messenger, that said she came for a friend of hers.

CHAP. VIII.
How to correct the perverse disposition of cross messengers: and afterward
to make the messenger believe that thou can conjure, by showing the disease
by the Vrinall case. How men will serve their wives (who would feign be rid of
them) and women their husbands, when they have been with a Physician (for
advice) the one for the other. The notable imposture of a Butter-box about this
Town, who pretends great skill (above other men) in giving judgment of
diseases by the Urine.

I Have made this Gossip tarry till the last for her oracle, because I feared
by her answer (when I asked her whose water it was that she had brought) that
she would prove a cross piece of flesh to deal withal: I must therefore
handle her gently, for the wildest colts are oftener tamed by gentle means, as
by letting them have the raines lie still in their necks, and giving them their
own play, than by curbing them in too straightly, or by laboring to quiet
them by switch and spur, or the lash: I therefore suffer this colt to play in
her own halter* till she have so tired or hampered her self, that I may do
what I will with her: I do in no wise handle her roughly, or speak harshly
unto her, and say, come you with your friends water, and let me see it, and
(when I have taken it of her) ask her whether it be a man's or a woman's water,
for it seems by her other answer, that she will not tell me that, and then
say (she denying to tell me) come, come, a Pox on it, tell me whose water it is,
for I have not time to stand peering into it, for every thing that I must tell
you, though I could find it there, if I had not other fish to sees: and indeed
their foolish peevishness had (oftentimes) need to be so met withal, and some
Physicians have gone that strain, and by that humor have gotten more fame,
than their transcendent skill in Physic or learning, above other men has
deserved: but I am not of that humor, no, I say, come good woman (who stinkes
as much of goodness, as a Poult-cat of musk) I have made you tarry, but you
shall not altogether lose your labor; I pray follow me; and so I conduct her
into my Parlour, where I have now my man waiting for me with a cup of Ale, with
a Nutbrowne tossed in it, or else a cup of good English Beer of sixteen at the
least, with Nutmeg and Sugar in it for my mornings draught, and sit me down in
my chair, and say, here good woman I drinks to you, and so fetch off a bowl
of almost a pint, and bid my man fill the good woman a cup and put in some
more Nutmeg and Sugar and bid her to drink an hearty draught: and when she
has drunk, I bid my man fill me another cup, that I may wash both mine eyes,
so that I may see the better to dispatch this woman quickly: and when I have
drunk that off, I bid my man fill the good woman another cup, and bid her mend
her draught, and tell her that to drink Nutmeg and Sugar in her Beer in a
morning will make her water sweet. And thus are the perverse dispositions of
cross messengers better corrected, than the malignity of Scammony, with
Anise-seed, Rubarbe with Spike, Agricke and Turbitch, with Sal-gemme, Ginger,
or Galingall, Senna, with Ginger, or Cinnamon, black Hellebore with Masticke,
or Cinnamon, or La^is Armenius, with twenty times washing in Rose Water: but now
to return to the matter, I have washed away all the ill quality of this woman's
nature with the cup of Beer that I gave her, and wrought her to so good a
temper with my loving speeches, that I need not fear, but that she will tell
me any thing that I shall ask her: however I have now drunk my mornings
draught and shall be able to see the clearer, if I must find it all out of the
water, that I must show. I therefore now say, come good woman (it is a great
chance but that I lie;) how long has your friend been sick? and she cannot
answer me to this question without showing me the sex, (that is, whether it be
a man's or a woman's water) for the party is not sick; for then she might answer
me directly without giving me any knowledge thereof, and might say, a week, a
forthnight, or more, or less, but she must needs say, He, or She (but yet she
will scarce remember that she said, He or She, anon when I shall show my skill
upon the water, and determine the Sex) has not been very well a good while,
and so offers me her Urinall with the water in it, as it is in the Case, but I
refuse to take it, and say unto her as follows. Good woman, because I have
made you to stay so long, I will show you your friends disease by the Urinall
Case, and never look upon the water at all: give me therefore the Urinall
Case, and do you keep the water to your self, so that I do not see it at
all, and yet I will tell you your friends disease, as well as he that should
pore and peep, or gaze into the water this month: and now the woman thinks
that I can surely conjure. I now therefore take the Urinall Case of her, and
look as wistly upon it, as if it were the Urinall with the water in it, and
presently pronounce (looking upon the Case,) That this party goes up and down,
is not heart-sicke, but is faint in the body, has but a bad stomach, does
linger and pine as it were, is joylesse and melancholic and takes no pleasure
in any thing, which shall be the description of this disease: and now the woman
she wonders to hear me say, by looking only upon the Urinall Case, that the
party is so affected, as I have said; and yet it is true, that the party is so
affected, and it is as true that the Urinall Case does show it as certainly as
the Urine it self. For the water might be of such a laudable color and
consistence as might seem not to import any disease at all, and yet the party
might be sick unto death: It might likewise be of such a color and consistence
as might seem to import a violent disease when the party is not sick at all:
I wish therefore that any Physician would set pen to paper to disprove me, or
to show that there is any certain judgment of any disease, by the water; and
yet forsooth this base custom, of divining by it, must be continued: But how
then, will you say, can a Physician conclude, that a party is thus or thus
affected, from it? Why thus you may do it: namely, by putting a question; For
(as Fernelius says) Interrogatiuncula caute praemittenda quampridem morbus
invasit: A question is to be propounded (craftily) to the messenger (as I have
done to this woman) how long the party has been sick: Then pronounce a
description of the disease, and fall to parley with the messenger, and thou
shall quickly find what the disease is; for the same Author says, Verborum
circuitu stultorum men's facile irretitur, by exchange of words the fool
messenger is soon caught: And thus have I caught this woman, whom (though she
be an old bird) I have caught with chafe; for I asked her, before I took the
Urinall case of her (by which I have undertaken to divine) how long her friend
had been sick, and she answered me, that he (but has forgot that she said
he) had not been very well a good while, from which answer I shall show both
the sex and the disease; for this word (He) shows me the sex, and these
words, Has not been very well a good while, show me that it is a Chronicall
disease, and how the party is affected: The latter part of her answer, namely,
A good while, show that it is a Chronicall disease; and the former part of the
words, namely, Has not been very well, do implie that the party lies not by
it, and that therefore he goes up and down, has no appetite to meat, is
faint in his body, does linger and pine as it were, is joylesse and
melancholicke, and takes no pleasure in any thing (as I told her before) and so
are all they that have not been very well a good while: But the woman never
dreams that I gather all this from her answer, because I look upon the
Urinall-case, but rather think that the Urinall infected the case, or else
that I can conjure: But let her think what she will, so that I conserve that
fame which I have got in the Pisse-pot Science, I care not: Yet this I am sure,
that she will think never the worse of me for being a conjurer. Imagine with
me, that she came but now in, and that (after my courteous entertainment of
her) I have but now taken the Urinall case of her, asked how long her friend
has been ^^cke, and received her answer, but that I presently pronounce the
same description of her friends disease that I have already showed you; at
which she wonders not a little; but I shall make her wonder more anon: And now
I add, that it is a man's water, to which she answers, that it is indeed. I
further ask her how old the party is, and according to her answer, as the
parties age shall agree with hers, I say that it is her husbands, at which she
mervailes more than at all the rest, and says that it is indeed: And now she
is ready to put finger in the eye, and asks me if he be not in a Consumption,
and tells me (for I did not name it) that he has a very great cough: She
asks me likewise if I do not perceive it; and I answer, yes I do perceive
it, or else befoole me while you will, and I will never be angry: And then I
tell her that this cough proceeded from his ill stomach (which I had named)
that sent a theume unto his head, which distilled down from thence upon his
lungs and caused the same. I now come nearer to the matter, and tell her that
her husband is inclining (and perhaps further entered than ever I shall be able
to recover him) into a Consumption: But yet I tell her that I hope he may be
recovered as yet, and that I will use the best means* that may be, to restore
him: I also ask her why she so long deferred coming to a Physician, and she
says, that her husband had thought to have worn it out, as they all think to
do: I now tell her that I fear there will be some danger, yet I will do
what can be done on my behalf, and that she must now defer no longer time,
if she love her husbands life: And now if she be not provided of another
husband already, and so come more to know how long she shall be troubled with
him, and to excuse her self (if he should chance to dye) than for any thing to
cure him, I must bethink my self of some Aurum potabile, some Liquor of life
of a great price, some Consumption powder of twenty or thirty shillings an
ounce, or some such receipt which no body has but my self) than the which non
datur majus secretum, there is not a greater secret in the world: And now if I
recover the man, he will think his purse to be in a Consumption, but I cannot
cure it there. But if this woman would have him dye, she will go home and tell
him that he is in a Consumption indeed, and will scarce recover: So now whereas
he went up and down before, walked abroad, and was sick but a little in jest,
he feels himself iller already with this message, and means to dye in good
earnest; and so betakes himself to his chamber, with a resolution to save his
purse, out of which he never comes till he be brought with his heels forward:
And thus was I cruelly haunted (at Canterbury) by a man to put him in comfort
of his wives more sudden departure than God had decreed, but she is yet
living, and (for ought that I know) may live to eat of that Goose that may
graze upon his Grave. I dare say that women come not short of that man* yet I
did never perceive that any woman ever brought me her husbands Urine for that
purpose; I will not therefore belie them, to make them worse than they are, for
they are (God amend them) bad enough of themselves already. I have therefore
done with this woman (for I suspect, for all her fained tears, that she came
to to that purpose) and have given her her errand, and sent her away, and she
(by this time) has given her husband his errand, and sent him the way of all
flesh, (who had he not trusted to his wife, and relied upon the sending of his
Piss in stead of sending for my self or some other learned Physician) might
have been a live man and have lived many a fair year: But you see what is
become of him, and (I hope) conceive what danger you put your lives in that
adventure to take Physic prescribed by the sight of the Urine only: I hope
likewise that you conceive by these few instances that I have already set
down, how a Physician (if I may so call him that uses such base fallacies to
back his pretended knowledge) may give judgment of Urines both in Acute and
Violent, or Chronicall and lingering diseases, and how handsomely your
Pisse-messengers are fob'd over: for I protest before God, that by these
fallacies, this deceitful juggling, and far worse shifts than any I have here
set down, has this base custom of giving judgment of diseases by the sight
of the Urine, been underpropped and supported, or else it had long ago been
abrogated, and fallen to the ground: For there is no knowledge of any disease
to be gathered by the Urine, sufficient to guide a Physician in the prescribing
of medicines to cure the same: (And yet (forsooth) such a base custom has
been upholden by most of our best Physicians, that (you bringing us your
Piss) we must tell you (though we do it merely by such fallacies as I have
showed you, or the like) what is the disease by it, and whether it be a man's or
a woman's water; as also, if it be the water of a woman-kinde, whether it be a
married woman's or a Maidens; and, if a married woman's, whether she be with
child or no; and, if with child, whether she shall bring forth a boy or a
girl, and when she conceived of it; and (I think too) whether she shall bring
forth a man or a monster: I can tell you one thing more (as well as any man in
the world can tell you any of these that I have named) by the water, if you be
as much desirous to know, as you are far to seek sometimes, and that is
this, namely who begot this child, whether your own husband or what other
man. But if women did believe as much (which they may as well as any of the
other) we should as often have half a piece, for being sent for to the women
kind, as have half a shilling sent us for casting their water. Nay the Maid
(that I spoke of) may chance to be but a cracked vessel and a supposed Virgin,
and has been toying with some fellovv or other, so far that she knevv not
how to back his putting forward, but has (she thinks but in jest) taken such
earnest for her Virginity, as has confirmed the sale of her chastity: Upon
consideration whereof, she now begins to grow malcontent, is queasie
stomached, troubled with a pain and swelling in her belly, and her ancles
are svvolne toward night; for which cause, her friends fear the Dropsy, or
some ill disease, and so send their Daughters water to a Doctor to cast, to
know what she ayleth; and if they have any jealousy of their Daughter, that
she has played at fast and loose, and played loose when she should have kept
fast, they think that a Doctor can tell how the knot slipped, and easily
resolve them of that doubt: But if we suspect and conceive it to be so indeed
by the tale of the messenger that brings this water, yet we dare not say that
this Maid is with child, for we know not the trouble and stir that might
come of it; but happily we say, Is this a Maids water? and then we say (if it
be) that she has a Tympanie (which is a Dropsy as her Parents feared) meaning
with two legs, which proves too true, and makes the messenger to call to
mind (when this Tympanie has more plainly discovered it self) that the
Doctor asked her if this were a Maids water; and then they surely think that
we could tell by the water; but yet we can tell no otherwise, than as I have
showed you before in giving judgment of women's Urines, and how we judge them
to be with child by their water; the which, women themselves might do (if
they would apply their hearts unto that wisdom that most properly concerned
them) by conferring with discreet women, or Midwives, who (if they could not
better tell by that secret examination of their bodies which they might make,
and by other observations, whether a women were with child or no, than any
Physician can do by the Urine,) were not worthy to exercise that function; So
they should not need to trouble a Physician (for that matter) but that they
love rather to be tampering with a man than with their own sex, and so might
save that groat (sent for casting their water to know whether they be with
child or (...)) to buy them a pound of Soap to make their Limon white: But the
woman is, so addicted to the man, that Midwives (I think) ere long will be
quite out of request, so that if some more of us Physicians (who are the most
proper and handsome handed men amongst us) do not tur^^ women-deliverers, our
brothers will be ouer-wrought; Sed (...) targere: But I will not now rub any
more upon this sore, for I have not now time to search it to the bottom, and
therefore I will let it a one until I may chance to rank it with the other
monopolized secrets of the met hodicall Abusers of the noble Profession of
Physic. And thus have I showed the fallacies and knavery (of all those,
whether Physicians or Quacks and Empiricks; who pretend knowledge of diseases
by the same) used in the giving judgment of an Urine: The which I have so
plainly showed that the most ignorant people may perceive how finely they are
flamm'd over, when they send their Piss to a Doctor to cast, and may collect
(for it is very true) that there is no certain knowledge of any disease to be
gathered from the Urine; but yet the nature of men is such that (being settled
in an opinion, though grounded merely upon errors and (...) they will hardly
be bearen from it by sound arguments and solid reasons and will rather embrace
and maintain falsehood (instead of truth) than be thought so weak as to have
been possibly deluded: I know for certain that it will hardly sink into many
of your heads, which I have written; because many Physicians, some Divines, and
other silenced Ministers who have turned Physicians (whose tender consciences
would not serve them to subscribe to the decent ceremonies of the Church) have
practiced these base fallacies, in giving judgment of Waters being brought unto
them: But (I hope) some of their waters will be better looked into, than to
be suffered to exercise two callings of such weight as are Divinity and
Physic: And (for mine own part) scare not though I be censured for going
about to overthrow this custom of giving judgment of diseases by the Urine,
the which I know I shall be; for I have already ejaculated something to this
purpose, and I find men so prepossessed with an opinion that the Urine is
sufficient to show a Physician the disease, sex, and conception, and the
like, so that very mechanics tell me that they have sent their waters unto
such and such Doctors, who have thereby told them their diseases directly: I
(says one) have sent my Wives water by my Maid (who is a cunning vvench, and
would not be deceived) to a young Dutch man a Doctor, who (they say) is the
most expert man, for his judgment in waters, in all the Town; and he has told
the Maid (by the water) how her Mistress has been affected in every respect,
and that she was with child, which proved true. To which I answer, that if the
Maid had no more wit than her Master, I could as easily cozen her as the
Dutchman did; and I do further affirm that the Dutchman is an Ass, the
Frenchman a Fool, and the Englishman a Knave, who pretends knowledge of
diseases by the Urine. I have likewise had some conference with some of better
breeding, and more knowing men, who (because they have been thus deluded by
their Physicians) do likewise believe that the Urine does show the disease
sufficiently of it self: And (to this purpose) says one, I have sent my water
unto such a Doctor with a Latin Epistle of two or three lines (not writing
how I was in any kind affected) and he has returned me an answer in very terse
Latin, and showed me truly how I was affected, and what was the cause of my
disease; and therefore certainly (says he) the Urine does show the disease:
To whom I answer, that he could pen no Epistle (though he do not write therein
how he is affected) from whence a Physician cannot collect something which
shows how he is affected, more than the Urine: and yet when he returns
his answer, he will therein implie that he perceives it by the Urine. For
examples sake I have here framed an Epistle from this Academian; (...) in such
terse Latin as he wrote) unto his Physician, for his judgment of his disease
by his Urine: I have likewise set down the Physicians Oracle or answer in some
of the very same words which this Gentleman said, that his Doctor vvrote
unto him: From whence you shall perceive that there is nothing but fallacy in
giving judgment of diseases by the Urine only.

WOrthy Master Doctor, I have sent you by this bearer, with these my Letters,
my water to view, which men call the discovere^ of diseases: I desire to
understand by your letters, what evil it threatens, and what kind of disease
it seems to betoken: view it therefore; and return me your opinion of it in
writing^ and what present infirmity or imminent danger it does foretell: as for
the cure of it, I shall take your advice; concerning that counsel which shall
be most convenient for it, when I have certified you (from mine own mouth)
what malady most afflicts me, and have showed you (if my Urine should conceal
it) what is the cause of it. In the mean time have a care of your own

fare-you-well.

Your most loving friend, R. K.


I confess that this Epistle does give a Physician very little light of the
disease, toward the pronouncing judgment of the same, yet not so little as
the Urine. I can draw no conclusion from the words thereof, because I penned
them my self. But from the circumstance of the words I gather these
particulars. First that there was acquaintance between you and your Doctor,
and that thereby he knew the complexion and constitution of your body, which
conferred much to the giving judgment of your Urine: otherwise (if there had
been no acquaintance between you) you would not have written unto him so
familiarly; secondly, you did but leviter ^^rotare, were but a little sickish
or ill at ease; or else you would not have been able to have written your
self for in a Violent disease (for the most part) men are in two or three
days so debilitated in their bodies, and disturbed in their senses, that they
cannot write: Thirdly, from the Urine arises this circumstance, that (as the
water seemed not to import a violent disease) it did not seem to import any
disease at all, save only that it was sent with your letters, to witness that
you were not well. Fourthly, I presume, that the messenger, whom you sent with
your Piss, could tell your Doctor (for I am sure he would demand that) that
you walked up and down, but were not very well: all which circumstances being
well considered and laid together, were light enough for your Physician to show
how you were affected. I doubt not, but that your Doctor knew well how to make
use of all such advantages, for else he would have been as lightly esteemed
of all men, as you would have esteemed him, if he had not told you (as you
think) your disease by your water. I will now pen his answer unto your
letters, and then I will show you the fallacies of them; wherein you shall
perceive, that the learned Clerks are not the wisest men, nor the craftiest
Pisse-prophets so honest as they should be.

Englished thus.

THE discerning and finding-out (most learned Sir) of diseases, by the sight of
the Urine only, is a matter of great difficulty: yet (as you desire me) I have
written unto you what I discern by your Urine. You are (as I conceive)
troubled with Rhume arising from your stomach unto your head, and from thence,
distilling again upon the lower parts: but what part it most oppresses, or
what place it affects, I cannot well tell; yet I have great suspicion that it
chiefly possesses your stomach, and that your stomach is nauseous and Ioaths
your meat, insomuch that you neither desire meat nor can digest it when you
have eaten it. Furthermore, your Spleen is ill affected by reason of the
impurity of your stomach; whereupon your heart and head are assaulted with a
tetrous vapor, so that you are melancholicke, and cannot take your rest, or at
least have very troublesome sleeps: your belly and hypochondres are oppressed
with wind: you seem also to be somewhat feverish. If I have omitted any thing
that I discern by your Urine, or that your Urine does not show, let me but
know it, and I will supply you with that advice which shall be most convenient
to profligate your disease, and to reduce you to your former health. I desire
and study your welfare, so farewell.

The most earnest Wisher of your health. H. C.


This Epistle (Master Doctor) has pleased your Patient, and you thereby have
purchased a great deal of honor: your Latin he understands well enough, but
the implied sense and meaning thereof he is not aware of, because he is not
acquainted with the mystery of giving judgment of a Pissepot: I will therefore
be so bold as to comment upon your Epistle, the better to help his
understanding, and then I leave him to his own Genius to retain or reject his
old opinion concerning judgment of diseases by the sight of the Urine.

And now (Master Doctor for your Epistle) you begin it thus, first you write,
That the discerning and finding out of diseases by the sight of the Urine
only, is a very difficult matter.

It is very true, Master Doctor, that you have said; it is a very difficult
matter (indeed) to find out diseases by the sight of the Urine only, but
these your words implie that it may be done, and that you your self have
arrived at the Haven of this knowledge, and that most other men have come far
short of it. Herein, Master Doctor, that which you implie is merely false;
for neither Hippocrates nor Galen, nor your self (who think not your self
inferior unto them) did ever attain unto this knowledge: but however you will
not be ashamed to assume and arrogate it unto your self (because it is put
upon you, and you can make a shift to delude such Novices,) and to derogate
what you can from other men: and this is very common to you with most other men
of our Profession. If you had written thus to your Patient (Sir it is
impossible to give true judgment of diseases by the sight of the Urine only,
which is but one of the many signs which together, with the knowledge of
diverse other Symptoms (which the Urine shows not, do determine the disease)
you had said but truth, and showed your self to have been an honest man. But
hang honesty, what care you for it? so that you carry the matter so fair, that
you be not caught in your knavery. You think, that if you had written so to
your Patient, he would have suspected your skill, and therefore you will
rather smother the truth to maintain this your pretended skill (though you be
conscious to your self that you are a Knave for your labor) than you will
have your skill questioned, though you have spoken truth, and therein played the
part of an honest man: for then you think you should likewise lose your
Patient.

Secondly, you say, That you have according to your Patients desire, written
unto him what you descerne by his Urine. To which I answer, that if the Urine
show you any thing, which I question much in such a case, you write a great
deal more than you perceive in the water, and that (if you will be an honest
man) you must often frustrate the desire and expectation of your Patients,
which you may do, and yet give them content too, if you carry the matter
discreetly.

Thirdly, Master Doctor, you write, That your Patient (as you conceive) is
troubled with Rhume arising from the stomach unto the head, and from thence
distilling again upon the lower parts; but what part it most oppresses, or
what place it affects, (which is most true, but yet there will be no notice
taken of these words) you know not.

I answer unto this, that you do not (from the water) gather this, but from
his complexion and constitution of body which you know and are acquainted
vvithall: for neither does any Urine so certainly betoken either Phlegm,
Rhume, Choler, or Melancholy, but that (by reason of the diverse variations that
it is subject unto) it may (falsely) pretend any of these humors to be
predominant, and so be far distant from the conjecturall and probable Canons
of the Pisse-pot-science: but admit, Master Doctor, that this Urine had been
brought you from a Stranger, whose constitution you had not known, I presume
that you would have enquired very narrowly what constitution of body the sick
party had been of, whether a lean spare, a gross and fat man, or of a middle
temperature and habit of body, as also how long he had been sick, and whether
he went up and down or no, before you pronounce your judgment of the Urine:
and then, if it chance to be true that you speak or write, you can make him
believe, that you perceive it by the Urine; but if it be false, that you have
said, you can make it good.

Fourthly, Master Doctor, you write, That you have a great suspicion (which is
a word that might call you judgment into suspicion, but that your Patient is
very confident of your skill, and therefore he will give it a favorable
construction) that this Rhume did chiefly possess his stomach, and that his
stomach was now become nauseous and loathed meat, and did not digest it being
eaten: and your Patient believes that you perceive his stomach is possessed
with this humor, and that you perceive also by it that his stomach is
nauseous, desires not meat, nor digests it being eaten: but here, Master
Doctor, you are too cunning for him; he writes unto you for your judgment of
his Urine, and you are afraid, that if you do not satisfy his desire, he will
seek advice somewhere else: you therefore think that you were as good deceive
him as another man. You read his Letters, and they only desire your judgment
of his Urine, but do not show you any thing how he is affected: you look upon
his water, and that imports no disease at all: you tell the messenger looking
upon the water (as if you there perceived it) that he goes up and down, and
the messenger answers that he does. You likewise know his constitution to be
spare and thin, and what humor is predominant in the complexion and
temperature of the same. You take all these into consideration: and first
collect that he is not very well, because he has sent unto you his Urine; and
desires your advice of it: Secondly, you conceive that he is not very ill,
because he walks up and down, and his Urine does not import any disease at
all. Thirdly, you know his complexion to be (for so I suppose it) Phlegmatic.
And now you conclude (he neither being sick nor well, and his complexion
Phlegmatic) that he cannot have a good stomach to his meat, and therefore you
determine the cause of his sickness to be Phlegm in the stomach: so you write
unto him that he is troubled with Rhume in the stomach rising from thence, and
distilling down thither again, caused nauseousnesse, and want of appetite and
digestion, and your Patient thinks you perceive all these things by his Urine:
never dreaming that you collect from the forenamed circumstances (namely his
complexion, his going up and down, and his Urine not importing any disease)
that he was troubled with Rhume in the stomch; nor once imagining that you add
the nauseousnesse of his stomach, want of appetite and digestion, as consequent
effects of this precedent cause (Phlegm in the stomach) but thinks that you
perceive them all severally in the water: whereas indeed, you perceive none of
them at all*

Fifthly, Master Doctor, you add, That your Patients Spleen is ill affected
by reason of the impurity of his stomach: and he thinks likewise that you
perceive this in his water: if his Spleen be not ill affected at all, yet he
will think it to be, because you say so: and if it be ill affected, it is not
to be discerned in the Urine, but is (you well know) Cacochymiae soboles, the
offspring of impurity, which follows (very) often crudity of stomach.

Sixthly, You further add, that his head and vital parts are assaulted with a
noxious vapor proceeding from his Spleem, which makes him sad, and that he
cannot take his rest, or at least that his sleeps are very troublesome, he
still thinks that his water shows all this, not knowing that these are
necessary consequences of a crude stomach and a Rheumatick constitution: he
never considers, Master Doctor, (as you do) that those that are on the
sudden distempered (though they be but a little ill) do not take their rest,
or at lest have troublesome sleep: but thinks that the Urine (according to the
several parts of it) does show the disease of the several parts of the body:
he therefore thinks, that the Circle shows the discases of the head, the Center
of the truncke or middle part of the body, and the lower part the diseases of
the lower parts of the body: and so by consequence the disease of the Toe is to
be found in the very lowest part of the Urine; but the pains in the head or
Toes, are neither to be perceived by the upper-most or lower-most part of the
Urine nor by any other part of it. Yet a silenced Minister in Kent, who was
become an Aesculapius, being asked by a friend of mine (when he had, by this
fallacious way of giving judgment upon an Urine, reckoned up a Pain in the
head, amongst other Symptoms) whether he perceived by the Urine, that the
party had a pain in the head, he answered, yes: look you here (quoth he) this
Circle or Ring, by some marks that I perceive in it, does show me that the
party has a pain in the head. He might as well have worn the Surplice, and
baptized with the Cross, against his conscience, as to make a common practice
of lying against his conscience wilfully.

Seventhly, You add that he is troubled with wind in the belly and
Hypochondres; which is like-wise incident to Phlegmatic constitutions, but is
not (as he supposes) to be perceived in the Urine.

Eighthly, You add that he seems to be somewhat feverish: you do not
perceive this in the water neither, yet you know that whosoever is not well
does (vel febre laborare, vel sebricitare) labor either of a Fever, or is
feverish; and therefore you have added this to help at a pinch, for you know
not certainly, but that his feverishnesse may be greater than you suspect: his
heat may be such, as that he may expect that you speak something of his Liver,
for he thinks that it is over-hot; but you can tell him that he cannot have
a Fever, but that his Liver must be inflamed. In fine (Master Doctor) whether
he he have a Fever or no Fever, you have hit the nail on the head, and he
believes that you have written nothing but what you perceived in the water; but
if it please him to read an exposition upon your Letters, he shall perceive
your cunning to be (vix frans honesta) scarce honest cozening. You determined
his disease (as he told me) to be Flatus Hypochandriacus, when you saw him,
that is, wind in those parts called the Hypochondres: but it was (as he
confessed to me) Flatus Hypochondrunckicus, or (as I think I may fitly call
it) the drunken Hiquet, ex crapula contractus, taken by a drunken surfeite. It
skills not what his disease was, nor how he took it; I do not mean to
scandal him for it, since he is recovered of it; I rather bestow this Recipe
upon him, by the way of prevention, (Noli tu peccare ampli^us, ne Pejus tibi
contingat) that he fall not into the like infirmity: and wish withal my heart,
ut valeat and resipiscat, that he may enjoy his health with that greater
happiness of that wisdom, whereby he may rectum distinguere falso, discern
truth from falsehood.

CHAP. X.
I have here inserted another Epistle (out not in Latin) from a Revealed
Divine, unto his cunning Ae^culapius, for his judgment of his wives Urine, to
know whether she were with child or no: I have likewise set down the Doctors
answer, with an explication of the Aenigmatized fallacies, therein contained,
darking the judgment of the learned, and making a specious show of a falsely
assumed knowledge.

WOrthy Master Doctor, my kind love salutes you etc. My wife being neither
sick nor well, goes up and down the house, but is very puling: she has a
very, nauseous stomach, loathes meat, and if she eat any thing (which is very
little, or of some very strange dish) she is ready to vomit it up again: she
has now twice missed (which she orderly enjoyed before) the natural benefit
of her monthly evacuation: ever since which time, that she had them last, she
has been thus ill: and for the same cause, that she has missed them, she
suspects that she may be with child, or else is thus ill for want of them: I
have here sent you her Urine, and desire you to vouchsafe to look upon it, and
to resolve us whether she be with child, or what other infirmity she does
labor of, that we may (if she ^e not with child) prevent a worse danger in
^^me; I pr^y return your answer in writing; and ^o with my best wishes for
your own welfare, that others may fare the better for you, I bid you
farewell, and rest.

Your wel-wishing friend, J. H.


REverend Sir, my best respects to your self and your wife, do kindly resalute
you both: your wife (you write) is neither sick nor well; you may then shife
your hands of her, if you do not like sir, and tell her that you promised only
to keep her in sickness and in health: but however (good Sir) I am sorry, as
she is not sick, that she is not well, but not so much as otherwise I should
be, because your kindness has caused this neutrality of being neither sick
nor well. Her nauseousnesse of stomach, loathing of meat, and vomitting after,
it will ^^ortly cease, and the disease (which now troubles her stomach) will
some seven months hence, be gotten into her arms. In the mean time it were
not amiss for her to take something to corroborate her stomach, which she may
very safely do, I have viewed her water, and can say no more than have done,
unless to speak more plainly. I say with an (...) she is with child, and that
almost a quarter gone, God send her a happy deliverance, when the time shall
come, and (till then, and ever) health, and so prays,

Your assured loving friend, H. P.


This good Divine (as most of them are) is one who is possessed with this
opinion, that the Urine does show the disease, (...) conception, and the like:
yet happily has heard that Vrina (...) meratrix, the Water is a lying Harlot,
but yet he thinks that a Physician (if he be his crafts master) can tell
whether a woman be with child or no^ because he hears women clatter such
things who have been thus deluded. He never stands to examine the truth of
such predictions by the Urine, but supposes that men are or should be honest
in their callings. This I am sure of, that he is a loving man to his wife, for
which I think him to be the honester man. He has sent her Urine to a
Doctor, and desires him to resolve him from thence whether she be with child
or no^ or what other danger may be imminent. He writes likewise, very
punctual and carefully, how she is affected: namely, that she has a nauseous
stomach, loathes meat, longs after trifles, and is apt to vomit after she has
eaten: now all these are evident signs of Conception, if she be a
childing-woman, and they do agree with other signs also, and if she find any
such alteration in her body* as that she suspect the same: he likewise adds,
that she has not had her monthly benefit of nature, now this two months, which
she enjoyed orderly before: and this witnesses very strongly to the former
signs that she is with child, and shows how long it is since she conceived of
it: but the goodman (though he have read this in Aristotle, and Albertus) (...)
think that this is all the ground we have to conclude woman to be with child,
but thinks that Hippocrates and Galen, and the common practice of viewing of
waters, have taught us otherwise to distinguish the Sex, as also whether a
woman be with child or no, by her water: but (good man) he is deceived; and
which is worst of all, he has partly deceived himself, for he has written
that unto his Doctor (though he do not know it) that shows his wife to be
with child, and yet he desires to be resolved from the water; and so his
Doctor has done: he has read his Letters, and therein finds enough to his
purpose, and a great deal more than the Urine shows, from whence he may
boldly pronounce her to be with child, though he never look upon the water at
all: yet (having read the Letters) he takes the Urine, and before the
messenger that brought it) falls to peering into it, to seem to find that
there, for which he has brought it: and so he betakes him to his pen and ink,
to answer these Letters, and (having descanted upon the former part of the
Divines Letters, in such manner as you see in his answer, which showed him that
the good Gentlewoman was with child) he now determines her to be with child,
and that almost a quarter gone: which prooving true, as it is very probable
that it will, makes them the more admire this unsuspected juggling: for they are
not aware that the sudden ceasing of the natural monthly benefit of a woman,
together with nauseousnesse of stomach, longing (...) trifles, want of
appetite, and vomiting after meat, are the most infallible signs of Conception
by which we judge a woman to be with child, as indeed they are neither do they
observe, that it is the most apt time for a woman to conceive immediately after
that she has enjoyed that natural benefit, as their Doctor does: nor they
do not conceive that the Doctor determines her to be a quarter gone with
child, from the time that she enjoyed her natural benefit last, which (as her
husband writes) was now more than two months ago, which is almost a quarter,
for two months is almost ten weeks, and ten weeks is a quarter of the time
that a woman goes with child from her conception according to the common
computation of a woman's going forty weeks with child but they good man and
good-woman, think (as almost all the world beside themselves does) that the
Dr. perceives, by some signs in the Urine, the conception, as also how far a
woman is gone with child: and the Dr. is very well contented that they should
think so: but whatsoever they think you see what they are but fools) for
their labor, and their Dr. but a Jugler at the best, for nursing them up in
that false opinion. And now I hope that you conceive that there is no certain
knowledge of any disease in the world by the Urine, much less of the (...),
Conception, parties age, and the like: you perceive likewise the fallacies
whereby the Water-Prophet makes the messenger to think that he perceives all
these things in the Urine. You (...) also that not only the rude multitude,
(...) Clerks have been made both Greek fools, and Hebrew Asses, by (...), and
these deceitful fallacies which I have showed: yet these are not all the
tricks, and fallacies that Pisse-mongers have to deceive their Patients, or
Pisse-messengers withal: but by these you may perceive how you may be a
thousand ways more deceived; for by a little may be perceived what more is
meant, and according to the old Proverb, Verbum sapienti sufficit, to the wise
few words suffice. Let this therefore suffice, that has been spoken, to show
you how you are cozened, when you bring or send your water to a Doctor to
cast: and from hence learn to esteem an honest plaine-dealing Physician,
according to his worth, who tells you that the water does not show the disease,
as you suppose, and the common Pisse-pot-casters do make you believe.

CHAP. XI.
Wherein, (...) how judgment of diseases by the (...) of the Urine has been
upheld by confederacy, and other such like cozening tricks.

AND now to add more credit unto that which has been already said (although I
have said more already than some would willingly hear, though no more than
truth, and yet so much as might satisfy concerning the imposture and cozenage
used in giving judgment of diseases by the sight of Urine only,) I will
briefly subjoyn some few sleights of confederacy, and other cunning tricks,
whereby imposturs have beguiled the common people, and gained themselves
credit, in maintaining the cozening Trade of Water-prophesying. What
Confederacy is with whom this Confederacy is commonly made.
Now this confederacy is a plot or mutual compact made betwixt the
Pisse-prophet and some servant (whether man or maid) or some other of his
family, whom he has deputed to that office, or else some Nurse, Midwife,
Apothecary, or such like, who first set upon the messenger being come to the
Doctors house telling them that the Doctor is not yet at leisure, and so fall
to parley with the messengers, getting out of them all things necessary to the
judging of the disease (as namely whose water it was, when the party was taken
sick, and what other grievances the party labored of) and then went or
rather sent (...) ^ther that stood by (who seemed to take no not (...) of that
which the messenger said to the inquisitour) to see if the Doctor were at
leisure to speak with the messenger, who is in very great haste to be gone: Now
this by-stander tells the Doctor (whose business was not so great, but that he
might have come and dispatched the messenger at first, if his skill in Urine
had been as good as he pretends, and is presumed upon by such as he thus
gulleth) all that the messenger had related, who now comes forth and takes the
Urine, and tells the messenger that the party is thus and thus affected, as
his confederate had told him, which makes the (...) messenger to think that he
is a cunning man (...) the judgment of Urines. And thus the Parson of Caverley
was wont to deceive his patients, (...) of this cozenage by confederacy.
and so gained the name of a cunning man; too many such Parsons and persons are
suffered to abuse the common people in our days. Others have their
Apothecaries or other attenders upon sick persons, for their intelligencers,
who come beforehand, and tell them that such a one is thus and thus affected,
and has been thus long sick (and has happily taken such or such means
already) who means to send his Urine for his advice; I hope now the Doctor
is provided to tell whose water it is, what is the disease, how long the
party has been sick, nay and what Physic the party has taken; Another
Dunce in Essex famous for this imposture. That by this cozening he determines
the conception, sex in the womb, and tells what Physic the party has taken.
as uses a juggling Dunce in Essex (who has gained by (...) and the like
knavish plots of confederac^^ (...) credit than is (...) such an illiterate
(...) as he is) who presumes to determine the conception to a day, the sex in
the womb, the place where the party lives, and what Physic the party has
already takes, with so many other such knavish absurd cozenages, as I have not
time, and should (if time did permit) be ashamed to relate. A learned Doctor,
a much honored friend of mine, told me that a Nobleman (a Patient of his)
told him that he would undertake that this Jugler would tell by the Urine what
Physic the party had (...): That he determines a man to have a pain in his
right kidney (...) done but by confederacy.
And a Doctor of the Civil Law told me that he went as a stranger to him (as
he thought) and carried him his Urine, who so soon as he saw it, told him
that he had a pain in his right kidney, the which (as the Civilian told me)
was true, but yet that the Physicianer perceived it in his Urine was a lie; I
dare say that all learned Physicians will swear as much. This therefore must
needs be done by confederacy, or else he had some accidental intelligence
thereof by hearing himself speak of such a thing long before, or else by
hearing some body else to speak of it, which is little better than
confederacy. Such advantages are often made use of, for most people are (when
they come in company with a Physician) telling of their infirmities, which they
be often subject unto, and Physicians take more notice thereof than they are
aware of, and remember to make use thereof when occasion shall serve: Besides
(...), that Physicians have that live in great (...) Towns, and have much
Country practice, whereby they come to know the disease, as also how long the
party has been (...) without the sight of the Urine, and that is this,
Another trick (not much unlike to confederacy) by which we come to know
whose water it is, and the like, and may make the messenger believe the water
shows us.
They never have any Urine brought out of the Country but that (so soon as
they have dispatched the messenger) they ask if any body else be sick in
their Parish or near about them; and so are often told that such or such have
been thus long sick, and after what manner, and that they do mean to send to
them very shortly; so that now they need to do no more but ask the messenger
where he dwells, but that he knows the disease without looking upon the
Urine, and can say (that this is such a ones, Urine) as does the forenamed
Jugler, and the party is, thus or thus affected, although the Urine do not
show it. By this confederacy has much people been much deceived, and many
ignorant Rascals have got much credit, who have accommodated themselves to the
humouring of the vulgar people and such as have not been able to discern the
fucus or cloak of their cozenage; but I hope that henceforward it will appear
more plainly unto them, by this little which has been said to that purpose, so
that I shall not need to enlarge my self any further hereupon, for then I
should swell this small Pamphlet unto a large volume. Read it therefore and
make (...) that end it was penned, viz. ((...) evites) not to cozen, (...) avoid
the cozener. And so I will now proceed to show you the lawful use of the Urine.

CHAP. XII.
That there is no judgment of diseases to be given by the Urine alone; that
the Physician ought not to give judgment of the Urine, before he have
strictly examined how the sick party is affected: how this base custom came
up.

YOu will now ask me: Obi^^. Answ.
What is there no use of viewing the Urine at all? I answer no: there is no use
of viewing it alone without the consideration of other signs, symptoms and
indications of diseases, which are not therein perceived: neither can a
Physician prescribe Physic (by the sight of the Urine) with less danger,
than if (it being granted that purging would cure, and blood-letting would kill
his Patient) he should notwithstanding cast cross and pile which of these he
should appoint. You will further object, Another Object. Answ.
that you suppose that a Physician will not prescribe before he have examined
all circumstances needful for him to know. I answer, that no messenger can
tell us that in all diseases; though (oftentimes) in many cases they can. Nay
oftentimes they can not certify us any thing how the party is affected; but
(with the very hazard of their (...)) expect that we should tell them what they
(...) by the sight of their Urine alone, and prescribe them Physic
accordingly. But let such messengers learn to give their Physicians better
instructions, or stay at home, unless the Patient be contented to put his life
upon such a desperate chance. Another Object.
You will further object, that every one is not able to undergo the charge of
sending for a Physician: and then what shall they do, if it be not convenient
to send their water? Answ.
To this I answer, that it is true, that every one is not able to reward a
Physician (especially in the country) for coming to see him: Let therefore
such an one send for his Minister (who is of duty bound to do it) to ask his
counsel unto what Physician to send, and entreat him likewise to write how he
is affected, what age the party is of, of what sex, of what constitution of
body, the strength of it at this present time, when the party was taken sick,
and what other unusual symptoms the party now labors of: as whether he
have a vomiting or looseness, or be extremely bound in his body, and how
long it is since he was at stool; as likewise whether he have a cough, or
stitch, or can take rest or no, or bleed or sweat, or be grievously pained in
the body, and where the pain lies; or whatsoever passion he suffers: And
then (on Gods Name) let them also send their Urine to a Physician. And let the
Physician (before that ever he vouchsafe to look upon the water) strictly
examine all those, or the like circumstances that I have named: Then let him
take the Water and look upon it, and pronounce the disease: But if he take the
water, and begin to pronounce a description of a disease by the sight of the
Urine alone, before he have examined those circumstances; he makes but a fool
of thee, and is (for his labor) but an impostour, and a knave himself. I had
not thought that this imposture had crept into this City, or been connived at
by those that have power to suppress it: But here it is so exercised, that
some refuse to be informed of those circumstances (to the end that they may
purchase the more fame) till they have showed their juggling skill upon the
Urine. A friend of mine told me (very lately) that he carried his Urine unto a
Dutch Doctor (naming the man) to have his judgment of it: Now this man was so
faint and weak, that he was feign to rest himself three or four times by the
way, and had his disease written more manifestly in his face than in his water;
and now being arrived at the Doctors house, and admitted unto his presence, he
begins to tell the Doctor that he had nor been very well (which the Doctor
perceived very well by his countenance) a good while, and that he had made hard
shift to come unto him; and was ready, presenting him his Urine withal, to
declare unto him further how he had been affected; but this Butter-box
interrupted him, saying, I pray forbear to tell me any thing, yet I will tell
you your disease by your water: Was this (think you) an hard matter to do, to
tell the Gentleman (whose sickness was written in his forehead, who had told
the Doctor that he had not been very well a good while, and whose complexion
and constitution of body showed the Doctor what diseases he was most subject
unto) what was his disease? He might have done that without the Urine,
though his Patient had said no more unto him: Yet to show his Uromanticke
skill to the end that his fame may be the more spread for the same, he takes
the Urine (though he discern no disease by the same) and pronounces his
opinion from it. I hope you will (in time) perceive your own errors, and
their juggling who pretend knowledge of diseases by the Urine; and so I have
done with this juggling. I should now answer another objection, and question;
Object.
and they are these, That it may be that I plead for the Physicians profit, to
overthrow the judgment of Urines, that our fees may grow the greater for being
sent for: Answ.
To this I answer, Let their moneys perish with them that think so, rather
than I would be enriched by it. The question is this, Quest.
How this custom of giving judgment of diseases by it (since it shows no
disease certainly) came up: Answ.
To this I answer, That covetousness in the common people, to save their money
(because they saw Physicians to view the water at the Patients (...) house)
caused them to send their waters likewise unto Physicians: And Pride in the
Physicians, to show more skill than ever they had learned out of their Master
Hippocrates, made this to become a custom, which is become a very strong Plea.
I could show how this custom might be as soon abrogated; but since I have no
power to put it into execution, I leave it to them (whose power insufficient to
suppress it) if their care were correspondent. I will now show you your
errors in the choice and change of your Physician, and give you some few
directions for the choice of the most convenient Physician, for most men in
their several places and callings, and according to their several abilities.

CHAP. XIII.
Errors committed in the choice and change of a Physician: Directions how to
avoid these errors: Some Rascals nominated, who are usurpers upon, and
abusers of the noble profession of Physic, and the honorable Professors
thereof.

THE errors that you commit in the choice of a Physician, are these: Either you
choose an insufficient man, for his knowledge in Physic; or else one, who
(though he be sufficiently qualified for his knowledge) is notwithstanding no
fit Physician for thee. For the first, you are in the time of your sickness
led either by your own fancy or by the persuasion of some friend to send for,
or send unto such a man, who has (they tell you) cured such a one of such a
disease, when all other Doctors had given him over: or else because he gives
out some great matters of himself, and disableth all other honest learned
Physicians, as does Trigge, alias, Markham, who predicates of himself to
ignorant people, that he was Bachelor of Arts in Clare Hall, and Pupil and
kinsman unto Doctor Butler in Cambridge, a Master of Arts of Saint John's in
Cambridge, a Master of an Hospital, and one of the Fellows of the College of
the Physicians in London, and all these lies: for he never was otherwise than
a Shoemaker, bred and brought up, save only that he became a Last-maker; and
is no other but an Ass (though he pretends great learning amongst silly
people) who understands not one word of Latin. This Trigge lives in a place
called Captain Royden his lodgings over against the Custom House* Such
another is Butler of Puddle Wharfe, a Glover, Felmonger, or Sheep-skin-dresser,
who should therefore be the better acquainted with the virtue of Aesipus,
because it belongs to his Trade; but yet I dare say he knows not what it is.
Such another is little Doctor George another Shoemaker, living about
Westminster. And one Fashions an Horne-merchant, who furnishes Apothecaries
with Harts-hornes, and Stagges pis^es, and professes great skill in curing
Consumptions. To whom may be added Donnigton in Moore-fields, who drencheth
Asses (I do not mean the long eared ones as familiarly as he was wont to
drench Horses, and burns children behind the ears for the Rickets. Unto such
Knaves, or else to Witches and Conjurers (whom you term Cunning men and women)
you are carried (though they are the most vile and base ignorant Asses in the
world) with more confidence than to the most learned honest Physician that can
be. And then if you chance to recover, you impute the cause thereof to such a
Rascal, never considering that it was Gods providence not (as yet) to take
this party unto himself, and that this rascally Quack (for medicines used by
an ignorant Quacke, are said to be poisons; but being used by a skillful
Physician, they are said to be Gods own helping hand) did not kill this
party, for it was (as they say) but haphazard. But if it happen that one of
these Rascals kill his Patient (for so it falls out too often) and some of
your neighbors or friends question with you, Why you made use of such a Rogue;
you are then as ready (to excuse your own foolery and wickedness) to excuse
him too, and to say that the best Doctors cannot save a man's life when his
time is come: and you think this is a sufficient plea to excuse your selves
for not using the best means: You will not afford an honest man the like
favor, who has used the best means that Art could lead him unto, if his
patient should chance to dye, and satisfy yourselves (as you ought to do) in
this case, that it was Gods providence, but prosecute him with all the
scandalls, and slanders that you can, questioning withal his skill, the which
you are no more able to judge of than a blind man of colors. So much shall
suffice to have spoken concerning the errors you commit in making choice of
such a one, for your Physician, who has not been lawfully called thereunto,
nor is sufficiently qualified with that knowledge, Who are not to be chosen,
although they be able.
and those Arts that necessarily conduce unto the making of a Physician. Now
you err likewise in making choice of an able man, when you make choice of the
Kings or Queens Physician, who for their sufficiency, it is not to be doubted
but that they are skillfull men: but yet, in respect of their attendance at the
Court, and their much employment by persons of great quality, they are not the
best Physicians for persons of mean condition; for they cannot give that due
attendance unto such a Patient as his present necessity might require: Neither
can you obtain his presence when it is most desired: And then you are
constrained to call another, who (in respect that he knows not what has
formerly passed about the sick party) knows not what to prescribe without
error on his own part, and danger to the sick party.

You err likewise, when (being destitute of acquaintance with some able and
convenient Physician for you) you make choice of a Physician by the garb, and
habit wherewith he is accoutred; that is to say, his Beaver-Hat, his
Plush-suite, with his cloak of, or at least, lined through with the same, his
silk stockings, with all other such suitable ornaments to deck his person:
thinking that there dwells Art alone, knowledge, and the Muses, because he is
mounted upon the wings of Fame, which is no less mendacious and deceiptfull
than an Harlot, or there Pisse-pot; the one whereof faineth diseases, the other
modesty. You err likewise, when (having happily made choice of an able and
convenient Physician) you cast him off, because you do not presently obtain
the sudden effect of the desired success. What Physicians are to be chosen.
But now to avoid the errors of making choice of an insufficient, or
inconvenient Physician; Leave Trigge, and little Doctor George to their A^le,
and (Ne suitor ultra crepidem) let the Shoemaker not presume to go beyond his
Last; Et Artem, quam quisque ^orit exerceat: Let every other man exercise that
Art and faculty which he understands, and has been bred up in: and let mean
people, let Kings and Queens Physicians alone, for those great personages whom
they are to give attendance upon, and listen unto me a little, in directing
thee in the choice of an able and convenient Physician in the time of a violent
and dangerous sickness. Take therefore, (and that in time) such a Physician as
is authorized and allowed, either by the Universities, or by the learned
College of Physicians of London: In the choice of such a one, who is so allowed
and approved of, have some respect unto his dwelling, and other employments;
and consider with thy self whether by remoteness of place, or multitude of
imploiments, he can give that attendance, that thy need may require. For in
diseases of danger, it were very convenient that the Physician did see his
Patient, (if it were possible) three times in a day: so he should often
observe something or other in the sick party, that might divert him from his
intended purpose, and direct him a safer way. Wherefore an honest neighbor is
more convenient than a stranger remote, especially for the meaner sort of
people, and those who are so poor, that their purses will not reach to the
gratifying of a Physician for coming to see them with a fee: and let no man
shake off that Physician whom he has first entertained; but let him (if he
please) take another Physician, or more into consultation with hi^ first
elected Physician, retaining him still. Let this (in brief) suffice to direct
in the choice of a Physician, for I had no purpose to touch upon this subject,
but only to show the fallacies and juggling, that is used in giving judgment of
diseases by the Urine, with the dangers that insuethe prescribing of Physic
by the sight of the same alone. If I have not therefore satisfied thee in this
latter, read Doctor Cotta his book, called, A short discovery of the
unobserved dangers of several sorts of ignorant and inconsiderate
practitioners of Physic in England, wherein he has (at the latter end) very
learnedly set down a description of the true Artist, with directions for the
Election of him in the time of sickness.
