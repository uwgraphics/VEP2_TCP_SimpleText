An Enuoye from Thomas Smyth upon thaunswer of one. W. G. Lurkyng in Lorrells
Den / for fear men should him see.
Whether I troll here, or troll there, I will so troll about
That in my trollynge, I do trust, as you are, to trolle you out.
Now with no less salutacyon, that to such does pertayne
Unto you I do present, this little poor treatise
Willing you to understand, and also to know plain
I have received, your lewd lybell, wherein you enterprise
Both me and my doings, full proudely to despise
But babble what you list / it skylleth not a whyt
Remember well this word, hereafter comes not yet.
You ruffle, and you rail, for malice and despyte
And as a ragynge ruffyen / your self you do show plain
For as much as you be grieved, with that, that I did write
Which I will never deny, but throughlye maintain
Yet (as you write) in one point, you have cause to complain
For that I spoke but of lykelyhod / and went but by guess
Of the treson in your heart / you knowing there no less.
If with the point of my pen, I do you so spur and prycke
That thereby you be grieved and greatly styrred to ire
Yet doubt I not to sit sure / all though you wynche and kycke
Fast closed in my dewty / to save me from the mire
But in your flynges take heed, beware I say the fire
Or some other galtrope / take this proverb for a token
The pot so often goes forth / at last it comes home broken.
You are angry that I my self / so openly declare
My name plainly dyscrybynge, and of my service the pyth
All honest men thynk, I should no less, wherefore I ne care
Though mad malice move you / to be despyted therewith
Hit have plesed you, to compare, the cobbler with the smyth
Your proud skorne wherein / is easy enough to be found
Yet better is a cobbler than an ydell vagabounde.
In opening my name and service / this was mine entente
In case that for my doings, I were thought worthy blame
Any other person gyltles therefore should not be shente
Consydred (as is well known) many be of my name
Mine office therefore I added / and thought therein no shame
Nether bragging, nor bostynge / as to my charge you lay
Who is naught himself / so judges in others always.
A true man shameth never, to show his name and face
A thief him self mystrusteth and is evermore in doubt
Lest that his lewd living / should present it self in place
As commenly it is seen / at lenght troth is tried out
So in likewise you / do seek all corners round about
But it woll not help you, though a while there be delay
Time shall try your color, be it russet, black / or graye.
Of rumblynge in scryptures / you do me much reprove
Well if your wits do serve you / my doings to amend
Come forth and show your face / as to honestye does behoue
And lay unto my charge / what you can reprehende
Nay / nay / I am sure, you do it lest intend
In raylynge is your ruff, in your spelunke when ye sit
But remember well this word / hereafter comes not yet.
^^ysely you council me / to some taylour to resort
^^nge out of scripture / my text the better to frame
^ot hyde your sect / nor yet your brotherly sort
(...) for the devil) you show your self the same
^urs / Cobblers / and Tylers / doctous of worthy fame
^des / Ruffyens / and others / amongs whom you ring your bell
(...) like as you be / so set you forth your council.
^rynge in your boldness / you would your self a traitor prove
(...) only pretens of my most desired fall
^ntenans of popery / you say I do most love
(...) if you know true / than a traitor I may you call
(...) your concelement but I woll drive you to the trial
(...) doings shall appear / though deferred for a space
(...). W. G. I dare well show my face
^est of your raylynges / I woll as now omyte
(...) the purpose penysshe my time I woll not spend
(...) naught / but declare ^ the lewd use of your wit
^at malice of heart toward other you pretend
^e no another buckler / wherewith your self to defend
^uketh your sect / or would refourme your heresye
(...) you stray^e he is a mayntaynour of popery.
(...) though you would hyde yourselfs / yet men may easily know
^yned hertes you do bear to God and our good King
^e has ordained laws / which clean to overthrow
(...) auayll is daily taken / to euydent is the thing
^lde beware your sect for surely you would feign bring
(...) ^ther to rain over us if you wyste / by what shyfte
(...) ^e we have / hereof / Read of king Henry the fyfte
^^e may we plainly find / what a detestable sort
(...) feigned hertes / against their king did rise,
^nge to chose another king / that would them supporte
^r naughtye errors and mayntaynaunce of heresies
(...) (who of his grace) ever prouydeth for his
^che knowledge thereof / that they had not their entente
^fled / some taken / some were hanged on the gallows and burnt.
^che thing I do desire / all true subjects to regard
(...) god and our good king / to bear a due obedience
^ll false feigned hertes / I wish the same reward
^^ke as thothers had / worthily / for their offense
(...) we sit. W.G. mark well this sentence
^er that as you be / so have you used your wit
^berr well this word / here after comes not yet.
(...) adventure sir. W.G. you will yet brag and boste
(...) from the scripturs you have driven me clean a way
(...) ^e therein when you dare / you shall come to your cost
^h for cause consyderable / a while I do little say
^e to ride you with a byt / shall drive you from your play
^se you hold down your head / that feign you would bear a loft
^woll so tramell your heles / your pace shall be more soft.
(...) for an end (Eternal God) I beseech the grant long life
^sperous contynuans / to Henry our most noble king
^^theryne our Queen also / his most Laufull Wife
^nte between them both / like other branches to spring
^warde our Prince) that most odor^ferous thing
(...) them long together Lord / and grant them all the bliss
^ngels incessantly / sing (Gloria in excelsis) Amen.
God save the King.
^^ether I trolle here, or trolle there, I will so trolle about
(...) my trollynge I do trust, as you are, to trolle you out
^^e self same person, who not withstanding your despyte
^^eth not, nor shrynketh not plainly him self to write
(...) Smyth, se^uant to the Kings Royal Majesty
Clerk of the Queen's graces counsel (though most unworthy)
Finis.
