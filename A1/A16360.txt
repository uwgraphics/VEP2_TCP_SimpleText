A devout Epistle or Treatise for them that been tymorouse and fearful in
Conscience which Treatise if yt be well red over and folowyd will bring the
Reders out of all Scrupulosyte of Conscience and seruyle fear / and bring
them to the holy fear and Love of almighty God. Co^pyled by a brother of Syon
(Called wyllyam Bond a Bacheler of Diuynite) on whose soul Jesus have mercy.
And sent to a deuote Relygiouse woman of Denney. At ye Instance of one of her
spu^all friends. And by that same friend ouerseen / and divided in to.xx.
Chapitres, to the more comfort of the Reders. And yt may be called the
Co^solatori of Timorouse and fearful Consciencys.

A Preamble or Introduccion in to this Treatise and of what thing he entendyth
to speak of. The first Chapitre.
Devout Spouse of Jesus christ. Our lord ever preserve you in his marcy / and
increase his grace in your soul so to proceed from verteu to verteu in this
our paynfull pilgrimage: that like as now ye be spowsyd to the son of god by
grace: so finally ye may attain to be parfytly married to our said lord in
glory everlasting Amen. your charity mouyth me to write unto you though
vnaquayntid / because ye have sent to us many and diverse tokens vndeseruyd on
our part. I require you for the love of our lord that ye do no more so. All
our labor and dylygence should be to have tokens sent to us from heaven. what
thing or pleasure in this world may content and saciate the souls of them yt
have despysyd and utterly forsaken all this world with his po^pes and pleasures
for the love of Jesus christ. Trewly no thing. For these worldly pleasures may
be rather a let and great hynderance to the holy loueyng soul / if yt keep not
the self loose and fre from all such vanyties Do delicate and precious is the
love of god / that those parsons which intend to have yt / must not only
despise all worldly pleasures: but also their own will and appetytes. And no
marvel: for this love of god is more pleasure and tresure to man then all the
riches of the world. This notwithstandyg I suppose that such temporal tokens
have been suffered / vsyd / sent / and received of holy parsons* not for any
pleasure that should be taken thereof: but as signs and tokens of parfyt love
and charity. wherein they be united and knyte in our lord god that sendyth or
receives such tokens. Now good sister I wot not what I may write unto you for
gostly exhortacion and spu^all comfort. because that before this time I have
nether written unto you / ne yet much otherwise have been acquaintid with you.
But your spu^al friend has so instantly mouyd me thereunto: that I can not
conveniently deny his godly and devout request. Besechyng our most mercyful
lord / that yt may be to his honor and your spiritual comfort.

ANd for as much as the holy prophet David says. Iniciu^ sapiencie timor
du^i. Psalmo. C^
The holy fear of god is the begynynge of all gostly wysdom and spu^all
buyldyng. And the apostell Paul says Charitas est vinculum perfeccionis et
finis precepti. Coloss. iii.^
Charity or the holy love of god is the end and knotte of all parfeccion.
Therefore to co^byne the begynyng of goostly wysdom to the end of parfeccion. I
purpose su^what to declare of these tow according to the sentence of holy
scripture / and after ye mind of holy doctors and saints / declarynge the
same for ye spu^all co^solacion and gostly comfort / of such devout sowles.
as be su^what tymerous and ferefull in conscience.

what is the holy fear of God. The second Chapitre.
This holy fear of god / is a spu^all reverence which the soul of man has
to his maker as the natural child to his father. The child will not displese
his father / be cause he so louyth him naturally / that he had lever suffer
gre^e pain or than he would be out of the favor of his father or to be
separate from his presence. This is a kind natural reverence and a chyldly
fear. And such is the fear that we ought to have to God. Our fear to god
ought to be a kind loueynge reverence / so that we had lever suffer all
pains then to be separate from his grace. ^cda. secu^d ^uestio. ix.
This as saint Thomas says is the most parfyt fear / that man may have in
this world. This fear although every crystyan man and woman should have: yet
more specially those yt ben the spouses of christ / ought to have the holy
reverence / and reuerente fear of god. This reuerente fear is the lock of
all parfeccion. It kepyth and preseruyth man ever in the love of God. and will
not let him return again to syn. It ever comyth with charity / that is the
holy love of god / and departyth with the same It ever lenyth and cestyth upon
charity / and encreasyth with yt. And never may be separate from grace None may
have this. but those that been in the grace and favor of god. And none may
have this excellently / but the spouses of christ Jesus and such that has
forsaken the world for his love.

what is the seruyle fear and what yuells comyth to us there by. The.iii.
Chapitre.
ANother fear there is / that is assymylyd and comparyd to a bondsman / or a
hyryd saruante / which does fear and dread his master for his cruelte and
Justice / ever keeping and fulfyllynge his co^mandementes for dread of
punysshemente / or lest he will take his wages from him. This fear contentyth
not god / but rather if yt be vndyscretly vsyd / much dyspleasyth his grace /
and specially in those / of whom god lokyth to have an hyer reverence / that
is the holy loueyng fear that I spoke of before. These ben or should be all
relygyous parsons. They ought to render to god an holy loueyng reverence / and
not to fear god in his Justice only with a mystruste of his mercy / supposing
for every tryfull dampnacion / in their erroniouse conscience. This is the
seruyle fear / this contentyth not god. but if yt be vsyd indiscreetly / it
sore displeasyth him for yt takyth his honor and his dew reverence from him /
as much as man may. This fear the great sinners of the world has some
time. They fear dampnacyon / their conscience puttyth them in remembrance of
their syn / although for lack of grace they have no remorse of the same. But
in religiouse parsons commonly yt is more trouble / then other syn or danger /
for yt drawyth them to a scrupulosyte and fear of spyryt / that yt makyth them
think that all that they do is naught. and yet they be in grace and live full
holely / but not so holely as they should do. if they labouryd to put that
seruyle fear away. for if they would / they should profyt much / and go
forth in holy life / where as now in this fear / they other stand still / or
go backwarde. For this seruyle fear so pressyth down the holy love of god:
that yt may not have lyberty to spryng as yt would. It also quenchyth the holy
fear above said. For the holy reverence lyftyth the eye of man's soul ever
upward to god / where contrary wise / the seruyle fear fireth the eye of man
ever in hell / for there is nothing in (...)

of hell more then they do. But to the saruantes of christ the relygiouse
parsons which with all their minds and study applies them self to sarue god
daily / and never to offend his grace / yt is necessary to use this foresaid
meditacion of fear with dyscresion / in time / place / and cyrcumstance
conueniente. As when they ben dulle / sluggysshe / and not prompte or ready to
goostly warkes. Or when they have carnal thoughts / or vain glorious
thoughts / or such other / that lettyth them from the saruice of god. Then a
meditacio^ of the pains of hell / or of gods Justice is necessary as a prick
/ to prick them forth and to quycken their dulle soul to do their dewty.
Otherrwyse yt may do hurt / and abate their love / which should not be / for
in love restyth all parfeccion. This I write by cause many be deceived in
fetynge and dredynge god / and specially some relygiouse parsons / takeynge the
one fear for the other / wenynge that they render to god the dew fear / and
holy reverence / and yt is not so. For they only dread him for his Justice /
and so give him but a seruyle fear / which contentyth him not.

How of seruyle fear comyth scrupulosyte that much trobelyth the relygiouse
parson. The.fyfthe. Chapitre.
FArthermore this seruyle fere indiscreetly vsid bryngyth them to such a
scrupulosyte of conscience / by the reason whereof. they ben brought to such a
marvelous trouble of spirit / that nether they can profit in grace / and in
the service of god: nor ye can not do their dewly as they should do / to
their lord in time and place convenient. And all is because that they know not
the nature of that spiritual disease / called scrupulosyte. And to what
gebardyse / parelles and confusyons / yt may bring them if yt be not removed
and put utterly a way / which is very easy to all them that be wylynge to live
in piece of spryte / and holy love of god. For how many they keep their lord in
their heart contynually / whose conscience is full of trouble by scrupulosite /
sith scripture says / that his mansyon and dwelling place is ever where
peace is. In pace fatus est locus eius.

Psalm. lxxv.


Then the mansyon of god may not be fyxed in a scrupulouse soul / which is
ever trobelyd and full of wauerynges and doutfulnes. And though the tabernacle
of grace for a time may be in their soul / yet there yt may not contynually
abide. by the reason of the great troble that is in their conscience. How may
grace abide in that conscience that makyth dedly syn of every venial syn. And
some times by their erronyous estymacion and scrupulosyte. they make a grievous
mortal syn of that / that is no syn at all but rather verteu. Example. A good
example.
when such a parson has vsyd long time pryuate prayers and deuocio^s. At
the comau^dement of his prelate / when he should do the work of obedience:
then his scrupulouse conscience will bind him to the contrary. and say / yt is
dedly syn to leave his deuocions vnsayde And also morouer when he has vsyd
certain prayers of devotion / to the which he is not bound of duty. sometime
is scrupulouse conscience will prick him so with fear that he dare not omyt
and leave such volu^tary prayers for any cause reasonable. And that is a great
folysshenes. Even such ben all scrupulouse persons. that byndeth them to their
erronyouse conscience. which they ought to refuse / remove / forsake and
depose / at the counsel of their prelates or spiritual fathers. For though
ye conscience does ever bind. yet when yt is erroneouse / yt should be
deposyd and does not bind p^cysely / for yt may and should be put a way. To
whom may a scrupulouse relygiouse parson be comparyd? ^ comparison
Certeynly to a man that walkyth in a way that is most plain* plesante / and
sure / and yet he will stu^ble at a pease / or at a whete corn / or at a
cherystone / for a scrupul is called such a little stone. Even so of such
manner his he worthy grate derysyon that will be scrupulouse in relygion. which
is the most right / plain / sure / and plesau^t way / that any criste^ man may
walk in / to god. And yet in relygion the scrupulouse parson will stu^ble at
every straw / and sometime make that thing that is verteu / by his weak
conjectures and corrupt estymacions to be vice / and that syn that is but
venyall / to be grievous and mortal. And the cause of all this is for he knows
not the nature of scrupulosite. He knows not what yt is / and whereof yt
rysyth / or bredyth / what things they be that noryssheth it / what things
maynteyneth yt / to what gebardy it brings the parson that is infecte with yt
/ and how and by what manner they might have remedy to remove it and utterly
put yt a way. By cause that all these premysses sometime be unknown / the
parsons that be scrupulouse be maruelously troubelyd and brought to so great
fear of conscience and spirit: ye scantly they can goo forth in the saruyce
of god as they should do. And yet the thing that troubelyth them is but a
tryfle in yt self / and sone removed if they would put there good will there
unto. vndoutyd to the great increase of verteu in their souls. Therefore / for
these aforsaid causes and effects of scrupulosyte. I shall teache somewhat for
the conforte of ye said parsons / and first what is scrupulosyte.

what is scrupulosyte. The.vi. Chapitre.
Scrupulosyte is called sometime pusyllanimite sometime the fear of conscience /
sometime erroneous of conscience / and thus yt is dyffyned. Scrupulosyte is a
dulle tediousnes and indiscreet deieccion or trouble of the mind / by
thoccasion of ymaginacions of certain things which semyth to be contrary.
Also yt is called the fleyng or abhorrynge of fear by the which in a mind
unstable imagenynge things for to come that been terryble is caused an
anguysshe of spryte and straytenes in conscience. But that noble Clarke Gerson
declaryth it more plain and says. In comp^dio theolo. ^ Ite^ libro. i^ de
consola^one prosa se^
Scrupulosyte is a waueryngnes / or a doutefulnes and a fear that is caused of
weak and uncertain conjectures of the mind. As he might say thus.
Scrupulosyte is a wauerynge unstableness of the fantasy. A doutfull vndyscussyd
and uncertain weak conjecture of reason / and troubelous fear of the
conscience. In the which words yt apperyth well / that scrupulosyte is not
the parfit dyscussyd act of reason / but rather a weak conjecture without deu
delyberacion. And that apperyth well by this. Let a scrupulouse parson be asked
cou^seyl of an other in those things in the which he is tanglyd him self /
and some time he will give holsom counsel without scrupull / and that he can
not give to himself / wherefore it is plain that scrupulousnes does not
proceed of parfit delyberacion. For yt is but a weak imaginacion or a feeble
conjecture of reason. It apperith also / that scrupulosyte is not the fynall
sentence of conscience. For if yt were / yt must needs bind to fulfill the
said sentence / whether yt were good or yuel. For after doctors / the
erroneous conscience so does bind / as long as yt is not put a way / but it
ought ever to be deposyd and put a way / when a thing is finally decreed of
conscience / conscience has no doubt / but strongly comau^dyth yt / as yt
apperyth in these worldly consciences / in byyng and selyng / where often times
though they do wrong / they put no doutes. But scrupulosite is ever a douteful
fear of the conscience / wherefore I may conclude / yt a man may do against his
scrupulouse mind and yet do not against his conscience. Also a man may put a
way his scrupulosyte / without comytyng of syn. but rather sometime with merit.
and to thencrease of grace and verteu. For as saint Thomas says / the
conscience. and the fear of conscience ben tow things. To do against the
conscience is syn. but to do agenst the fear or waueryng doutfulnes of the
conscience may be without syn / what so ever act be without doubt and fear:
that is no scrupul / ne may be called a scrupulosyte. And contrary wise. That
act that proceeds not of parfyt delyberacion / but is in fear and doubt / yt
semyth a scrupulousnes. Thus we have showed you the nature of scrupulosyte.

whereof scrupulosyte rysyth or bredyth. The.vii. Chapitre.
NOw we shall show you whereof scrupulosite does bread / and other p^mysses
aforesaid. Though doctors show many and diverse causes that may be occasion of
scrupulosyte / yet for this our purpose. Antoninus in prima pert^ su^me. tit.
iii. captlo. x.
I note one special cause aft doctors sometime thereof yt is to say / the
natural complexion of man / when our fore father Adam had broken the
comau^dement of god / where before his syn he had his body at his will After his
syn his flesh was all rebellyng to him and full of diverse inclynacions to
vice. Inclinacions to Pride / to envy / to ire / to couytousnes / to slouthe /
to glotony / and to lechery. with many other inclynacio^s left in man / after
ye dyuersyte of his complexion / as pains dew for his syn. some mo / some less
/ after the dyuersyte of their natural complexion. Among all. One cause of
scrupulosyte.
I note specially for this our purpose / ye natural inclynacion to inordynat
fear. The which I would chose / if yt were in my lyberty before all ye other
perilous i^clynacio^s aforsayde. For como^ly they yt of natural disposycio^
been disposyd to fears: they other want many of ye other / or else they be not
much troubled with them as other be. This natural inclynacion to fear after
doctors may rise of an humor in ye stomach called melancoly / which humor
much disposyth to fere / and specially in women. which as saint Thomas
says. by the occasion of that humor. whereof the fear of w^men comy^ to
them.
when they go alone they be indiscreetly fearyd. and dredyth things / that no
constant christian persons should fear. For as saint Thomas says. In the night
specially they woll ymmagyn that they se sprytes and beasts and other deformyd
fygures. And all is that their fantasy by reason of the said humor / which
inclyneth them to the said fear. This dread should not be in the spouses of
criste. In whose heart ever should be the quycke remembrance of the passion of
our lord Jesus / which makyth all fears to vanysshe a way. as the flame of
the fire puttyth a way the smoke. of the contrary / and the son the shadow or
darkness of the clouds. No christian man or woman ought to fear any damnyd
sprytes. For the lions of hell be bound and may do nothing to man / but only
at the will of our lord. And our most gracyous master christ Jesus never
does suffer the enmy to appear vysybly to any of his saruantes that loueyth
him. but he gives them gostly strength to resyst him / and not to fear him /
as I shall show after by example. And also yt was plain and manyfestly showed
in saint Margaret / saint Iulyan ye vyrgyn / saint Kateryne of seen and many
other mo / both men and women. And although scrupulosyte and fear of
conscience may be caused many ways. yet in women and some other that to our
lord be right faithful / yt may rise of this foresaid humor and inclynacion
of natural complexion. And therefore as we said before / in such yt is more
trouble then danger or peril / and those in conscience trymble and quake. as
the profet says / where no fear is. nor peril and many times also no syn.
Psalmo.xiii and.lii.


How scrupulosyte is norysshed. The.viii. Chapitre.
ANd not only the fear of the conscience or scrupulosyte is bred by the
occasion sometime of this inclynacion of nature / but also yt is norysshed by an
unstable fantasy / which commonly and often times by thoccasion of this humor
melancoly is dysposyd to ymagyn tho things that been teryble and fearefull-and
that is one cause that makyth the conscience troubled and doutful / and full of
fear. An other cause of scupulosyte.
which fear is called scrupulosyte. An other cause that noryssheth
scrupulosyte is this. where the ymaginacion is much occupied with terryble
fantasyes / the mind is much inclyned to consider the same And for as much
as to the faithful soul / syn and seperacyon from god is most abhorryd /
therefore those things which should cause or follow of ye same be most terible
to the mind / as the justice of god. his fynal sentence of judgment and
reprobacion. his most strayte examynacion of all sins. ye teryble pains of
hell and dampnacio^, that be ordenyd for sinners. and the acou^tes that man
must then give of every ydell word and of venyall sins / be they never so
small. and the horrible company of devils and such other. These vndyscretly
co^syderyd causyth the seruyle fear of god. and that noryssheth the fear of
conscience / and scrupulosyte. as the moisture of the earth noryssheth the
plant or herb. and even so makyth yt grow and increase. And sometime the
enemy right well knowing the natural dysposycion and complexion of man
helpyth forwards and mouyth by suggestion often to the co^sideracion of the
same and all these does norysshe scrupulosyte.

whereof scrupulosyte is maynteyned. The.ix. Chapitre
Scrupulosite is maynteyned as I note specially of tow things. that is to say
/ of an erroneous conscience / and of the most perylous spyce of pride called
syngularite / which is when a parson so testyth to his own opinion and to his
own reason / that he will not believe any other. nor follow the cou^seyl of any
other. and this is the more peryllous yuyll of these tow. For though a parson
have an erroneouse conscience / yet if he be meke and will follow counseyl. he
may sone put his error a way. and sone be curyd of this foresaid sprituall
sycknes / called scrupulosyte. But if he be infecte with syngularite / yt is
hard to remove the error of his conscience / except a special grace and
good will / with dylygent labor of his own part. (...)
Singularite is peryllouse in every person / but as saint Gregory says /
most peryllouse in a relygyous parsone that entendyth parfeccyon Such if they
take an opinyon / or error. hard yt is to remove them from yt. And specially
as he says in the begynyng of their conversion to relygyon Such parsons
scrupulouse and synguler in their own ways / been apt to be overthrown in
all te^ptacions / and be dysposyd to receive all the suggestions of the enemy /
and that is be cause they ben like to him / in their i^ordinat love of their
own excellensy which is their syngularite. Such will keep ye small things
of relygion precysely. and such perfeccions as been but tryfles. but the great
parfeccions and bordyns of relygio^ / and specially obedience and mekenes they
will not keep. Such may be sone known. For pretendeyng parfeccion / they ben
ever ready to be full of suspicions / ready to take occasyons ready to set at
naught / despise and dysdayne the works of other persons. But such manner of
persons ben sore deceived For they shall never profyt in gostlynes / nor
increase in grace / for god resystyth the syngular and proud parson as
scripture says / and gives his grace habu^dantly to the meke soul. Deus
superbis resistithumilibus dat graciam.

Iac. iiii.


Such persons ben ever unquiet / unstable and full of troubles and anguysshe
of spirit partly / by the reason of their scrupulosyte partly / by their
syngularite. Their scrupulous conscience will trouble them among in their
saruyce. Of scrupulosite in sayynge of saruice.
when theye have said yt ones sufficiently as their fraylte will suffer / yet
they can not be content / but the fear of their conscience pricketh them / and
so they say yt again / twyse or thryse. And worse at the second time / then
at the first. De vita spu^ali ai^e lectio iiii. Item in tract. de remediis
contra pusillanimitatem.
But as Doctor Gerson says. Let such parsons know for a certenty / that the
church byndeth no person to say his saruice with actual devotion and actual
attencion of mind in all his saruice. For then he should offend in sayng of it
when he has not actual devotion / and that is false. For deuocio^ is of god
and not in our power to have yt but as it pleasyth his grace. Also as saint
Thomas says / yt is sufficient that in ye begynynge / when he should say his
saruice / that he have an intent to sarue god and to do his dewty. Their
syngularite also with fearful conscience commonly does unquiet and trouble
them in their confessions sore. And as doctor Gerson says / surely without
reason. For they will form and make a great conscience of those things that been but tryfels / in comparison / and light offenses / and such venial
sins / without the which / yt is not possible this life to be co^tynuyd. In
such they will make such precyse search and dyscusse of conscience / that
they will leave nothing vnconfessid but make conscience of all their life / and
unwisely more weeping their offenses in the balance of the justice of god / then
in the balance of his marcy. Such if they follow not counsel / and put a way
this scrupul they shall come to this inconvenience / that they shall make
conscience of that / that is no syn / and confess that / that is no vice / nor
matter of confession / and that is not to be done. This smellyth all of
syngularite / and specially in them that comyth to confession haueyng co^petent
contricion as this clarke Gerson says / and sometime habou^dant co^tricion /
and makes their confession sufficyently: yet by ye reason of their
scrupulousnes and syngularite / they be not content / nor can be suffysyd with
one confession sufficiently made / but sometime they will make tow or mo
co^fessions of such small sins / and so do they irreverence and dyshonoure
to the holy sacrament of penance and mystrust the same / and both weary
themself and also their gostly father. (...) Psalmo. xiii. ^^. lv. Vbi supra.
Caplo. xii.
They quake and tremble as the prophet says / where no dread is. Such says
this forsaid clarke been syngular / more trustyng in their own justice / then
in ye marcy of god. They wene to make them self so clean / that they shall
have no need of ye marcy of god / but they look to be sauyd by his justice But
let such take heed / what our savior says in his holy rewle which we have
professyd / blyssyd be his holy name ever more therefore. that if a man would
suffer him self to be slain in his body / if yt were possible a.C. times for
penance yet for all that / he should not be worthy to come to heaven / if god
would proceed after the only rygoure of his justice against him. Thus we have
showed you whereof / as in part / and as of one rote scrupulosyte does bread /
whereof yt is norysshed and mayntenyd that is to say / of complexion yt may
spryng / of an unstable fantasy and seruyle fear yt may be noryshed and of an
erroneous conscience and syngular mind yt may be maynteyned.

Of the yuels that scrupulosite brings to. The.x. Chapitre.
NOw restyth behind to show what pareyls troubles and ieobardy scrupulosyte
may bring any parson to. And what remedies for the same. and for all these
foresaid fears and troubles. First as concerning the pareyles and ieobardies /
to the which scrupulosite may bring that parson that restyth in yt / there be
many and diverse. of yt which all for lack of time I can not write now. yet
one ieobardy I note / that I find in a notable doctor / to the which those
that been infecte with scrupulosite sometime be brought. And like as I have
showed one occasion whereof yt may spring and breyde. That is natural
complexion: so like wise I shall show one pareyl and ieobardy above all other /
to the which yt may bring. Doctors / and specially physyciens determyne and
say / that of a certain humor in the stomach / whether that humor be
melancoly / as yt is like to be / or else a dust color / or rather a black
fleme. I leave yt to them that be lernyd in physycke but they say / that of
such an humor there rysyth a black and a dark fume to the head / which so
troubelyth the sensis and head of man / that by thoccasion thereof / reason is
darkenyd. and that as saint Thomas says / is the gretest pain that may be in
this world / and specially to the faithful soul. For if reason be darkenyd
and may not have his course to discern and discuss parfytly things as him
ought to do that causyth in the conscience of man or woman / A fear and
waueryng doutfulnes / and that is scrupulosyte. And so long without remedy
that fear may grow / that it will bring ye conscience half to consent to
things that been wrong / which for lack of dew delyberacion / reason can not
discuss nor discern. And paraduenture fall to mocions of infidelyte. to
anguysshe of spyrit / and tediousnes of life. thynkeyng all that they do to be
naught. And that they be forsaken of almighty god. and delivered to the hands
of the enemy / for their sins / and so fall to desperacion. This is the
greatest pain that may be in this world / to the faithful soul. And in
patiently sufferynge this pain / and in wisely ouercomynge the same / there is
promised the great crown of glory / and so much more glory / that the pain
is importable. And certeynly / this pain or some other like. is necessary and
much holsom for the syngular person to keep him in mekenes / least he should
fall to farther pride and so lose the favor of god and crown of glory. (...)
There is as saint Augustine says for every syn a dew pain. And god of
justice has comaundyd that every inordynate mind shall receive his dew pain
in him self. As the enuyous heart his pain. The slothful his pain. The
Gloton his pain / and so forth of other But among the^ all / there is no
pain so meyte to suppress syngularyte / as these foresaid spiritual pains
and temptacions. The which / for as much / as we have showed how they may com
and rise in some manner wise / of the route of our corupte nature / wherefore
such may be sometime more pain then parell. as we have said before. Libro pri
d^ co^so. theolo^ prosa. iiii. and libro. iiii. pros^ secunda. A good
desperacion.
For doctor Gerson says that there is a good scrupulosyte and a good
desperacion. That is a good desperacion that reryth up the dull soul of man /
and makyth yt strong in hope. for the faithful soul being in fore temptacions
and pains / seeing that he can not deliver and help him self / he castyth all
his thoughts / heart and mind / body and soul / in to the hands of god his
maker / and cleuyth fast to his marcy. as does the nedyll to ye adamant stone.
And that soul doutles shall have comfort of god. which anon as he receives
/ he is ever afterward more strong in hope than he was before. This is a good
desperacion. Vbi supra. A good scupulosite.
Likewise / that is a good scrupulosyte. that is occasion to remove the soul
from seruyle fear / and tymerous conscience to hearty and faruent love. And
that is a good mocion of infydelyte / by the occasyon of the which / man may
obtain clear faith / and quick faith in things concerning his salvation. I
write not this / ye only every man yt is scrupulous and syngular has these
forsaid spu^al infyrmytyes and temptacio^s but also some times / the strong and
faithful saruantes of god. that had lever have their hearts pluced out of
their breasts then in word / deed / or thought they would declyne from ye true
faith. and love of Jesus criste. And for as much as allmyghty god loueyth them
most syngularly. therefore he will prove them in the furnace of pain and
tribulacion. like as he did his natural and eternal son our savior and
lord Jesus crist. And the cause is. that above other patiently sufferyng the
same / they be preordinate to have an hyer crown of glory in heaven. For as
that noble and devout clarke. whom I suppose ye both knew and louyd for his
synguler verteu Doctoure Chubbes / in his conflate / co^paryth the swetnes of
devotion / and faruoure of charity unto milk. ^onflate is ^e name of (...)
book.
with which. god often times does feed and norisshe his tender children / and
such as ben tender in faith / weak in faith / weak in hope and feeble in
love. But the strong saruantes and cha^pions of god. been fed with a more
strong meat / as with pains / labors / commandments / profeccions and
great troubles / temptacions and aduersityes. which if they suffer pacyently
and so prouyd / keep hole and break not from the love of god. such be blyssed
says the wise man. And they shall have the crown of glory / which god has
promised and kepyth for them. (...)
And saint James in his epistle exhortyth every faithful soul to the same.
sayng. Be glad and esteem yt for a great joy / when ye be in troubles / and
temptacions. For sith the life of faithful man is co^paryd to battle in
scripture. the cristian man should not care / nor abate his gostly courage to
god when he is assailed by the enemy. or otherwise tossyd in aduersyte. knowing
for certain that none may come to heaven but by troble and pain Saint Paul
says. ^ebre. xii. B^
Them whom god receives and admyttyth as his children / he correctyth in this
world. And none may look to be enheritours of the kingdom of heaven / ye in
this world will suffer no pain. And therefore ye faithful saruant of god should
not regard much what pain he does suffer. nor of whom his pain takyth
occasion or is caused. For know ye for certain yt all pain sensyble is
wroughte of god. and of him pryncipally is comau^dyd..s. Thoma^
And though the occasion of our syn some time may be ye cause / by the
suggestio^ of ye enemy. And though also ye cause meritorious may be our self.
other by our surfeit or necglygens / fraylte / ignorance / or corrupt will /
yet the pain is only of god / as ye pryncipall cause / to rectify / other the
syn yt is past / or to let the syn yt is to com. so ye prophet David says.
Psalm. xxxvi^
that god correctyth man for syn. Then we should not much care nor be weary of
pain but we ought dylyge^tly to apply all our study / after the cou^sayl of ye
wise man. How we may receive with hearty thanks all such things yt god shall
send. whether they be adversities / or prosperity. And often to reuolue and
recou^t in our mind: how we may p^pare and order our self pacie^tly to suffer
/ endure and to co^tynew hole and unbroken. in such te^ptacions adversities and
proves. For like as ye fire tries and prouyth ye silver or gold. Eccli. ii.
so ye furnace of pain and tribulacio^ prouith ye elect children and chosen
e^heritours of ye kingdom of heaven. saint Paul wytnessyth yt same. sayng.
Roma. v.
Tribulacio^ warkyth patience. Patience hole and unbroken workyth proof. and
proof warkyth hope. and hope never confou^dyth / but gyuyth such gostly
stre^gthe to man and knytteth his heart so fast to god. yt all pain is pleasure
to him and augmentacio^ of strength and grace. Example. An examp^^ of the
pott^^
The pottar when he turnyth his vessel and in ye first time makyth yt as long
as it is grene earth. he setyth no great store by it. But when he has put it in
ye fire. and after take it out again / if he find it broken. he will sone cast it
a side as naught / and settyth no store thereby. But if yt be hole and sou^de
when he takyth it out of the tyer. then he makyth much of yt. trustyng that yt
shall re^dre and yield him such avantage as he made yt for And that pot so
being hole and sound after the fire. if yt had reason and understanding /
might have great comfort and trust to com to that end / that yt was made for.
So in like wise. That parson that in pains and temptacions can suffer all
patiently and endure hole and break not / he may have great hope and trust of
his salvation. Thus we have showed you to what ieobardy scrupulousnes and
syngularite brings.

Of remedies against scrupulosyte. The.xi. Chapitre
NOw we shall show you what remedies for the same. (...)
And first against scrupulosyte. As the famous clarke doctor Nydar says /
and also yt is in speculo spu^aliu^. Scrupulosite is removed by.iii. things
that is to say / by deposyng and putyng a way of the erroneous conscience. by
mekenes. and by clean discrete confession. In the which I note that
scrupulosite should be removed and dystroyed / in a contrary wise to the order
whereof it does grow / and specially in this one point of scrupulosyte / that
we have taken to entrete of. It bredyth of ye inclynacion of our corrupt
nature. It is norysshed by an unstable fantasy / and by seruyle fear / and by
the suggestion of the enemy. It is mayntenyd by syngularite and by an erroneous
conscience. Now first after this foresaid clerks we ought to do a way our
erroneous conscience and then put a way syngularyte / and take mekenes. And as
for the unstable thoughts / cast them in the lap of your gostly father. And
for as the inclynacion of nature. dread yt no more. then ye would dread the
i^clynacion to uncleanness of the body / or the inclynacion to i^pacience or
glotony. or any other vice ageyn the wiche we must ever fight / and there upon
dependyth and folowyth ye crown of glory. scde Thin^ secu^do. ^
For as saint Paul says none shall be crownyd but only they that manly does
fight for yt. in the batayl of verteu. And if scrupulousnes of these great
fears of conscience had been good and necessary: the holy saruantes of god that
has gone before us / would have been scrupulous / and that we read not. For I
suppose if all had been scrupulous. we should not have had the i^numerable
multitude of martyrs / confessors and other holy fathers that been past / nor
the unspeakable works that holy doctors have written and left for our comfort.
with many and diverse cou^seyls and precepts to direct our conscience agenst
such scrupulosytyes. And that they would not have done / if we ought to give
place to such feres. Therefore be never weary of any such i^ordinat fearys. but
take dew part agenst them when they come. and order them after discrecion. And
if they will be fearse / suppress and p^uent them by holy and sweet
meditacions of ye goodness of god. of his great marcy and benefytes / and love
that he has to man. And thank his grace for that yt has pleasyd him to
admyt man to be partenar of his glory. for resystyng such small mocions and
tryfels. The ordyr and manner to put a way an erroneous conscience. To remou^ an
errone^^ conscience
Doctors shewyth sayng / that yt is most sure to do yt after the counseyl of
their gostly fathers and discrete confessors. for that putyth all things out
of doubt. both by the reason of their meke obedience to their confessor /
and by the grace of the sacrament of penance. In the which undoubted the holy
ghost does often times illumyn / lyghten and i^spyre ye mynystre of ye said
sacrament. yt is the pryst with the light of his grace and cou^seyl For
experience shewyth. how many that has been scrupulous and in process of time
parceyueyng their own great folysshenes and error / laboryng in them self
only after their syngular mind to put yt a way / and not aft counsel / has
fallen to further inco^uenientes on ye other party. that is to say / they have
excedyd more in largenes of conscience. then ever they did before in streytnes
of scrupulosyte. And more have drawn themself to the gebardy of p^su^pcion
then ever they were in any danger of desptracio^. Both these saint Thomas
forbyddeth. both to large conscience / and to streyghte conscience. For the
one brings to p^su^pcion and the other to desperacion. But all our labor
should be to have the quiet and mean conscience. For therein restyth the holy
ghost / and there in standyth parfeccion. And thereof encresith grace and verteu
in relygion / which syngularite principally does let. therefore do yt a way as
the mayntener of ye scrupul. and take in his place mekenes. Syngularite
preferryth his own judgment before all others. And mekenes does prefar the
iugdemente of other before her own. And therefore is mekenes the most
souerente medcin agenst scrupulosite. And that thing ye principally puttyth it
a way / is to follow cou^seyl. narracion
So we read that saint Barnarde removed a great fear and scrupul from one of
his brethren / which was so feryd. that he durst say no mass. He thought he
had no faith in the sacrament / whose error saint barnarde wayng wisely and
dyscretly / said. Go to mass brother in my fayeth. And he so doing for
obedience had never more trouble of that scrupulousnes and fear. But some will
say. ye sir. saint barnard was an holy man. and a great clarke. our gostly
fathers be not so. To this answerith doctor Gerson. and says. yt it was
neither the holiness of saint barnard nor his great lernyng that delyueryd this
man. but yt was the meke obedience of ye brother. that obayed and followed ye
comau^dment and cou^seyl of his father. Therefore yt is best to follow cou^seyl
and to ensew mekenes. and to put a way all syngularite. For as we said in
begynyng. like as the holy fear of god / is the lock of all perfeccion. so
mekenes is the key of all perfeccion. which openyth the heart of man to all
things that been goostly / and shyttyth yt fast from all things contrary. Then
in all scrupuls yt is best and most ready medicyn to follow the cou^seyl of a
discrete gostly father. And as for saruice of the church / as matyns.
euynsonge / and such other hours. Let none be to much scrupulous therein. we
be as saint Austyne says no angels. And what so ever we shall do / some
defaute we make therein. we can not do every thing so p^cysely as angel can
do. Therefore in our saruice. as we allegyd saint Thomas before. Of sayng
saruice. ca^
let us in the begynynge form our mind to god. and what so ever negligence
follow. if yt be not wylfully nor of conte^pte. but of our fraylte or
negligence or infyrmyte. our mind be abstracte. standing the first order of
our mind it is sufficient / and we be not bound to say it again. But if any
light negligence fortune of our fraylte / be sorry therefore with a consion on
our breast or some other token of contricion and go forth And as for confession
be not to far precyse therein. confession
I mean in making to far discussion in small sins. For though in our propre
judgment / it be not lawful to think any sin small. (...)
for that were blasphemy says saint Barnarde / yet many sins byne venyall
and so small / that as saint Thomas says / we be not bound to confess
them of very necessite by any comau^dement / but only of congruyte. Laudable yt
is / and specially for the holy relygious parsons / and much behoueful and
holsom it is for their sonlles health often to confess their daily offenses /
which commonly and in manner been but venyall. But ever among concerning the
matter of co^fessyon be ware of the enemy and specially that parson that is
scrupulous. For like as you put muddy water in a vessel / touch the vessel
and the mud will rise and dark the water. Even so sometime will the enemy (if he
be suffered) touch our body and move the humors and trouble the senses
thereof. and so dark reason / that yt shall nether se yt self. nor parfytly
consider the confession or other warkes that we have made or done. Then he will
come and say / sir such a syn is not remytted of god. for yt was not trewly
confessyd / and so make him go to confession ageyn / and specially the
scrupulous person. whose conscience is much prompte and ready to consent / by
the reason of fere that is in yt But know ye well / that this suggestion of
the enemy is not done. to have him confess his syne. or to make him have
remyssio^ of the same. But as saint Gregory says / the enemy sometime will
move to verteu. by cause he will induce vice. libro. iii. moraliu^ caplis.
xxiiii..xxv.
He will move the prelate to Justice. because he would make him cruel. sometime
to pity and marcy / because he would make him neglygent. And sometime he will
move the relygyous parson to scilence / prayer / and contemplacio^ / because he
would make him vain glorious sometime move him to great abstinence / and watch
because he would bring him to ydelnes of brain or other confusion. And so
like wise. in this point he will move to confession / not for to have them
clean in soul. but because he would trouble them in conscience. for he hatyth
peace / and he is called the pestylent spirit of discord and trouble. Therefore
though in great crimes. and abhomynable offenses of the which man ought ever
to be a shamyd. Sith shame and the pain thereof in penance is cou^tyd for a
great part of co^tricion / such of mere devotion a man often to confess for
the increase of grace and meryt / though doctors comende yt. yet in this case
/ other for the suggestion of the enemy / or for any scrupulousnes. doctors
will that they shall not confess them ageyn in cotidian and daily sins and
venialles of which they have been confessyd before. but wisely to dyssymul it
and to resyst the enemy in yt point. yet this not withstandyng / if at any
time of only mere deuocio^ they be mouyd to make their life and soul clean /
then they may / as the time is expedient and necessyte requires. These points
we have rehersyd by cause scrupulosyte is much accustomyd to follow the same.

Of remedies for temptacions coming of Scrupulosyte. The.xii. Chapitre.
NOw let us se remedies for the gebardyes and temptacions rehersyd. which
done follow of scrupulosyte. Temptacions comyth diverse ways some of ye enemy.
some of our own self. some been carnal. some sprituall / and each one of these
has diverse remedies. we must ever resyst the enemy. and so scripture
comau^dyth sayng. Iaco. iiii.
Resyste the dyuell and he will flee from you. And treuthe yt is. For where he
is suffered and feryd / there is he a lion. and where he is resystyd and not
fearyd nor set by. there says doctors he is but a sheep. But yet know /
that no man may look to be able of him self / to resyst or wrastell with the
enemy. sith there is no power upon earth able to be co^paryd to his power.
Therefore temptacion must be resistyd by grace / prayer / and good works. (...)
The foul thoughts of ye lusts of the body must be fled and had in
abhomynacion / dysdaynynge that our soul yt is dedicate to god. should be
occupied with such. sith our hearts should ever be kept clean. as the chamber
and mansion of our said lord. To this exhortyth saint Paul sayng. Flee
fornicacio^. And in an other place yt is said. (...)
Give place to ire. In the which we be taught a remedy ageyn impaciency. to
suffer and not to revenge our own quarrel And like wise to resyst the mocions
of pride and vaynglory. Thus euerychone of these manner of temptacions. have
^^eyr propre remedies.

Of Spiritual temptacions and how they may com to us. The.xiii. Chapitre.
BUT for as much / as the spiritual temptacions be more suttell and paynefull
/ and commonly more parlous / therefore our pore purpose now is. to show / how
such may come / and what remedies for them. These temptacions be as mocions of
infidelyte and mocions of desperacion. And among all other I note after
doctors one special manner yt they may com of / Isoder says. Libro. iii. de
su^mo bono. Captlo. v.
The enemy when he would deceive man / he first co^syderyth of what complexion
he is. And so applies his ordinance and lays sege to manes soul / where he
fyndeth him most weke. and appte ta receive his suggestions. Saint Gregory
affyrmyth the same in his morals. Sermo. vii.
And pope Leo in a sarmon of the Natyuyte of our lord says thus. The cursyd
adversary our ancient and goostly enemy co^syderyth the state of every person
and ceassyth never / ne fails to sprede and cast every where the snares of
his deceytes / and ever labouryth to corrupt the true faith of the beleuyng
souls. He knowyth full well to whom he may apply the insatiable appetyte of
covetousness. And to whom he may suggest ye soul and abhomynable desires and
occasyo^s of Glotony and Lechery. And whom he may inspyre with his most
venomous poison of Ire and envy. whom he may deceive with false joy. and make
them proud and vaynglorious / or by admyracion and maruelynge of outward
things to seduce and led them from the way of grace and parfeccion. He
knows says this noble Clarke whom he may trouble with pensysnes. and whom
he may oppress with fere. All his labor / dylygence / study and busynes / is
to way consider and search the manners / co^dicions customs / and disposicio^s
of man / wherefore when he knowith that a parson is disposyd to be scrupulous
and fearful in conscience. Anon he will move his body / and cause a fume to
rise up to his head. and trouble his senses / and so dark reason. and then he
has brought him in to a great trouble. The^ by bis subtyl crafts he will
make him believe that he has no faith / and that all he does is naught. And
yt is not so / for all this is by cause reason is darkyd and may not se him
self. nor discuss such things as parteyneth to his salvation. And that the
enemy knowing though he can not overcome him / yet he will trouble him and weary
him. as doctors says. and drive him to that point. if he can / that he
shall be weary to suffer pain for his sins and for the love of Jesus crist. In
which if the faithful soul resyst him / and be not ouercom. but patiently
suffer all his crafts / pains and troubles / certainly that soul does meryt
greatly and byldyth his hye crown of glory. to the great confusion of ye
enemy. which sinned and fell without any such occasion or pain. but only of
his fre will. But if a soul will be weak and faint / and not strongly call for
grace to resyste him: Anon he will lay greter sege to him. and assail him with
more temptacions. He will bring him to anguysshe of spirit / which is a
spu^all pensiveness. And that parlous pain he will by darkyng of his reason /
bring him to yet a greter pain. that is to say. to tediousnes of life. And
there upon next he will if he be not resysted / move him to desperacio^ which
is the uttermost that he may do. in the soul yt louyth god. For certainly.
though he may bring his own saruantes. and such that louyth the world
better then god to forther confusion: yet. ye saruantes of god. and the elect
chosen vessels of grace he may never finally confou^de in that temptacion nor
in any other / as saint Gregory says in the second book of his morals.

A lamentable co^playnt of the dulle Soul. The.xiiii. Chapitre.
BUT some wol say. sir. I am so maruelously troubled some time / that me
thinks I am left and forsaken of god and all his aungells and holy saints.
and I am as yt were a thing that were taken and delivered to the enemy for my
sins. I have no swetnes nor deuocio^ / but all my life is as yt were a
tediousnes / all swetnes and devotion is taken from me. And I as a thing left
dry without merues / and to nothing apt nor disposyd / that is goostly. And
that brings me to such fear / that I may trust and hope of no joy in heaven
/ nor any thing that is good in earth. but only look for dampnacion. Ah. holy
soul and if thou wist what these pains does profyt the thou would have a
merry spryt and a light heart. For certainly other these great temptacions been
only pain to the. or else they been wylfully desired of the. If they been only
pain: know thou for cartaynte that they been no syn. Captlo. xiiii de vera
religione.
For as our holy father saint Austine says. Syn is so volu^tary. that if yt
be not volu^tary yt is no syn. and as doctors says. what so ever temptacio^
man suffer / if he consent not / yt is no syn / but only pain and meryt. and
specially in these spu^all temptacio^s. which ben against faith and hope. For
as scripture says. this is our glory / this is our vyctory: our most strong
and mighty faith. Prima. Ioa^nes. v.
in Jesus christ. which knowyth his saruantes and elect children better then
they know them self He knowyth that lever they had to suffer death / as
martyrs. than they would break or give over / or consent to the enemy in such
temptacions and pains. whom therefore he putyth for the trial and meryt in
these great pains. by cause their crown and glory should be the more hye in
heaven. And certeynly their pain were a kind of martyrdom / if they would
suffer yt gladly / as holy martyrs did fuffer death for the love of Jesus crist.
But for as much as any parson is not like strong in faith / hope / and the
holy love of god: necessary yt is to show some remedies and co^fortes / how holy
fathers before us has behauyd themself in such temptacions.

Good remedies ageynste Spiritual temptacions. The.xv. Chapitre.
Doctors wrytyth that in such spu^all temptacions. we should behave our self
otherwise then in carnal temptacions. For in carnal temptacions we ought to
make strong resystence / and ever wrastell against them. but we may not do so
in spu^all temptacions. wisely and dyscretly we must resyste them / but in no
wise wrastell with them. when the enemy putyth to you a mocion of infydelyte /
reason not with him / and like wise when he castyth a suggestion of desperacion
/ strive not with him. but use this medecyne. Suspende your reason. restrain
all your sensys. and pluck up all your spirits. and as the mocion co^yth /
so let yt pass without strife. If it be only of ye disposicion of our corrupt
nature / this is sufficient if yt be vsyd. If yt com of the enemy he will not
leave you so. but he will cleue otherwise and work more trouble. Then after the
cou^seyl of doctors use this remedy. Dyssymul and show your self to set little
by it / or naught. though ye thing be great And lift up your mind to god.
and remember his tender marcy in the redemption of man / and how yt is his
ordenau^ce in such te^ptacions and pains to prove his saruantes. to whom he
entendith to give ye crown of glory. But if ye enemy be feerce and wol not
cesse for this. as he is most subtle and crafty / then meke your self unto
god. and offer your self for his love and for the dew fruit of penance for
your synes. gladly and with thanks of heart / to suffer al pains that yt shall
please his grace to send you. And with ye call and cry with heart and voice /
on the holy name of Jesus.x. times. or more or less / as your devotion saruith
with some holy and sweet meditacio^ of reverence to the same / as god shall put
in to your mind. This verteu of mekenes and confession of the name of Jesus in
heart and word / ye enemy may not abide. For though for a little time he wol
pretend and semble as if he were not abashed for that verteu and name / as
the sarpent that scripture spekyth of. Psalm. lvii.
whose property is for the time to stop his erys / yet by the words of the
enchanter in conclusion she is ouercom and taken. So the enemy though he wol
not be a known thereof / but some times more fersly he wol make insurreccio^
after that holy name Jesus be spoken. yet certeynly that holy name named he is
overthrown / and therefore strongly parsew him with the same and with mekenes /
and he shall fle with great confusion / to the great comfort of all them that
abydyth as treu servants parseuerant in this their proof / to their great
tryumphe and to the utter confusion of the enemy. Experience shewyth also
comfort and remedy against such temptacions. A certain parson there was / that
by ye space of.ii. years and more. was troubelyd with such mocions / and often
times by water and by land. he had mocions to desperacion / and to the most
abhomynable that may be / to distroy him self. both by water and otherwise.
And the person never ceasyd. but called to god daily and parseuerantly to
strength him. and ever confessyng himself the saruant and worshyper of the
holy name of Jesus. co^mytyng himself only and holly to ye passion of christ and
marcy of our lord god. And within the said time he had comfort and
illuminacio^ in soul. how to answer the enmy / to his great comfort. and to ye
edefiyng of other. And yt was this / yt was given him by a light. that when so
ever such mocion came to his mind. that he sulde take that mocion for an
occasion and remembrance to honor the passion of crist and the blyssed vyrgyn
his mother. And if it com to his mind a.C. times in the day. so often of ye
same to take occasion and remembrance to say. Adoramus to criste Ihu^ et
benedicimus tibi. Quia per crucem titam redemisti mu^dum miserere nobis. And to
the mother of marcy one Aue maria. to the end. And thus that parson was clean
delyueryd. to the great increase of hope in his soul.

An answer to the first part of the Co^playnt of the dulle soul. And a
remedy for his tediousnes. The.xvi. Capitre.
BUT now to the co^playnt of the person that is troubelyd with mocions of
desperacion. And first where he says that his life is as yt were a
tediousnes. In that point begins ye enmy all this trouble. For if he may
bring him to an heaviness of spryte / and to a dulnes and tediousnes: then has
he in manner robbed him. from ye zele and quycke fervor of good works / and
spoiled him of his courage that he had to verteu / and woll make him leave
sometime his dewtyes undone / and other good works / to ye which he has been
accustomyd. But this spu^all pensiveness / and tediousnes of spryte is caused
otherwise in ye great syners of the world and infydels and heretics and
otherwise in the saruantes of god..iii. ways how tediousnes may come in evil
people.
In the saruantes of the dyuell / yt is caused. when they have ye conditions of
their master. sometime of a synguler and proud mind when a man p^ferryth his
own will mind / i^^^cion / or cou^seyl before al other..i.
and also against the commandment of god / and is so obdurate and styffe in
his opynion / that he will follow no cou^seyl. neither of his prelate / nor of
any other reuler. Of this we read an example in the second book of the Kings
of one called Achytofel / which for that his cou^seyl was refusyd and not
folowyd. Captlo. xvii
he went home and honge himself. Some time yt comyth of an enuyous mind. when
a man is so replete with the poison of Envy. Ire. and impaciency. that nether
for god nor man he woll spare to revenge. his enuyous will and heart. Captlo.
iii.
Of this we read in the book of queen Hester of one called Amon / which so
enuyed a verteous man called Mardocheus that he could non other wise be
contentyd / but he would have / not only the said Mardocheus / but also all his
nacio^ slain on a day. and all for that Mardocheus did not arise and do him
reverence as other did. But what fortuned? suerly by the will of god and the
means of the fornamyd queen Hester which was Mardoche us brothers daughter.
Ibide^. Capitulo. vii.
upon the same galows that he let make for Mardocheus / he was hangyd himself.
and Mardocheus with all his nation delyueryd..iii.
Some time yt comyth of a malysyous and cursyd will. a man will not call for
marcy to god. but volu^taryly and wylfully seperat him self. from his marcy /
as did Judas that betrayed our sauyoure. Math. xxvii
And all these came to confusion. And therefore from this tediousnes god keep all
christian people. for his tender marcy. How tediousnes may be i^ the sarua^tes
(...).
amen. Of an other cause and manner this foresaid tediousnes is caused in ye
saruantes of god As saint Gregory wytnessyth in his moralles. And that is when
the saruantes of god has foughten the batayl of verteu long seson / and
exercysyd himself well in warkes of parfeccion / and gostlynes. Afterward he
begins to be weary. and to abate his dylygence and goostly courage that he had
in resystynge temptacions and doing good works / and so gives place to the
enemy / which a non as ye aduarsary do the parceyue / he parsewyth him more
craftily / and by many suttyl frauds and suggestions mouyth him to the foresaid
gostly werynes / and tediousnes. Ageyn the which / we must use these remedies
that folowyth / and apply all our enforce and might / to resyste and remove
this said tediousnes For like as where the sarpent may get in / her head / she
will co^uey and draw in her body shortly / so wol he do. Therefore let us cut a
way tediousnes from our heart / as ye most parlous head of the sarpent the
dyuell. For if he may obtain that vndoutyd he wol bring us to farther trouble
Therefore when we be weary in goostlynes. let us ren to the well of marcy and
fou^tayne of all comfort our loueyng savior christ Jesus. which has promised
to comfort and refresshe us sayng. Math.xi.
Come to me al you that be ouerchargyd and weryed in the great labors yt ye
have taken for my love. Com to me and I shall refresshe you. I shall comfort
releue and defend you / and from all troubles deliver you. Ioa^nes. xvi
In me ye shall have peace Let us consider ye great marcy and tender love of
that lord / which for our redemption and delyuerance / netheyr spared body
nor soul / but strongly sufferyng the batell of tribulacion and all pains to
ye uttermost never ceassyd to the end / but rendryd his most p^cyous life for
our salvation. Remember also the holy appostles / martyrs / co^fessours and
vyrgyns / and i^numerable holy fathers and saints that faughte the same
batayl. Lift up the eye of your soul to heaven. and consider ye crown of
glory. which our said lord has p^paryd for his saruantes. and holdyth yt in
his hand as most sure and ready to those persons ye parseuer fyghtyng this
batayl to ye end. For to them only it is promised. Look also down to hell.
and consider wheter ye be able to stusteyne the pains ordenid for ye contrary
For them I mean yt begins good works and do not persevere to ye end. These
well consyderyd may be an occasion to remove all tediousnes and dulnes of
spirit. But if you will confou^de the enemy shortly. A good re^^dy ageyns^
tediousne^
use this remedy when ye be dysposyd to dulnes of spyryt / apply your self
to some works bodily or gostly. that been to the honor of god. though in the
doing of them ye have devotion. as in prayer. or in redeynge of holy Psalms /
or saints lives. And specially often among. use these holy Psalms Iudica me
deus et discern causam meam. Psalmo. xlii Psalm. C.xlii.
and Domine exaudi orationem meam. auribus percipe obsecracionem meam. And in
this excercyse the enemy may not abide. but seeing that ye more he te^ptyth / ye
more the saruante of god does profyt in good works / as utterly co^fou^dyd
for that time he wol depart / and cesse his temptacion to the great comfort
and goostly experience of the said parson and many no.

An answer to the second part of the complaynt of the dull soul where she
complayneth that all swetnes and devotion is taken from her and she left all
dry / and with out merits. The.xvii. Chapitre.
WHere the said parson also says that all his devotion and swetnes is taken
from him / and he as a thing / that were forsaken. al left dry without
merits. He thynkyth that all ye deeds that he has done be naught / and
rather be syn. the^ good works / and yt is not so / but all is illusyon and
craft of the enemy / which after yt he has darkyd reason as is said before /
then he wol begin to clatter in the fantasy of man. ^omelia. xii
For as Origin says upon Luke Man has.ii. angels deputyd to him / one good
and an other yuel. And if good thoughts be in our heart / and Justice in our
warkes / then our good angel spekith to us. and contrary / when yuell
thoughts does abide and root in our hearts / then the angel of the dyuell
spekyth to us. And some time he wole (as saint Paul says) transfygure
himself / and appear as an angel of light. And under the color of verteu
and good things / he wol deceive the simple soul / such as have not ye
experience of his subtyl crafts. And sometime. he has apperyd in ye
symylytude of criste. as we have many examples. and by a false and vain joy /
he has deceuyd them / that has been given to great perfeccion. And more
over yt is to fear / sith he is so proud and has so great rebellyon to god.
and such malice and envy to man. if he were suffryd he would not spare / to
cou^terfet the voice and parson of god omi^potent / and speak such or other
like words in the person of god. As yt were god that spoke / and signyfy and
say / thou art abhomynable by syn. thy grace is gone / thou have cast thy self
utterly from me / and therefore I wol no more receue the to my grace / thou art
dampnyd. I have delyueryd the to the enemy / and such other. and all should be
but the frauds of ye enemy. whom if god would suffer so to do: yt should be
to the great glory and tryumphe of his saruant / which being but as a worm
of the earth in manner and in comparison of the enemy yet by ye grace of god / is
able to ouercom him and all his crafts. to his utter confusion. For he lost
the said glory without any such temptacion or dyssuasion. He will also sometime
speak to us in the voice of our own conscience / specially when we be darked
in our reason / and say. My faith is unstable / and not true. it is but feigned
/ my hope is not upward as yt should be. I have no love to god. I consent to
every syn. and to every delectacion. I wol despair / how may I look for heaven.
that consentes to every delectacion. and do not resyst any temptacion / ever I
decay and fall from god. Such thoughts and inumerable moo he wol speak in our
soul as yt were our own conscience that should speak / and all is but his
craft and suggestions. Sometime he wol speak in his own dynellyshe parson and
cast his most terryble engyns of fere in man's soul / to his great
unquietness. and say thus. If thou leave not this parfeccion or this work. I
shall mete with the in such a cornar. Or if thou do thus / and thus I shall
bring the to this confusion / or that mystyef. I shall never leave the / but
ever persew ye / tempte the / and trouble the / unto I have brought the to
hell. And sometime he woll put him in great fere / and daily vex him for a
season / though he may not ouercom him. and say If thou cease not from this
work / or that work / thou shall fall in this horrible syknes / as the
falyng syknes / the frensy / ye pawlsey or the pestylence. On this manner he
spoke to the holy father saint Francys / but he set nothing thereby. but preached
the more / not withstandyng his suttyll suggestions. And also to saint Martyn /
and said that he would never leave him / whyther so ever he went. but he feryd
not his thretenyng / but said thus Du^s mich^ adiutor non timebo vias tuas. God
being my socour and help. I fear not all thy ways / and so he was
confoundyd. These things though they been terryble to every man / yet they be
most vexacion to the ferefull and scrupulous proson / whose conscience by
cause of the fear / and doutfulnes of the same. semyth to consent to such /
and yet yt is not so. Of these terryble suggestions / mocion and fears / the
prophet David spekyth in his psame / where he says and prays on this wise.
^sal. lxiii.
Exaudi deus oratione^ meam cu^ deprecor. a timore inimici eripe animam meam.
Good lord graciously here my prayer / and deliver me from the fere of mine
enemy In an other place also he says. Psalmo. li^
Contristatus su^ in excercitacione mea a voce inimici. etc. Blyssyd lord I am
sore vexyd in mine excercyse / through the voice of mine enemy. And in the.xl.
psalm also Inimici mei dixeru^t mala michi. Mine enemies has spoken to me.
most teryble yuel and ferefull words. upon the which terte saint Austyn
askyth what enemies been these. but our goostly aduarsary the dyuell. And the
ordinary gloss of the same says. These enemies been ye da^pnyd spirits /
which sometime with ferys / and sometime with false joys / troubelyth the
saruantes of christ. But let never any person or parsons be feryd of such
suggestions / that would sarue god. and has a mind thereto / though they be
darkyd in reason sometime. and can not discuss that thing they should. nor se
them self / nor their acts ne life that they have led in time paste. For there
is nothing more necessary to make a man know that of himself he is naught
then these pains / and that all his help comfort and strength is of god. But
such a soul yt is in trouble and pain of te^ptacion / if he cleue in heart
to god. and call to his marcy / he shall never be ouercom. For as saint Gregory
says in his Morals. In all anguyshe of spyrite and te^ptacion / how much so
ever thy senses / reso^. thoughts and deeds ben darkid / and seem not sweet
nor meritorious / as long as in the bottom of thy heart and root of thy will
thou lelyst a contrary inclinacion that thou would not consent / for any
thing / and that such te^ptacions been paynfull to the and not pleasure nor
volutaryly desired. so long thou art safe and not ouercom in that te^ptacion.
Saint Ierom says also. that in such anguyssnes of spyrit / if thou but
suspyre or sygh up to god for marcy / thou art safe in soul. But as saint
Thomas says / better yt were to despise them / for that is a token of great
grace. Every man / says this noble doctor yt resystyth and wrestelyth with
te^ptacion ouercomyth it not. (...)
but he ouercomyth temptacion / yt dispisyth yt and caryth not for yt. but
rather offeryth him self to yt and all other wylfully and gladly for ye love
of god and for the purgacion of his own sins. And such a person in
wrestlyng resystyng or ouercomyng te^ptacion does much meryt. (...)
For as master Duns says. Meryt stondyth not in swetnes and faruour of grace.
but in the enforce and labor of ye comau^deme^t of god. according to the
i^clynacion of grace and charity. For some time ye soul yt has more grace /
has less swetnes and faruoure than he that has less grace. (...)
Gerson says also. that better yt is sometime and more meryt to have a will
clearly by faith to believe / and to have a will strongly to hope in god / and
to have a will with enforse and labor of heart faruently for to love god and
more meryt may be. than without difficulty sometime to have the use of these
foresaid virtues / as we would and after our own will. And this is not only the
sayng of Gerson / but yt is also the comendetermynacion of doctors. Therefore
never dread ne care / what the enemy speak in your soul. for as saint Thomas
says. ^rima secde (...). lxxx.
know ye for a certaynte that he can another create thought nor directly cause
any thought in your mind but as we gave example a fore of the vessel with
muddy watter. he may be occasion of diverse thoughts in our mind. he may
touch ye disshe. that is to say. he may move and touch the instruments of
the sensys. and by the occasion thereof. troble the fantasy / and inclyne yt to
ymagyn many and diverse things / by the reason whereof / the reason of man / for
nigh amyte and affinite. that yt has with the fantasy / considerith the same /
and so yt is to be vnderstondyd that we said before / how the enemy did clatter
and speak in the fantasy and soul of man and none otherwise after this
notable clarke saint Thomas. On this manner he w^ll speak among in the time of
the saruice of god. and enclyne us by his suggestion to consydre things and
matters hard / spoken / seen / thought or wrought / in all the process of our
life / though before they were not in our mind / and also move us to discuss
our life past / and our confessions and say / they be not suffyciently made /
by cause he would let our mind from our dewry. sometime he woll persuade and
entyse us to vayneglory. after resystyng of te^ptacion or other holy meditacion
and prayer. and say / Ah sir. ye be a holy man. and strong in god. ye have
overcome me / ye may be glad and rejoice in heart that I can fasten no
te^ptacion on you. But for all such cautels and false deceytes of the enemy /
keep you ever in mekenes. Do your dewty as your health woll suffer to the
vttermoste. and care not for them. for they can not hurt. And all be yt / that
he say / ye have no merittes / ye be a syner. and offer to you mocions of
infidelyte. and of despair. reason not with him in any wise.

(...) reuyue. and com to him self. Antony consyderyng where he was / and
seeing the company yt was present about him. espied his disciple / and pryuely
made him a sign to com to him and said. Carry me again where I was before. And
so done he cried and provoked the dyuels to com ageyn sayng. Com ageyn ye
theuys. I am the saruant of Jesus criste. do what ye can. I defye you. The
dyuels not beryng this great co^fusyon and dispyte. thought how they might
revenge themself. and gatheryng a great multitude to gether transformyd them
in to the similytudes and lyknes of diverse bestys. and so apperyd to him ageyn
/ whom when he saw. Anon he was lyghtnid with ye light of the holy ghost.
and said to them. I se now ye fere my lord Jesus christ. for one of these
bestes in whose symylitude ye have transformyd your self / were able to
devour me / if yt were the will of my lord Ihu^ crist. but now all the world
may know / that ye may nothing do of your self / but as ye be lycensyd and
permyttyd of my lord Jesus crist. In wose name I defye you all / and so they
confou^dyd / euanysshed a way. And then our lord Jesus apperyd. To whom Antony
said. O lord where have thou been so long? And he answered and said. Certeynly
Antony I was ever with the. But I semyd to wythdrawe my self / for ye I might
prove / how strongly thou would fight for my love. And now for that I se thou
have acquit thy self well and played ye man. I shall make thy name to be
known through out all ye world / wherefore. let never man think / that he is
forsaken of god. Capi. liiii. B
but as the prophet I sai says / yt is but as a little point or prycke. an
instant or moment of time. in ye which god prouyth man. and semyth to torn the
most favorable and sweet countenance of his most blessed vysage from man and to
semble as he had indignacion and were sore displesid with man. And all is be
cause in a little point / he wol prove him. that ever more he may have marcy on
him. And thus to be left of almighty god no faithful saruant of god should
disdain / sith on the same manner the son of god. in our nature / hangyng on
the cross did call and try / to his eternal father sayng. My lord god. Mat.
xxvi
why haste thou thus forsaken me.

Remedies against desperacio^. The.xix. Cha.
WHere also the desperant person says. he can see nothing but his dampnacion
/ and so to fall to despair. O sweet soul beware. what thou say est usurp
not the power of god. Take not on the to discuss the vnscrutable judgments
of god. I wol grant to the yt in time and place it is good a man to remember
dampnacion / and in his meditacion to recou^t with him self as he were before
ye judgment of god reme^bryng his sins. the justice of god. the pains of
hell dew for syn / and such other. But in this beware dyffyne nothing /
another for thy self / ne yet for any other. For if thou despair. or decre
thyn own da^pnacion. thou vsurpyst to dyffyne ye most secret sentence of
god. which angel in heaven does not know but only yt is resaruyd to god. Also
thou do much injury to god / in mystrustynge his marcy. thou make his
marcy no more in thy corrupt fantasy / or mind / then is the marcy of man. or
au^gel. where the marcy of god is infynite and has no end / what spekist thou
man of sins. (...)
As this noble clarke Gerso^ says / if thou hadest shed all the cristian
me^nes blood / that has been shed from the incarnacion of our lord to this
hour. haueyng repentance with a will to be co^fessyd and contryte / for one
supplycacion for marcy / thou may be sauyd and opteyne forgyfnes of god. why
thynkest thou. that our most marcyfull savior Jesus did choose to his singular
famylyarite. Matthew. Peter. Paul. Zache. mari Magdalen and mary the Egipcian /
and the thief and blasphemar that honge on his right side. with i^numerable mo
great syners. that now been holy saints in heaven. but only that thou should
never despair. but ever commit ye to the marcy of god. and to his blyssyd
passion. Or what spekyst thou of merits? sith the wydow / that offrid but.ii.
mytes / was more alowyd. then they yt offryd most of all. for god recou^tyth
not the works so much / as he does the will. where is in case no another
possybylyte. but over all this. ye merits of the passion of crist is
sufficient for us all. The infantes that been newborn / and cristenyd / that
never did good deed. in the merits of the passion of criste been sauyd. I say
not but great multitude and no^bre of merits been good but grace which makyth
man partener of ye passion of christ is sufficient. Master Duns says. that he
merityth much / that in te^ptacion lesyth not ye grace that god has given
him. ^^habeto.
And Gerson says that he has great merits / that has the passion of
crist and a good will to do well. ^ good Exa^^^^ of saint ^^rnard.
He that has these.ii. has great merits / and good suerty / and never
nedyth to be ouercom of ye enemy. For as I read of saint bernard in his
legende. In such a time as he was in great ieobardy of death by syknes / the
enemy came and temptyd him in desperacion / and mouyd him first to consider his
life / and neglygences / and the holy man saw there in much negligence / and
then the enemy did tempte him farther and said / what good deeds or merytes
haste thou done in thy life / or what is all thou have done / in comparison to
ye great and inestimable benefyt of glory. And he / as ever he was meke /
thought all his deeds naught / and so began to fere. and fall to despair.
But anon the holy gooste did lyghten him and gave him his answer. And then he
said. I know that my lord Jesus has dew right to the kingdom of heaven /
by.ii. tytles. one is / by his natural enheritance / sith he is ye eternal son
of god. A another title he has by the merits of his blyssid passion. which
he suffryd / not for him self / but for me and all mankind / and that is
sufficient for me. And so the enemy vanysshed a way. Thus in our death suerty
we have to rest to the passion of crist. which is a save co^ducte to all that
trustyth therein. No man nedyth to fall in to desperacio^. that woll any thing
enclyne himself to ask marcy. For our blyssyd lord is so marcyfull as our
said lord showed to our holy mother saint Birgitt by reuelacion. Libro p^
Capi. lv^ et. lix. F^
and tenderly he louyth the sheep of his fold. that if yt were possible for
him to dye for each one of them a special death. such as he ons did suffer on
the cross for all mankind / rather then he would lose them or any of them /
he would suffer the said special death to redeem them. Roman
For as saint Paul says. Sith he suffered death for mankind / when we were
all his enemies. what wol he do now for us yt he has so dear boughte. with
his preciouse blood. and made us his own children by adopcio^ of grace suerly
rather then he would leave us / if yt were possible / according to the
reuelacion he would dye for us again. But sith he would do this for every
christian man. what think ye he will do for them that leuyth the world and
forsakyth them self for his love and geuyth themself holly to him. as al holy
relygiouse persons. Of whom I wot not what I may say / sith they be so
appropryed to god. that they be only his. and none others (As saint Anselme
says) they must needs have more marcyfull judgment at his hand then any
other. (...)
because they be his only. No man says this holy Doctor / does judge his
own more streygtly / than he does that. which parteynyth to a another.
wherefore all such may have great comfort in our lord / st^^ngly for his love
to wythstond temptacion. And I would exhort every relygiouse parson to the
same. by an example that I read of an holy father that overcame the enemy. and
utterly in manner confou^dyd him. by grace and good wysdom For when the enemy
would tempte him to pride / he would with all his might enforse him to mekenes
when he mouyd him to ire or wroth / then he applied himself strongly to
patience. And so. likewise from Glotony he would declyne to abstinence / and
when he temptyd him to desperacion: he would commyt himself to the marcy of
god / and apply himself to hope. And likewise also when he would tempte him to
scrupulosite / and fear of conscience: then he would enforse himself all to
gyther to charity. and to the holy love of god. which holy love / when yt is
parfyt yt excludith all synystre fearys and yuel dredys.

A conclusion of this Treatise / exhorteynge every parson to the love of god
The.xx. Chapitre.
AND for a fynall conclusyon of this treatise I exhort every relygiouse parson
to behave themself. and apply them specially to the love of god. for therein
restyth all parfeccion. where holy love is. there is only merit / and where it
is not / there is ever error and presu^pcion. If I shall watch / pray / fast
do alms deeds / keep silence / abstinence / sight and contynence. If I had all
the knowledge and graces..ii. Little. xiii.
to do miracles / says saint Paul with all other parfeccions and have not
charity / which is the holy love of god. All the other can not profyt me. All
these said parfeccions must be vsid with a mesure / but the holy love of god.
In manual^ Captlo. x.
as saint Austyne says / has no measure. who may have this holy love and
reuernt famylyaryte with our blyssyd lord / if the spouses of the said lord
have yt not. Read and ye shall never find that our sauyoure christ Jesus
has showed more familyarite / than to holy virgyns and wydowes / as to saint
Kateryn ye martyr / to our holy mother saint Byrgyt / saint Clare / saint
Kateryn of seen with many other / which he spousyd to his grace. they wylfully
forsakeyng the pomp of the world for his holy love. This love is co^paryd to
the oil that the folysshe vyrgyns specyfyed in the Euangely had not. Math. xxv.
what avaylyth yt to have lamps and have no oil. So like wise / what auaylyth
yt to have soulles as vessels apt to grace / and not to have the oil of grace
to replenysshe them. which oil is the holy love of god. Therefore devout
systers / if ye know any parsons dysposyd to Scrupulosyte and seruyle fear.
counseyll and exhort them in our Lord. all such seruyle and synystre fearys
secludyd and put a way holly and only to apply them self to be garnysshyd with
the holy fear and reverence of god / and with his blyssyd love. For in
these.ii. begins and endyth all parfeccion. and these.ii. joins the soul
of man or woman to our lord and savior criste Jesus. whose blyssyd love has
mouyd us to begin this blyssyd treatise / as a directory of the conscience.
which pour exhortacio^ is only after the mind of these forsaid holy
Doctors. And thus we end the said treatise in the holy love of our said
Lord. To whom be ever all honor / holy reverence and love of heart without
end. Amen.
