A Subtle practice, wrought in Paris by Friar Frauncis, who to deceive Friar
Donnet of a sweet skind Nun which he secretly kept, procured him to go to Rome,
where he told the Pope a notable lie concerning the taking of the king of
France prisoner by the Duke de Main:

For which, they whipped each other so grievously in Rome, that they died thereof
within two days after.

LONDON Printed for Thomas Nelson. 1590.

I Have at length (gentle cosen) obtained some leisure to acquaint you with the
condition of my welfare, which I assure you to be far better, then the usual
uncertainty of a traveler. For departing out of England under the right
Honorable the Lord Willoughbies protection, we happily arrived at Deep in
France within a little while after, whence marching unto the frontiers of the
enemy, we shared our fortunes in those famous atchieuements that attended the
stations of the invincible Henry of Burbon, which hot pursuit of Honor once
slackte, I took my way to Caen in Normandy, where I have remained ever since,
in what state you may imagine by my old wont, merry I thank God, how ever the
devil now and then, somewhat youthfully disposed makes a dancing school in
the bottom of my purse for a whole week together. But that's but Fortune de la
guerre, as the knave of clubbes said when he was banished the Town, Wherefore
to come to the purpose of my promise at our parting, (which was to send you
such news as this Country brought forth) so it is that since the late
battle we have had nothing worth the noting, save only this, which is
pleasant to some, though irksome to others. At what time the king lay in
leaguer of Paris against the dastard traitor de Mayn, the said recreant Duke
had amongst his holy orders two wel-fedde Friars, whereof the one was his baudy
ghostly father, and principal confessor, the other was his chuffe-headed
Chaplain, and chief shaueling in ordinary. The first of them (whom they hight
Friar Donnet) was in love with a smugge fast Nun, about some nineteen years
of age, as good a wench as ever hard Mass at high midnight, which fat Francis
espying (for so was the younger called) began likewise to lick his lips
after her, and slauer out his love in sighs as well as he could, but seeing no
way to compass it, as long as his better was in place, and considering what
infinite store of Crowns old Donnet coffered up by confessing in the time
of the Parisians distress, and what credit he was in with the Duke, he cast a
thousand plattes in his head, how to displace him of all three at once, but
none of them all would come off half roundly to his contentment a long time.
In the end it so fell out that Mounsieur Scackerton to revenge his fathers
death, made a little breach into the City, and with some few of his followers
slew many of the League then fast a sleep, in which confused conflict, there
was such a monstrous hurly-burly in the City, that all the town was in an
uproar, and know not what should become of them. Amongst them that feared most
was this foresaid Nun with breathless Donnet, that had her in shrift betwixt
the sheets at the self same hour, which made the quaking Friar call to his
fellow Francis lying in the next chamber, and asked him what was the reason of
that turmoile, who answered he knew not as yet, but he would go and enquire,
within half an hour after, he came in blowing and puffing, and told him a
long tale of a tubbe, how the King entering the City, was taken by a common
soldier, and presented as prisoner to the Duke de Maine, as then in the
market place. Now says he brother Donnet if you will win your spurs for
ever, and behave your self like a right man of God in deed, get you packing
presently to Rome, and be the first that shall tell his holiness of this good
service, so shall you both come to exceeding promotion your self, and be able
to pleasure all your friends as you list. The ravished Friar ouerioyed with this
opportunity, and greedy of Honor and thanks which he hoped to reap by his
message, made no more ado but resigned his office, and sister in bed to
Friar Francis both at once, saying if he never returned his was the gain, for
he knew by inspiration, that great was the preferment which tended his news.
Francis excused himself that the charge was ouermighty for him to go through
with, and that there were many fitter men to under go it then he, yet thrice
it had pleased him of his own free motion, to make ^ho^^ of him before all
other, he would endeavor to discharge it as well as he could. Many words of
kindness to this effect past betwixt them, but the night far spent and
Donnet in have of his journey, reached his pigsney a dry kiss, and so departed
through Aix, by shipping to ^heithen, and from thence took post to Rome,
where he was no sooner alighted, but he roused up his reverence, and new gla^^^
h^^ lips with the linen, that he might kiss the Popes toe with
commendation, wherein he failed not a whitte, for meeting his holiness as he
went to Saint Peter's to hear mass, he ^^^kt down so low as his garters
would let him, and with a ^^^^^es mouth let fly at his slipper. Then began he
with a ^es grace to discourse the late conquest of Leaguer de Maine, against
that Huguenot Henry of Burbon, who in a single combat had overcome him, and
took him prisoner most bravely, to the great advantage of the sea Apostolic,
and utter discom^^^^^^ of all usurping heretics, amplifying by the way of an
^onicall Prosopopeia, what despayring lamentations were made for him, by the
English excommunicats, and the outlawes of Geneua, and in the Epilogue of his
eloquence, her protested such allegiance, as if he would dispute with the
devil in defense of the papacy. The gorgeous controuler of Princes that all this while had attended his speech, attracted such inward joy from this tale of
success, that he commanded Mass to be sung in every church, bone-fires to
be made in the streets, and a solemn procession to be held throughout Rome,
in which he himself marched along to Saint Angelos, under a rich canapy
supported by four Cardinals, sprinkling the beholders with holy water all the
way he went. Neither was Donnet a small property in this pageant, for he had
the bearing of the principallest Cross that day, allotted him in honor of his
travail, whiles these things thus were a doing in Italy, the King entered
battle with de Maine, and by the won^^rful working of Heaven, (as it is not
unknown in England) chased him the field, and made him retire for rescue to
Mentz, in the habit of a common soldier, where it is said he took
sanctuary. Through which accidental mishappe Friar Francis with his Nun now
put to their shifts, and not hearing what was become of the Duke, determined to
try the courtesy of other Countries, since they found so little safety in
their own. But amorous Brigetta, that longed after the first customer,
persuaded him to convert his course unto Rome, whereto he easily condiscended.
As they were thus on their way, the Duke du Maine, despairing in his auckward
proceedings, and quite confounded in his forlorn cheualry, wrote lamentable
letters to his holiness, by one Mounsier Below a french man, wherein he
passionately reported his ill fortune, and dismal discomfiture, cursing the
stars that did boade him such bitter mishap, and the day that gave light to
that luckelesse disgrace. These letters came to the Pope in the midst of this
triumphs and honors done to Friar Donnet, that now was in good hope to be
Cardinal. But he came short of his longing, for when his beatitude beheld this
balefull discourse, and with throbbing heart had perused those pitiful
contents, he called me his messenger in question, who with trembling told him,
that whatsoever he had reported proceeded from one Friar Francis, that had thus
informed him, and that he knew of nothing but by him. By this time was the
said Francis with his Nun come to Rome, and there thought to anchor secure
from all encombraunces of war, but alack for pity, that might not be, his
partner had espide him, and he must needs come before the Pope, where being
examined upon the cause and the Dukes letter shown in the nicke, he was so
confounded in his five senses, that straight he confessed all the knavery, and
appealed to the court for mercy. Yet notwithstanding there conjoined
submission, they were adjudged for penance of their presumption, to go
barefoote and barelegde through Rome, and whip each other with whippes of wier
up and down the City, which the day following he performed very
faithfully. For Friar Donnet angerd at the heart at Friar Francis, to hear his
treacherous conueyance about the Nun, cursed him self a thousand times that
he had not a two hand whippe to torment him, yet with that short weapon that he
had, he belabored him indifferently, and Francis on the other side wounded him
with his wiry wasters so well fauoredly, that his back spat blood in his face at
every stripe he gave him, who so has seen two iackes in a clockhouse striking
hie noone with their opposite hammers may well conceive this anticke
resemblance. Donnet he behaved himself like an old Fencer, that fetches his
blow with a flourish, one while setting his right leg forward as though he
lay at back-sworde, he would aim at a boane in stead of a button, anotherwhile
framing his toe to the turn, he would bring his whippe about his head with a
whiske, and pierce through his thick skin coat into the inner regions of
his ribs. Francis thinking this was very foul play to come behind a man and
strike him like a coward, and finding by proof how painful it was to dance
to this three stringed music, raised up himself on all ten like a gander,
and gave him such an item over the shoulders, that he had littie need of any
other Phlebothome in two months after, for it came so edglong, that it
discarded all the skin from the neck to the middle, and put Donnet besides his
fence with the sudden amazement, yet casting his eyes on his sweet Nun that
went along by them he fell to it a fresh, and made such furrous in his fat
brothers flesh, as a man might have seen through the flesh to the bones: and
he likewise laid such load on my confessors curets, that he lost above two
lash of wire in the loins of his back, whose rawbond ridges showed in all
points so like a red lattice, that if a tincker had seen them he would
undoubtedly have mistook him for an alehouse. To be short, in this mutual
combat continued they for the space of three hours, till the weariness of
their strength and extremity of anguish, constrained them to rest. But so
unspeakable was their pain (as it is reported here in Caen) that what with
sorrow for their fault, and shame of their punishment they dyed within two
days after. Thus have you heard in as brief sort as I could, the
cometragicall history of these unfortunate Friars, which is so laughed at
here, and so much moned elsewhere. When I have more news I will send you more,
in the mean time be merry with this, which I assure you for the substance of
it is true, although it fail in some circumstance, and so for this time I take
my leave, hoping to see you ere long in England.

From Caen in Normandy by your friend. L. R.
