Stripping, Whipping, and Pumping: OR, The Five mad Shavers of Drury Lane.
WIthin the large Circumference of this great Theater, and Stage of the World,
all people, Kingdoms, and Nations, Males or Females, of all ages and degrees,
are Actors of such parts as they have studied, either from the Rules and
Inspirations of Virtue, or from their own inclinations, and Satan's
suggestions to Vice. And the Devil w^ll knowing our frail and weak
conditions and instability, does every day and hour (like a cunning Iugler or
a Gipsy) devise new Tumbling casts and feats of Activity (...) allure and
delight the minds of as many as he finds to be addicted to take pleasure in
his Le^gerdemaine. He gives a false sweete-seeming relish to the Drunkards
Cup, he ^ars the Glut^on against the day of slaughte^, he tips the Blaspheamers
tongue with Oaths and Curses, he whers the Slanderers and backbiters speech,
and makes it keen and cutting; he teaches the rare and ancient Ar^ of Lying,
(and has (...) innumerable ^umber of apt (...) Scholl^^s) he turns
ang(...)venge, Revenge into Murd(...) to Impie^y, Truth into Theft^ Love into
Jealousy, Jealousy into hatred and madness; and (in a word) to sum up all
together, the Devil does labou^ daily, and all his endeavor is wholly bent to
make work for the Hangman, and draw souls to his Infernal Kingdom.

And amongst all the ^icks and sleights which this Grand cunning Master of
mischief does use, to bring us to destruction with all, there is no one policy
of his that is more prevalent and advantageous to him, than is the sowing of
discord and debate betwixt Man and Wife; and although he has a thousand
innumerable ways for the effecting of his damnable projects and purposes, yet
Jealousy is the chief and maine Engine to bring it so to pass, that modesty
shall be turned into madness, peace into strife, and love into hatred and
mischief, as shall be showed in this short following Treatise.

About the latter end of August last, 1638. this hellish fire of Jealousy did
most strangely inflame five Women, whom my Pen should not name, nor should they
be known by any writing of mine, but that they and their mad and barbarous
proceedings are too much true, and too many ways scattred and spread abroad by
sundry Pens and Tongues, some of them making the matter that was (and is) bad
enough already, worse; some mincing it, to make it better; some for affection,
some for malice; some for flattery, and some as their idle and various humors
please, do report it as they list to frame it, not caring whether they speak
or write truth or falsehood. The matter has been Rim'd upon beyond Reason,
and therefore I hold it Reason it should be related with truth, and thus it was.

At the time, or near the time aforesaid, one Master Evans, a Barber in
Drury Lane, did chance to meet with one Ioane Ilsley in the Street, and
belike the woman had formerly kept the said Evans his wife when she lay in
Childbed, in which season (of Gander-month or Wander-month) perhaps the
suspicious woman began to be a little inkindled with the sparkles of jealousy:
but suspicion is no proofe^ but Evans afterward, when he by chance once met
the woman, offered her ^ Pint of Wine, which after some d^nyall was at last
accepted: So in they went to a Tavern (the Sign of the Phoenix) n^^re the
lower end of Drury Lane, behind, or on the backside of the Bell, which is an
Inn and a Tavern in the Eastern part of the Strand: But they being over
their one Pint, in a low Room, and a Drawer standing at the Tables end, the
one sitting on one side of the Board, and the other on the other side, so that
there neither was nor could be any immodesty said or done at that time: but
some busie-body or other went and told Evans his wife, that her Husband was at
the Tavern drinking with Ioane Ilsley, whereupon she went in a heat to the
Phoenix, and found them there, upon whom she bestowed such hot and hasty
language as her tongue could afford, which made them break company, (some of
the words were, she told the said Ioane that she was naught with her Husband)
But some few days after, Mistress Evans (being still jealously angry) did
break her mind to some women, her neighbors, and withal made a show to
Ioane that her anger was past against her, so that agreement was made, that a
Pigge should be eaten at Mistress Evans her house at night, and that in a fair
seeming way Ioane Ilsly should be sent for as a loving guest invited to the
Pigge.

At the time appointed the Pigge was roasted, and the women dissembled, were
assembled, and simple Ioane was sent for, who (poor wench) not suspecting the
sharpness or sowernesse of the Feast, suspecting nothing, went to them, and
being come amongst them, they seemed very friendly and courteously to
entertain and bid her welcome: to whom Mistress Evans said, (...) prithee
Ioane, thou art well acquainted with my house, go up into the upper Chamber,
and fetch down some stools for us to sit on, so innocent Ioane went quickly
up the stairs for stools, and presently there followed her three of the five
Women, to wit, Evans Wife, one Cox his Wife, and one Fosters Wife; these three
had with them a per^iworth of Birchin Rods, after whom followed the other two,
to wit, one Smiths wife a Broker, and one Mistress Lee a widow, then they
began to revile her in most strange manner, and withal to lay hands on her,
to pluck her clothes violently off from her body, but she resisted and
strived and strugled with them as long as she could, till at last they tore her
apparel off from her, then having her naked, they began their execution,
some to hold her, and some to whippe her, so that the smart, and their harsh
usage enforced her to begin to cry; which they perceiving stopped her mouth
^ith a clout or a handkerchiefe: Then ^the first pennyworth of rods being
wasted to the st^mps they fetched, or sent for two pennyworth more^ and after
they had whipped them out upon her, they sent for one pennyworth more: (still
stopping her mouth, that her crying might not be heard) She being thus naked,
and all gore-bloody, they called up (...) bade him bring up a Basin of water, and
a Razor, which the boy did; but when he came within the Chamber door he was
abashed and ashamed, and threw down the Razor and Basin, running down the
stairs as fast as he could: the one of the women took up the Razor, meaning
to do I know not what with it. But Ioane being used thus harshly by them, and
in bodily fear of some worse abuse, did strive against them, in which scuming
she received a cut, or wound in her back, near the shoulder, with the Razor.

This extremity being past, these Women (if I may so call them) had (...) much
modesty as to make fast (...) Apron, or half a Kir^^e before her, over the
forepart of her body, and as she was, being cut, whipped, and all bloody over,
they haled and thrust her down the stairs, and pumped her at a Pumpe which
was in Evans his back ^ide: after that they thrust her into the street, (i^
being between ten, and eleven of the Clock at night) and from the street (or
Dr^ry Lane) they pulled and ^ug^^her (with her hair about her ears) into a
Court called Reine-Deere Court, where at a Pumpe they held her under the spout,
and pumped Water upon her, and used her more shamefully than is fit to write
of, still stopping her mouth with a clout^ also in the Yard, at the last Pumpe,
there were two men that did abuse her, one Smith was one: but she striving
with them had her Kirtle or Apron torn off from her, so ^^at she had nothing
to cover her ^^rkasse, but the darkness of the Night.

At last this bu^ling was overheard by an honest Coachman, whose name is
Thomas Finch, who marvailing what it might be that made such a stir at that
time of night: he and his Wife coming to the Pumpe, finding a Woman in such a
pitiful plight, so handled by such rough and pitiless Creatures, he (in
humanity) rescued her from them, and suddenly plucked off his Horse-mans Coat,
and coverd her nakedness: whereupon her Adversaries (or lawless executioners)
all forsook her, and dispers't themselves, it is no great matter whither.

The Coachman demanded of the poor abused creature what she was, and
wherefore they had used her so cruelly: and she answered, that she was a poor
young Woman that did get her living by Nursing and keeping of Childe-bed Women,
and also that sometimes she did attend and kee^^ sick folks, and that she at
that ti^^ was a Keeper or Waiter on a si^ke Gentleman (a Captain) at the sign
of the Helmet in the Strand: he asked her further where her clothes were, and
wherefore those women had used her so? and she answered him, that they had
torn and rent her clothes in pie^es, and also that she had five shillings of
money in one of her Pockets: whereupon the Coachman did pity her hard estate
and usage, and withal did bring her presently home to the aforesaid Sign of
the Helmet, where she dwelt, and does remain yet to this twelfth of October,
1638. being much bruised and hurt, and spets blood.

Now Reader I imagine you have not heard of such a mad crew of Shavers,
Whippers, and politic Pumpers; nor do I think that any Pen, or relation
of tongue or History does mention the like.

After she had recoverd a little ^^rength, she procured Warrants from (...)
Justice of the Peace; which when the matter was heard and understood, they were
bound all of them to answer for this outrage to the Woman, the spoiling of her,
and her Apparel, and the loss of her money; but they did put in good Bail
for their appearance at the Sessions, and on the eight and twentieth of
September they went to Westminster to save their Bail and Recognisence:
(Quarter Sessions being then holden there) from which trial, they have by a
Writ of Sursarara removed their cause up to the right honorable Court of Kings
Bench, but as they were returning homeward, some women (belike that had heard
of their desperate and unmannerly exployts) as soon as they saw them pass did
rail on them, and revile them most scoldingly eloquent; and withal so
embroydered them with dirt, which they cast at them, that they seemed more like
Ladies of the soil, than women of any mean degree. And thus have these five
foolish women run^^ themselves into six pecks of trouble: How it will be
answered and ended time will show, if the Reader has the patience to stay so
long.

These are the fruits of mad-braind, Hare-braind, shallow-braind jealousy; for
as the Pedigree of cure (or remedy) may be thus delineated: Itch begat Scratch
^ Scratch was the Father of Scabbe; Scabbe begat Sore, to whom Smart succeeded;
then Smart was the Father of Pain; Pain begat Grief, who was the Sire of
Care, and Care begat Cure: So Idle thoughts are the fathers of Whisperings;
Whisperings begat Prattling, Babbling, Talking, Lying, Slandering; these Mongrels
are for the most part begotten at Gossippings, and are the incurable Issues or
Fistulaes of wicked minds: from them Fame sends out Rumor, Report, and
Hearsay; and they set Malice, Backebiting, and Slander on work, who are so
double diligent in their damnable Devices, that they do never cease working,
till such time as they have h^led Jealousy by the ears out of the Dungeon of
Hell: and sure there is no Tiger or Bear when they are robbed, or bereaved of
their Whelps, so divelish mad as a jealous man or woman.

It has been indeed too often known that Beauty has been the ruin of
Chastity, (if grace guide and guard it not) and as the flattery of men may
overcome the weakness of women, so the wiles and snares of subtle Strumpets
have entangled and ruined too many men; for ^ole, Deianeira, and Omphale, were
too hard for Hercules, and one of them made him lay by his Club, and fall to
spinning with a Dista^fe. The Queen of Love subdued the god of War, and the
same Venus naked, did foil Pallas who was armed on Mount Ida: and whosoever
he be that sowes kisses on such lips as are lasciviously manured with the dung
of temptation, shall be sure to reap (...) Harvest either of contempt,
diseases, beggary, and defamation; for the world is full of examples and
presiden^s of many thousand, that have reaped such a crop as they have sown.

That man that is yoked with a scold, that will be jealous without cause;
o^^ly because she will be so; and for that surmise and slander she like a
Devil does make her house her Husbands continual Hell: Surely such a man is
partly happy, if withal he has the virtue of Patience, (as wife Socrates had
with his Xantippe) for he that is matched with such a Fiend, has no need to
care where he goes, nor what society he keeps; nor has he reason to be afraid
of any harm that any wicked company can do him, for the Devil himself will
not hurt him that is matched with one of his Sister. But if any shuttle-witted
fellow, that is wedded to a chaste and modest woman, and is so far troubled
with a wild buzzing ^^d-flye in his brains, that he nothing but dreams of
supposed invisible Horns, such a kind of Cacadudgeon C^xcombe, does justly
deserve to have been matched to a wench whose heels had been lighter than
his head, and then he might meritoriously have made a Comb of a Fire-forke,
and worn an Oxe-feather in his Hat without wrong or injury: in a word, there
is nothing can grieve or torment the heart either of a good man or woman, than
to find their truth, constancy, loyalty, and honest integrity suspected or
questioned; for let it be truly weighed and considered, what hurt or occasion
of suspicion can be for a man to give a woman a part of one Pint of wine, in an
open low room in a public Tavern? it is not to be doubted but such
accidents do happen daily, at the least a thousand, and yet for all that there
is not one Whore or Cuckold the more: but when as rashness adds waxen wings
(like those of Icarus) of indiscretion and inconsideration, and that either the
man or the woman are mounted or soared aloft to the height of Love-killing
hell-borne jealousy, then does the furious heat and flame of rage melt those
deceitful and suspicious wings, wings whereby the jealous party drops and
tumbles down headlong into the bottomless Ocean of irreperable disgrace and
infamy.

The envy and inveterate hate of wicked women is almost past thought; Envy is
the mistress of injustice; it stirs and inciteth both the thought and the
hand to all ill and wicked actions: and that envy which is secret and hidden,
is more to be feared than that which is open and manifest: such was the secret
malice of this Barbers wife, whose jealousy did burn a great while within
her, and at length her envy did burst out into a flame, and so has brought
ruin and disgrace to her and her Husband, which is so far distant: And if
any woman be so full of wrath and revengefull as this woman is, and her
associates, and especially if they know that they have power of command, or
authority, they will soon bring all to destruction: for they will plot either
to poison, stob, or else some there way make their will and passions their Law:
and therefore I advise all to learn this saying, rather to be afraid of that
renown and credit which is dishonest and shameful, for they plotted this
business, because they would he talked on hereafter. Suppose this I^^^e had
been guilty of a fault, must these Women be their own revengers, their own
witnesses, their own Judges? must they have the Law in ^^eir own hands, thus
to usurpe^ (...) wholesome Laws, and make havo^^ of a woman in this un^ill
mann^^^ Women shall I call them nay, rather monsters: or else some evil
spirit in their shapes, to commit such inhumane and unnatural acts as these:
such actions they be that are past example, nay; never the like heard of, to
commit such uncivil actions, and upon their own Sex, whose civil carriage
should be example to the younger sort; their actions were such, as I said
before, that I blush to relate them, and ought not to be divulged no louder
than a whisper: The Heathens that knew not God would not have done the like:
nay, the wild beasts of the wilderness would have pursued to death such
beasts as rapin'd and live upon the spoil of other beasts; they themselves
punish, and shall these creatures hate these acts which a Christian commits,
and we commit them? but their punishment no doubt will be inflicted upon them
according to their deserts; and my second part, which I will shortly publish,
shall show their confessions and their punishments: And so I end this Relation,
wishing their sufferings may be an example to others, that none dare attempt
such uncivil and immodest actions hereafter.

FINIS.
