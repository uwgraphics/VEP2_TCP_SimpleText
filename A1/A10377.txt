And of the true motives and inducements which occasioned His Majesty to

LONDON, Printed by BONHAM NORTON and JOHN BILL, Printers to the Kings most
Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XVIII.

ALthough KINGS be not bound to give Account of their Actions to any but GOD
alone; yet such are his MAJESTY'S proceedings, as he has always been
willing to bring them before Sun and Moon, and careful to satisfy all his
good people with his Intentions and courses, giving as well to future times as
to the present, true and vndisguised Declarations of them; as judging, that for
Actions not well founded, it is advantage to let them pass in uncertain
Reports; but for Actions, that are built upon sure and solid grounds, (such as
his Majesty's are) it belongs to them, to be published by open manifests:
Especially his Majesty is willing, to declare and manifest to the World, his
proceedings in a case of such a nature as this which follows is; since it not
only concerns his own people, but also a foreign Prince and State abroad.

Accordingly therefore, for that which concerns Sir Walter Raleigh late
executed for Treason (leaving the thoughts of his heart, and the protestations
that he made at his death to God that is the searcher of all hearts, and Judge
of all Truth) his Majesty has thought fit to manifest unto the world, how
things appeared unto himself, and upon what Proofs and evident Matter, and
the Examination of the Commanders that were employed with him, in the Voyage,
(and namely of those which Sir Walter Raleigh himself by his own Letter to
Secretary Winwood, had commended for persons of special worth and credit, and
as most fit for greater employments) his Majesty's proceedings have bin
grounded, whereby it will evidently appear how agreeable they have been in
all points to Honor and Justice.

SIR Walter Raleigh having been condemned of high Treason, at his Majesty's
entrance into this Kingdom, and by the space of fourteen years, by his
Majesty's princely Clemency and Mercy, not only spared from his Execution, but
permitted to live, as in Libera custodia in the Tower, and to enjoy his Lands
and Living, till all was by Law euicted from him upon another ground, and not
by forfeiture; (which notwithstanding, his Majesty out of his abundant Grace
gave him a competent satisfaction for the same) at length, he fell upon an
Enterprise of a golden Mine in Guiana.

This proposition of his, was presented and recommended to his Majesty by Sir
Ralph Winwood, then Secretary of State, as a matter not in the Air, or
speculatiue, but real, and of certainty; for that Sir W. Raleigh had seen of
the Oar of the Mine with his eyes, and tried the richness of it. It is true,
that his Majesty, in his own princely judgment, gave no belief unto it;
as well, for that his Majesty was verily persuaded, that in Nature there are no
such Mines of gold entire, as they described this to be; and if any such had
been, it was not probable that the Spaniards, who were so industrious in the
chase of Treasure, would have neglected it so long; as also for that it
proceeded from the person of Sir Wall. Raleigh, invested with such circumstances
both of his disposition and fortune: But nevertheless Sir W. Raleigh had so
enchanted the world, with his confident asseueration of that which every man
was willing to believe, as his Majesty's honor was in a manner engaged, not to
deny unto his people the adventure and hope of so great Riches, to be sought
and achieved, at the charge of Voluntaries; especially, for that it stood with
his Majesty's Politic and Magnanimous courses, in these his flourishing times
of peace, to nourish and encourage Noble and Generous enterprises, for
Plantations, Discoueries, and opening of new Trades.

Hereupon the late Spanish Ambassador, the Count de Gondomar, took great
alarm, and represented unto his Majesty by loud and vehement assertions, upon
iterated audiences, that he knew and had discovered the intention and
enterprise of Sir W. Raleigh to be but Hostile and Piraticall, and tending to
the breach of the Peace between the two Crowns, and danger and destruction of
the King his Masters Subjects in those parts; protesting in a sort against the
same. To which his Majesty's answer always was, that he would send Sir Walter
Raleigh with a limited Commission, and that he durst not upon peril of his
head attempt any such matter; and if he did, he would surely do justice upon
him, or send him bound hand and foot into Spain, and all the gold and goods he
should obtain by Robbery, and bring home, were they never so great. And for
further caution, his Majesty enjoined Secretary Winwood, to urge Sir Walter
Raleigh upon his conscience, and allegiance to his Majesty, to deal
plainly, and express himself, whether he had any other intention, but only
to go to those golden Mines in Guiana, which he not only solemnly protested
unto the said Sir Ralph Winwood, but by him writ a close letter to his
Majesty, containing a solemn profession thereof, confirmed with many vehement
asseuerations, and that he never meant or would commit any outrages or spoils
upon the King of Spaines Subjects. But notwithstanding, his Majesty acquainted
the Spanish Ambassador with this his protestation; yet the said Ambassador
would never recede from his former jealousy, and importuning his Majesty to
stay his voyage, alleging that the great number of ships that Sir Walter
Raleigh had prepared for that voyage, showed manifestly, that he had no such
peaceable intent; and offering (upon Sir Walter Raleigh his answer thereunto,
that those ships were only provided for his safe conuoy) that if Sir Walter
Raleigh would go with one or two ships only to seek the said Mine, that he
would move the King of Spain to send two or three ships with him back again
for his safe conuoy hither with all his gold; And the said Ambassadors person
to remain here in pledge for the King his Master his performance thereof. But
such were the constant fair Offers of the said Sir Walter Raleigh, and
specious promises, as his Majesty in the end rejected the importunate Suit of
the said Spanish Ambassador for his stay, and resolved to let him go: but
therewithal took order, both that he, and all those that went in his
company, should find good security, to behave themselves peaceably toward
all his Majesty's Friends and Allies; and to observe strictly all the Articles
of the Commission, which his Majesty for that cause, had the greater care to
have it well and clearly penned, and set down. And that his Majesty's honest
intention may herein the better appear, the words of the Commission are
herein inserted, as follows.

JAMES, by the grace of GOD, etc. To all to whom these presents shall come, to
be read, heard, or seen, and to every of them greeting. Whereas Sir W.
Raleigh Knight, intends to undertake a voyage by Sea and shipping, unto the
South parts of America, or elsewhere within America, possessed and inhabited by
heathen and savage people, to the end to discover and find out some commodities
and merchandises in those Countries, that be necessary and profitable for the
Subjects of these Our Kingdoms and Dominions, whereof the Inhabitants there
make little or no use or estimation; whereupon also may ensue by trade and
commerce, some propagation of the Christian Faith, and reformed Religion
amongst those savage and Idolatrous people: And whereas We are credibly
informed that there are diverse Merchants and Owners of Ships, and others, well
disposed to assist the said Sir Walter Raleigh in this his enterprise, had
they sufficient assurance to enjoy their due parts of the profits returned (in
respect of the peril of Law wherein the said Sir Walter Raliegh now
stands:) And whereas also We are informed, that diverse other Gentlemen, the
kinsmen and friends of the said Sir Walter Raleigh, and diverse Captains and
other Commanders are also desirous to follow him, and to adventure their lives
with him, in this his Journey, so as they might be commanded by no other then
himself.

Know ye, that We, upon deliberate consideration had of the premises, being
desirous by all ways and means to work and procure the benefit and good of
Our loving Subjects, and to give Our Princely furtherance to the said Sir
Walter Raleigh, his friends and associates herein, to the encouragement of
others in the like laudable Iourneys and enterprises, to be hereafter
prosecuted and pursued; and especially in advancement and furtherance, as well
of the conversion of savage people, as of the increase of the Trade, Traffic,
and Merchandises used by Our Subjects of this Our Kingdom, being most famous
throughout all Nations: Of Our special grace, certain knowledge, and mere
motion, have given and granted, and by these presents for Us, Our Heirs, and
Successors, do give and grant unto the said Sir W. Raleigh, full power and
authority, and free license and liberty out of this Our Realm of England or
any other Our Dominions, to have, carry, take, and lead, for and toward his
said intended voyage into the said South parts, or other parts of America
(possessed and inhabited, as aforesaid) and to travel thither, all such and
so many of Our loving Subjects, or any others strangers that will become Our
loving Subjects, and live under Our obeisance and allegiance as shall
willingly accompany him, with sufficient Shipping, Armor, Weapons, Ordinance,
Munition, Powder, Shot, Habiliments, Victuals, and such Wares and Merchandises,
as are esteemed by the wild people in those parts, clothing, implements,
furniture, cattle, horses, and mares, and all other such things as he shall
think most necessary for his voyage, and for the use and defense of him and
his company, and trade with the people there; and in passing and returning to
and fro, and in those parts to give away, sell, barter, exchange, or otherwise
dispose of the same goods, merchandises and premises to the most benefit, and
at the will and pleasure of the said Sir Walter Raleigh and his company, and
such other person or persons, as shall be adventurers or assista^ts with, or unto
him in this his intended voyage, and from thence to return, import, convey, and
bring into this our kingdom, or any other Our Dominions, such gold, silver,
bullion, or any other wares, or merchandises, or commodities whatsoever, as
they shall think most fit and convenient; and the same being so returned,
imported, conveyed, and brought into this our Kingdom, or any other our
Dominions, to have, take, keep, retain, and convert to the only proper use,
benefit, and behoof of the said Sir W. Raleigh and his said Company, and other
persons adventurers and assistants with or to him in this voyage, without the
let, interruption, molestation, and disturbance of Us, Our Heirs or
Successors, or any the Officers or Ministers of Us, Our Heirs or Successors
whatsoever, Paying and answering unto Us, Our Heirs, and Successors the full
fifth part in five parts to be divided, of all such gold, and silver, and
bullion, and oar of gold or silver, and pearl, and precious stone, as shall be
so imported over and besides, and together with such Customs, Subsidies and
other duties, as shall be due for or in respect of any other Goods, Wares, or
Merchandises whatsoever to be imported by the true meaning of these presents.
And to the end the said Sir W. Raleigh may be the more encouraged to go forward
in this his enterprise, and all our loving Subjects desirous to be adventurers
with him or assistant unto him, may be the more incited to further his
proceedings: We do hereby in verbo Regio, for Us, Our Heirs and Successors,
covenant, promise, and grant, to and with the said Sir W. Raleigh and all other
persons that shall accompany him or to be attendant upon him, or to be
adventurers or assistants with or to him in this his voyage, that no gold,
silver, goods, wares, or merchandises whatsoever of what kind or sort soever,
by him or them or any of them to be imported into this Our Kingdom of
England, or any other our Dominions from any the said South or other parts of
America, (possessed or inhabited as aforesaid) shall be attached, seized or taken
by Us, Our Heirs or Successors, or to the use of Us, Our Heirs or
Successors, or by any the Officers or Ministers of Us, Our Heirs or
Successors whatsoever; But that the same and every of them (the fifth part of
the said gold, silver or bullion, and oar of gold and silver and pearl and
precious stone, and other the Customs and duties aforesaid being truly
answered and paid) shall be, and remain to the sole and proper use and
behoof of the said Sir W. Raleigh and his said company, and such persons as
shall be adventurers with him, or assistant to him in this his voyage, Any Law,
Statute, Act of Parliament, Proclamation, Provision, or restraint, or any
right, title or claim of Us, Our Heirs or Successors, or any other matter or
thing whatsoever to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding. And further, of
Our more especial grace, certain knowledge, and mere motion, We do hereby
for Us, Our Heirs, and Successors, ordain, constitute and appoint the said
Sir W. Raleigh to be the sole Governor and commander of all persons that shall
travel, or be with him in the said voyage, to the said South, or other parts
of America (so possessed and inhabited as aforesaid) or in returning from
thence. And We do hereby give unto him, full power and authority to correct,
punish, pardon, govern and rule them or any of them, according to such orders,
ordinances, constitutions, directions, and instructions, as by the said Sir W.
Raleigh shall be from time to time established, as well in cases capital and
criminal, as civil, both Marine and other; So always as the said statutes,
ordinances and proceedings (as near as conveniently may be) be agreeable to
the Laws, Statutes, Government and Policy of this our Realm of England, and
not against the true Christian faith now professed in the Church of England.
And because that in such and the like enterprises and voyages, great
inconveniences have grown by the mutinous and disorderly carriage of the
Mariners and Saylors employed in the same, for want of sufficient authority
to punish them according to their offenses: We do therefore by these presents
for Us, our Heirs and Successors, give full power and authority to the said
Sir Walter Raleigh, in case of rebellion, or mutiny by sea or land, to use and
exercise Marshall law (upon just ground and apparent necessity) in as large and
ample manner as Our Lieutenant General by sea or land, or Our Lieutenants in
Our Counties, within Our Realm of England, have, had, or ought to have by force
of their Commission of Lieutenancie. And We do further by these presents,
give full power and authority to the said Sir Walter Raleigh, to collect,
nominate and appoint such Captains and other inferior Commanders and Ministers
under him, as shall be requisite for the better ordering and governing of his
company, and the good of the voyage. And further, We do by these presents,
for Us, Our Heirs and Successors, straightly charge and Command the Warden of
Our Cinque Ports, and all the Customers, Comptrollers, Surueyers, Serchers,
Waiters and other Officers and Ministers of Us, Our Heirs and Successors for
the time being, that they, and every of them do quietly permit and suffer the
said Sir Walter Raleigh, and all person and persons that shall be willing to
travel and adventure with him in this voyage with their Ships, Munition,
Goods, Wares and Merchandises whatsoever out of this Our Realm, or any other
Our Dominions, to pass into the said South or other parts of America,
(possessed and inhabited as aforesaid) and from thence to return and import
into this Our Realm, or any other our Dominions, any Goods, Wares or
Merchandises whatsoever, and there to sell or otherwise to dispose of the same,
to the best benefit and advantage, and to the only use and behoof of the said
Sir Walter Raleigh and his company, and such other persons as shall be
adventurers with him in this voyage, paying the fifth part of all gold and
silver, bullion, and oar of gold and silver, and of pearl and precious stone
imported, and other the Customs and Duties aforesaid. And these Presents, or
the inrollement thereof shall be unto the said Warden of the Cinque Ports,
Customers, Comptrollers and other the officers and ministers aforesaid, for the
time being a sufficient Warrant and discharge in that behalf. And our Will and
pleasure is; And by these presents, for Us, our Heirs and Successors, We do
grant unto the said Sir Walter Raleigh, That these our Letters Patents, or the
Inrollement thereof, and all and singular grants, clauses and things therein
contained, shall be firm, strong, sufficient and effectual in Law, according to
our gracious pleasure and meaning herein expressed; Any Law, Statute, Act,
Provision, Ordinance or restraint, or any other matter or thing to the
contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding. Although express mention etc.
In Witness whereof etc. Witness our self at Westminster, the six and
twentieth day of August, in the fourteenth year of our Reign of England,
France and Ireland, and of Scotland the fiftieth.

Per breue de priuato Sigillo.
THis Commission so drawn and framed (as as you see) his Majesty himself did
often peruse and reuise, as foreseeing the future events; the tenor whereof
appears to be so far from giving Sir Walter Raleigh warrant, or color to
invade any of the Territories, occupate and possessed by the Spaniards, as it
tended to a direction, rather of commerce, then spoil, even toward the
Savages themselves. And the better to contain Sir Walter Raleigh, and to hold
him upon his good behavior, his Majesty denied (though much sued unto for the
same) to grant him pardon for his former treasons, both to disauthorise him
with those, that were under his Command, (in case he should attempt to exceed
his Commission) and to reserve him to the Justice of the Law, if by new
offenses he should make himself indigne of former mercies. And as for the
good security which his Majesty ordered to be taken, for their good and
peaceable behavior in the voyage; his Majesty never heard any thing to the
contrary but that it was performed till they were upon their parting; and then
was it told him, that every one of the principals that were in the voyage, had
put in security one for another, which if his Majesty had known in time, he
would never have accepted of.

But howsoever the Commission was penned; and whatsoever the cautions were
which his Majesty intended or used, and whatsoever the protestations and
promises were, that Sir Walter Raleigh made or exhibited, it appears
plainly, by the whole sequel of his Actions, that he went his own way, and
had his own ends: First, to procure his liberty, and then to make new
fortunes for himself, casting abroad only this tale of the Mine as a lure to
get adventurers and followers; having in his eye the Mexico Fleet, the sacking
and spoil of Towns planted with Spaniards, the depredation of Ships, and such
other purchase; and making account, that if he returned rich, he would ransom
his offenses (little looking into the nature and Character of his Majesty's
Justice and government) and if otherwise, he would seek his fortune by flight,
and new enterprises in some foreign Country.

In execution therefore of these his designs, Sir Walter Raleigh carrying the
reputation of an active, witty, and valiant Gentleman, and especially of a
great Commander at Sea, by the inticement of this golden bait of the Mine, and
the estimation of his own name, drew unto him many brave Captains, and other
Knights and Gentlemen of great blood and worth, to hazard and adventure their
lives, and the whole, or a great part of their estates and fortunes in this his
Voyage: whose ruins and decays following, remain as sad and grievous
relics and monuments of his unfortunate journey, and unfaithful proceedings.

But before he went from London, he was not so reserved, nor so constant unto
his pretense of the Mine, but that some sparks brake forth of that light,
which afterward appeared. For he cast forth some words to some particular
friends of his Company, That he knew a Town in those parts, upon which he
could make a saving Voyage in Tobacco, though there were no other spoil.
Nevertheless, to make the better faith of that he had given out touching the
Mine, he promised his Company at London, that when he came to Plymouth, he
would take a great company of Pioners out of the West, (where best workmen are
of that kind) and he maintained this his pretense so far, as he billited
the said Pioners for several ships; but when he came into the West this
vanished. For it is testified of all parts, and by himself confessed, that he
carried none at all, excusing it, that there were many other tall men of the
Mariners, and common Soldiers, that he would have made fall to work; which is
a slender excuse of omitting so principal a point. As for Pickeaxes, Mattockes
and Shouels for the working of the Mine, it is true he carried some small
quantity for a show, but by the judgment of all that were in his company,
nothing near sufficient for that which had been requisite for the working of
the Mine, which be excused only by saying, that his men never saw them
vnpacked, and that the Mine was not past a foot and a half under ground.

After, when he was once at Sea, he did not much labor to nourish and
maintain the belief, that be meant to make his voyage upon the profit of the
Mine, but fell a degree, as if it were sufficient to bring home certainty and
visible proof, that such a Mine there was, though he brought not the riches
of it. For soon after his setting forth from Ireland, he professed, that if
he brought home but a handful or basketfull of Oar, to show the King, he
cared for no more, for it was enough to save his credit; and being charged
therewith, he confessed the speech, with this argument and inference, that if
there had been a handful of the Mine, it followed there was a Mine to be
confessed; as if so many Ships, so many lives of men, such charge of
provisions, and such an honorable Commission, had been but for an experiment.

About the same time likewise, he began to forget his Commission, as well as his
pretenses of the Mine; for he did declare himself to diverse of his company,
that he meant to take St. Thome, and that he would make his voyage good upon
that Town, for that it was very rich; So as where it was blown abroad, that
the assault of Saint Thome was enforced by a kind of necessity, for that our
Troops were first assailed, it appears manifestly, both by his speech at
London, of a Town indefinitely, and by this his speech early in his voyage at
Sea of St. Thome by name, that it was an original design of his from the
beginning: And yet it is confessed by all, that the parts of Guiana, where St.
Thome was situate, were planted by Spaniards, who had diverse Towns in the
same tract, with some Indians intermixed, that are their Vassals, so as it is
plain, both place and persons were out of his Commission.

And that this was well known to him it appears notably in a letter of his
own hand, written since his return from his voyage, wherein he complains,
that the Spaniards of the same place did murder diverse of his men, which came
in peace to trade with them, some seven years past; neither does he in that
letter, any way decline his knowledge, that those parts Were inhabited by the
Spaniards, but stands upon a former title, which he would needs now have
strengthened by a new possession; notwithstanding that this his pretense is no
way competible with his Commission, and that himself before his going never
made ouerture, or allegation of any such pretext, nor so much as intimated, or
insinuated any such design or purpose.

Again, before he came to the Islands, he made no difficulty to tell many
in express terms, that he meant to surprise and set upon the Mexico Fleet,
though sometimes he would quallifie it, by saying, If all failed, or if the
Action of the Mine were defeated.

And Sir Walter Raleigh himself being charged with these speeches, confessed
the words, but says, that in time, they were spoken after the Action of the
Mine was defeated; and that it was propounded by him, to the end, to keep his
men together, and if he spoke it before, it was but discourse at large.

After, when he began to be upon the approaches of his pretended design of
the Mine, and was come to Trinidad, he fell sick in some extremity, and in
doubt of life (as was thought) at what time he was moved by some principal
persons about him, upon two points, in case he should decease: The one, that
he would nominate a General to succeed him; The other, that he would give
some direction for prosecution of the Action of the Mine. To the first he made
answer, that his Commission could nor be set over, and therefore left them to
agree of that among themselves: but for the Mine, he professed he could give
them no direction; and stayed not there, but told them, there was another
course (which he did particularize unto them to be a French Commission,
whereby they might do themselves most good upon the Spaniards.

When he was upon recovery, he dispatched the Landforces pretended for the
Mine, and had designed Captain Sentleger to command in that Expedition: but by
reason of Sentlegers infirmity at that time, he resorted to his kinseman
Captain George Raleigh, who was his Sergeant Mayor; in whose written
Commission which he gave him, he was wary enough not to express the taking of
St. Thome, but only inserted a clause of Commandment; That they should in all
things obey him, as they would do to himself in person: yet in private
directions and instructions, he did open himself to diverse of his Company,
that in case they should not receive some aduertisment, that the Town was
reinforced by new supplies of men (whereby the enterprise might be of too
great hazard for their number) they should take the Town first, telling them,
that the Mine was but three miles distant short of the Town, and inferring (as
Kemish expounded it afterward) that it was in vain to meddle with the Mine,
except the Town were first taken, and the Spaniards chased; for that
otherwise, they should but discover it, and work it for the Spaniards: and
when he had opened himself thus far, some of his company, of the more
intelligent and duetifull sort, did in plain terms turn it upon him, setting
before him, that the taking of the Town, would break the Peace, and that they
should go against the Commmission: Whereupon, most falsely and scandalously,
he doubted not with confidence to affirm, that he had order by word of mouth
from the King and his Council, to take the Town, if it were any hinderance to
the digging of the Mine.

But the event did sufficiently expound and manifest the direction; and yet
that kind of interpretation little needed, for that young M. Raleigh, (who was
likest to know his fathers secret) when he led his soldiers upon the Town,
used these or the like words, Come on my hearts, here is the Mine that ye must
expect, they that look for any other Mine, are fools; And with this did well
concur that which followed, in the prosecution of the Mine after the Town
was taken; For this Mine was not only imaginary, but moveable, for that which
was directed to be 3. miles short of Saint Thome, was after sought 30. miles
beyond S. Thome.

All this while Sir W. Raleigh stayed at Pont degallo, by the space of some 9.
weeks, during which time it was much noted by those that remained with him,
that the speech of the Mine was dead, (whereas men in expectation do commonly
feed themselves with the talk of that they long to hear of;) Nay more, after
he had received news of the taking of the Town, which had been the fittest
time to pursue the enterprise of the Mine, (in regard the Town that might have
been the impediment was mastered) he never entertained any such design, but
contrariwise, having knowledge at the same time, that his son was slain, (who
as it seems was his only care amongst the Land soldiers) he did move very
inhumanly, to remove not a little from Pont degallo to Port-hercule in respect
of the danger of the Current (as he pretended) but to go for the Charibes
many leagues off; accompting (as it seems) the land Soldiers, but as fruges
consumere natos, and having his thoughts only upon Sea forces, which how they
should have been employed, every man may judge. And whereas some pretense is
made by him, as if he should leave some word at Pont degallo of direction, to
what place the land Soldiers should follow him; it is plain, he knew them at
that time so distressed for victual, as famine must have overtaken them,
before they could overtake him; at which time one of his Captains told him,
that he had delivered out 52. men to that service, which were then at the
enterprise on Land, whose lives he held at a dear rate, and that he would not
weigh Anchor, as long as he had a Cable to ride by, or a Cake of bread to eat:
So Sir W. Raleigh finding no consent in that which he propounded, that cruel
purpose was diuerted.

It was also much observed, that after that unfortunate return of Kemish,
notwithstanding Sir W. Raleigh did publicly give out, that he would question
him for failing to prosecute the Mine, he had him at Dinner, and Supper, and
used him as familiarly and as kindly as before. And to Geo. Raleigh the
Sergeant Major, to whom he did use the like discountenances in public, who
took it more tenderly, and complained, and brake with him about it; he did
open himself more plainly, telling him that he must seem to do as much as
he did, to give satisfaction.

After all this, when the prosecution of this imaginary Mine vanished, and was
defeated, and that his Company cast a sad eye homewards, finding they were but
abused, Sir Walter Raleigh called a Council of his Captains, and held the
same in his Cabbine, where he propounded to them, that his Intention and
design was; First, to make to the Newfound lands, and there to revictuall and
refresh his Ships; And thence to go to the Western Islands, and there to lie
in wait to meet with the Mexico Fleet, or to surprise some Carrackes; and so
having gotten treasure, which might make him welcome into any foreign
Country, to take some new course for his future fortunes, valuing himself as
a man of great enterprise, and fame abroad; but then and at diverse times, he
did directly, and openly declare, that it was no coming for ENGLAND, for that
he knew not how things would be construed, and that he (for his part) would
never put his head under the Kings girdle, except he first saw the great Seal
for his pardon.

At which time, his cogitations embracing East and West, rather then any
return into his Country, he did in particular make promise to a principal
Commander in his Company, to give him a Ship to go into the East Indies, if
he would accompany him thither. But according to his first project, he went
to the New found Land, which he needed not to have done, if his purpose had
been for England, (for that he had victuals enough, and to spare, for that
journey) and there at New found Land his other company having formerly
dispersed and forsaken him, his own company which was in his own Ship began
likewise to mutine. And although some old Pirates, either by his inciting, or
out of fear of their own case, were fierce and violent for the Sea, and
against the return, yet the far greater number were for the return; at which
time himself got aland, and stood upon the Sea bank, and put it to a
question, whether they should return for England, or land at New found Land:
Whereupon there was a division of voices, the one part to the Starreboard, and
the other to the Larboard; of which that part which was for the return for
England, was two parts of three, and would by no means be drawn to set foot
on land, but kept themselves in the Ship, where they were sure they were
masters; which he perceiving, for fear of further mutiny, professed in
dissimulation, that he himself was for the return into England, and came and
stood amongst them that had most voices; But nevertheless, after that he
despaired to draw his company to follow him further, he made offer of his
own Ship (which was of great value) to his company, if they would set him
aboard a French Barque: The like offer he made, when he came upon the Coast of
Ireland, to some of his chief Officers there.

But about the time of his arrival upon the coast of Ireland, the forcing and
sacking of Saint Thome, and the firing of the Town, and the putting the
Spaniards to the sword, was noysed abroad in all parts, and was by special
advertisement comne unto the knowledge of the Count de Gondomar, then
Ambassador for the King of Spain with his Majesty, who thereupon prayed
audience of his Majesty, and with great instance demanded Justice against the
persons, and their goods (who had committed those outrages and made those
spoils upon his Majesty's subjects) according to his Majesty's promise, and
the treaty of Peace. Whereupon his Majesty published his Royal Proclamation
for the discovery of the truth of Raleighs proceedings, and the advancement of
Justice. Notwithstanding all which, his Majesty used a gracious and mild
course toward Sir Walter Raleigh, sending down Sir L. Stucley Vice Admiral
of the County of Deuon, to bring Sir Walter Raleigh in fair manner, and as
his health would give leave, by easy iourneyes to London. For about this time
Sir Walter Raleigh was comne from Ireland into England, into the Port of
Plymouth, where it was easy to discern with what good will he came thither,
by his immediate attempt to escape from thence; For soon after his coming to
Plymouth, before he was under guard, he dealt with the Owner of a French
Barque (pretending it was for a Gentleman a friend of his) to make ready his
Barque for a passage, and offered him twelve Crowns for his pains: And one
night he went in a little Boat to have seen the Barque that should have
transported him, but the night being very dark, he missed of the Barque, and
came back again, nothing done; wherein by the way appears, that it was not
any train laid for him by Sir Lewis Stucley or any other (as was voyced) to
move or tempt him to an escape, but that he had a purpose to fly, and escape
from his first arrival into England.

But in this his purpose, he grew to be more resolute, and fixed, after that
the Lords of his Majesty's Council, observing the delays in his coming up,
had sent unto Stucley, some quick letters for the hastening thereof: But
thereupon, as his desire of escape increased, so did the difficulty thereof
increase also; for that Stucley from that time forth kept a better guard upon
him, whereof he took that apprehension, in so much as (knowing Stucley to be
witty and watchful) he grew to an opinion that it would be impossible for
him to escape, except he could win one of these two points; either to
corrupt Stucley, or at lest to get to have some liberty, when he came to
London, of remaining in his own house; for guiltiness did tell him that upon
his coming to London, it was like he should be laid prisoner in the Tower.
Wherefore he saw no other way, but in his journey to London, to counterfeit
sickness in such a manner, as might in commiseration of his extremity, move
his Majesty to permit him to remain in his own house, where he assured
himself ere long, to plot an opportunity of an escape: And having in his
company one Mannowry a French man, a professor of Physic, and one that had
many Chymicall receipts, he practiced by Crowns, and promised to draw him
into his consort, the better to make faith of his counterfeiting to be sick:
the story whereof, Mannowry himself reports to have passed in this manner.

Upon Saturday the 25. of July, Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Lewis Stucley, and
Mannoury went to lie at Master Drakes, where the Letters of Commission from the
Privy Council were brought unto Sir Lewis Stucley, by one of his Majesty's
messengers, which caused a sudden departure, with much more haste then was
expected before: and the countenance of Sir Walter Raleigh was much changed
after Sir Lewis Stucley had showed the Commission; for Mannowry saw him from
the stairehead (he being alone in his chamber, the door standing half open)
how he stamped with his feet, and pulled himself by the hair, swearing in
these words, Gods wounds, is it possible my fortune should return upon me thus
again?

From Master Drakes they went on their journey to the house of Master Horsey,
distant from thence four miles, or thereabouts. It was in that hour that Sir
Walter Raleigh began first to cause Mannowry to be sounded, what was in his
heart, by an old domesticke of his called Captain King, who there began to
discourse unto Mannowry of the infortunitie of his Master, and amongst other
things, said thus; I would we were all at Paris, To whom Mannowry answered, I
would we were all at London, alas, what should we do at Paris? Because,
quoth King, that as soon as we come to London, they will commit Sir Walter
Raleigh to the Tower, and cut off his head: Whereupon Mannowry answered, That
he hoped better then so, and that he was sorry for his ill fortune; and that
according to his small ability, he was ready to do him all honest service
he could, so it might be done without offense.

After dinner, it being Sunday, Sir Walter Raleigh departed from Master Horsey
his house, and went to Sherburne, and in the way when he came within view
thereof, turning to Mannowrie, and showing him the place and the territory
about it, he said unto him sighing, That all that was his, and that the King
had unjustly taken it from him. He and Stucley lay not at Sherburne, but were
invited to the house of old Master Parham: Mannowry and their train went to
lie at Sherburne, at the sign of the George. The next day, being Monday, the
seven and twentieth of July, Mannowry went to them, and from thence they took
their way toward Salisbury, five and thirty miles from Sherburne; and arriving
there, Sir Walter Raleigh going afoote down the hill, addressed himself unto
Mannowry, and asked him if he had any of his Vomits, or other Medicines; which
he telling him that he had, he prayed him to make one ready against the next
morning, and to tell no body thereof. I know (quoth he) that it is good for me
to euacuate many bad humors, and by this means I shall gain time to work my
friends, give order for my affairs, and, it may be, pacify his Majesty
before my coming to London; for I know well, that as soon as I come there, I
shall to the Tower, and that they will cut off my head, if I use no means to
escape it; which I cannot do, without counterfeiting to be sick, which your
vomits will effect, without suspicion. For which cause the same evening, as
soon as he arrived, he laid him down upon a bed, complaining much of his
head, and blaming his great days journey from Sherborne to Salisbury,
(notwithstanding he supped very well) but after supper he seemed to be
surprised with a dimnesse of sight, by a swimming or giddiness in his head,
and holding his hand before his face, he rose from his bed, and being led by
the arm by Sir Lewis Stucley, he staggered so, that he struck his head with
some violence against a post of the gallery before his Chamber, which made Sir
Lewis Stucley think that he was sick indeed; in which belief Mannowry left
him for that time.

The next day in the morning, he sent his Lady his wife, and most of his
servants to London, and also Captain King: and Cuthbert and Mannowry, and Sir
Lewis Stucley being in Stucleyes chamber, a servant of the said Sir Walter
named Robine, came and told them that his Master was out of his wits, and
that he was naked in his shirt upon all four, scratching and biting the
rushes upon the Plankes, which greatly pitied Sir Lewis Stucley, who rising in
haste, sent Mannowry to him, who when he came, found him gotten again to his
bed, and asking him what he ailed, he answered, he ailed nothing, but that he
did it of purpose. And Sir Walter Raleigh asking him for his vomit, he gave it
him, who made no bones, but swallowed it down incontinently: At which time
Sir L. Stucley coming in, Sir Walter began again to cry and rave; Then
Mannowry went out of the Chamber, and the vomit which he had given him was an
hour and a half before it wrought, but in the mean time Sir Walter Raleigh
began to draw up his legs and arms all on a heap, as it had been in a
fit of Conuulsions, and contractions of his Sinews; and that with such
vehemency, that Sir Lewis Stucley had much ado with the help of others to
pull out straight, sometimes an arm, sometimes a leg; which against all the
strength they had, he would draw up again as it was before; whereat the said
Sir Lewis Stucley, took great compassion, causing him to be well rubbed and
chafed; which Sir Walter Raleigh himself afterward told unto Mannowry,
laughing that he had well exercised Sir Lewis Stucley, and taught him to be a
Physician.

This fained fit being thus past, Sir Walter Raleigh called Mannowry, and
when he came, he prayed him to stay by him, and said he would take some rest.
Mannowrie shut the door, and being alone with him, Sir Walter Raleigh told
him, That his vomit had done nothing as yet, and said, that he would take
another more violent; but Mannowry assuring him, that without doubt it would
work, he contented himself, and asked Mannowry if he could invent any
thing, that might make him look horrible and loathsome outwardly, without
offending his principal parts, or making him sick inwardly: Mannowry studied
a little, and then told him, that he would make a Composition presently, of
certain things which would make him like a Leper from head to foot, without
doing him any harm, which at his entreaty he effected speedily; at which
time Sir Walter Raleigh gave him the reason, why he did it, telling him that
his being in that case, would make the Lords of the Counsel affraide to come
near him, and move them with more pity to favor him. Soon after that
Mannowry had put this Composition upon his Brow, his Arms, and his Breast, Sir
Lewis Stucley came into the Chamber, and Mannowry went away, and Sir Lewis
Stucley perceiving the places where Mannowry had put this Composition to be all
pimpled, his face full of great blisters of diverse colors, having in the
midst a little touch of yellow, and round about like a purple color, and all
the rest of his skin as it were inflamed with hear, he began to apprehend
the danger of the disease, that it was contagious, and being very much
astonished at the sudden accident, he asked Mannowry what he thought thereof,
but Mannowry judged it fit to conceal it from him at that time, seeing Sir
Walter Raleigh had not yet told him, that he meant to fly out of England,
but that it was only to gain time to satisfy his Majesty.

Upon Mannowry his uncertain answer to Sir Lewis Stucley touching Sir Walter
Raleigh his malady, Stucley resolved to go to my Lord Bishop of Elie, now of
Winchester, to relate unto him in what case Sir Walter Raleigh was, and brought
unto Raleigh two Physicians to see and visit him; who being come, could tell
nothing of what humor the said sickness was composed. There came also a
third, a Bachelour in Physic, who all could not by all that they could do,
discover this disease; Only they gave their opinion and advise, that the
Patient could not be exposed to the Air, without manifest peril of his life,
and thereof they made their report in writing, unto which Mannowry also set his
hand.

Sir Walter Raleigh, seeing that all these things fell out according to his
intention, was exceedingly contented thereat, especially that in the presence
of the said Physicians, the vomit began to work both upwards and
downwards. And because he doubted that the Physicians would ask to see his
water, he prayed Mannowry to do something to make it seem troubled and
badde; which to content him, (giving him the Vrinall into his bed) Mannowry
rubbed the inside of the glass with a certain Drugge, which as soon as he
had made water therein, the Urine even in the hands of the Physicians, turned
all into an earthy humor, of a blackish color, and made the water also to
have an ill savor, which made the Physicians judge the disease to be mortal
and without remedy, but from Heaven.

He made Mannowry also to tie his arms about with black silk ribband, which
he took from his Poyniard, to try if it would distemper the pulse, but that
succeeded not, as he thought it would. The day following he called Mannowry,
and prayed him to make some more such blisters upon him, as upon his nose, his
head, his thighs, and his legs: which Mannowry having done, it succeeded
according to his desire, for which he was very iocund and merry with Mannowry,
and said unto him, that the euacuation which his physic had caused, had so
opened his stomach, that he was exceeding hungry, and prayed Mannowry that he
would go and buy him some meat secretly; for, quoth he, if I eat publicly,
it will be seen that I am not sick; so according to his request, Mannowry
went to the White-hart in Salisbury, and bought him a leg of Mutton and three
loaves, which he ate in secret, and by this subtilty it was thought that he
lived three days without eating, but not without drink: Thus he continued
until Friday the last of July, seeming always to be sick in the presence of
company, and nevertheless, being alone, he writ his Declaration or
Apology, and prayed Mannowry to transcribe it, which was since presented to his
Majesty.

The same evening Sir Lewis Stuckley discoursing upon his sickness, and
whence it should proceed, Sir Walter Raleigh said in these words, As God save
me, I think I have taken poison where I lay the night before I came to this
Town; I know that Master Parham is a great lover of the King of Spain, and a
Papist, and that he keeps always a Priest in his house; but I will not have
any of you to speak of it, nor you Mounsier (quoth he) speaking to Mannowry.
Also Sir Walter Raleigh, his Chamber doors being shut, walked up and down,
and only Mannowry with him, there naked in his shirt, and took a looking
glass, and looking upon the spots in his face, whereat he took great
pleasure, and laughing, said unto Mannowry these words, We shall laugh well one
day, for having thus cozened and beguiled the King, his Council, and the
Physicians, and the Spaniards and all.

Upon the Saturday that his Majesty arrived at Salisbury, which was the first
of August, Sir Walter Raleigh desired to speak with Mannowry in secret, and
seemed to have a very great apprehension of some thing, and having made him
shut the doors, prayed him to give him a red leather coffer, which was
within another coffer, which when he had, he was a good while looking in it,
and then called Mannowry, and putting nine pieces of Spanish money of gold into
his hand, he said thus; There is twenty Crowns in Pistolets, which I give
you for your Physical receipts, and the victual you bought me; and I will
give you fifty pound a year, if you will do that which I shall tell you, and
if it happen that Sir Lewis Stucley do ask you what conference you had with
me, tell him that you comfort me in mine adversity, and that I make you no
other answer then thus, as is here written, which he had already written
with his own hand in a little piece of paper for Mannowries instruction, as
follows:

Vela M. Mannowry L' acceptance de tout mes trauaus, pertie de mon estat, and
demon fills, mes maladies and doleurs. Vela L' effect de mon confidence au Roy.
Which paper of Raleighs hand writing Mannowry produced.

And now Sir Walter Raleigh began to practice with Mannowrie, and to tell him
that he would fly and get himself out of England, and that if Mannowry would
aid him in his escape, it was all in his power: and that Sir Lewis Stucley
trusted in no body but Mannowry; whereupon Mannowry made him an ouerture, that
at his coming to London he should keep himself close in a friends house of
Mannowries in Shire-lane in London, whereunto he seemed to incline, and found
Mannowries advise good for a while; but in the end he told him, that he was
resolved otherwise, and that he had already sent Captain King to hire him a
Bark below Grauelend, which would go with all winds, and another little
boat to carry him to it; For, quoth he, to hide my self in London, I should
be always in fear to be discovered by the general searchers that are there;
but to escape, I must get leave to go to my house, and being there, I will
handle the matter so, that I will escape out of the hands of Sir Lewis Stucley
by a backe-doore, and get me into the boat; for no body will doubt that I
can go on foot, seeing me so feeble, as I seem to be. And then Raleigh
having mused a while, without speaking. Mannowrie asked him, Sir, wherefore
will you fly? your Apology, and your last Declaration, do not they justify
you sufficiently? Then all in choler, Raleigh answered him in English thus;
Never tell me more; a man that fears is never secure; which fashion of his
put Mannowry to silence for that time.

Now there rested nothing but his Majesty's License, to permit him to go to
his own house, without which (he said) he could nor possibly escape. This
License was after granted him by the means of Master Vice-chamberlaine, and
Master Secretary Naunton; which being obtained, Mannowry took occasion to say
to him, That hereby one might see, that his Majesty had no meaning to take his
life, seeing that he suffered him to go to his own house to recover his
health. No (quoth Raleigh) they used all these kinds of flatteries, to the
Duke of Byron, to draw him fairly to the prison, and then they cut off his
head; I know that they have concluded amongst them, that it is expedient that
a man should die, to reassure the Traffic which I have broken in Spain. And
thereupon brake forth into most hateful, and Traiterous words against the
Kings own Person, ending in a menace and bravery, That if he could save
himself for that time, he would plot such plots, as should make the King
think himself happy to send for him again, and render him his estate with
advantage; yea and force the King of Spain, to write into England in his
favor.

Mannowry at that time did ask him further, if he escaped, what should become
of Sir Lewis Stucley? and whether he should be put to death for him or not,
and whether he should loose his Office and Estate? Not to death (quoth
Raleigh) but he will be imprisoned for a while, but his lands the King
cannot have, for that they are already assured to his eldest son; and for the
rest, it was no part of his care. Mannowry further asked him, if it were not
Treason in himself to be ayding to his escape; No (quoth he) for that you are
a stranger; nevertheless, you must not be known of any thing, for then you
will be sure to be put in prison. In conclusion, Mannowry demanded of him
yet further, But what if it be discovered, that I had any hand in your escape?
why (quoth he) follow me into France, (that is your Country) and quit all,
and I will make you amends for all.

After, Raleigh went on his journey to Andolier, and so to Hartford-bridge, and
from thence to Stains, during which time, Sir Lewis Stucley being made
acquainted by Mannowry with Raleigh his purpose to escape, used extraordinary
diligence in guards and watches upon him; which Raleigh perceiving, said to
Mannowry at Stains; I perceive well, it is not possible for me to escape by
our two means alone, Stucley is so watchful, and sets such strait guard upon
me, and will be too hard for us, for all our cunnings; therefore there is no
way but to make him of our counsel; and if we can persuade him, to let me
save my self, I will give him in hand two hundred pounds sterling worth: and
thereupon drew forth a Jewel, and showed it to Mannowrie, and gave it into his
hand, made in the fashion of hail powdered with Diamonds, with a Rubie in the
midst, which he valued at a hundred and fifty pound sterling, and said,
Besides this Jewel, he shall have fifty pound in money; I pray you go tell
him so from me, and persuade him to it, I know he will trust you.

Mannowrie went presently to Stucley, and told him as before, and concluded
with him, that Mannowrie should report back to Raleigh, that he would accept
of his offer, and bade him tell Raleigh also, that he was content to do as
he desired; but he would choose rather to go away with him, then to tarry
behind with shame and reproach; and he bade Mannowrie ask him further, how
he thought he could do this, without loosing his Office of Vice Admiral,
which cost him six hundred pounds, and how they should live afterward; and to
what place they should go, and what means he would carry with him, to furnish
this intended escape; which Mannowrie did, and was answered by the said
Raleigh, and prayed to tell Stucley, that if he would swear unto him, not to
discover him, he would tell him his whole intent; and that for the first
point, though Stucley should loose his Office, yet he should be no looser
upon the matter; and for afterward, as soon as he was gotten into France, or
Holland, his wife was to send him a thousand pounds Sterling, and that he
carried with him only a thousand Crowns in money and Jewels to serve for the
present in his escape. But after supper, Raleigh said unto Mannowrie, Oh, if I
could escape without Stucley, I should do bravely; But it is no matter (said
he) I Will carry him along, and afterward I Will dispatch my self of him well
enough. And after, Mannowrie relating all that had passed, to Stucley, brought
them together, at which time Raleigh showed the Jewel to Stucley; and he
making show to be content, prayed him a little respite to dispose of his
Office; whereupon Mannowrie seeing them so accorded upon the matter in
appearance, took his leave of them to go to London; and in the morning
Mannowrie upon the taking of his leave, said to Raleigh, that he did not
think to see him again while he was in England; Whereupon Raleigh gave him a
Letter directed to Mistress Herrys of Radford, that she should deliver him an
iron furnace with a Distillatory of Copper belonging unto it, and charged him
to tell every man he met, that he was sick, and that he left him in an
extreme looseness that very night.

But Raleigh having formerly dispatched a messenger to London, to prepare him a
Barque for his escape, came at last to London, and having won his purpose,
(by these former devices of feigned sickness) to be spared from imprisonment
in the Tower, and to be permitted to remain at his own house, till his
better recovery; there fell out an accident, which gave him great hopes and
encouragement speedily to facilitate his intended design for escape. For as he
came on his way to London, in his Inn at Brentford, there came unto him a
Frenchman named La Chesnay, a follower of Le Clear, last Agent here for his
Majesty's dearest brother the French King; who told him that the French Agent
was very desirous to speak with him as soon as might be after his arrival at
London, for matters greatly concerning the said Sir Walters weal and safety;
as in effect it fell out, that the very next night after his arrival at
London, the said Le Clear, and La Chesnay came unto him to his house, and there
did the said Le Clear offer unto him a French Barque, which he had prepared
for him to escape in, and withal his Letters recommendatory for his safe
conduct and reception to the Governor of Calis, and to send a Gentleman
expressly that should attend and meet him there; to which offer of his, Raleigh
after some questions passed, finding the French Bark not to be so ready, nor
so fit as that himself had formerly provided, gave him thanks, and told him
that he would make use of his own Bark, but for his Letters, and the rest of
his offer, he should be beholding to him, because his acquaintance in France
was worn out. So passionately bent was he upon his escape, as that he did
not forbear to trust his life, and to communicate a secret importing him so
near, upon his first acquaintance, and unto a stranger, whom he has since
confessed that he never saw before. And thus after two nights stay, the third
night he made an actual attempt to escape, and was in Boat toward his
Ship, but was by Stucley arrested, brought back, and delivered into the
custody of the Lieutenant of the Tower.

For these his great and heinous offenses, in acts of Hostility upon his
Majesty's confederates, depredations, and abuses, as well of his Commission, as
of his Majesty's Subjects under his charge, Impostures, Attempts of escape,
declining his Majesty's Justice, and the rest, evidently proved or confessed
by himself; he had made himself utterly unworthy of his Majesty's further
mercy: And because he could not by Law be iudicially called in question, for
that his former attainder of Treason is the highest and last work of the Law
(whereby he was Ciuiliter mortuus) his Majesty was enforced (except
Attainders should become privileges for all subsequent offenses) to resolve to
have him executed upon his former Attainder.

HIs Majesty's just and honorable proceedings being thus made manifest to all
his good Subjects by this preceding Declaration, not founded upon conjectures
or likelyhoods; but either upon confession of the party himself, or upon the
examination of diverse unsuspected witnesses, he leaves it to the world to
judge, how he could either have satisfied his own Justice, (his honorable
intentions having been so perverted and abused by the said Sir W. Raleigh) or
yet make the uprightness of the same his intentions appear to his dearest
Brother the King of Spain; if he had not by a Legal punishment of the
Offender, given an example, as well of terror to all his other Subjects, not to
abuse his gracious meanings, in taking contrary courses for the attaining to
their own unlawful ends; as also of Demonstration to all other foreign
Princes and States, whereby they might rest assured of his Majesty's honorable
proceeding with them, when any the like case shall occur: By which means his
Majesty may the more assuredly expect and claim an honorable concurrence,
and a reciprocal correspondence from them, upon any the like occasion. But as
to Sir Walter Raleigh his confession at his Death, what he confessed or denied
touching any the points of this declaration, his Majesty leaves him and his
conscience therein to God, as was said in the beginning of this Discourse. For
Sovereign Princes cannot make a true judgment upon the bare speeches or
asseuerations of a delinquent at the time of his death, but their judgment
must be founded upon examinations, reexaminations, and confrontments, and such
like real proofs, as all this former discourse is made up and built upon; all
the material and most important of the said examinations being taken under the
hands of the examinates that could write, and that in the presence of no fewer
then six of his Majesty's privy Counsel, and attested by their alike
several subscriptions under their hands, which were my Lords, the Archbishop
of Canterbury, the Lord Verulam Lord Chauncellor of England, the Earl of
Worcester Lord Privy Seal, Master Secretary Naunton, the Master of the Rolls,
and Sir Edward Coke.
