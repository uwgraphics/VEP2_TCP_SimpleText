^he true hearted L^^^^ OR
A Young Man sent a letter to his Love,
Showing to her his mind could not remove:
But for true love he love again does crave,
If false she prove, then he must to the Grave.
To the Tune of, I fancy none but thee alone.


MY loving friend I do commen^
my self most kindly unto you,
Wishing your health your joy and wea^^h
most like unto a Lover true,
For Cupids dart, has struck my he^^^
and I no remedy can find,
Your love it is, the cause of this,
therefore sweet Love prove not unkind.
Your love so soon, my heart did woun^
that I no longer can forbear.
^ill you my love, with it be moved,
and that an answer I do hear,
I shall not rest, for I protest,
that I do love you as my heart,
Therefore my dear, let love appear,
to love again it is thy part.
If thou should not what were my lot
the time and day I should repent
That ever my love, to thee I mo(...)
my heart with sorrow ^^^ld be spent,
Because my love, cannot remove.
but it will breeve my deadly pain,
Then sweet prove kind, that I may find,
for love, fou^e love of thee again.
Or else my pain will still remain,
no joy nor comfort I can have.
Until that death has stopped my breath,
and brought my body to the grave,
Thy lovely looks, are bayteing hooks,
and they so fast have caught my heart,
That none but thee, can remedy,
my grief, my woe, my pain and smart.
Seeing in thy hands, my life if stands,
consider well my grief and moan,
If thou did know, the grief and woe,
that I suffer for thee alone,
Thy heart I think, if it were flint,
it could not choose but grant me love,
For I love thee, most faithfully,
and till I die I Will not remove.
So Love adue, thy lover true,
^^ll he does hear from thee again,
Prays for thy health, thy joy and wealth,
hopeing thou will not breed his pain,
So I will pray both night and day
the Lord to have thee in hi^ (...)
So till I hear, from thee my d^^^^
adue my love, and only sweet(...)
The second part*
To the same Tune. OR
(...) kind Mai^ answer
(...) true to thee as Hero to Leander,
I Will be thy love, thou shall be my Commander,
As in my answer plainly shall be shown,
Let Hymen join, and then I am thy own.


Thanks love for thy commendations,
unto me so kindly sent,
I it receive with kind embracing,
I Will not breed thee discontent,
Though Cupids shaft with a full draught,
did aim aright and pierce thy heart,
The wound I Will curd I thee assure.
and ease thee of that grievous smart.
If it be I thy heart have wounded,
'twas a thing to me unknown,
Be not then in sorrows drowned,
for ver that vowed to us thy own,
But rest in peace, let love increase,
I will thee love while I have breath,
I will not part, from thee sweet heart,
until that I am forced by death.
Thy lot's according to thy wishing,
to repent thou have no cause,
With kind embraces and with hissing,
I will keep God Cupids Laws,
Ere false I Will prove, to thee my love
or do thee wrong by day or night,
I rather choose, my life to loose,
then wrong my love and hearts delight.
(...) pain I Will strive to ease thee,
(...)t love good comfort take,
(...) ^ight shall be to please thee,
I Will dye ere I will thee forsake,
But unto thee as true I Will be,
as is the Turtle to his mate,
Whilst life thou have, my love is plat'st,
If life thou loose, my life I Will hate.
Thy plaints and moan I have regarded,
my hand and heart be ever thine.
I have thy love with love rewarded,
as thy hand and heart is mine,
So shall it rest, within my breast,
I Will entertainment give unto it,
I Will it relieve, I Will not it grieve;
(...) ^ather lose my life then do it.
So with my love and true affection,
I do now my love commend,
Unto the hands and the protection,
of him that does all blessings send,
And so I end, thy loving friend,
has now her love to thee made known
In hymen's bands, let us join hands,
and then my love I am thine own.
FINIS.
