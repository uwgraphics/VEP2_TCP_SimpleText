The prologue
They mow by law / as they said
Us curse and dampne to hell brinke
Thus they putten us to pain
With candels queynte and belles clynke
They make us thralles at her lust
And said we mow not else be saved
They have the corn / and we the dust
Who speaks there again they say he raued
What man / quod our host / can thou preche
Come nere and tell us some holy thing
Sir / quod he / I herd ones teache
A priest in pulpyt a good prechyng
Say / on quod our host / I the beseech
Sir I am ready at your byddyng
I pray you that no man me reproach
While that I am my tale tellyng.
Thus ends the prologue / and here follows the first part of this present
work.
ASterne strife is stered new Narratio.

In many stedes in a stounde,
Of sondrie sides that be sewe
It seems that some ben unsound:
For some be great grown vngrounde
Some ben souble / simple and small,
Whether of hem is falser found
The falser foul mote him befall.
That one side is / that I of tell.
Popes / cardynals / and ^relates
Parsons / monks / and Freres fell
Priours / abbottes of great estates
Of heuyn and hell they keep the yates
And Peter's successors they ben all
This is demed by old dates
But falshed foul mote it be fall
The first part
The other side ben poor and pale
And people put out of prease
And seem caytyffes sore a cale
And ever in one without increase
I clepeth lollers and londlese
Who toteth on hem they ben vntall
They ben arayde all for the peace
But falshed foul mote it befall
Many a country have a sought
To know the falser of these two
But ever my traueyle was for naught
All so far as I have go
But as I wandered in a wro
In a wodde beside a wall
Two fowls saw I sytte tho
The falser foul mote him befall
That one did plede on the Popes side
Gryffon.
A Gry^^on of a grymme stature
A Pellycane withouten pride
To these lollers laid his lure
He mused his matter in measure
To counsel Christ ever began he call
The Gry^^on showed as sharp as fire
But falshed foul mote it be fall
Pellycan
The Pellycan began to preche
Both of mercy and of meekness
And said / that Christ so began us teache
And meke and mercyable began bless
The Euangely bears witness
Ecce agnus d^i.
A lamb he lykeneth Christ over all
In tokenyng that he mekest was
Since pride was out of heuyn fall
Ex^mplum dedi vobis.
And so should every Christened be
Priests / Peter's successors
Beth lowlyche and of low degree
Qui mayor est vestrum.
And vsen none erthly honors
Neither crown / ne curious couertours
Ne pylloure / ne other proud pall Nolite the saurizare.

Ne naught to cofren up great treasours
For falshed foul mote it befall
Priests should for no catell plede Qui voluerit tecum co^tendere i^ iudicio.
etc.

Cum voca^^ fueris ad nupcias recu^be in noui. ^^mo loco. etc.

Qui se ex^lta^ humiliabitur.



But chasten hem in charity
Ne to no bateyle should men led
For inhaunsyng or her own degree
Not wylne syttynges in hye see
Ne souerayntie in house ne hall
All worldly worship defye and flee
For who so wylleth highness foul shall fall
Alas who may such saints call R^ges gentium (...) tu^ co^m^neque domina^t^s
in cle^.

Nisi ha^ui^ d^uerit (...) tia vestra plusquam scribarum et phari scorum.



That wylneth welde erthly honor
As low as Lucifere such shall fall
In balefull blackenesse buylden her boure
That eggeth the people to error
And makes them to hem thrall
To Christ I hold such one traitor
As low as Lucifere such one shall ^all
That wylleth to be kings peers Non in e^s bellicosis.

And higher than the Emperor
Some that were but poor Freres
Now woollen wax a warryour
God is not her governor
That holds no man his permagall
While couetyse is her counsaylour
All su^he falshed mote need fall
That hye on horse wylleth ride
In glytterande gold of great array
I painted and portred all in pride
No common knight may go so gaye
Change of clothyng every day
With golden gyrdels great and small
As boystous as is bear at baye
All such falshed mote need fall
With pride ponysshed the poor
Ue pastoribus Israel / q pascebant se metipsos.

Ezech. xxxiiii


And some they sustain with sale
Of holy church makes an hoar
And fylleth her womb with wine and ale
With money fyll^th many a male
And chaffren churches when they fall
And tells the people a leude tale
Such false faytours foul hem fall
In cithara and lyra et tipanum ^t tibia / et vinum in co^uiuiis vestris: et
opus domini non respici^ / nec opera manuum eius consideratis.

Isaie. v.


With change of many manner metes
With song and solace syttyng long
And fylleth her womb / and fast fretes
And from the mete to the gonge
And after mete with harp and song
And each man mote hem lords call
And hot spyces ever among
Such false fayto^rs foul hem fall
And myters mo than one or two
I perled as the queen's hedde
A staff of gold / and pyrrey lo
As heny as it were made of led
With clothe of gold both new and red With glytterande gold as grene as gall
By dome woll dampne men to dedde
All such faytours foul hem fall
And Christ's people proudly curse
With broad books / and brayeng bell
To put pennys in her purse
They woll sell both heuyn and hell
And in her sentence and thou wylt dwell
They wyllen guess in her gay hall
And though the sothe thou of hem tell
In great cursyng shalt thou fall
That is blessed / that they bless
And cursed that they curse woll
And thus the people they oppr^sse
And have their lordshyppes at full
And many be marchantes of wolle
And to purse pennyes woll come thrall
The poor people they all to pull
Such false faytours foul hem fall
Lords mote to hem loute
Obeysaunt to her broad blessyng
They ryden with her royal route
On a courser / as it were a king
With saddyll of gold glytteryng
With curyous harneys quayntly crallyt
Styroppes gaye of gold mastlyng
All such falshed foul befall it
Christ's mynysters clepen they been
And rulen all in robbery
But An^ichrist they seruen clean
Attyred all in tyranny
Witness of Iohe^s prophesy
That Antichrist is her admyrall
Tyffelers attyred in treachery
All such faytours foul hem fall
Who says that some of hem may sin
He shall be done to be deed In vestimen it is ouium in tri^ s^^us aut^m sunt lupi
rapaces.

Some of hem woll gladly win
A^l against that / which god forbede
All holiest they clepen her heed
That of her rule is regal
Alas that ever they eten breed
For all such falshed woll foul fall
Her heed loves all honor
And to be worshypped in word and deed
Kings mote to hem knele and coure
To the Apostels / that Christ forbede
To Popes hestes such takes more head Extollens se super omne / quod dicitur
deus.

Than to keep Christ's commandment
Of gold and silver mote ben her wede
They holds him hole omnypotent
He ordayneth by his ordinance
To parysshe priests a powere
To another a greatter auaunce
A greatter point to his mystere
But for he is highest in earth here
To him reserueth he many a point
But to Christ that has no pere
Reserueth he neither opyn ne joint
So seems he abouen all
And Christ abouen him nothing
When he sytteth in his stall
Dampneth and saves as him think
Such pride tofore god does stynke
An Angel badde John^ to him not knele
But only to god do his bowyng
Such wyllers of worship must need yuel feel
Sctu^s deus sctu^s fortis.
They ne clepen Christ / but Sctu^s deus
And clepen her heed / Sanctissimus
They that such a sect sewys
I trow they taken hem amysse
In earth here they have her bliss
Her hye master is Bellyall
Christ's people from hem wysse
For all such false will foul fall
They mow both bind and lose
And all is for her holy life
Omne regnu^ in se d^uisum desolabitu^.
To save or dampne they mow chose
Between hem now is great strife
Many a man is killed with a knyfe
To wete which of hem have lordship shall
For such Christ suffered wou^des five
For all such falshed woll foul fall
Nolite time ^e eos / qui occidu^t corpus estote prudentes.
Christ said / Qui gladio percutit
With sword he shall dye
He bade his priests peace and gryth
And bade hem not dread for to dye
And bade hem be both simple and slye
And carke not for no catall Sicut serpents et simpli^es sicut columbe.

But trusts on god that sytteh on hye
For all ^alse shull ^oule fall
These woollen make men to swear
Against Christ's commandment
And Christ's members all to tere U^ qui co^ducunt leges in iquas vt oprimant
pauperes i^ iudicio.

On Roode / as he were new yrent
Such laws they maken by common assent
Echone it choweth as a ball
Thus the poor be fully shent
But ever ^alshed foul it fall
They vsyn no Simony
But sellen churches and priories
Ne they vsen no Envy
But cursen all hem contraries
And hyereth men by days and years
With ^trength to hold hem in her stall
And culleth all her adversaries
Therefore falshed ^oule thou fall
With purse they purchase personage
With purse they paynen hem to plede
And men of war they woll wage
To bring her enemies to the deed
And lords lives they woll led
And much take and give but small
But he it so get / from it shall shede
And make such false right foul fall
They halowe nothing but for hyr^
Church / ^ont / ne vestement
And make orders in every shyre
But priests pay ^or the parchement
O^ ria^ours they taken rent
T^erwith they smere the shepes skall
For many churches ben often suspent
All such falshed yet foul it fall
Some lives not in lechery
But haunten wenches / wydowes / and wives
And punyssheth the poor for putry
Them self it uses all her lives
And but a man to them shriues
To heuyn come never he shall
He shall be cursed as be caytyues
To hell they said that he shall fall
There was more mercy in Maximyen
And in Nero / that never was good
Than is now in some of them
When he has on his furred hoode
They ^olowe Christ that shed his blood
To heaven / as buckette in to the wall
Such wreches ben worse than wode
And all such ^aytours foul hem fall
They give her alms to the rich
To mayn^^ynours / and to men of law
For to lords they woll be lyche
An harlottes son not worth an hawe
Corruit in platea veritas.

I^aie. lix.


Sothfastnesse such han slawe
They kembe her crokettes with crystal
And dread of god they have down draw
All such faytours foul hem fall
They maken parsons for the penny
And canons of her cardynals
Unnethes amongst hem all any
That he ne has glosed the gospel falls
For Christ made never no cathedrals
Ne with him was no cardynall
With a Red hatte as vsyn mynstrals
But falshed foul mote it befall
Charitas no^ querit q sua sunt.
Their tythyng / and her offryng both
They clemeth it by possessyon
Thero^ nyll they non forgo
But robben men as ransom
The tithyng of Turpe lucrum
With these masters is meynall
Tithyng of bribry / and larson
Will make falshed full foul to fall
They taken to ferme her sompnours
To harm the people what they may
To pardoners / and false faytours
Sell her seals I dare well say
And all to holden great array
To multiply hem more metal
They dread full little domes day
When all such shall foul fall
Such harlottes shull men dysclaunder
For they shullen make her gree
And ben as proud as Alexaunder Ue homini illi per quem sca^dalum venit.

And said to the poor / woe be ye
By year each preeste shall pay his ^ee
To increase his lemmans call
Such heerdes shull well yuell the
And all such false shull foul fall
And if a man be falsely famed
And would make purgacioun
Than woll the officers be agramed
And assign him fro town to town
So need he must pay ransom
Though he be clean / as is crystal
And than have an absolutioun
But all such false shull foul fall
Though he be gyltie of the deed
And that he may money pay
All the while his purse woll blede
He may use it fro day to day
These bysshoppes officers gone full gay
And this game they vsen over all
The poor to pyll is all their pray
All such false shull foul fall
Alas / god ordained never such law
Ne no such craft of couetyse
He forbade it by his saw
Such governors mowen of god agryse
For all his rules is rightwyse
These new points ben pure papal
And gods law they dispyce
And all such fayt^urs shull foul fall
They said that Peter had the key
Of heuyn and hell / to have and hol^e
I trow Peter took no money
For no sins that he sold
Such successors ben to bold
In wynnyng all their wit they wrall
Her conscience is waxen cold
And all such faytours ^oule hem fall
Peter was never so great a fool
To leave his key with such a lorell
Or to take such cursed such a tole
He was aduysed nothing well
I trow they have the key of hell
Their master is of that place marshall
For there they dressen hem to dwell
And with false Lucifere there to fall
They ben as proud as Lucifarre
As angry / and as enuyous
From good faith they ben full far
In couetyse they ben curyous
To catch cattle as couytous
As hounde / that for hungre woll yall
Ungoodly / and ungracious
And nedely such falshed shall fonle fall
The pope and he were Peter's hey^e
Me think he erreth in this case
When choice of bysshoppes is in dispeyre
To chosen hem in diverse place
A lord shall write to him for grace
For his clerk anon pray he shall
So shall he speed his purchase
And all such false foul hem fall
Though he can no more good
A lords prayer shall be spedde
Though ^e ^e wild o^ will or wood
Not understanding what men han read
A leude boster / and that god ^orbede
As good a bishop is my horse ball
Such a Pope is ^oule be stedde
And a^ la^t woll ^oule ^all
He makes bysshoppes for erthly thank
And nothing ^or Christ's sake
Such that ^en full fat and rank
To soul heal none head they take
All is well done what ever they make
For they shall answer at ones for all
For wo^ldes thank / such worch and wake
And all such ^alse shall ^oule fall
Such that can not her Creed
With prayer shull be made prelates
Nou^her can the gospel read
Such shall now welde hye estates
The hye goods frendshyp hem makes
They toteth on her so^me total
Such bear the keys of hell yates
And all such false shall foul fall
They forsake for Christ's love
Traueyle / hungre / thurst / and cold
For they ben ordered ever all above
Out of youth till they ben old
By the door they go / not in to the fold
To help their sheep they naught trauall
Hired men all such I hold
And all such false foul hem fall
For Christ her king they woll forsake
And know him naught for his pouerte
For Christ's love they woll wake
And drink pyement ale aparte
Of god they seem nothing a ferde
As lusty lives / as did Lamuall
And driven her sheep in to deserte
All such faytours shull foul fall
Christ had.xii. apostels here
Now say they / there may be but one
That may not err in no manner
Who leueth not this ben lost echone
Peter erred / so did not John^
Why is he cleped the principal?
Christ cleped him Peter / but him self y^ stone
All false faytours foul hem fall
Why cursen they the croysery
Christ's christen creatures
For between hem is now envy
To be enhaunsed in honors
And christen lyuers with her labors
For they leuyn on no man mortal
But do to death with dishonours
And all such false foul hem fall
What knows a tyllour at the plowe
The popes name / and what he hate
His creed suffyseth to him ynowe
And knows a cardynall by his hatte
Rough is the poor unrightly latte
That knows Christ his god royal
Such matters be not worth a gnatte
But such false faytours foul hem fall
A king shall knele and kiss his show
Christ suffered a sinful to kiss his fete
Me thinks he holds him hye ynowe
So Lucifer did / that hye set
Such one me thinks him self foryete
Either to the troth he was not call
Christ that suffered wounds wete
Shall make such falshed foul fall
They lays out her large nets
For to take silver and gold
Fyllen coffers / and sackes fettes
There as they souls catch should
Her servants be to them vnholde
But they can doublyn their rentall
To bygge hem castles / and bygge hem hold
And all such false foul hem fall
Here ^ndeth the first part of this boke^ and herafter follows the second
part
TO accord with this word fall
No more English can I find Qui non est mecum / ^on^ra me est.

Show another now I shall
For I have much to say behind
How priests han the people pynde
As curteys Christ has me kende
And put this matter in my mind
To make this manner men amend
Shortly to shende hem / and show now
Now wrongfully they worche and walk Qui non est etc.

O hye god / nothing they tell / ne how
But in gods word / tells many a balke
In hernes hold hem and in halke
And prechyn of tithes and offrende
And untruly of the gospel talk
For his mercy god it amend
What is Antichrist to say
But even Christ's adversary
Such has now ben many a day
To Christ's byddyng full contrary
That from the truth clean varry
Out of the way they ben wend
And Christ's people untruly carry
God for his pytie it amende^
That lyuen contrary to Christ's life
In hye pride against meekness
Against sufferaunce they vsen strife
And anger against sobrenesse
Against wisdom wylfulnesse
To Christ's tales little tend
Against measure outragyousnesse
But when god woll it may amend
Lordly life against lowlynesse
And demyn all without mercy
And couetyse against largess
Against truth treachery
And against alms envy
Against Christ they comprehend
^or chastyte they maynteyne lechery
God for his grace this amend
Against penance they use delights
Against sustraunce strong defense
Against god they vsen yuell rightes
Against pytie punysshementes
Open yuell against contynence
Her wicked wynnyng worse dispende
Sobrenesse they set in to dispense
But god for his goodness it amend
Why cleymen they holy his powere
And wranglen against all his hestes
His living folowen they nothing here
But lyuen worse than wytlesse beestes
Of fysshe and flesh they louen feestes
As lords they ben broad ykende
Of gods poor they haten gestes
God for his mercy this amend
With Diverse such shall have her dome
That said that they be Christ's friends
And do nothing as they should done
All such ben falser than ben fendes
On the people they ley such bendes
As god is in earth they han offend
Sucour for such Christ now send us
And for his mercy this amend
A token of Antichrist they be
His careckes ben now wide yknowe
Received to preche shall no man be
Without token of him I trow
Each christen priest / to prechyn owe
From god above they ben send.
Gods word / to all folk for to show
Sinful man for to amend
Christ sent the poor for to preche
The royal rich he did not so
Now dare no poor the people teache
For Antichrist is over all her foe
Among the people he mote go
He has bydden / all such suspende
Some has he hente / and thinks yet mo
But all this god may well amend
All tho that han the world forsake
And lyuen loly / as god badde
In to her prison shullen be take
Betyn and bounden / and forth ladde
Hereof I read no man be dradde
Christ said / his should be shende
Each man ought hereof be glad
For god full well it woll amend
They take on hem royal powere
And say they have swerdes two Ecce gladi^ duo hic

One curse to hell / one slay men here
For at his taking Christ had no mo
Yet Peter had one of tho
But christ / to Peter smite began defend
And in to the sheth badde put it tho
And all such myscheues god amend
Uos qui spirituales estis insti^cte alios in ^pu^ lenitatis ^uscitabo pastor^
stuitum / q dispersa no^ coliget. Sed oues pi^gues co^e^^^^ and habebit gladi^
in brac^^io dextro / and glad^u^ (...).
Christ badde Peter keep his sheep
And with his sword forbade him smite
Sword is no tole with sheep to keep
But to sheperdes that sheep woll byte
Me thinks such sheperdes ben to wit
Again her sheep with sword that contend
They drive her sheep with great dispyte
But all this god may well amend
So successors to Peter be they naught
Whom Christ made chief pastoure
A sword no sheperde vsen ought
But he would ^lee / as a bochoure
For who so were Peter's succes^our
Should bear his sheep till his back bend
And shadow hem from every shoure
And all this god may well amend
La^ comedebatis and lanis cooper ^^amini / and quod pingu^ ^rat occioistis.
Successors to Peter ben these
In that that Peter Christ forsook
That had lever the love of god lose
Than a sheperde had to lose his hoke
He culleth the sheep as does the coke
Of hem taken the woll vntrende
And falsely gloss the gospel book
God for his mercy them amend
After Christ had take Peter the kay
Christ said / he must dye for man
That Peter to Christ began withsay
^un^ dixit Jesus discipulis sui^ ^r oportet (...)
Christ badde him go behind Satan
Such cou^saylours many of these men han
For worlds well / god to offend
Peter's successors they ben for than
But all such god may well amend
For Satan is to say no more ierosolimam and multa pati. R^dit petrus.
Nequaquam erit tibi hoc Jesus dixit petro: Uade post me sathanas.

But he that contrary to Christ is
In this they learn Peter's lore
They sewen him when he did mysse
They follow Peter forsothe in this
In all that Christ would Peter reprehende
But not in that that longs to heuyn bliss
God for his mercy hem amend
Some of the Apostels they sewen in case
Of ought that I can understand Fur ^rat / and loculos habebat et ea que
mitteqantur portabat.

Him that betrayed Christ / Judas
That bare the purse in every land
And all that he might set on hand
He hid and stale / and myspende
His rule these traitors han in hand
Almighty god hem amend
And at last his lord began tray
Cursedly through his false couetyse Ut dolo cape rent et occide rent

So would these / trayen him for money
And they wysten in what wise
They be seker of the self ensyse
From all sothnesse they ben friend
And couetyse chaungen with queyntyse
Almighty god all such amend
Were Christ on earth here efte sone
These would dampne him to dye
All his hestes they han fordone
And said his sawes ben heresy
And against his commandments they cry
And damp^e all his to be brende
For it lyketh not hem such losengery
God almighty hem amend
These han more might in England hete
Than has the king and all his law
They han purchased hem such powere
To taken hem whom list not knawe
And say that heresy is her saw
And so to prysone woll hem send
It was not so by elder dawe
God for his mercy it amend
The kings law woll no man deem
Angerlyche withouten answer
Lex nominem ^udicat / Nisi prius audi ^rit a^ eo qui dixit.
But if any man these mysqueme
He shall be ^eted as a bear
And yet well worse they woll him tere
And in prysone woll hem pende
In gyues / and in other gere
When god woll / it may mende
The king taxes not his men
But by a^^en^e of the co^mynalte
But these each year woll raunsom hem
Maisterfully / more than does he
Her seals by year better be
Than is the kings in extend
Her officers han gretter fee
But this myschefe god amend
For who so woll prove a testament
That is not all worth ten pound
He shall pay for the parchement
They third part of the money all round
Thus the people is raunsounde
They say such part to hem should apende
There as they grypen it gothe to ground
God for his mercy it amend
A simple fornycacioun
Twenty shyllynges he shall pay
And than have an absolution
And all the year vsen it forth he may
Thus they letten hem go a stray
They recke not though the soul be brende
These kepyn yuell Peter's key
And all such sheperdes god amend
Wonder is / that the parlyament Cum filii ^ely poluerunt domini sacrificium.
etc.

And all the lords of this land
Herto taken so little intent
To help the people out of her hand
For they ben harder in their bond
Worse beat / and bitter brende
Than to the king is understand
God him help this to amend
What bysshoppes / what relygions Paulus inimi cos crucisxpi quorum finis
interitus qui terrena sapiunt. etc.

Han in this land as much lay fee
Lordshippes / and possessions
More than the lords / it seems me
That makes hem lose charity
They mow not to god attend
In earth they have so high degree
God for his mercy it amend
The Emperor yaf the pope sometime
So high lordshyppe him about
That at last the sely kyme
The proud Pope put him out
So of this realm is in doubt
But lords be ware and them defend Reges gentium du^antu^ little.

For now these folk^ be wonder stout
The king and lords now this amend.
Thus ends the second part of this book / and herafter follows the third
Moses law forbode it tho No^ hab^^a^t hereditate^ sacerdotes et leuite inter
fratres coru^ ego aut^m pars and hereditas ^o^um. etc.

That priests should no lordshippes welde
Christ's gospel byddeth also
That they should no lordshippe held
Ne Christ's Apostels were never so bold
No such lordshippes to them enbrace
But smeren her sheep and keep her fold
God amend hem for his grace
Ne^ qu^^qu^ cor^^n (...) possideba^ aliquid su^i esse dicebat.

Ex fructibus ^o^ cognose^ ti^ ^os. etc.

Homo cum i^ honor esset non intelle^it. etc.


For they ne ben but countrefete
Men may know hem by her fruit
Her gretnesse makes hem god foryete
And take his meekness in dispyte
And they were poor and had but lyte
They nolde not demen after the face
But norisshe her sheep / and hem not byte
God amend hem for his grace
Gryffon.
What can thou preche against chanons
That men clepen seculere?
Pelycan
They ben curates of many towns
On earth they have great powere
They han great prebendes and dear
Some two or three / and some mo
A personage to ben a playeng fere
And yet they serve the king also
And let to ferme all that fare
To whom that woll most give therefore
Some woll sp^nde / and some woll spare
And some woll lay ^t up in store
A cure or soul they care not fore
So they mow money take
Whether her souls be ^onne or lore
Her profytes they woll not forsake
They have a gederyng procuratour
That can the poor people enplede
And robben hem as a rauynour
And to his lord the money led
And catch of quick and eke of deed
And richen him and his lord eke
And to rob the poor can give good read
Of old and young / of hole and syke
Therewith they purchase hem lay ^ee
In land / there hem lyketh best
And build also broad as a cite
Both in the Est / and eke in the west
To purchase thus they ben full pressed
But on the poor they woll naught spend
Ne no good give to gods gest
Ne send him some that all has send
By her service such woll live
And trusse that other in to treasour
Though all her parysshe dye vnshriue
They woll not give a rose flower
Her life should be as a myrrour
Both to lered and to leude also
And teache the people her lele labor
Such myster men ben all mysgo
Some of hem ben hard nygges
And some of hem ben proud and gay
Some spend her good upon gygges
And fynden hem of great array
Alas / what think these men to say
That thus dispenden goddis good
At the dredefull domes day
Such wretches shulbe worse than wood
Some her churches never ne sye
Ne never o penny thither ne send
Though the poor parysshens for hungre dye
O penny on hem will they not spend
Have they receyuynge of the rent
They recke never of the remena^t
Alas the devil has clean hem blen^
Suehe one is Sathanas soiournant
And vsen horedome and harlotry
Couetyse / pomp / and pride
Slouthe / wrath / and eke envy
And sewen sin by every side
Alas / where think such tabyde
How woll they accomptes yield
From hye god they mow hem not hyde
Such wyllers wit is not worth a nelde
They ben so roted in richesse
That Christ's pouert is foryet
Served with so many mess
Hem thinks that Manna is no mete
All is good that they mow get
They wene to live evermore
But when god at dome is set
Such treasour is a feeble store
Unneth mote they matyns say
For countyng and for court holdyng
And yet he ^angleth as a iaye
And vnderstont him self nothing
He woll serve both earl and king
For his fyndyng and his fee
And hyde his ty^hynge and his offryng
This is a feeble charity
Outher they ben proud / or coueytous
Or they ben hard / or hungry
Or they ben lyberall or lecherous
Or else medlers with marchandry
Or maynteyners of men with maistry
Or stewardes / coun^ours / or pledours
And serve god in hypocrisy
Such priests ben Christ's false traitors
They ben false / they ben vengeable
And be gylen men in Christ's name
They ben unsteadfast and unstable
To tray her lord / hem thinks no shame
To serve god they ben full lame
Gods thieves / and falsely stele
And falsely gods word defame
In wynnyng is her worlds well
Antichrist these seruen all
I pray the who may say nay?
With Antichrist such shull fall
They folowen him in deed and fay
They seruyn him in rich array
To serve Christ such falsely feign
Why / at the dredefull domes day
Shull they not follow him to pain?
That known hem self that they done ill
Against Christ's commandment
And amend hem never ne will
But serve Satan by one assent
Who says sothe he shall be shent
Or speaks against her false living
Who so well lives shall be brent
For such ben gretter than the king
Pope / bysshoppes / and cardyuals
Chanons / persons / and vycayre
In gods service I trow ben false
That sacraments sellen here
And ben as proud as Lucifere
Each man look whether that I lie
Who so speaks against her powere
It shall be holden heresy
Look how many orders take
Only of Christ / for his service
That the worlds goods forsake
Who so takes orders / or other wise
I trow that they shall sore agryse
For all the gloss that they conne
All sewen not this assyse
In yuell time they thus begone
Look how many among hem all
Holden not this hye way
With Antichrist they shullen fall
For they wolden god betray
God amend hem that best may
For many men they maken shende
They weten well the sothe I say
But the dyuell has foul hem blende
Some on her churches dwell
Appayrelled poorly / proud of port
The seuyn sacraments they done sell
In cattle catchyng is her comfort
Of each matter they woollen mell
And done hem wrong is her dispor^e
To affray the people they ben fell
And hold hem lower than does the lord
For the tithynge of a duke
Or of an apple / or an aye
They make men swear upon a ^oke
Thus they foulyn Christ's fay
Such beren yuell heuyn kay
They mowen assoyle / they mow shriue
With men's wives strongly play
With tr^we tyllers sturte and strive
At the wrestlyng / and at the wake
And chief chauntours at the nale
Markette beters / and medlyng make
Hoppen and houten with heue and hale
At fair fresshe / and at wine stale
Dyn^ and drink / and make debate
The seuyn sacraments set at sail
How keep such they keys of heuyn gate?
Men's wives they woollen hold
And though that they ben right sorry
To speak they shull not be so bold
For sompnyng to the consistory
And make hem say mouth I lie
Though they it saw with her eye
His lemman holden openly
No man so hardy to axe why
He woll have tythyng and offrynge
Mauger who so ever it gruche
And twyse on the day he woll sing
Gods prestes nere none such
He mote on huntyng with dog and bytche
And blown his horn / and cryen hey
And sorcery vsen as a wytche
Such kepyn yuell Peter's key
Yet they mote have some stock or stone
Gayly painted / and proudly dight
To maken men leuyn upon
And say that it is full of might
About such / men set up great light
Other such stocks shull stand thereby
As dark as it were midnight
For it may make no maistry
That it leude people se mow
Thou Mary / thou worchest wonder things
About that / that men offryn to now
^ongen broches / ouches / and rings
The pre^st purchases the offrynges
But he nyll offer to none image
Woe is the soul that he for synges
That precheth for such a pylgrimage
To men and women that been poor
That been Christ's own likeness
Men shulden offer at her door
That su^^ryn hungre and dystresse
And to such images offer less
That mow not feel thurst ne cold
The poor in spyrite began Christ bless
Therefore offreth to feeble and old
Buckelers broad / and swerdes long
Baudrike / with ba^clardes kene
Such toles about her neck they hang
With Antichrist such priests been
Upon her deeds it is well seen
Whom they seruen / whom they honoren
Antichrists they ben clean
And goddis goods falsely deuouren
Of scarlet and grene gay gowns
That mote be shape for the new
To clyppen and kyssen cou^ten in towns
The damsels that to the dauuce sewe
Cutted clothes to sewe her hew
With long pykes on her shone
Our gods gospel is not true
Either they seruen the dyuell or none
Now ben priests pokes so wide
That men must enlarge the vestement
The holy gospel they done hyde
For they contraryen in raiment
Such priests of Lucifere ben sent
Like conquerours they ben arayde
The proud pendauntes at her ars ypent
Falsely the truth they han betrayde
Shrifte silver such woollen ask is
And woll men crepe to the crouche
None of the sacraments save asks
Without mede shall no man touch
On her bishop their warant vouch
That is law of the decre
With mede and money thus they mouche
And thus they said is charity
In the mids of her mass
They nyll have no man but for hyre
And full shortly let forth pass
Such shull men find in each shyre
That personages for profit desire
To live in lykyng and in lusts
I dare not said / Sans ose ieo dire
That such ben Antichrists priests
Or they yef the bysshoppes why
Or they mote ben in his service
And holden forth her harlotry
Such prelates ben of feeble emprise
Of goddis grame such men agryse
For such matters that taken mede
How they excuse hem / and in what wise
Me thinks they ought greatly dread
They said / that it to no man longs
To reprove them though they err
But falsely goddis goodesse they fongeth
And therewith maynteyne woe and werre
Her deeds should be as bright as sterre
Her living / leude man's light
They say the pope may not err
Need must that pass man's might
Though a pressed lie with his le^man all night
And tellen his fellow / and he him
He goth to mass anon right
And says he syngeth out of sin
His bird abides him at his inn
And dighteth his dinner the mean while
He syngeth his mass for he would win
And so he weneth god begyle
Hem thinks long till they be met
And that they vsen forth all the year
Among the folk when he is set
He holds no man half his pere
Of the bishop he has powere
To soil men / or else they ben lore
His absolutyon may make them skere
And woe is the soul that he syngeth fore
The Gryffon began for to threte Gryffon.

And said / of monks can thou ought
The Pellycane said / they ben full great Pelycan.

And in this world much woe has wrought
Saint Benet / that her order brought
Ne made hem never on such manner
I trow it came never in this thought
That they should use so great powere
That a man should a monk lord call
Ne serve on knees / as a king
He is as proud as prince in pall
In mete / and drink / and all thing
Some wearyn myter and ring
With double worsted well ydight
With royal mete and rich drink
And rides on a courser as a knight
With hawk and With hounds eke
With broches or ouches on his hode
Some say no mass in all a weke
Of deynties is her most fode
With lordshippes and with bondmen
This is a royal relygyoun
Saint Benet made ueuer none of hem
To have lordshippe of man ne town
Now they ben qneynte and curious
With fine clothe cladde and served clean
Proud angry / and enuyous
Malice is mouche that they mean
In catchyng crafty and covetous
Lordly lyuen in great lykyng
This lynyng is not relygyous
According to Benette in his living
They ben clerks / her courts they over se
Her poor tenaunce fully they flyte
The hyre that a man amerced be
The gladlyer they woll it write
This is far from Christ's pouerte
For all with couetyse they endyte
On the poor they have no pity
Ne never hem cherysshe but ever hem byte
And commonly such ben comen
Of poor people / and of hem begete
That this perfection han ynomen
Her fathers ryden not but on her fete
And trauaylen sore for that they ete
In pouert lives young and old
Her fathers suffers drought and wete
Many hungry meles / thurst / and cold
And all this the monks han forsake
For Christ's love and saint Benette
To pride and ease have hem take
This relygion is yuell be set
Had they ben out of relygioun
They must have honged at the plowe
Thresshyng and dykyng fro town to town
With sorry mete / and not half ynowe
Therefore they han this all forsake
And taken to riches / pride / and ^ase
Full few for god woll monks hem mak^
Little is such order for to praise
Saint Benet ordained it not so
But badde hem be cherelyche
In churlyche manner live and go
Boystous in earth / and not lordlych
They disclanuder saint Benette
Therefore they have his holy curse
Saint Benet with hem never met
But if they thought to rob his purs^
I can no more hereof tell
But they ben like tho before
And clean serve the dyuell of hell
And ben his treasour and his store
And all such other counterfeytours
Chanons / canons / and such disgysed
Ben gods enemies and traitors
His true relygion han foul dispysed
Of Freres I have told before
In a making of a Creed
And yet I could tell worse and more
But men would weryen it to read
As gods goodness no man tell might
Write ne speak / ne think in thought
So her falshed / and her unright
May no man tell that ever god wrought
Gryffon.
The Gryffon said / thou can no good
Thou came never of no gentle kind
Outher I trow thou wexest wood
Or else thou have lost thy mind
Sulde holy churches have no heed?
Who should be her gouernayle
Who should her rule / who should her reed
Who should her forthren / who should avail
Each man shall live by his travail
Who best does / shall have most mede
With strength if men the church assail
With strength men must defend her need
And the pope were purely poor
Nedy / and nothing ne had^e
He should be driven from door to door
The wicked of him nolde not be dradde
Of such an heed men would be sad
And synfully lyuen as hem lust
With strength / ame^des such be made
With wepen wolves from sheep be wust
If the pope and prelates would
So beg / and bydde / bow and borowe
Holy church should stand full cold
Her servants sytte and soupe sorrow
And they were noughty foul and horowe
To worship god men would wlate
Both on even and on morrow
Such harlotry men would hate
Therefore men of holy church
Should ben honest in all thing
Worshypfully gods works werche
So seems it to serve Christ her king
In honest and in clean clothyng
With vessels of gold and clothes rich
To god honestly to make offryng
To his lordshyppe none is lyche
The Pellycan cast on houge cry Pellycan

And said alas / why say thou so
Christ is our heed that sytteth on hye
Heddes ne ought we have no mo
We ben his members both also
And father he taught us to call him als
Masters to be called defended he tho
All other masters ben wicked and falls
That takes maistry in his name
Goostly / and for erthly good
Kings and lords should lordshyp hane
And rule the people with mylde mode
Christ for us that shed his blood
Badde his priests no maystershyp have
Ne carke not for clothe ne ^ode
From every myschefe he will hem save
Her rich clothyng shall be ryghtwy^enesse
Her treasour / true life shall be
Charity shall be her richesse
Her lordshippe shall be unity
Hope in god / her honest
Her vessel clean conscience
Poor in spyrite / and humylyte
Shall Be holy churches defense
What said the Gryffon may the grieve Gryffon^

That other folks faren well
What haste thou to done with her live
Thy falshed each man may feel
For thou can no catell get
But lyuest in land as a lorell
With glosyng gettest thon thy mete
So fares the devil that wonneth in hell
He would that each man there should dwell
For he lives in clean envy
So with the tales that thou do tell
Thou would other people distry
With your gloss / and your heresy
For ye can live no better life
But clean in hypocrisy
And bring the in woe and strife
And therewith have not to done
For ye ne have here no cure
Ye serve the dyuell / neither god ne man
And he shall pay you your hyre
For ye woll fare well at feestes
And warm clothed for the cold
Therefore ye gloss goddis hestes
And begyle the people young and old
And all the seuyn sacraments
ye speak against / as ye were slye
Against tithi^ges / offrynges / with your ente^tes
And on our lords body falsely lie
And all this ye done to live in case
As who says / there ben none such
And said the pope is not worth a pease
To make the people again him gruche
And this comes in by fendes
To bring the christen in distaunce
For they would that no man were friends
Leave thy chattryng with myschaunce
If thou live well / what will thou more
Let other men live as hem list
Spend in good / or keep in store
Other men's conscience never thou nyst
ye han no cure to answer fore
What meddell ye / that han not to done
Let men live as they han done yore
For thou shalt answer for no man
The Pellycan said / Sir / nay Pellycan

I dispysed not the pope
Ne no sacrament / sothe to say
But speak in charity and good hope
But I dispyse her hye pride
Her richesse / that should be poor in ^pirite
Her wickedness is know so wide
They serve god in false habyte
And turnyn meekness in to pride
And lowelynesse in to hye degree
And goddis words turn and hyde
And that am I moved by charity
To let men to live so
With all my connyng and all my might
And to warn men of her woe
And to tell hem truth and right
The sacraments be soul hele
If they ben used in good use
Against that speak I never a dele
For than were I nothing wise
But they that vsen hem in mysse manner
Or set hem up to any sale
I trow they shall abye hem dear
This is my reason / this is my tale
Who so takes hem vnrightfulllyche
Against the ten co^maundymentes
Or by gloss wreched lyche
Sells any of the sacraments
I trow they do the devil homage
In that they wetyn they do wrong
And thereto I dare well wage
They seruyn Satan for all her song
To tithen and offren is wholesome life
So it be done in dew manner
A man to houselyn and to shryue
Weddyng / and all the other in fere
So it be notherfolde ne bought
Ne take ne give for couetyse
And it be so taken it is naught
Who sells hem so / may sore agryse
On our lords body I do not lie
I say sothe through true read
His flesh and blood through his mastry
Is there / in the form of bread
How it is there / it needs not strive
Whether it be subgette or accydent
But as Christ was / when he was on live
So is he there v^rament
If pope or cardynall live good live
As Christ commanded in his gospel
Against that woll I not strive
But me thinks they live not well
For if the pope lived as god bid
Pride and highness he should dispyse
Richesse / couetyse / and crown on head
Meekness and pouerte he should use
Gryffon.
The Gryffon said he should abye
Thou shall be brent in balefull fire
All they sect I shall distrye
Ye shall be hanged by the swyre
Ye shullen be honged and to draw
Who gives you leave for to preche
Or speak against gods law
And the people thus falsely teache
Thou shall be cursed with book and bell
And disseuered from holy church
And clean ydampned in to hell
Otherwise but ye woll worche
Pellycan
The Pellycan said that I ne dread
Your cursyng is of little value
Of god I hope to have my mede
For it is fashede that ye show
For ye ben out of charity
And wylneth vengeance / as did Nero
To suffryn I woll ready be
I dread not that thou can do
Christ badde ones suffer for his love
And so he taught all his servants
And but thou amend for his ^ake above
I dread not all thy mayntenaunce
For if I dread the worlds hate
Me thinks I were little to praise
I dread nothing your hye estate
Ne I dread not your diseace
Would ye turn and leave your pride
your hye port / and your richesse
your cursyng should not go so wyd^
God bring you in to rightwysenesse
For I dread not your tyran^y
For nothing that ye can done
To suffer I am all ready
Syker I recke never how soon
The Gryffon grynned as he were wode Gryffon.

And looked lovely as an owl
And swore by cocks heart blood
He would him tere every doule
Holy church thou di^claundrest foul
For thy reasons I woll the all to race
And make thy flesh to rote and moule
Losell / thou shalt have hard grace
The Gryffon flewe forth on his way
The Pellycane did sytte and weep
And to him self he began say
God would that any of Christ's sheep
Had herd / and ytake keep
Each a word that here said was
And would it write and well it keep
God would it were all for his grace
Plowma^
I answerde / and said I would
If for my travail any man would pay
Pelycan.
He said yes / these that god han sold
For they han store of money
Plowma^
I said / tell me and thou may
Why tellest thou men's trespace?
Pelyca^.
He said / to amend hem in good fay
If god woll give me any grace
For Christ him self is lykened to me
That for his people dyed on rode
As fare I / right so fares he
He fedeth his birds with his blood
But these done yuell against good
And ben his fone under friends face
I told hem how her living stood
God amend hem for his grace
Plowma^
What ayleth the Gryffon / tell why
That he holds on that other side
For they two ben lykely
And with kinds robben wide
Pelycan.
The foul betokens pride
As Lucifere / that high flewe was
And sith he did him in yuell hyde
For he agylted goddis grace
As bird flies up in the air
And lives by birds that been meke
So these be flow up in to despair
And shenden sely souls eke
The souls that been in sins seek
He culleth hem / knele therefore alas
For bribry goddis forbode break
God amend it for his grace
The hinder part is alyoun
A robber and a rauynere
That robs they people in earth a down
And in earth holds none his pere
So fares this foul both far and nere
And with temporell strength they people chas^
As a lion proud in earth here
God amend hem for his grace
He flewe forth with his wings twain Pellycan

All droupyng / dased / and dull
But soon the Gry^^on came again Gryffon.

Of his ^oules the earth was full
The Pellycan he had cast to pull
So great a nombre never seen there was
What manner of fowls tellen I woll
If god woll give me o^ his grace
With the Gryffon comen fowls feel
Rauyns / rokes / crows / and pie
Grayfoules / agadred well
I g^rde above they would hye
Gledes and bosardes weren hem by
White molles and puttockes token her plac^
And lapwynges / that well co^neth lie
This fellowship han for gerde her grace
Long the Pellycane was out
But at last he comes again
And brought with him the Phenixe stout
The Gry^^on would have ^^owe ^ull ^ayne
His fowls that ^lewen as thycke as rain
The Phenixe tho began hem chase
To ^lye from him it was in vain
For he did vengeance and no grace
He slew hem down without mercy
There astarte neither free ne thrall
On him they cast a xufull cry
When the Gry^^on down was fall
He beat hem not / but slew hem all
Whither he hem drove no man may trace
Under the earth me thought they yall
Alas they had a feeble grace
Pellycan
The Pelycan than axed tyght
For my writing if I have blame
Who woll for me fight of flight?
Who shall shield me from shame
He that had a maid to dame
And the lamb that slain was
Shall shield me from gostly blame
For erthely harm is goodis grace
Therefore I pray every man
Of my writing have me excused
This writynge writes the Pellycan
That thus these people has dispysed
For I am fresshe ^ully aduysed
I nyll not maynteyne his manace
For the devil is often disguysed
To bring a man to yuell grace
Wyteth the Pellycane and not me
For hereof I nyll not auowe
In hye ne in low / ne in no degree
But as a fable take i^ ye mow
To holy church I will me bow
Each man to amend him Christ send space
And for my writynge me allow
He that is almighty for his grace
