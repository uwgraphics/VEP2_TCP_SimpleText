Noble SIR,
YOur most Generous and Heroical disposition, seen and manifested in love,
and professed affection to both Art and Arms, or whatsoever best things
Learning and all laudable Inventions, the daughters of Minerva and the Muses,
in whom you may justly claim no small interest; makes me both offer this, and
assured of your honorable and kindest acceptance (as in things of inferior
nature has been d^^^gned) more especially of these divine Sonnets, howsoever
the manner, not so worthily agreeing with the majesty of the matter, yet not
meanly dignified by the divinenesse and excellency of the subject: A Lyrique in
his own ancient and native language, wherein I could also present him thus
modernly dimensioned to our times, and therein the most worthy the best favor
and regard. So offering it (such as it is) to your Patronage, having testimony
sufficient of your courteous respect to any, even the meanest of my Poetical
essays and endeavors in this kind, till fit apportunity be offered by the
dedications of some graver treatise, (though better cannot be than this) to
remember your honorable Name: I rest in all humility devoted

At your service, WILLIAM SLATYER.


PSALMS, OR SONGS OF SION.
PSALM 1.
THrice blessed, who has not bent
t'^ll counsel foo^ nor ear,
Nor path of sinners hent,
nor sat in scorners chair:
But in the law of God the Lord
has set his whole delight,
And in that law, the eternal Word,
does meditate day and night.
He Is like the tree that springs
fast by the rivers side,
That fair fruit store forth brings
in her due time and tide:
Whose leaf shall neither fade nor fall,
but flourish still and stand:
The Lord, who plants, does prosper all
that this man takes in hand.
But now the ungodly finds
his state is nothing so;
But like, by whirling winds,
chafe scattered to and fro.
Therefore the wicked never can
in judgment stand upright,
Nor sinners with the righteous man
once come in place or sight.
For why the righteous has
his ways made so direct,
That to his virtuous path
the Lord does yield respect.
When ways of such as do decline
from Gods just statutes shown,
And spurn against the laws divine
shall quite be overthrown.
PSALM 6.
THine ire, Lord, on me do not wreake,
Nor in displeasure fell chastise me;
But on me, Lord, since I am weak
Have mercy, and do not despise me.
Lord, heal me; for my bones are vexed:
My soul is sick, and sore perplexed.
But Lord, how long, how long, I say,
Will thou delay, and vengeance take?
Lord turn thee, save my soul I pray;
O save me for thy mercies sake:
For why, in death no man does mind thee;
In pit, to praise thee, who will find thee?
But I am weary of my groaning,
Each night wash I my bed with tears,
With tears of my sad plaint and moaning,
Watring my couch through cares and fears.
My beauty gone through foes disdaining,
Worn away with my sad complaining.
Away yet from me sinners vain,
The Lord has heard my voice, my groans,
The Lord hears my petition feign:
Will take my prayer, attend my moan,
And all my foes sore vexed and wounded,
Shamed, turned back, shall be soon confounded.
PSALM 8.
O Lord our God and Governor, how hie
and excellent 's thy Name every where?
Thou that have set thy glory great and majesty
above the starry spangled sphere,
Out of the mouth of tender sucklings thou
art pleased to confound thy foes;
For in those babes thou will thy might and glory show,
thy graces they disclose.
So when above me the heavens fair and hie
works of those fingers of thine
Sun, Moon, and Stars I spy in clear and azur sky,
in order as thou point'st them to shine:
What thing is man then, O Lord, to mind I call,
that thou should remember him?
What man's race so small, his sons, and his posterity all,
that thou should consider them?
For in degree thou have made him little less
or lower, than the Angels fair:
When more thou did bless, and crown him we confess
with dignity and glory rare:
Thou made him his dominion to bring
over all thy handy works of wonder.
Laying every thing, advanced like a King
his feet and subjection under.
All sheep, and Neat, and beasts that appear
in the fields for to feed or abide;
Fowls of the air, or Fishes that repair
through the paths of the seas so wide:
Therefore O Lord of glorious Majesty,
Lord of the whole world, that do hear,
How excellent and great's thy Name advanced and glory hie
above the starry spangled Sphere?
PSALM II.
IN the Lord put I my trust,
how say ye then to my soul,
To the mountain that fly she must
like a sielly foul?
For lo the wicked bend their bow,
with their shafts ready pressed
Upon the string, to shoore at those,
so they set up their rest.
Privily do they hit the upright
that are in heart, whence thrown,
When down are the foundation quite,
what has the righteous done?
The Lord is in his holy place,
in th'eaven is his Throne.
His eyes consider the childrens case,
his eyelids try each one.
The Lord he will the righteous try,
but the wicked doer,
And him that loves iniquity,
does his soul abhor.
Upon the wicked he shall reign
fire, and brimstone, and snares,
Stormy tempest shall be their gain,
and cup to drink their shares.
PSALM 13.
HOw long will thou forget me Lord?
ever shall I faint?
How long will thou not grace afford
to my sad complaint?
How long will thou thy visage hide
from me as thou mean to chide?
with thy faces, and thy graces,
so much feared restraint.
How long shall I to my unrest
daily making moan?
Take counsel thus within my breast,
and with sighing groan.
How long else shall my deadly foe
above me be exalted so?
My weary heart even daily smarting
when I am alone.
Behold and hear me O my God,
lighten thou mine eyes,
That I sleep not in death abhorred,
lest with open cry
My enemy rejoice, and say,
I have prevailed against him ay:
And that tide when I slide,
seem to get the prize.
But I will in thy mercy trust,
and with heart and voice
In thy salvation, as I must,
evermore rejoice.
Yea, I will sing unto the Lord,
because, according to his word,
Friendly he has dealt with me,
and freed me from annoyes.
PSALM 15.
LOrd, within thy Tabernacle
whom will thou receive to dwell?
Or within the habitacle
of thy Sions sacred Cell,
Thy royal Tents high Battlements,
who shall ascend, where comes no ill,
With theet abide, ay to reside,
and rest upon thy holy Hill?
He whose life's upright, and whose
ways and works are just and straight,
Whose heart thoughts of truth disclose,
and whose tongue speaks no deceit,
Nor wish nor will his neighbor ill,
in body, honor, goods, or name:
Nor willing takes false tales, or makes
reports, that might impair the same.
That in heart does not regard
malicious wicked men and vile:
But who love and fear the Lord
he makes much of them the while.
That keeps his oath, his word, and troth,
according to their free intent,
Nor will forgo his promise, though
he find it to his detriment.
That indeed has never lent
to the usurious trade his coin,
Ne for to hurt the innocent
did bribe, play false, or else purloine*
Who so does all these things, that shall
be pleasing to thy heavenly doom,
Lord, cannot here in this world fear,
nor perish in the world to come.
PSALM 16.
SAve me and preserve me ever,
O my God, for in thy word
I trusted; and my soul persever:
thou have said unto the Lord,
Thou art my Lord, my King, my God:
my goods are nothing unto thee.
Those love I well on earth that dwell.
in virtue that excelling be:
Sorrows to them that run after
other gods shall be enlarged,
Their blood offerings I Will not offer,
neither shall my lips be charged
Once with their names, to show the same.
The Lord himself disdaineth not
My heritage free portion to be,
my cup, and to maintain my lot.
Unto me the line is fallen
in a fair and pleasant place;
A goodly heritage befallen.
I will praise Iehovah's grace,
That warning gave my soul to save,
my reins anights his chastnings bide,
I set thee, and at my right hand
Lord stood'st thou, that I should not slide.
Heart was glad, my tongue and glory,
flesh rejoice, and rest in hope;
For thou will not leave me sorry,
nor my soul in grave to droope.
And since from grave my soul to save
thou will not let to set me free,
Shall never sure, in pit impure,
thy holy One corruption see.
Thou shall show O Lord most holy
unto me the path of life;
For with thee the fountain wholly
is of health, and pleasures rise.
Before thy face that happy place
abounds with joy such plenteous store.
Thy presence, and at thy right hand
full bliss and life for evermore.
PSALM 19.
LOrd, the Heavens high and fair,
starrie Spheres, and Orbs there under,
Gloriously they do declare
all thy mighty works of wonder;
Day to day do show the same,
night to night record thy fame.
No language, tongue, or speech,
in which their voices are not found,
Thy noble acts with lively sound
to the ends of the earth to preach.
There he set a Tabernacle
for the Son that Bridegroom wife.
From his chambers receptacle,
does in Eastern regions rise,
And with valiant champions grace,
giant-like to run his race,
Advances in the sky
from end to end, that nothing did
Escape, or from the heat were hid,
or beams of days bright eye.
Perfect, and the soul converting
is thy law and judgments sure,
Wisdom to the weak in parting,
thy commandments are pure,
Giving light unto the eyes,
they rejoice the heart likewise.
Thy laws and statutes either
clean, thy fear endures always,
Truth thy testimonies ay,
and righteous altogether.
Precious more than gold admired,
than much fin^d gold thy doom,
Sweeter, and to be desired
more than honey or hony-combe:
They forewarne me in my way,
what is so dear and sweet as they?
High honor they intend,
in keeping them's great recompense.
Oh who can tell his secret sins,
how often he does offend?
Cleanse, O cleanse my negligence,
secret faults my soul that stain:
So freed, over me foul offenses
nor presumptuous sins shall reign;
But from many blots made clean,
let my soul her self demean,
And tongue as may beseem her,
that both thought of heart and word
May acceptable be, O Lord,
my strength, and my Redeemer.
PSALM 33.
MY Shepherd is the ever living Lord,
and so loving I nothing can need;
In pastures fair, by his heavenly word
conducting me forth to feed.
Pleasantly he, to the fountains that be
led along by the fruitful field,
And my soul he did guide down to the rivers side,
that the waters of comfort yield.
Yea, though I walk in the vallie of death,
that I need not to fear none ill:
For it is thou make me still draw my breath,
by the power of thy holy will.
And with thy rod thou will save me O God
making haste with thy shepherds crook,
To relieve me that breath in the shadow of death
by thy favor and gracious look:
For in the presence of all envious foes
my table have thou richly spread;
Filling full my cup till it quite overflowes,
and with balm did anoint my head:
So that now finally, all my life till I dye,
to thy mercy my self I commend;
And the Temple of thy grace shall be my dwelling place,
where the rest of my days will I spend.
PSALM 42.
LIke the Heart that strayes,
Breathes, pants, and brayes,
To the rivers fair to gain,
Even so my poor heart right feign.
My soul I cry
Thirsts, O when nie
To the living God of might,
Shall I come to appear in his sight?
All times my tears
Are my repast and food,
And more my fears,
When wicked men deride,
Where now is God thy guide;
Stood I at the tide
In sad and heavy mood
My soul even faints,
Void of her best delight,
Since now she wants
What freedom once she had,
When to the Temple glad
As her train she led
Music and songs she might.
Why art thou so
Surcharged with woe,
O my soul, and robbed of rest;
Hope and help is in God most blessed:
Trust in his Name,
And praise the same.
O my God, my soul is sad,
Yet thee I remember glad:
For Iordans land,
And little Hermon hill,
Whiles great deepes, and
Griefs one another call,
Ills, like to water-falls,
Storms, whose noise appalls,
Thy stouds o'rewhelme me still,
In God by day
Mercy and grace I find,
By night always
I unto him will sing;
And as often prayer bring,
As my heavenly King,
God of my life I mind.
To God I say, my strength and stay,
Why have thou forgotten me,
Though I mourn and oppressed be?
Or why else so
Do I troubled go,
As heavy and ill appaid,
Whiles enemies me upbraid.
My bones as 'twere
Smit with a sword asunder,
Whiles those I fear,
My foes that me upbraid,
Where now is God thine aid?
To me daily said,
Making at me a wonder.
Why art thou so
Vexed O my soul, and sore
Perplexed with woe?
O trust in God most hie,
For on his help rely,
Praise him ay will I,
My God and hope evermore.
PSALM 43.
IVdge my cause, O Lord,
And give sentence for me:
My just plea record
Against the ungodly throng.
From deceitful crew,
Those that do abhor me,
Save me Lord most true,
And revenge my wrong.
O God of my strength,
Why have thou at length
Put me far away from thee?
And O Lord, why so
Heavily do I go,
Whiles my foe oppresses me?
O send out in brightness
For my souls uprightness.
And to guide me in the way,
Thy lights beams reflecting,
And thy truth directing,
That my steps go not astray.
To thy holy hill
And supernall palace,
Lord conduct me still,
By thy truth and grace.
To thy Temple so,
God of joy and solace,
Thy Courts will I go;
Even thy holy place,
On the harp with glee,
I Will give thanks to thee,
Thou O God, my God most dear:
Why art thou so vexed,
O my soul perplexed,
In so sad and heavy cheer?
O in God most holy,
Put thy trust then wholly.
Unto him will I give praise,
That in favor ever
Does to me persever,
God my hope and help always.
PSALM 47.
ALl people clap your hands,
Sing laud unto the Lord,
Advance your notes with merry noise,
And telling tune with joyful voice
His wonders all abroad.
For why, above all lands,
The Lord is high and great,
A terrible and mighty King,
Angel quires his praises sing,
In heaven his glorious seat.
The people under us be subdued,
Under our feet the nations rude;
So the Heathen all
He did make, and shall
Under our feet to fall.
For his own sake alone,
And he himself an heritage,
The flowring worship of that age;
For us now to whose
Race his lore he shows,
And Jacobs glory chose,
His welbeloved one.
God he is, out of the earth,
Ascended up on hie,
Gone in triumphs merry noise,
And with trumpets royal voice
Up to the starrie sky.
Sing to our God with mirth,
Sing praises to our King;
For God is King of all the earth,
Sing to him with greatest mirth,
With understanding sing.
God does over the Heathen reign,
God that will his cause maintain,
God that sits alone,
On his holy Throne,
And is other none,
Does heaven and earth behold,
And how the princes all abroad
Are to the people of Abraham's God
Joined, who they intend,
As with a shield defends
All the earth, and to that end,
High only to be extolled.
PSALM 63.
GReat is the Lord on hie,
And great his praises still
To be advanced, and spread abroad
Within the City of our God
Upon his holy hill.
Mount Sion North does lie,
And is a pleasant place,
Whence joy of all the lands does spring,
The City of the mighty King
Does so this mountain grace.
In whose palaces is shown,
God for a refuge surely known;
For lo the King each one
Gathered, and to get her gone,
Were astonished, as thereon
They gaze, and with wondering muse.
Suddenly driven back they were,
Fear came upon them, and sorrow there,
As on a woman in
Travel, and destroyed they bin
Like the ships of Tharsis, when
With East winds thou will them bruise,
As we have heard it said,
So have we seen of old,
Within the City of the Lord
Of hosts, the City of our God,
That ever he will uphold.
O Lord, we wait for aid,
Amid'st thy holy place,
According to thy Name thy praise,
Unto the worlds end do raise.
Thy loving kindness and grace,
Thy right hand thy Saints confess,
Lord, is full of righteousness:
Hence Mount Sions voice,
And the daughters noise
Of Judah glad rejoice,
Cause of thy judgments pure.
Compass Sion, compass her walls,
Tell well her towers and bulwarks all,
Mark well her towers, that ye
May tell posterity,
God's our God, and e're will be,
Our guide till death most sure.
PSALM 52.
WHy do thou boast thy self abroad,
thou tyrant, that thou can do ill:
The loving kindness of our God
seen daily, it continues still.
Deceit and fraud do in thy bosom lurk,
and as thy lewd heart does devise,
Thy tongue is making of despitefull work,
like rasor sharp it cuts with lies.
Thou evil more than good approu'st,
more than truth to speak lies and guile:
All words that may destroy thou love,
O thou deceitful tongue and vile;
Therefore shall God destroy thee, pluck and take,
and root thee quite out of thy tent,
From the land of the living, thee to make
go int' eternal banishment.
The righteous shall see this, and fear,
and laugh at him, and say, behold,
What is become of this man here,
that on his riches was so bold?
Lo he that took not God his fortitude,
but in his malice put his strength,
And in his riches and their multitude,
he fell, and perished thus at length:
But as for me, I shall be seen
in Gods house always to persever,
Like to an Olive tree so green,
my trust was in his mercies ever;
So I will always praise thy holy Name,
for that, O Lord, thou have done this:
I will hope in thy Name, because the same,
before thy Saints so joyful is.
PSALM 57.
HAve mercy, O my God, have mercy strait,
My soul does trust in thee, and on thee wait:
In shadow of thy wings my hope is placed,
Until this tyranny be over-past.
I Will call unto the most high God, even he;
God that performs his promise toward me:
For he will send from his high heaven, and save me
From their reproof, would swallow and deprave me.
God will send out his mercy and his truth;
My soul among lions is, I lie in ruth
Among men's sons, that are set on fire, their words,
Their teeth are spears and shafts, their tongues sharp swords
Exalt thy self above the heavens, O God,
Thy glory aye on all the earth abroad.
Nets laid they in my way my soul to oppress,
Pits too, but fell in their own wickedness.
My heart, O God, prepared is always,
My heart's prepared, I will sing and give praise:
Awake my glory, Lute and Harp I Will take,
And I my self right early will awake.
I will praise thee, O Lord, among the nations,
I Will sing to thee among all generations.
Thy mercy great unto the heaven does reach,
Thy truth exceeds, and to the clouds does streach;
Exalt thy self above the heavens, O God,
Thy glory aye over all the earth abroad.
Awake my Violl, Lute and Harp awake,
To praise the Lord sweet music let us make.
PSALM 60.
O God, thou (...) cast us out of yore,
And scattred (...) angry with us fore:
O turn again (...); thou have made
The land to tremble, and with fear to fade.
O heal he breach, for it fore does shake;
The breach thereof that thy hands did make.
Thou show the people heavy things, in fine
Thou made us drink a draught of deadly wine.
But now thou have advanced an ensign known,
A token given to them that are thine own:
To them that fear thee, and
In cause of truth by them to be displaied.
That thy beloved may be fully freed,
Help with thy right hand, hear me at my need.
God in his holiness spoke, rejoice I shall,
Sechem divide, and mete out Succoth vale;
Gilead is mine, Manasses mine shall be,
Strength of my head is Ephraim, Judah he
My Lawgiver, Moab my wash-pot named,
I will cast out my shooc over Edom famed:
So will I triumph, and in this design
Show thy self joyful for me Palestine.
Who will lead me into the City great?
Who will bring me unto strong Edoms seat?
Will thou not God that helpedst us of yore,
Go with our armies forth, as heretofore?
Against troubles, O God, give us aid again;
For else we know the help of man is vain.
Through God we shall do valiant acts well known,
For he shall tread our cruel enemies down.
PSALM 61.
REgard, O Lord, for I complain,
And make my moan to thee;
Let not my words return in vain,
But lend an ear to me:
For from the end and utmost part
Of the earth, in anguish of my heart
I cry, I cry, O hear my woes:
And on the rock of thy great power,
My hope, my help, my fort, my tower,
O God, my woeful mind repose.
Within thy tent, O King of kings,
I long and hope to dwell,
Under the covering of thy wings
I trust, and knew right well
I shall be safe; for thou wast near
O God, and did my prayer hear,
And wilt, and wilt fulfill the same.
Thou Lord do my desire regard,
And wilt with gracious gifts reward
All those, all those that seek thy Name.
A long life thou will give the King,
For many an age to reign;
His years shall fresh for ever spring,
Before God to remain,
Where he shall have a dwelling place
And for thy mercy, truth, and grace,
Shall praise, shall praise thy holy Name:
So will I sing thy praise still,
Perform my duties, vows fulfill,
And daily, daily pay the same.
PSALM 63.
THou, O God, art my God whom I early enquire,
My soul thirsts for thee, my flesh does desire
And long after thee the true fountain of bliss,
In a harren and dry land where no water is.
O let me behold thee in thy Sanctuary,
And see thy great majesty, power, and glory;
For thy loving kindness is better than life,
And my lips will be telling thy praises most rise.
So Lord will I magnify thee all my days,
And lift up my hands in thy Name to thy praise?
My soul shall be filled with marrow and fatness,
Mouth and heart praising thee with lip-offrings of gladness.
Often thou on my bed art remembered by me,
And in the night season I think upon thee
Because thou have been my defense from annoyes,
Under the shadow of thy wings will I therefore rejoice
My soul cleaves unto thee; for thy right hand
Vpholdeth me, and therefore Lord shall I stand:
And who seek for my soul to destroy it, into
The nethermost parts of the earth they shall go,
And with the edge of the sword they shall be cast down,
Made a portion for foxes, whiles joy the King crowne^
And who swear by him, by Gods truth underpropt,
But the mouth of all those that speak lies shall be stopped.
PSALM 65.
O God all praise on thee does wait,
In Sion thine own hill:
The vow shall be performed strait,
According to thy will.
Because the prayer of all and some
Thou hear'st, to thee shall all flesh come.
O Lord, O Lord of hosts most hye,
My wicked deeds prevailed have;
But thou, O Lord, in mercy save
My soul, my soul, or else I dye.
The man is blessed whom thou do choose,
And make to come to thee,
That does thy house and Temple use,
Where choicest pleasures be;
Whom in thy Courts thou make to dwell,
Where all good things and joys excel,
The souls, the souls sweet satisfaction*
But thou in justice threa^^^^^ (...),
And answerest us with fearful signs,
O God, O God of our salvation.
O thou the hope of all, and stay
Of the ends of the earth, O God,
And of them that far off do stray
In the wild seas abroad,
That stablish^st the mountains strong,
And girt with power that does belong
To thee, to thee, the God of might.
The peoples tumults can appease,
And still the noise of raging seas,
The noise of waves that would affright.
Lord, they in the utmost parts of the earth
That dwell, as 't were dismayed;
Though East and West rejoice with mirth,
Are at thy signs afraid,
Thou make the outgoings with thy voice,
Of Morn and Evening to rejoice,
And so thou visitest the earth with rain,
Thou moistned'st it, and make it rich,
The river of God is plenteous, which
In store, prepares them corn and grain:
As thou appointest it to be,
The fields with fruit do fill,
Thou waterest so abundantly
Her surrowes from the hill.
From whence thou make the rain descend
Into the valleys, to that end,
With showers made soft and to abound,
Whose bud thou blessest every where,
And with thy goodness crown'st the year;
Thy clouds drop fatness on the ground,
Over all the deserts they shall drop,
Such plenty on the earth:
The fields and plains shall yield their crop,
The hills rejoice with mirth,
The little hills shall compast be
With gladness, and with merry glee,
That they with ecchoing noise shall ring;
With sheep the plains and pastures green,
With corn the valleys covered been,
Yeomen do shout for joy, and sing.
PSALM 84.
O Lord, how amiable
Thy Tabernacles be?
The dwelling place, and Temple of thy grace,
How pleasant Lord to me?
My soul, Lord God of Sabbath,
Longs to thy (...)
My heart does pant,
My flesh rejoice and faint,
The living God to know.
The Sparrow has found her a house,
And the Swallow,
A nest for to lay her young,
Even thy Altars among,
O Lord of hosts most holy,
My God and King, and solely
Great, glorious wholly, and most strong,
O blessed they that dwelling
In thy house sing thy praise,
And blessed he,
Whose strength it is in thee:
And in whose heart thy ways,
Who going through the vallie
Of tears dig fountains still,
Till with those tears,
As springs it all appears:
Thy rain their pooles does fill,
And so from strength to strength do they go,
In the beau^^ of holiness clear,
Till at last every one do appear,
Before the Lord in Sion,
Whose mercy they rely on,
And God of gods set eye-on there.
Lord God of hosts my prayer,
Thou God of Jacob hear,
Shield us in grace, and look upon the face
Of thine Anointed dear.
O a day in thy Court's better
Than a thousand other where,
And better dwell,
Doore-keeper in (...),
(...) ^^tents that do want thy fear;
For the Lord God is our son and our shield,
Who will give glory and grace
To them that seek his face,
And no good thing detained,
O blessed the unstained,
That faith in thee unfeigned place.
PSALM 87.
Firmly for ever are her foundations,
On the holy mountains laid,
Whence that appears that above the habitation
Of Jacob, as it is said,
The gates were blessed,
Of Sion best;
The Lord himself we know,
He loves to dwell thereby.
And glorious be, the things of thee
Were spoken long ago:
O thou City of God most high,
Mention making of Rahab, an eye on
Babylon will I throw,
As among them that my promise rely on,
And seek my Name to know:
Lo, Palestine, and Tire is mine,
With Aethiope long ago;
Great peoples bordering by,
Of them is made,
Great brute, and said,
Of sacred Sion so,
That in her is the most Hic.
There is he borne,
Is of Sion reported,
And famous men of yore,
Many that to the most Holy resorted,
And he will stablish her store;
Show then he shall,
That the chiefest of all,
Had his beginning there,
When he does his folk descry,
And all pleasant things,
My fountains and springs,
Quire, singers, are in thee here,
O thou City of God most hic.
PSALM 93.
THe Lord as King aloft does reign,
all clad and girt with power,
And majesty in heaven so hic,
his seat and sacred bower,
Whereas no eye, the Deity
c're saw, save tending on her,
Those Angels feign, and Cherub traine^,
with glory clothed and honor.
The world thou have so surely placed,
unmou'd it does persever,
Thy throne much more secured of yore,
the heaven of heavens for ever:
Before the Chime of ruinous time,
this world's frame set or wrought on,
And aye her state, beyond all date
of time that can be thought on.
The floods, O Lord, the floods record
thy praise, and with their voices,
The floods do rave, lift up their waves,
and rage with horrid noises.
Though floods with noise lift up their waves,
and seas enraged swelling,
With waves so hie, would kiss the sky,
yet thou art higher dwelling.
Most mighty Lord, true is thy word,
thy promise failing never;
And holiness, thy Saints profess,
becomes thy house for ever.
PSALM 97.
THe Lord alone aloft does reign,
let peoples mazed assemble,
He sits between the Cherubims,
though the earth be moved and tremble.
The Lord is great in Sions seat,
and high above all nations;
Yea, they shall fame thy fearful Name,
throughout all generations.
It Is holy sure, and the Kings power,
judgment prepares and loves it,
That justice be and equity
in Jacob, he approves it.
Exalt with praise my God always,
upon the Lords Name calling,
It Is holy known, lo then bow down,
before his footstool falling.
Moses among the Priestly throng,
and Aaron who believed;
With Samuel one, who called upon
his Name, and were relieved.
Out of the smoakie pillar spoke he
unto them, while he drove them:
Like pastured sheep, his laws they keep,
and statutes that he gave them.
Heard them thou have, O Lord, and wast
so favorable to them,
How did thou take for their deeds sake,
the vengeance due unto them?
Make Gods praise known, lo falling down
before his holy mountain;
For high in bliss, and holy he is,
love, grace, and mercies fountain.
PSALM 99.
THe Lord in heaven aloft does reign,
and there triumphant sitting;
Let the earth rejoice with mirthfull noise,
and numerous Isles as fitting.
Black pitchy clouds, and darkness shrowds,
his throne on judgment founded,
Fierce fires that trace before his face,
lick up his foes confounded.
His lightnings round, shone on the ground,
the earth saw it and was affrighted:
Mountains like wax did melt, like flax
were at his presence lighted.
His presence this whole world, that is
great Lord, and mighty owner:
Heavens show his glory, and justice story,
all Nations see his honor.
Where all that carved Idols served,
and glory in them, confounded:
This Sion had heard, and was glad,
through Salem mirth resounded:
So Iuda's voice, and daughters noise,
thy hests and mercies on her;
O Lord most hie, 'bove earth and sky,
all ye gods give him honor.
Who love the Lord, hate vice abhorred,
his Saints souls he preserves:
From wicked and ungodly's hand,
who serve him, he conserveth.
Sprung for the upright in heart is light,
and for the godly sown,
Are joy and wealth, and saving health,
and all good blessings known:
Rejoice O then, ye righteous men,
this your memorial raises;
To the holy Lord with one accord,
sing everlasting praises.
PSALM 101.
MErcy I will and judgment sing.
to thee O Lord most holy:
And unto thee, O Lord, will bring
my song, and prayer wholly,
Wisely I shall in perfect way,
until thou come in brightness,
Do right, and in my house always
walk in my hearts uprightness.
No wicked thing mine eyes shall see,
deeds hate I of back-sliders,
A froward heart shall part from me,
and slanderous lewd deriders:
A privy whisperer I Will not brook,
against neighbor, to annoy him,
The proud heart, high and haughty look,
I cannot but destroy him.
Unto the meek mine eyes are bent,
who in the land are faithful,
Shall serve and dwell within my tent,
who is profit, not deceitful.
The liar shall my eye not pity,
I Will spoil the wicked wholly,
And cut off sinners from the City
of God the Lord most holy.
PSALM 108.
O God, my heart prepared is,
so is my tongue and voice:
I will sing and give praise, in this
my glory shall rejoice.
Wake, be not mute, Harp, Violl, Lute,
and I my self right early will awake:
Thy praise I Will sing, and Name, O King,
among Heathen known, and Nations will I make,
'Bove heavens high, thy mercie's great,
thy truth reached to the clouds;
Exalt thy self 'bove heavens seat,
all the earth thy glory shroud.
That so set free thy beloved be,
help with thy right hand O God, and hear my voice.
In holiness now, has God we know
thus spoken, I will triumph and rejoice.
For trophies, Sichem I Will divide,
and mete out Succoth vale,
Gilead is mine, Manasses side
unto my share shall fall,
Strength of my head is Ephraim, stead
of Lawgiver is Judah; a wash-pot to me
Is Moab; I Will threw ^'re Edom my ^^oe,
over Palestine ^'l^ triumph and ^^^fall be.
Who Will lead me to the City strong,
me into Edom bring?
Wilt not thou, who have left us long,
again O God and King
Forth with us go, our armies so
against troubles to aid's, else help of man's but vain;
Through God shall we do valiantly,
who shall tread down our enemies cruel train.
PSALM 110.
THe Lord unto my Lord did say,
Sit thou at my right hand for ay,
Till at thy feet so humbly laid,
Thy foes I have thy footstool made.
The Lord then out of Sion bright,
Shall send the scepter of thy might:
Thou shall be ruler with thy rod,
Yea, how commander thou shall be,
Amidst thine enemies all shall see.
And in that day, in which thy reign
They shall behold, and power plain,
The people free will offerings shall,
And holy army offer all,
Who presents shall to thee O King,
In beauty of holy worship bring:
For lo, the dew of thy birth shows
Like womb of youth, and mornings dewes.
Like mornings dew, dew of thy birth,
To far, enrich, and fresh the earth.
The Lord has sworn, and never may
Repent, thou art a Priest for ay
After Melchisedechs order blessed,
Of the most high God, Saint and Priest.
The Lord at thy right hand, that stownd,
Stately Kings in his wrath shall wound,
The heathen brought and Nations all,
Before his judgment seat, he shall,
Filling their places with their dead,
Over mighty Kingdoms smite the head,
And drinking of the Brook in 's way,
Lift up his royal head that day.
PSALM 114.
WHen that Israel was bent
out of Egypt land,
And the house of Jacob went
from that Barbarian strand,
Judah was his Sanctuary,
and his holy bower;
Israel did see his glory,
dominion, might, and power.
So the sea that fled amazed,
saw it, and admired;
Iordans flood that stood still and gazed,
turning back retired.
Mountains skipped like to rams,
and did quake for fear;
Little hills like trembling lambs,
silly ones they appear.
O thou sea, what did thou aile,
that thou fled'st amazed?
Iordans flood, that thou did quail,
turned'st back and gazed?
Mountains that you skipt like rams,
and did trembling shake?
Little hills that like to lambs,
you did fear and quake?
The earth did tremble before the face
of the Lord so victorious,
Of thy mighty and puissant grace,
Jacobs God most glorious.
Sea and land, little hills and mountains,
the Lord God do fear:
From the flint that makes the fountains,
rocks to gush, rivers clear.
PSALM 117.
ALl Nations with mirth
praise ye the Lord always,
And all the kinreds of the earth,
set forth his noble praise:
For great is his grace,
his loving kindness ay,
Toward them that seek his face,
and will no time decay.
The truth of the Lord
endures for evermore;
Ye Nations all, with one accord,
praise ye the Lord therefore.
All praise and honor be
to Father glorious most:
(God three in one, and one in three)
with Son and Holy Ghost.
As since the worlds prime,
has e're bin heretofore,
And is now at this present time,
and shall be evermore.
PSALM 121.
I Lift mine eyes
Up to the mountains and the skies,
Fixing eye on sacred Sion,
Where my hope and help relies:
My help alone,
Comes from the Lord his glorious throne.
Heaven that made, and earth that laid,
His footstool that we stand upon.
It is he that helps thee,
Suffering not thy foot to slide:
He that keeps thee, not sleeps,
No, not slumbreth any tide;
For behold who Israel keeps,
Never slumbers once nor sleeps:
O he that keeps Israel,
Never slumber him befell.
The Lord is he,
That evermore preserves thee;
He does stand at thy right hand,
His shadow thy defense to be:
The Lord always shall keep thee,
That the Sun by day,
Or Moon by night shall thee not smite,
Or harm with light or piercing ray:
It is he defends thee,
The Lord thy keeper and thy guide,
That does still from all ill,
Save thy soul as at this tide:
He thy going out did bless,
And thy coming in no less,
And who preserved thee heretofore,
Henceforth will and evermore.
PSALM 122.
I Did in heart rejoice, to hear the people say,
So lovingly with one accord,
Into the house of God the Lord,
We will go up and pray;
Right joyful was the voice, and gracious speech of them:
Our feet shall stand within thy gates,
O City thou of glorious state,
The fair Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is builded so neat,
Like to a City at unity; a seat
Whereunto the Tribes resort,
Even the Tribes of the Lord,
To testify with one accord,
His name unto Israel:
And so for to set forth the praise
Of his holy Name always;
And for this respect,
There were the thrones erect
Of judgment, to direct
And govern thy people well.
There were the thrones erect
Of David's house for ay;
Now therefore for the peace
Of Ierusalem's increase,
Let us for ever pray.
Let them all, that do respect
And love thee, prosper still.
Joy he within thy walls, and peace
And plenty in thy palaces,
And on thy holy hill.
For my faithful brethrens sake,
And companions, I will make
Prayers to God on hye,
For thee wishing thy
Plenty and prosperity,
For ever to endure.
And because of the house we see
Of the Lord our God in thee,
I will evermore,
Seek thy welfare and store;
And to do thee good therefore,
In what I may procure.
PSALM 123.
Up to thee I lift mine eyes,
thou that dwell in the skies,
As the eyes of servants bend,
on their masters hand to tend;
Or a maiden meek applies,
to her mistress hand her eyes:
So O Lord our God do strait,
all our eyes upon thee wait,
Till that thou look down upon us,
and O Lord have mercy on us.
Lord have mercy on us then,
and forgive us sinful men;
Save our souls, that for thy sake,
much contempt upon us take,
Suffering fore rebuke and shame,
and even filled with the same,
Whiles the rich and worldly wise,
with the proud do us despise.
Though their mocking stocks they make us,
save yet O Lord, and take us:
Up to thee I lift mine eyes,
thou that dwell in the skies.
PSALM 124.
IF the Lord him self had not been on our side,
may Israel now say, but he is our guide:
If the Lord had not been on our side, when men
rose so furious against us, they had swallowed us then.
They had swallowed us up quick in wrathful displeasure,
their anger was kindled so hot above measure.
The waters had drowned us then without control,
the deep stream had gone even over our soul.
The fierce swelling waters of envy and pride,
had gone over soul with such a strong tide:
But praised be the Lord, that has not given us over
for a prey to their teeth, that our souls would have tore.
Our soul is escaped like a bird with good speed,
from the snare of the Fouler, that broken, we freed.
Our helpe's in the Name of the Lord always,
that has made heaven and earth, to his Name be the praise.
PSALM 126.
WHen as the gracious and merciful Lord,
Meant the delivery of his captived Sion.
And had again in his mercy restored
Their heavy losses, his promise that rely on,
Then, O then, got from extreme
Slavery and vileness,
We were like to them that dream,
Freed from all servilenesse;
And with glee, how did we
Triumph over sad annoy,
Being our mouth filled now with
Laughter, and our tongue with joy?
So were the Heathen and Nations soon
Forced to say, and confess before our faces,
What mighty things for them all he had done,
Praising his heavenly goodness and his graces.
Then, O then, how much more we
Bound to magnify him,
Having much more cause to be
Glad, and glorify him?
For no less, we confess,
And recount with merry noise,
How great things,
To pass he brings
For us, whereat we do rejoice.
PSALM 130.
OVt of the deeps in great distress,
where doubts and dangers me oppress,
I call to thee, Lord hear my voice,
consider well my great annoyes:
And let thine ear receive my moanes,
my sighs, my tears, my plaints, and groans.
If thou should be extreme, O Lord,
to mark in thought, in deed, and word,
What Is done amiss, O who shall stand
under thy strict all-searching hand?
Or when in truth thine eyes have tried it,
and judgment, Lord, who may abide it?
But there is mercy Lord with thee,
mercy, that feared thou may be;
And we will love and fear the same,
and wait upon thy holy Name.
I looked Lord, and patiently,
my soul waits on the Lord most hye:
My trust is in his holy word,
my soul it flies unto the Lord.
Before the morning-watch betime,
early before the morning prime,
The dawning morning-watch I say,
my soul flies to the Lord to pray.
O Israel trust in the Lord,
for with him there is mercy stored,
And plenteous redemption, he
from all his sins will Israel free:
From sting of death, and fear of hell,
and pains, redeem his Israel.
PSALM 137.
AS we in Babylon,
Sat by Euphrates flowery side,
With sad laments and moan,
We sold to mind fair Sions pride,
with Harp and Lute,
our Viols mute,
and instruments we hung
on willow tree'n,
that planted been,
the rivers there among.
Then said they that along,
Us captives brought in scoffing sort,
Let Us hear your Hebrew songs,
And melody, to make us sport:
Alas, said we,
how can that be,
in strangers land unknown?
so far removed
from Sion loved,
as loathed Babylon.
Let my right hand forget
The warbling harpes harmonious strains,
Or to my pallat let
My parched tongue cleave for my pains,
If e're I do
thy love forgo;
or minding this base earth,
so far should err,
not to prefer
fair Salem in my mirth,
Remember Edoms sons,
O Lord, on Sion's fatal day,
How they then all at once,
With cursed noise did cry, and say,
Now Sion falls,
down go her walls,
why do we stand at gaze?
her turrets round,
throw down to ground,
her stately bulwarks raze.
O daughter Babylon,
Wasted with misery in fine,
Time shall be, when shall none
Pity thee, that not pitied'st mine:
Blessed then we shall
the Avenger call,
that scorning mothers moanes,
shall dash the brains
of infants slain,
against the ^uthlesse stones.
PSALM 150.
PRaise ye the Lord ye Saints,
Within his Sanctuary,
Praise him in firmament
Of power, that does not vary;
In Temple fair
Of holiness,
And righteousness,
His praise declare.
Praise him according to
His greatness excellence,
And noble acts that show
His rare magnificence:
Praise him with Flute,
And merry noise,
Of Trumpets voice,
And Harp and Lute.
Praise him with Cimbals sound,
Dances, and Madrigals,
With Musiques sweetest ground,
Organs and Virginals:
With Cimbals shrill,
Let Viols sweet,
And Psalt'ry meet,
To praise him still.
His laud, let ay most rise,
Well tuned Cimbals sound,
With Timbrels, Strings, and Pipe;
His praises most renowned,
Let every thing,
Does life afford
And breath, the Lord
His praises sing.
FINIS.

or Latin Psalms, to these tunes, or the tunes of the Church, to his Lute, or
other Music, there are many, or most of the Psalms so fitted, and for a
taste of them, these in Greek and Latin here presented: the Hebrew to it, and

BEcatus vir, non ambulans

Non via stans, nec discubans
in sede derisorum;
Sed Lege Dei meditarus
interdiu, noctuque
Est ejus Lege jocundatus,
quasi victu, vestituque
Et erit arbor, ceu plantata,

Fructus quae feret, Deo grata,

Non comae, folia defloruerint
sed aget cuncta prospere;
Non impii sic; ceu gluma fuerint,
quam rapiet ventus propere;
Non in Iudicio, nec Sanctorum

Quia viam novit Iah justorum,

BEatus, O beatus ter,

Spectabilis and foelix es,
mors te nec tanget luctus,

Mea dextra pereat

These Psalms following were left out, being doubly translated, and some others.
PSALM 6.
O Lord do not rebuke me in
Thy wrathful indignation,
Chastize me not in due to sin,
Displeasures aggravation:
Have mercy on me Lord, for I
Am weak, and plunged in misery;
Lord help me, for my bones are vexed,
My soul is also troubled sore:
But Lord, how long will thou explore
My faults, and punish me perplexed?
Lord turn to thy wonted grace,
Save and deliver me;
My soul flies, pity her poor case,
For mercies sake to thee:
For why, in death no man we find
Remembers thee, or who shall mind
To give thee praises in the pit?
But weary of my groans and fears,
Each night wash I my bed with tears,
My couch with tears I water it.
For very grief and foes withal,
My beauties flower does fade,
Thence worn away, hence from me all
In vanity is whose trade;
The Lord the voice of my sad tears,
The voice of my petition, hears
My prayers, he will receive the same,
Confounded shall be all my foes,
Sore vexed and turned back, and those
That wrong me put to sudden shame.
PSALM 23.
MY Shepherd is the everliving Lord God
So loving that therefore that I nothing can need.
In pastures fair to make my abode,
He leads me pleasantly forth for to feed:
Fair fields, sweet flowers, beauty excelling,
Every where seem to bespangle the way;
Cool floud^, shady bowers, pleasure there dwelling,
Still to encircle my steps where I stray,
That from the mountains, as down to the fountains,
He led me along by most pleantifull fields,
To the rivers the water's of comfort that yields.
So gone out of sadness, my soul into gladness,
He brought to that happy and heavenly shore,
Where never should sorrow encompasse me most.
Yea, though in vale of the shadow of death
I walked, yet he in his mercy did guide
And keep my feet, that as long as I breath,
From the way they should never of godliness slide,
Nights Black terror, fore did affright me,
Yet on thy rod and thy staff did I stay;

PSALM 108.
MY heart and my tongue is prepared in song,
O my God, my glory always:
Awake Lute and Harp, I my self will awake
right early, to sing and give praise.
I will praise thee O Lord, and thy mercies record,
I will sing unto thee among Nations,
And raise up always thy great glory and praise
among people and generations:
For thy mercy is great above heavens seat,
and thy truth unto the clouds reaching,
Exalt thy self hye, O God above sky
and thy glory over all the earth streaching,
Thy beloved that we, delivered may see,
send help from thy holy place;
O stand with us, and aid us with thy right hand,
and hear us of thy good grace:
Out of his holy hill God has spoken, I will
rejoice, and Sichem divide,
I will mete out the vale of Succoth withal,
and Gilead he is on my side,
Manasses with me, and Ephraim he,
is the strength of my head and stay,
And never to leave her, shall Judah persever,
Lawgiver for ever and ay;
Men Moab shall see, my washpot to be,
over Edom my shoe will I throw,
Triumphing in fine, over Palestine,
I to the strong City will go:
Who will lead me along, into the same strong
City, of the Philistines their seat?
Who is he that will be a conductor to me
to bring me to Edom the great?
O God, why have thou forsaken us now?
why will thou not help us O God?
Or why no more, as thou used'st of yore,
went thou forth with our armies abroad?
Against troubles relieve us, and saving health give us,
vain else is the help of man known;
So shall we through thee do right valiantly,
being thou tread'st our enemies down.
PSALM 130.
OVt of the lowest deepes depressed,
Doubts and dangers great distressed,
On thy mercy most relying,
Unto thee, O Lord, with crying,
Sore with misery enthralled,
And with sighs and tears I called,
O hear, hear, O hear, bow down
Thine ear, attend and hear
My sighs, my cries, my prayer.
If thou straightly O most Highest,
What is done amiss descryest,
Who O Lord can stand before thee?
But for mercy we adore thee:
Mercy is with thee declared,
Mercy that thou may be feared,
O hear, hear, O hear, bow down
Thine ear, attend and hear
My voice, my noise, my prayer.
I have waited Lord upon thee,
Yea my soul has waited on thee;
I have trusted in thy word,
And my soul waits on the Lord,
Early ere the watch returning,
Morning watch, the dawning morning,
O hear, hear, O hear, bow down
Thine ear, attend and hear
My moanes, my groans, my prayer,
Israel wait on the Lord,
For with him is mercy stored,
And with his best excellences,
Great redemption from offenses;
All his sins that Israel saves,
And shall ever who so craveth:
O hear, hear, O hear, 'twixt hopes
And fears, with sobs and tears,
My sighs, my cries, my prayer.
PSALM 150.
O Praise the Lord in holiness,
You Saints of his his praise profess,
Within his Temple fair and trim,
And firmament of power, praise him
Praise him in all his noble acts,
His mightiness and famous facts,
according to his excellence
Of greatness, and magnificence,
Praise him in sound of Trumpets noise,
Praise him with Lute, and Harpes sweet voice,
Praise him with Cimbals and the like,
With Tabret, Dances, Strings, and Pipe,
Praise him in Musiques sweetest ground,
On the well tuned Cimbals sound,
Praise him with pleasant Madrigals,
Loud Cimbals and sweet Virginals;
Let every thing does life afford,
Breath out the praises of the Lord.

POSTSCRIPT.
HOwsoever these plain tunes are thus fitted to these Psalms, for the benefit
and use of the less skillful, it shall (I hope) be no prejudice to the
excellent Musicians of this age, but that at their pleasure they may fit them
to more curious and delightful tunes and aires, whether now or anciently
devised.

Turn then O Lord our bondage again,
Like to the rivers out of the South descending,
That with their plenty do cover the plain,
And water the valleys which way soever wending;
Then, O then, we here shall find
They that low in sadness,
Leaving tears and grief behind,
Reap in joy and gladness,
Who indeed, with precious seed,
Went out weeping on the way,
Turned again, not in vain,
Bringing home his sheaves with joy.
