THE GREAT EATER, OF KENT, OR PART OF THE ADMIRABLE TEETH AND Stomachs Exploits
of Nicholas Wood, of Harrisom in the County of KENT.

HIS EXCESSIVE MANNER OF EATING WITHOUT manners, in strange and true manner
described, by John Tailor.

LONDON, Printed by ELIZABETH ALLDE, for Henry Gosson, and are to be sold on
London Bridge. 1630.

TO THE MOST FAMOVS, INFAMOVS, HIGH AND Mighty Feeder, Nicholas Wood, Great and
Grand Gurmandizer of Harrisom in the County of Kent.
MOst exorbitant Paunchmonger, I having taken much unnecessary pains in
writing these few collections of your deserving Acts, in memory thereof have
erected this Monument of incke and paper. Herostratus was famous for burning
the Temple of Diana in Ephesus: Dedalus for flying in the Air, and Leander for
swimming over the Hellespontick sea: So by this small Treatise of your virtues,
will your unmatchable exploits be preserved to posterity, that time, or
oblivion shall never eat out or devour the happy memory of your eating; Yet
(not to flatter you) though you are the absolutest man of mouth, and the most
renowned stifgut in this Western Angle of the World, yet we have as great or
greater Faters then your self, which are scarcely thought upon: there are
some, that with the unsavory sauce of Envy, will eat up a man's name and
reputation, and leave nothing but the bones and scraps of infamy and scandal;
some eat up whole Lordships without Mannours, and some devour Mannours and
leave nothing but bare Lordships: your exercise is only for the Maw, and your
Excellency consists totally in Crambo; I have done my best to please and
pleasure you. And not knowing where to find a fit Patron, I am bold to
dedicate it to your digestion, wishing that your teeth and stomach may be ever
sharpe-set, and that your meat may be wanting before your Appetite.

Yours, He that not only admire and wonders at you, but has taken these
ensuing pains, to make the world anmire with him, JOHN TAILOR.

THE GREAT EATER OF KENT.
REcords and Histories do make memorable mention of the diversity of
qualities of sundry famous persons, men and women, in all the Countries and
Regions of the world, how some are remembered for their Piety and Pity; some
for Justice; some for Severity, for Learning, Wisdom, Temperance, Constancy,
Patience, with all the virtues Divine, and moral: Some again have purchased a
memory for Greatness and Tallness of body; some for Dwarfish smalnesse; some
for beautiful outsides, fair feature and composition of Limbs and stature;
many have gotten an earthly perpetuity for cruelty and murder, as Nero,
Commodus, and others: for Leachery, as Heliogabalus: for Drunkenness,
Tiberius, (alias Biberius:) for Effeminacy, as Sardanapalus: for Gluttony,
Aulus Vitellius, who at one supper was served with two thousand sorts of
fishes, and seven thousand fowls, as Suetonius writes in his ninth Book, and
Josephus in his fifth Book of the Jews wars. Caligula was famous for
Ambition, for he would be adored as a God, though he lived like a Devil,
poisoning his Uncle and deflowring all his Sisters: And in all ages and
Countries, time has still produced particular persons, men and women, either
for their virtues or their vices, to be remembered, that by meditating on the
good, we may be imitating their goodness, and by viewing the bad, we might be
eschewing their vices.

To descend lower to more familiar examples, I have known a great man very
expert on the Iewes-harpe; a rich heir excellent at Noddy, a Justice of the
Peace skillful at Quoytes; a Merchants wife a quick Gamester at Irish
(especially when she came to beating of men) that she would seldom miss
entering. Monsieur La Ferr a Frenchman, was the first inuentor of the admirable
Game of Double-hand, Hot-cockles, and Gregory Dawson an English man, devised
the unmatchable mystery of Blind-man-buffe. Some have the agility to ride
Poast, some the facility to run Poast; some the dexterity to write Poast, and
some the ability to speak poast: For I have heard a fellow make a Hackney of
his tongue, and in a moment he has galloped a Lie from China to London,
without Bridle or Saddle. Others do speak poast, in a thick shuffling kind
of Ambling-trot, and that in such speed, that one of them shall talk more in
one quarter of an hour, then shall be understood in seven years. And as every
one has particular qualities to themselves, and dissonant from others, so are
the manners of lives (or livings) of all men and women various one from
another; as some get their living by their tongues, as Interpreters, Lawyers,
Orators, and Flatterers; some by tails, as Maquerellaes, Concubines,
Curtezanes, or in plain English, Whores; Some by their feet, as Dancers,
Lackeyes, Footmen, and Weauers, and Knights of the public or common order of
the Forke; Some by their brains, as Politicians, Monopolists, Proiectmongers,
Suit-ioggers, and Stargazers; Some (like the Salamander) live by fire, as the
whole Race of Tubalcaine, the Vulcanean Brood of Blacksmiths, fire-men,
Colliers, Gunners, Gun-founders, and all sorts of mettle-men; Some like the
Cameleon, by the Air, and such are Poets, Trumpetters, Cornets, Recorders,
Pipers, Bag-pipers; and some by smoke, as Tobacconists, Knights of the Vapor,
Gentlemen of the Whiffe, Esquires of the Pipe, Gallants in Fumo; Some live by
the Water as Herrings do, such are Brewers, Vintners, Dyers, Mariners,
Fishermen, and Scullers; And many like Moles live by the Earth, as griping
Usurers, racking Landlords, toyling Plowmen, moyling Laborers, painful
Gardners, and others.

Amongst all these before mentioned, and many more which I could recite, this
subject of my Pen is not (for his quality) inferior to any: and as near as I
can, I will stretch my wit upon the Tenters, to describe his name and
Character, his worthy Acts shall be related after in due time duly.

And, Be it known unto all men, to whom these presents shall come, that I John
Tailor, Waterman of Saint Saviors in Southwarke, in the County of Surrey, the
Writer hereof, etc. will write plain truth, bare and threed-bare, and almost
starke-naked-truth, of the descriptions, and remarkable, memorable Actions of
Nicholas Wood, of the Parish of Harrisom in the County of Kent, Yeoman, for
these considerations following.

First, I were to blame to write more then truth, because that which is known
to be true, is enough.

Secondly, that which is only true, is too much.

Thirdly, the truth will hardly be believed, being so much beyond man's reason
to conceive.

Fourthly, I shall run the hazard to be accounted a great liar, in writing
the truth.

Lastly, I will not lie, on purpose to make all those liars that esteem me so.

Yet by your leave, Master Critic, you must give me license to flourish my
Phrases, to embellish my lines, to adorn my Oratory, to embroder my speeches,
to enterlace my words, to draw out my sayings, and to bumbaste the whole suite
of the business for the time of your wearing. For though truth appears best
bare in matters of Justice, yet in this I hold it decent to attire her with
such poor rags as I have, in stead of Robes.

First then; the place of his birth, and names of his parents are to me a mere
Terra incognita, as far from my knowledge, as content from a Usurer, or
honesty from a Bawd, but if he be no Christian, the matter is not much, he
will serve well enough for a man of Kent; and if his education had been as his
Feeding, it is evident he had been of most mighty breeding; he has gotten a
foul name, but I know not if it came to him by Baptism, for it is partly a
Nickname, which in the total is Nicholas, I would abate him but a Saint, and
call him Nicholas Shambles, and were the goodness of his purse answerable to
the greatness of his appetite, out of all question, no man below the Moon
would be a better customer to a shambles then he, for though he be chaste of
his body, yet his mind is only upon flesh, he is the only Tugmutton, or
Muttonmonger betwixt Dover and Dunbarr: for he has eaten a whole Sheep of
sixteen shillings price, raw at one meal (pardon me) I think he left the
skin, the wool, the horns, and the bones: but what talk I of a Sheep, when
it is apparently known, that he has at one repast and with one dish, feasted
his Carkas with all manner of meats? All men will confess that a Hog will
eat any thing, either fish, flesh, foul, root, herb, or excrement, and this
same noble Nick Nicholas, or Nicholas Nick, has made an end of a Hog all at
once, as if it had bin but a Rabbet sucker, and presently after, for fruit to
recreate his palate, he has swallowed three peckes of Damsons, thus
(Philosophically) by way of a Chimicall Infusion, as a Hog will eat all
things that are to be eaten, so he in eating the Hog, did in a manner of
extraction distill all manner of meats through the Limbeck of his paunch.

But hold a little, I would be loath to cloy my Reader with too much meat and
fruit at once, so that after your Sheep, Hog and Damsons, I think it best
to suffer you to pawse and pick your teeth (if you have any) whilst I spend a
few words more in Paraphrasing upon his surname. Wood is his Appellation,
Denomination, or how you please to term it

Some of the ancient Philosophers have compared man to a Tree with the bottom
upwards, whose root is the Brain, the Arms Hands, Fingers, Legs, Feet and
Toes, are the Limbs, and Branches, the comparison is very significant, many
Trees do bring forth good fruit, so do some few men; Some stately Trees
grow high and fair, yet stand for nothing but shades, and some men grow high
and lofty, yet are nothing but shaddows; Some Trees are so malignant, that
nothing can prosper under the compass of their branches; and some men are so
unlucky, that very few can thrive in their service. And as of one part of a
Tree a Chair of State may be made, and of another part a carved Image, and of
a third part a stool of office; So men, being compounded and composed all of
one mould and mettle, are different and disconsonant in estates, conditions,
and qualities. Too many (like the barren Fig Tree) bear leaves of hypocrisy,
but no fruits of Integrity, who serve only for a flourish in this life, and a
flame in that hereafter.

So much for that: now to return to my Theme of Wood, (indeed this last
disgression may make my Reader think that I could not see wood for trees) what
Wood he is, I know not, but by his face he should be Maple, or Crab-tree, and
by his stomach, sure he is heart of Oak; some say he is a Meddler, but by his
stature, he seems like a low short Pine, and certain I am, that he is
Popular, a well tymberd piece, or a store house for belly timber.

Now Gentlemen, as I have walked you amongst the Trees, and through the Wood, I
pray set down, and take a taste or two more of this Banquet.

What say you to the Leaf or Flecke of a Brawne new killed, to be of weight
eight pound, and to be eaten hot out of the Bores belly raw? much good do you
Gallants, was it not a glorious dish? and presently after (in stead of suckets,
twelve raw puddings. I speak not one word of drink all this while, for indeed
he is no drunkard, he abhorres that swinish vice: Alehouses, nor Tapsters
cannot nick this Nick with froth, curtoll Cannes, tragical blacke-pots, and
double-dealing bumbasted Iugges, could never cheat him, for one Pint of Beer
or Ale is enough to wash down a Hog, or water a Sheep with him.

Two Loins of Mutton, and one Loyne of Veale were but as three Sprats to him:
Once at Sir Warrham Saint Leigers house, and at Sir William Sydleyes he showed
himself so valiant of Teeth, and Stomach, that he ate as much as would well
have served and sufficed thirty men, so that his belly was like to turn
bankerupt and break, but that the Seruing-men turned him to the fire, and
anointed his paunch with Grease and Butter, to make it stretch and hold; and
afterward being laid in bed, he slept eight hours, and fasted all the while:
which when the Knight understood, he commanded him to be laid in the stocks,
and there to endure as long time as he had lain bed rid with eating.

Pompey the Great, Alexander the Great, Tamberlane the Great, Charlemagne or
Charles the Great, Arthur the Great: all these gat the Title of Great, for
conquering Kingdoms, and killing of men; and surely eating is not a greater
sin then rapine, theft, manslaughter and murder. Therefore this noble
Eatalian does well deserve the Title of Great: wherefore I instile him Nicholas
the Great (Eater:) And as these forenamed Greats have overthrown and wasted
Countries, and Hosts of men, with the help of their Soldiers and followers;
so has our Nick the Great, (in his own person) without the help or aid of
any man, overcome, conquered, and deuouted in one week, as much as would have
sufficed a reasonable and sufficient Army in a day, for he has at one meal
made an assault upon seven dozen of good Rabbets at the Lord Wootons in Kent,
which in the total is foure-score, which number would well have sufficed a
hundred, threescore and eight hungry Soldiers, allowing to each of them half
a Rabbet.

Bell, the famous Idol of the Babylonians, was a mere imposture, a Iuggling
toye, and a cheating babble, in comparison of this Nicholaitan, Kentish
Tenterbelly, the high and mighty Duke All-paunch, was but a fiction to him.
Milo the Crotonian could hardly be his equal: and Woolner of Windsor was not
worthy to be his footman. A quarter of fat Lamb, and threescore Eggs have
been but an easy colation, and three well larded Pudding-pyes he has at one
time put to foil, eighteen yards of black Puddings ( London measure) have
suddenly been imprisoned in his sowse-tub. A Ducke raw with guts, feathers,
and all (except the bill and the long feathers of the wings) has swomme in the
whirlepole or pond of his mawe, and he told me, that threescore pound of
Cherries was but a kind of washing meat, and that there was no tacke in them,
for he had tried it at one time. But one John Dale was too hard for him at a
place called Lennam, for the said Dale had laid a wager that he would fill
Woods belly, with good wholesome victuals for 2. shillings, and a Gentleman
that laid the contrary, did wager, that as soon as noble Nick had eaten out
Dales 2. shillings, that he should presently enter combat with a worthy
Knight, called Sir Loyne of Beef, and overthrow him; in conclusion, Dale
bought 6. pots of potent, high, and mighty Ale, and twelve new penny white
loaves, which he sop'd in the said Ale, the powerful fume whereof, conquered
the conqueror, robbed him of his reason, bereft him of his wit, violently took
away his stomach, intoxicated his ^i^mater, and entered the Sconce of his
Pericranion, blind folded him with sleep; setting a nap of nine hours for
manacles upon his threed-bare eyelids, to the preservation of the roast Beef,
and the unexpected winning of the wager.

This invincible Ale, victoriously vanquished the vanquisher, and over our
Great Triumpher, was Triumphant: But there are presidents enough of as potent men
as our Nicholas, that have subdued Kings and Kingdoms, and yet they themselves
have been captived and conquered by drink; we need recite no more examples
but the Great Alexander, and Holophernes, their ambition was boundless, and so
is the stomach of my Pens subject, for all the four Elements cannot cloy him,
fish from the deepest Ocean, or purest River, fairest Pond, foulest Ditch, or
dirtiest puddle. he has a receite for Foul of all sorts, from the Wren to the
Eagle, from the Titmouse to the Estrich, or Cassawaraway, his paunch is either
a Coope or a Roost for them: He has (within himself) a stall for the Ox, a
room for the Cow, a stye for the Hog, a Park for the Dear, a warren for
Coneies, a storehouse for fruit, a dayery for Milk, Cream, Curds, Whay,
Butter-milke, and Cheese: his mouth is a Mill of perpetual motion, for let the
wind or the water rise or fall, yet his teeth will ever be grinding; his guts
are the Rendez-vous or meeting place or Burse for the Beasts of the fields, the
Fowls of the Air, and Fishes of the Sea; and though they be never so wild or
disagreeing in Nature, one to another, yet he binds or grindes them to the
peace, in such manner, that they never fall at odds again. His eating of a
Sheep, a Hog, and a Duck raw, does show that he is free from the sin of
niceness or his curiosity in Diet. (It had been happy for the poor, if their
stomachs had been of that constitution, when seacoales were so dear here.)
Besides, he never troubles a Larder, or Cupboord to lay cold meat in, nor does
he keep any Cats or Traps in his house to destroy vermin, he takes so good a
course, that he lays or shuts up all safe within himself; in brief, give him
meat, and he never stands upon the cookery, he cares not for the Peacocke of
Samos, the Woodcock of Phrygia, the Cranes of Malta, the Pheasants of England,
the Caperkelly, the Heathcocke, and Termagant of Scotland, the Goat of Wales,
the Salmon, and Vsquabah of Ireland, the Sawsedge of Bolognia, the Skink of
Westphalia, the Spanish Potato, he holds as a babble, and the Italian Fig he
esteems as poison.

He is an English man, and English diet will serve his turn. If the Norfolk
Dumplin, and the Devonshire White-pot, be at variance, he will atone them, the
Bag-puadings of Gloucester shire, the Blacke-puddings of Worcester shire, the
Pan puddings of Shropshire, the White puddings of Somersetshire, the
Hasty-puddings of Hamshire, and the Pudding-pyes of any shire, all is one to
him, nothing comes amiss, a contented mind is worth all, and let any thing
come in the shape of fodder, or eating stuff, it is welcome, whether it be
Sawsedge, or Custard, or Eg-pye, or Cheese-cake, or Plawne, or Fool, or
Froyze, or Tanzy, or Pancake, or Fritter, or Flap-iacke, or Posset,
Galley-mawfrey, Mackeroone, Kickshaw, or Tantablin, he is no puling Meacocke,
nor in all his life time the queafinesse of his stomach needed any saucy
spur or switch of sour Vertuice, or acute Vinegar, his appetite is no
straggler, nor is it ever to seek, for he keeps it close prisoner, and like a
courteous kind Iaylour, he is very tender over it, not suffering it to want any
thing if he can by any means procure it: indeed it was never known to be so
far out of reparations, that it needed the assistance of Cawdle, Alebery,
Iulep, Cullisse, Grewell, or stewd-broth, only a mess of plain frugall
Country Pottage was always sufficient for him, though it were but a
washing-bowle full, of the quantity of two pecks, which porrenger of his, I my
self saw at the sign of the white Lion at a Village called Harrisom in Kent,
the Hostess of which house did affirm, that he did at once wash down that
Bowl full of pottage, with nine penny loaves of bread, and three Iugges of
Beer.

Indeed, in my presence (after he had broken his fast) having (as he said)
eaten one pottle of milk, one pottle of pottage, with bread, butter, and
cheese: I then sent for him, to the aforesaid Inn, and after some accomodated
salutations, I asked him if he could eat any thing? He gave me thanks, and
said, that if he had known, that any Gentleman would have invited him, that he
would have spared his breakefast at home, (and with that he told me as
aforesaid, what he had eaten) yet nevertheless (to do me a courtesy) he
would show me some small cast of his office, for he had one hole or corner in
the profundity of his storehouse, into which he would stow and bestow any
thing that the house would afford, at his peril and my cost. Whereupon I
summoned my Hostess with three knocks upon the Table, two stamps on the
floor, with my fist and foot, at which she made her personal appearance with
a low Curtsie, and an inquisitiue What lack ye? I presently laid the authority
of a bold Guest upon her, commanding that all the victuals in the house should
be laid on the Table. She said, she was but slenderly provided, by reason
goodman Wood was there, but what she had, or could do, we should presently
have: so the cloth was displaid, the salt was advanced, six penny wheaten
loaves were mounted two stories high like a Rampire, three sixe-penny Veale
pyes, walled stiffly about, and well victual'd within, were presented to the
hazard of the Scalado, one pound of sweet butter (being all fat and no bones)
was in a cold sweat at this mighty preparation, one good dish of Thorneback,
white as Alabaster or the Snow upon the Scithian mountains, and in the Rear
came up an inch thick shyuer of a Peck household loaf; all which provision
were presently, in the space of an hour utterly confounded, and brought to
nothing, by the mere and only valourous dexterity of our unmatchable grand
Gurmound. He courageously past the Pikes, and I cleared the shot, but the house
yielded no more, so that my Guest arose unsatisfied, and my self discontented
in being thrifty and saving my money against my will.

I did there offer him twenty shillings to bring him up to me to my house on
the Bank-side, and there I would have given him as much good meat, as he would
eat in ten days, one after another, and five shillings a day every day, and
at the ten days end, twenty shillings more, to bring him down again. I did
also offer ten shillings to one Jeremy Robinson a Glouer (a man very inward
with him) to attend and keep him company, and two shillings six pence the day,
with good diet and lodging: all which were once accepted, until Wood began to
ruminate and examine what service he was to do, for these large allowances.
Now my plot was to have him to the Beare-garden, and there before a house full
of people, he should have eaten a wheel barrow full of Tripes, and the next
day, as many puddings as should reach over the Thames (at a place which I would
measure betwixt London and Richmond) the third day, I would have allowed him a
fat Calfe, or Sheep of twenty shillings price, and the fourth day he should
have had thirty Sheep Geathers, thus from day to day, he should have had
wages and diet with variety; but he fearing that which his merits would amount
unto, brake off the match, saving, that perhaps when his Grace, (I guess who
he meant) should hear of one that ate so much, and could work so little, he
doubted there would come a command to hang him: whereupon our hopeful
Beare-garden business was shiuerd, and shatterd in pieces.

Indeed he made a doubt of his expected performance in his quality, by reason
of his being grown in years, so that if his stomach should fail him
publicly, and lay his reputation in the mire, it might have been a
disparagement to him for ever, and especially in Kent, where he has long been
famous, he would be loath to be defamed; But as weak as he was, he said, that
he could make a shift to destroy a fat Weather of a pound in two hours,
provided that it were tenderly boild, for he has lost all his teeth (except
one) in eating a quarter of Mutton, (bones and all) at Ashford in the County
aforesaid, yet is he very quick and nimble in his feeding, and will rid more
Eating work away in two hours, then ten of the hungriest Carters in the
Parish where he dwells. He is surely noble (for his great Stomach) and
virtuous, chiefly for his patience in putting up much; moreoeuer he is thrifty
or frugall, for when he can get no better meat, he will eat Ox Livers, or a
mess of warm Ale-graines from a Brew House. He is provident and studious
where to get more provision as soon as all is spent, and yet he is bountiful
or prodigal in spending all he has at once: he is profitable in keeping
bread and meat from mould and Maggots, and saving the charge of salt, for his
appetite will not wait and attend the poudring; his courtesy is manifest, for
he had rather have one Farewell then twenty Godbwyes: Of all things, he holds
fasting to be a most superstitious branch of Popery, he is a maine enemy to
Ember weeks, he hates Lent worse then a Butcher or a Puritan, and the name of
Good Friday affrights him like a Bulbegger; a long Grace before meat, strikes
him into a Quotidian Ague; in a word, he could wish that Christmas would dwell
with us all the year, or that every day were metamorphoz'd into
Shrouetuesdayes; in brief, he is a Magazine, a storehouse, a Receptacle, a
Burse, or Exchange, a Babel or confusion for all Creatures.

He is no Gamester, neither at Dice, or Cards, yet there is not any man within
forty miles of his head, that can play with him at Maw, and though his pasture
be never so good, he is always like one of Pharaohs lean Kine; he is swarty,
blackish hair, Hawknosed (like a Parrot, or a Roman) he is wattle-Iawde, and
his eyes are sunk inward, as if he looked into the inside of his intrayles,
to note what custom'd or vncustom'd goods he took in, whilst his belly (like a
Maine-sayle in a calm) hangs ruffled and wrinkled (in folds and wreathes) flat
to the mast of his empty carcass, till the storm of abundance fills it, and
violently drives it into the full sea of satisfaction,

LIke as a River to the Ocean bounds,
Or as a Garden to all Britains grounds,
Or like a Candle to a flaming Linck,
Or as a single Ace, unto Sise Cinque:
So short am I of what Nick Wood has done,
That having ended, I have scarce begun:
For I have written but a taste in this,
To show my Readers where, and what he is.
POSTSCRIPT.
THou that putst down the Malt below the wheat,
That do not eat to live, but live to eat:
Thou that the Sea-Whale, and Land Wolf excels:
A foe to Bachus, Champion of god Bells:
I wish if any foreine foes intend
Our famous I Will of Britain to offend,
That each of them had Stomachs like to thee,
That of each other they devoured might be.
Some have drunk healths at once (to purchase fames)
As there are letters in their Mistress names,
Others there are, that drink by rub and square,
And sound round drinkers there abundance are,
These barely go with making Barley dear,
And cunningly transform themselves to Beer,
Or potent Ale, or Juice of French or Spanish,
Or Smoke, (which Time and Coin does banish:)
These are the sleights that half the world inchants,
These are the principles of woes and wants:
But thou art free from drinking by the great,
Meat is for men, and thou were made to eat.
Though Maximinus, Romes great Emperor,
Did forty pound of flesh each day devour,
Albinus The Emperor did him surpass,
Five hundred Figs by him down swallowed was,
Of Peaches he consumed one hundred more,
Of great Musckmellons also half a score,
One hundred Birds, all at one meal he cast
Into his paunch, at breaking of his fast.
Pago surpassed both these two together,
A Bore, a hundred loaves, a Pigge, a Weather,
All this the Rascal swallowed at a meal,
(If Writers in their writing, true do deal.)
But sure I am, that what of thee is writ,
Is sure (although not all the truth, or half of it:)
Thou do exceed all that our age e're saw,
Thou potent, high, and mighty men of maw.
