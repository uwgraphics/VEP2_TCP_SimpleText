The Times abuses: OR, Muld-Sacke his grievances briefly expressed, Sewing the
causes does his mind molest, But ye he merry makes, and dedicates This Son in
love to all which baseness hates.
To the ^une of, Over and under.


ATtend my Masters and give ear,
whilst here I do relate
The base injurious slanders
are thrown on me in hate,
My wrongs and great abuses
so commonly are known,
As in in a Song to right my wrong,
shall instantly be shown.
They call me fudling Muld-Sacke,
when drink I have got none,
Cannot they look to their business,
and let Muld-Sacke alone.
If I sometimes a pot or so
do drink for recreation,
My reckning paid, a way I go,
and follow my vocation,
Not any good man gri^ving
offensive for to be
By rooking or deceiving,
from that my thoughts are free,
They call me fudling Muld-Sacke,
when drink I have got none,
Cannot they think on the black Jack,
and let Muld-Sacke alone.
As I along the streets do sing,
the people slocke about me,
No harm to any one I mean,
yet feeringly they flout me,
The Bar-boyes and the Tapsters,
leave drawing of their Beer,
And running forth, in haste they cry,
see where Muld-Sacke comes here.
Thus am I feered by them,
though harm I do them none,
Cannot they look to their small kans,
and let Muld-Sacke alene.
The feering cunning Curtezan,
and rooking roaring Boy,
Which day and night do take delight
in drunkenness to joy,
They with their Pimps and Panders,
Decoyes, and cheating Knaves,
Which runs to whores and drinks and roars
and simple men deceives.
They have no grace to guide well,
and conscience they have none,
Cannot they take heed of Bride well,
and let Muld-Sacke alone.
The Glutton rich that feeds
of Biefe and Mutton store,
And hates the poor that needs
which goes from door to door,
And will not spend his money,
but for the love of drink,
And grieves to give a penny,
so well he loves his chinke.
Too many such alive is,
of whom I am sure he is one,
Cannot he remember Dives,
and let Muld-Sacke alone.
The second part. To the same tune.


TEarme-frotting Petty-soggers,
which are so fine and nice,
Will drink if they meet rightly,
a cup of Ale and Spice,
Yet must they take their Chamber,
before they do begin,
And if they can but hide it,
they think it is no sin.
When I in the streets walk open,
to the view of every one,
Cannot they look to their Clyents,
and let Muld Sack alone.
The feering fleering Coxcombe,
with hands behind his back
All day, which stands from morntil night
to cry what do you lack,
With scoffing and with taunting,
will by the sleeve me pull;
What is it you will buy he will to me cry,
yet like a brainlesse gull.
He Will cast on me a scornful look,
though harm I do him none,
Cannot he look to his Shop-booke,
and let Muld-Sacke alone.
The Tailors saucy prentices,
as I do pass along,
They at my head will cast their shreds,
though I do them no wrong,
The saying old has often been told,
it plain does verify,
Poor and proud still Tailor like,
for they most feeringly
Do call me fudling Muld-Sacke,
though drink I have got none,
Cannot they keep their fingers true,
and let Muld-Sacke alone.
Also the feering Tripe-wives,
which Puddings sell and Sowce,
Cries there goes fudling Muld-Sacke,
does wine and beer carowse,
And with disdainful speeches,
having no cause at all,
Will taunt and scoff and leer and laugh,
and basely me miscall.
And calls me fudling Muld-Sacke,
though I am no such one,
Cannot she scrape well her greaste tripes
and let Muld-Sacke alone.
The Clownish country Carter,
will like wise with a feere,
Point at me as I go along,
his head being fill^d with beer,
Yet for his feeres I care not,
but laughing lets him pass,
To follow his Cart with gee, gee he,
most like a witless Ass,
For like a homebred Clownico,
good manners he knows none,
Cannot be look to his Wagon,
and let Muld-Sack alone.
The Bakers in the Suburbs,
with hearts devoid of pity,
Bread light and small they make for all,
both Country and the City,
And sometimes of in two penny loaf,
of weight wants ounces three,
As merrily I pass them by,
they cannot let me be.
They cali me fudling Muld-Sacke,
when drink I have got none,
Cannot they look to their conscience,
and let Muld-Sacke alone.
