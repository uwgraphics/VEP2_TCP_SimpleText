TWO very notable Commentaries THE ONE OF THE ORIGINAL OF THE TVRCks ks and
Empire of the house of Ottomanno, written by Andrewe Cambine, and the other of
the wars of the Turcke against George Scanderbeg, prince of Epiro, and of the
great victories obtained by the said George, as well against the Emperor of
Turkey, as other princes, and of his other rare force and virtues, worthy of
memory, translated out of Italian into English by John Shute.

To the right honorable and HIS SINGVLER GOOD LORD AND MASTER sir Edward
Fynes lord Clynton and Say, Knight of the order and high Admiral of England
and Ireland, John Shute wishes long life with increaceof godly honor.
FOR AS MVCHE (RIGHT HONORAble) as the office of man standethe chyefely in two
points, the one, to serve God as he him self has appointed, the other,
truly to serve his country and to wish well to the same in all that he may, I
thought it good to turn into our English tongue: these two Books following,
thereby to proffyte such, as are not of servile spirit, and when I had endyd
the same, I beth ought me of some worthy patron: to whom I moughte dedicate
the effect of my small travail in that behalf, and discoursynge in my self
of diverse men, I thought your honor a very meet man to accept my simple
present, not, for that I am your man, and you my very good lord, and Master
but, in respect of those rare virtues which in your honor I know to rest.
Wherefore, my humble request is, that your lordshyppe will take this my poor
travail in good part, which being granted may be an occasyon to stir me
up to take in hand here after, some greatter matter. The one of these Books is
written in the Italian by Master Andre Cambine: a Citizen of Florence, which
declares from whence the Turckes came: when they first came into the less
Asia, of what condition they were, the wars that they made and upon what
nations they made them, the victories that they obtained: and how they used
them, and the whole means whereby they attained to that mighty seat in the
which they now sytte and command, to the great dishonor of the Christian
princes. The other is a Commentary wryte^ also in the Italian, by whom, I
know not, for that the name of the auctor is suppressed but whatsoever he be
that did it, he has deserved to be well thought of for his travail, for it
is well worth the redding. It intreatethe of the wars between Amorathe the
second, Mahomethe the second his son, Emperors of Turckye, and the most
worthy prince George Castrioth: otherwvse named Scanderbeg prince of Albania,
in the which Book is evidently seen, to how great purpose and effect it is to
have a Captain of perfect judgment, and a ^ouldiour of tryid disciplyne. And
for so much as I have here occasion to speak of such knowledge as makes a
soldier and I term discipline I think it not encouuenient some thing to
say thereof, not at large (for that it will sufficiently fill a great volume)
but briefly as I may of so weighty matter. Of discipline and wherein it
concisteth
This disciplyne conteyneth in it, the whole force of the wars, the root
thereof is the perfect judgment of the Captain the branches are these, the
good choice of the new soldiers, obedience of the soldier, the contynuall
exercise of the soldier, order, wherein the soldier must be instructed,
furniture wherewith the soldier must both defend and offend, and then the
severity of the Captain in saying this discipline truly observed and kept A.
worthy general is of that perfection that he ca^ use any of these in his
kind, and I desire of god that this disciplyne may be better known in our
country then it is, so shall we not have so many as we have: that shall say,
give me the vntrayned soldier and take the trained that list, The trained
soldier is to be prefarred to the unskillful.
of whose opinion I for my part nether am ne wylbe, for so much as I think
I shall be able to prove both in these our days and also in the old worlds,
that the disciplined soldier has always acheuid the great enterprise, the
untrained has often ben overthrown, but seldom or never has given
overthrow. And to prove this true: these men are ready whose names do here
follow (beside the whole troop of historiens else) Liuie, Plutarcke Caesar
Appian Alexandrine Valerius Maximus Vigetius, Blondus Herodian, Paulus Iouius,
and the Co^mentarie of George Castrioth as here after more plainly shall
appear. I think these sufficient to persuade any man that is of a modest
spirit in that behalf. And for so much as this disciplyne is of so great
valewe I think it not vn^itting or unfruitfully to touch every branch
briefly in particular, and first I will begin with the election and choice of
the new soldier, Sertorius a worthy Roman who being the chief governor in
Spain after the death or Silla, The choice of the soldier and what is to be
required therein
and being a man of a noble courage and of great judgment in Martial affares
(as Appian Alexandrine witnesses of him in his first Book of the Civil
wars of the Romans) was not more honored for any of the rare virtues that
were in him t^en for his great judgment in the choice of new soldiers, his
opinion was that the youth which should be chosen to defend their country
should descend of honest parents they should be honestly brought up, they
should be modest they should also fear shame as wytnessyth Vigetius in his
first Book of the art of the wars the, 7. Chapter, Plato that noble
Philosopher is of opinion that the new soldier must be chosen of the age of
xx. years, Seruius Tullius king of the Romans would have them chosen of the
age of xvii. years, blando sayethe that others are of opinion to chose them at
xvi. years of age, Vigetius in his first Book and iiii, Chapter of the art
of the wars, is of opinion to chose them when their berde does first show,
Saluste is of opinion to chose them young, for as much as in their youth they
are apt to be taught any kind of exercise, and being acustumed in their
youth to great travail, they shall the better when they comme to greater age,
endure the travail and misery of the wars, he says also that it is better
that the soldiers want years, then exercise, moreover, Vigetius says that
whatsoever they learn in their youth does continue long in their memory
perfectely. All these worthy men are of opinion, that if he be vntrayned and
pass the age of thirty years, he is not to be accepted into a band: for
sondrie respects. This weighty charge to chose new soldiers, was not
committed to any Captain but to those that were of greatest judgment and best
seen in the disciplyne of the wars, as witnesses Vigetius in his first Book
and vii. chapter.

Now as touching the obedience of the soldier, The obedience of the
soldier.
the histories are full how great skyll is in it, for what was the cause of
the death of Pompey and defeicte or overthrow of his Populous army in
Thesaly, was it not only disobedience? look Cesare in his third Book and
Appian in his second Book of the Gyuyll wars of the Romans. Has not
disobedience ben also the death of diverse Roman Emperors and almost the
destruction of the whole Empire, look Herodian and there you shall see the
proof hereof This obedience is a band that byndeth the rest of the branches
of disciplyne so firmly together, that it makes them to work their effect
and gives virtue and power to every of them. Wherefore Andre Cambine justly
does say, that a disobedient army is less to be feared, them a worthy
Captain without an army.

THe worthy men of the old world and chiefly the Romans: The exercise of a
soldier.
brought up their soldiers in sondrie exercyses, as to run, lepe throw
the bare, swyme, to use their weapons, to march the march called Passo
militare, which was to go armed in the hotest of the summer xx. miles in five
hours, and upon great occasion: xxiiii. miles in four hours, they had a
feelde which lay upon the side of the River Tibre which once was of the
possession of Tarquinus surnamed the proud and when he was banished Rome, the
Senate appointed that feelde for the exercise of their soldiers, there were
in that feelde a number of great stakes depely set into the ground, against
whom the soldiers having their roundels made of wicker of the double weighte
of those which they should were in battle and a staff of the length of a
sword and of the double weyghte of the sword which commonly they did wear,
and being thus furnished they should daily fight against those stakes as
against their enemies. In this feelde did they use all their exercyses, whereof
I spoke before and when they were weary they went into the River and washed
them, and refreshed their weried bodies and learned to swime, as witnesses
Vigetius in his first Book and x. Chapter. To swymme well is and exercise very
commodiouse for a soldier, as for example Liver in his first Decade and
second Book declares that Oratius Cocleus a worthy Roman, Suimming Necessary
defended the end of the bridge that puts over Tiber, against the whole
power of the king Porsena whilst that they of the City brake the bridge
behind him, and then (armed as he was) he leapte into the River from the
bridge and did swymme to the land, and saved both him self and the City for
that time. Also the noble Emperor Julius Cesare being in Alexandrie and
assailed upon the sudden by the Alexandrines (and having but few of his people
with him) was enforced to flee their fury whereupon he lepte into the River and
did swyme over: to the other side, by the which means he saved his life at
that present, as witnesses Appian Alexandre in his second Book of the civil
wars of the Romans, and also Aulus Hirtius in his fourth Book of the
Commentaries of Caesar entitled de Bello Alexandrino the like does the same
Aulus Hirtius declare in the aforesaid Book, of the Ph^ritanes, which
dwelled in an Isle that stands in the River Nilo eyghte hundred pases from
Alexandrie, which being assailed by the soldiers of Cesare and put to
flyghte, took the River and did swyme to Alexandrie and saved a great number of
their lives. The exercise of the soldier and chiefly of the use of the
weapon that he shall use in the feelde is a thing of great valewe, The use of
the weapon.
which the Romans did so much esteem that they appointed a number of
Masters to instruct their soldiers in the use thereof, and every Master had
double the entertaynement that a soldier had, as witnesses Vigetius in his
first Book and xii. chapter, and in my judgment not without great reason,
for the field is not the only place to train soldiers in but they must also
be made perfect in the use of their weapon in marching in their armor,
acustumed to order and such like exercyses, before they come to the field,
otherwise they be but an encoraging to the enemy and a people led to the
slaughter, wherefore the Romans had their new soldiers as perfect in
altheyr exercyses as were their old soldiers (before they would send them to
the field) saving in that that they had not seen the enemy nor felt of his
force.

An other branch thereof is of importance, The necessity of Armor.
which is furniture with out the which no army is perfect, for if a man be
never so valiante and well trained if he want furniture he will not put him
self in that peril that he will do being well armed and furnished. As long
as the Romans went well armed and furnished to the field their Empire did
always florishe as witnesses Vigetius in his first Book and xx. chapter, but
when they became slothful and neglected discipline, they then obtained of
their Emperors within short space license to go to the field first without
their body Armor, and then without their sheldes and hedpeces, and when they
had obtained at their Emperors hands these noble demaundes, within shor^e
space after they paid well for their case, the Goths and Vandales, and also
the Lombardes made wars upon them and gave them sondrie overthrows. Then was
the difference seen betwyne the army brought up in disciplyne and that
wherein disciplyne was not known, betwine the exercised soldier and the
unexercised, betwine the instructed soldier and the ignorant, betwine the
armed soldier and the unarmed, and betwyne the Captain of judgment and the
unskillful Captain, for where as in time before the Romans (dwelling under
discipline) were not only able to defend their own most ample dominions: but
also that of their fryndes which lay fardest from them: now, when they had
rejected discipline (having wars with these nationes before named) they were
not only unable to defend their own dominions: but also to defend their City
Rome which was twyse or thriese sacked by the aforesaid enemies, as witnesses
Carian in his history.

There is also order, Order, of great importance.
which is of great value, and without it an army is but a confused multitude,
nether any battle is worthily fought no town perfectly besegyd, nor any
thing well done. This the ancient Romans had in such estimation, that
whosoever did violate it, was pu^nished without remission, as for example
Valerius Maximus in his second Book declares: that Posthumous Tibutius being
dictator, and having with him in the wars his only son the only succession
that he had, who^ he had very tenderly and carefully brought up, yet forasmuch
as he being in the wars did (of him self and not by his commandment) take
those bands which the Roma^es called aides, or helppes, and encou^tred the
enemies and gave them a great overthrow, and the^ returned to the camp with
the victory, as soon as he came to his father, he commanded to strike of his
head, Examples of strange punnishements for breche of order.
so careful was he to se order observed that he preferred it before the life
of his son, the contynuance of his house and all that ever he possessyd in
the world. The like did Posthumous Torquatus (being Consul) to his son in
the wars of Italy, who gave battle to the enemies without commandment
from his father, defeicted them, and slew a great number of them, and alson
took from them a marvelous rich spoil and returned with the victory, yet at
his return his father commanded the officers to take him, and so was he
executed. Also Papirus the dictator did marueloussy embrace order. And when he
made wars against the Sa^nites, he had with him general of the horsemen Q.
Fabius Rutilianus, who seeing his enemy in battle charged him, ouerthrewe the
Samnites, and returned with the victory, yet notwithstanding, Papirus
respected not the victory, his virtue, his force, nor yet his house, but
commanded him to be spoiled of his garments and to be beaten naked with
rods, a maruelouse strange ^yghte, to se Q. Rutilianus, general of the
horsemen, a man of great worthynes victorious, to be beaten naked and to have
his flesh torn by the hands of the Iusticiers and also his blood shed, and
although the soldiers desired Fabius to flee to Rome, where in vain he made
request to the Senate for pardon, Papirous perseuered in punnishinge him and
would in no wise for give it, the father of Fabius (who had been Dictaour, and
three times Consul) was enforced to comme in humble sort to declare the matter
to the people, desiring them to crave the aid of the Tribunes in the behalf
of his son, yet notwithstanding Papirus perseuerid still in his purpose, till
at the last (being desired by the Citizens, the Tribunes and people) he swear
that he would forgive it, not for the love of Fabio, but for the love that he
bare to the office of the Tribunes, and to the people of Rome, this Order
direct the every branch of this disciplyne and makes them to work their
effect. What should I say any more of order, the histories are full of the
nedefulnes thereof.

Beside th^se there is also severity which causes the soldiers to dwell in
obedience, it chaseth all disorder from them, it has been executed in all ages,
Severity in punishment very expedient.
Caesar that worthy Emperor whose natural inclination to pardone offenses was
such, that I do prefer his co^tezie before them all that I have read of,
yet you shall see in his commentaries that he upon occasyon has taken the
tenthe man of his legiones and put them to death, also Vallo a famous and
worthy Captain who has written very substancially three Books of the art of
the wars exhorts all men of charge, to be severe when occasion does
require, for one or two sometime punished do save great numbers from
destruction. Wherefore Vallo in his first Book, and third chapter, wills that
he that disobeythe his Captain, he that does mutine, he that being appointed
to the stand watch or scoute does leave his place with out license of his
Captain, or he that departs from his enseigne in the field without leave of
his Captain shall not only lose horse, armor, weapones and all that he
possessyth in the wars, and so escape the punishment, but he shall be
condemned to death and shall pass the pikes in manner as follows. There
shall be a squadrone ordered and in the myddest of the same shall be a void space
throughoute the squadrone almost as broad as the length of two pykes, The
order of passing the pikes
then shall the offendour be brought into the midst thereof and before that
they shall abase their pykes, he upon his kneese shall demand pardone at his
Captains hand three times and at the third time the Captain shall take the
enseigne from his enseigne berer vndisp^aide, taking the head thereof in his hand
and with the but end thereof shall stryke him on the head in token that the
^nseigne through his evil behavior has been in peril, and dishonored, and
that he does condemn him there to die, that done, the Captain withdraws
him self out of the place then the soldiers abase their pykes and sley him.

Also Selim father to Solomon Emperor of Turchie, being at Iconio (after that
he had brought his army out of Persia) determyning there to winter for that
he would be at hand to undertake the enterprise in the spring next following
against the Sophie, whereupon his Gianizzaries being desirous to pass that
winter in Grecia made request (at the persuasion of some of their leaders) to
Selim that they might go into Gretia that winter, and when they saw that
they could not obtain, they rebelled against their lord, whereupon Selim
disguysed sent into Spain to make wars upon the Numantianes and to daunt
their proud spirits which were puffed up through the want of understanding
of the Roman counsulles and legates which had made wars against them and
received diverse overthrows at their hands Scipio received the same army
which they had so often defeicted, and as soon as he had possessed this army,
What kind of people are to be banished out of an army or camp.
he forthewith purged it of all unprofitable people: such as procured men to
delicacie, as those that sold all kind of Merchandise and delicate meats and
drincks, such as were rather to satisfy appetite then to preserve health and
maintain force, also he banished from his camp two thousand wh^res when he
had this done he restored to tbe army perfect discipline and then beseged the
City of Numantia, took it and brought it into ashes.

The like may be said of Metellus, who being Consul made wars in Affricke
against Iugurthe he received his army of Spurius Albinuus throghe whose
negligence and want of understanding, discipline was clearly extincte and
forgotten: and the army utterly corrupted through ease and delicatie, by
means whereof the enemy obtained against them many victories. Other enormities
r^dressed by Metellus.
And the consul determyning to purge his army and to restore it to perfect
disciplyne, removed from his camp all Tauerners and cooks, he would not
suffer that any private soldier should have any horse or seruante to carye
his armor and victual but that he himself should carry it, then he marched
with his camp and removed in manner daily and fortified his camp and
entrenched it as strongly, as if Iuguith had been present, also he saw them
daily exercised acordi^g to the order of the Roman disciplyne, and in the end
brought them to that perfection, that to that same enemy (of whom they had
received many overthrows in time before and never could give any) they gave
sondrie and great overthrows and triumphed over him as witnesses the
aforesaid Valerius. Beside these, Appian Alexandrine in his fourth Book of the
civil wars of the Romans: does right well declare the price and necessite
of the Judgment of the Captains in the persons of B^^ius and Cassius, who
fled out of Rome after that they had slain Caesar, and through their wisdom
and policy gatherid together within the space of two years: an army of xx.
legions of foreme^, and of xx M. horse men, a legion acording to the opinion of
Liuie, What a legion i^.
had in it the number of five thousand four hundred soldiers and acording to
the mind of Vigetius it was of the number of six thousand and some time of
greater number beside this they had a Navy of two hundred great ships at the
least, they were thoroughly furnished with all kind of Munition and well
provided of money, this had they brought to pass in the space of two years
having Octauius surnamed Angustus, Marcus Antonius and Marcus Lepidus to
enemies, who then governed in the triumuirate at Rome, and did contynually
persecute them with wars by all means possible as the aforesaid auctor
plainly does declare. Also they brought under their governance all the
countres even from Macedonia to the floodde Euphrates, beside these examples
the histories are full of the praises of worthy generalles, but by the way I
would not that any man should think that I do so greatly honor the
judgment of the general: that I would thereby condemn discipline in any
respect in the which I would have the soldier brought up and trained, but I
do think it as requisite that the general with his chief officers of the
army, be of judgment sufficient to direct the use of this disciplne, as it is
for the soldiers to be brought up and instructed therein, and the army that
wants either of them: to wit the disciplined soldier and the general of
judgment is not perfect, nor sufficient to take any great enterprise in hand.

There is nothing more proffytable nor mete to bring a general to this
perfection then to add to his experience the reding of histories in the which
he shall se plainly set before his eyes in what order battles have been
fought, overthrows given, victory used, countres defended and conquestes
made, wherefore if the general with his chief officers want this perfection
they are not greatly to be feared although their armi be of trained
soldiers. Furthermore their is nothing more to be embraced by a worthy
general, then modesty, and there is nothing more peryllous in a General then
to be ambitious rash and wilful, as for example at the battle of Canua, A
general must be void of ambition and rashenes.
as plutarck declares in the second part of his lives: in the life of Fabius
Maximus and also of Aniball, how that both the Roman consulles were there
pesent the one was Paulus Emitius a man of great judgment and worthynes in
arms, the other was Caius Terentius Varro a vain and wylfull man, full of
ambition, glory, and boasting. This Terentius could not be contentid to
govern jointly with his companion and to use mutual council, but would have
the government divided and would govern every other day absolutely to avoid
conte^cion Paulus Emilius granted thereunto Emilius saw how to chase Aniball
out of Italy without hazarding of any one battle and therefore he
determined to prolong the wars, and saying Anibal in a strange country, in
great extremity through want of victualles, his army being of many nations
he was assured by these means to enforce him to abandone Italy for that time,
contraryly, Terentius (being a man of small judgment in Martial affares) did
taunte blame and openly spoke evil, Terentius wilful and without skill.
of that noble man Emilius, having no respect at all to his worthynes and
wisdom but said it was great shame to see the enemy daily in battle and the
Romans to lie idle within their camp, not weing what it was that constrained
the enemy so to do wherefore when he had brought to pass that he might
govern every other day, Anibal being newly comme with his army to Canua and
there lodged and the Romans being lodged upon both sides of the River A^sido,
now called ^ofanto not far from him as soon as his day came, in the morning
by the rising of the sun he caused to set up on the heighte of his tente a
token to signify that he would give battle which the Italianes call Vest
militare, this did he directly against the will of his companion, when Aniball
saw this he was excedyng glade for it made well for his purpose: for he was in
great extremetie through want of victual, Terentius had double the number of
soldiers that Aniball had. His soldiers were well trained and brought up
in discipline whom he put in order and gave battle, the horse of Emitius was
slain under him and he fought on foot like a noble man when Terentius saw
his people like to be overthrown he fled Emitius like a noble man fought
contynually, Emilius most valiante, and coragious.
till at the last, seeing the Romans all slain and fled, he sat him down
upon a stone, being full of wounds and embrued with blood that no man did
know him till at the last Cornelius Lentulus a noble young man came by him
and knew him, he lighted immediately from his horse and desired him to lepe on
and to save him self for the love of his Citizens who had great need of so
worthy a Captain as he was, His answer to Lentulus before his death.
but he answered not so O Lentulus, but commanded him to lepe to horse and
said declare unto Fabius Maximus and also be thou witness how that Paulus
Emilius has observed his council even to the last of his life and has not
broken one jot of the promise that he made unto him, and that he was not
ouercomme only by Aniball, but also by Terentius, and with such commendations
he licensed Lentulus, and then he fell down among the ded bodies and gave up
the spirit. Here was seen to the great hindrance of the Roman City the
difference, betwyne the modesty of Emilius and the arogancie of Terenrius,
Liuie says that in this battle there were slain xl. M footmen and two
thousand seven hundred horsemen, pollibie declares of a great number but
truth it is that the Romans nether in the first nor second wars of the
Carthagvnenses received a greatter overthrow then this, for so much as
Emilius the Cousul a man of great worthiness and virtue redi in all doutes
toward his country with Seruilius which was Consul the year before, and a
number of worthy Citizens eles, who had been Consulles, pretors Tribunes,
Ediles and inche like, were there slain.

The like happened in Puglia and other time: Fabius Maximus being then
dictator, Anibal determined to winter with his army in a City named Glereon, a
City of great welthe Fabius encamped as near him as he might conveniently,
and being called to Rome (for sondrie great affares of the common welthe) left
his army under the conducte of Marcus Minutius with express commandment
nether to assail the enemy ne yet to give battle in any wise. It happened
after the departure of the dictator a squadrone of the enemies to go forth
into the country for corn, Minutius hearing of it brake the commau^deme^t of
the dictator and marched forth with certain ba^des and encountered the enemy
and chased them home to their very lodginges and flewe a great number of them,
the brute of this came fleeing to Rome, and forthewith it was holde^ for a
great victory, and immediately the people wold^ needs that the government
should be equally divided between Fabius and Minurius: a thing or that time
never seen, Fabius endured al these things patiently and returned to his
camp, they were then two dictators, Minutius through this little spark of
good hap, did clean forget him self and took upon him without the advice of
Fabius to give battle which Anibal (being often victorious) durst scarcely
do Minutius being an arrogante, Note the arrogancy and wilfulnes of Minutius.
ambitious and proud man, and not of great judgment in the discipline of the
wars caused Fabius to stand in great doubt, lest that he being thus
excidingly puffed up in pride should take in hand some matter that might
greatly hurt the common wealth wherefore he came to Minutius and divided with
him the army, thinc king it better for him to govern only some part of the
army then co^fusedly with his insolent companion to govern the whole. Whereupon
he took to him the first and fourth part of the Roman soldiers and gave to
Minutius the second and third part the like did he by the soldiers that they
call aids, when Minutius saw him self dictator equal with Fabius and that he
had an army at his commandment, he was in great triumph, Fabius badde him
to take heed and to confider that now it was not with Fabius that he must have
to do, but with Aniball, and upon this Fabius caused his drommes and trompetts
to sound and marched out of the camp and went to a ground that he lyked and
there encamped with his people.

Anibal understanding of this, approached near to them both and encamped in a
ground of strength and had between him and his enemies ground very apt to
ambushe his people in, and when he saw Minutius divided from Fabius he thought
it good to present the battle to Minutius and in the night ordained and
placed his ambushes and appointed them a sign at the which they should salie.
When the day came he sent certain bands to take a hill not far from Minutius
to provoke him to battle, Minutius forthwith: sent forth his light armed
men and attached the scaramoche and seeing Anibal to supply from time to time
(with fresh bands) those soldiers that he had sent to take the h^ll he put
his whole army in order, and marched forth and joined with the enemy in
battle, the fight was cruel, the Carthaginenses retired and fought
contynually until such time as they had drawn him past their ambushes, then
Aniball gave his sign, wher^pon the ambushes discovered them selves and
assailed the Romans behind them with great rumor, noise, and slaughter, when
Minutius turned him and saw the disorder that was among his people, and his
Captains fleing he sought to save him self also by flyghte, whereupon the
Numidan horsemen followed the chase, and made great slaughter of the disorderid
Romans.

When Fabius saw the Romans in this extremity, the which he suspected in the
beginning of the battle he went to a certain place from whence he might
behold the whole mattet and seeing the Romans gathered in the midst of their
enemies struck his hand upon his thyghe and with a great sighe said in the
presence of al those that were with him, O Hercule, so^ner then I would have
wished and not so sone as he him self would, Minutius has undone him self
and his, whereupon he commanded his army to march and said O soldiers
whosoever does now think upon Minutius let him make have and consider that
he is a worthy man one that loves his count^e, Fabius exortation to his
soldier.
and although it has not happned (acording to his desire) that he moughte put
the enemies to flight we shall here after have time to blame him for it. Then
he encountered the Numidianes, charged them, and put them to flight and marched
on and encountered those that were laid in ambushe in the night and assailed
the Romans behynd them in the battle, he slew them that the rest of the
Carthagtnenses seeing this, began to fle.

When Anibal saw his people fle and Fabius a far of very fiercely among the
Carthagynenses, he left of any further executing of the Romans and commanded
to sound to the standard and then returned to his lodginge and suffered the
Romans to pass to their camp without any further slaughter, and it is said
that being at his lodging and talking of Fabius he said have not I often times
told you that yonder mist that lay always upon the hill would make us one day
very foul wether. I have this day overcome Minutius and Fabius has overcome
me. When the battle was ended Fabius commanded his soldiers to take the
spoil of the ded enemies, and then returned to his camp, and notwithstanding
this great victory he never cast in the tetle of his companion his evil
government.

When Minutius came to his camp, he spoke to his soldiers in this sort. My
companions in arms, there is nothing more peryllous to a man then to fail in
gerat matters: Minutius acknowledgethe his folly.
and when he seith his own default it is the part of a wise man to obey unto
him that has given him good admonition and although that I have good occasion
to be offended with fortune, yet I must confess that I am much bound to her,
for that she has given me to understand eue^ in an instante that I not being
able to command others, should submit my self to the rule of others.
Wherefore let us go to the first dictator and render him thancks and I promise
you that I will be the first, both to thancke him and to yield him obedience,
when he had thus spoken, he commanded to take down the Egles which were the
banners of government and marched with them to the lodgings of Fabius and
being comme to the market place, he went straight to his tent and there did set
up the Egles with great noyses and when Fabius came forth of his tent he came
and called him father, and his s^uldiours saluted the soldiers of Fabius by
the name of patrones or Masters. When silence was commanded Minutius said to
Fabius thou have in one instante obtained two victories thou have ouercomme
thine enemy by force and thy companion by counsel and cortezie, wherefore I
may justly call the most worthy father, who has saved both me and my people
and then served under him as general of the horsemen as before.

Hereby it appears that where things shall take good effect* it must needs
be that the soldiers be brought up in discipline and that the general be
able to judge of discipline, as for example liuie in his third Book of his
first decade does well declare that it was not only an army of trained
soldiers: that did overthrow the people called Volsci and Equi, but that
also the consules and chief officers of the field were of great judgment,
whose good order did not a little prevail in that behalf. Beside this it was
not only an army of trained soldiers that discomfyted the Samnites not far
from the City Suessola, where they slew an exceeding great number of them and
took. 40. thousand sheldes which were of the men that were slain, and also.
170. standardz Cornetts, and Euseignes as witnesses Liuie in his vii. Book of
his first decade, but that also the Judgment of the Consul did much prevail
in that behalf, who when he saw the great number of his enemies, commanded
his soldiers to hold them within his camp, whereupon the Samnites presuming,
conte^ned the enemy., and neglicted order, and dispersed them selves all the
country over to provide them of corn and other victualles, and left their
camp unguarded in effect, which when the consul vndestode he exhorted the
soldiers to behave them valiantly and immediately went forth of his camp and
assailed the camp of his enemies, and in the first charge he slew the
greatest number of them as they were in their tents and lodgings, and then
commanded to set all their Cornetts, Enseignes and standardz, upon the
trenches of their camp which he had taken from them, and then left for the
guard of the camp two legions, with commandment that on pain of death no man
should take any thing of the spoil of the camp until his return, whereupon
he marched on with his army in order toward the enemy and sent his horsemen
before him, who charged, the negligent and unprovided enemies being dispersed
all over the field and utterly destitute of order so that they fled with great
confusion and fear, not knowing whyther it were best to fle, when this was
done the counsul returned to the camp with great victory, and then gave the
spoil of the camp of the enemies to his soldiers. In like sort was the
perfect order of L. Scipion counsul: no less helpful to his army when that
he defeicted the mitghty army of Antioche king of Asia up on the River Phrigio
near to the City Magnesia as wytnessyth Liui in his fourth decade and vii.
Book. And in like sort did the indgeme^t of Alexa^dre the great help his
soldiers i^ the battle that he fought with Darius in the which with a small
number of trained soldiers he defeicted 6. hundred thousand Persians as
witnesses Blondo in his x book de La institution de La chose public. In the
like sort was the judgment of T. Quintius Flaminius helpful to his trained
atmie when he did overthrow Philippe the Macedone prince, beside Scotusa in
Gretia, slew viii. thousands of his soldiers and took five thousand of them
prisoners as witnessyth Plutarck in his Book called the second part of his
lives, in the life of the same Flaminius.

Beside this it was not only the continual exercise and disciplyne of the
soldiers of Scanderbeg that gave unto the Turckes so many overthrows as are
declared in his Commentaries, although they were becomme through their
continual exercise as it were invincible but his great judgment in the art
of the wars was a great part of the cause thereof, for he knew when and
how to take the advantage of his enemy

Also to come to our age in the battle that Frauncys the first of that name
Frenshe king, fought at Marignian with the Suysses where great skyll and
valiantize was showed on both parts, yet was not the victory won alone
through the discipline of the soldiers but also through the judgment of
the conductours. The like may be said of the battle that the County de
Augimen fought at Serizoles with the Marquis of Guasto in the year of our
Lord. 1544 The like of the battle of Pauie betwyne the aforesaid Frenshe
king and the Duke of Burbone lieutenante of the Imperial army. Also the
like, of the battle betwyne Charles the first: and the Duke John of Saxon,
the Lansgraue of ^esse in Almaigne. What should I say any more to prove this
to be true, the histories do all affirm that the understanding of the
general does greatly help to the obtaining of the victory, and without it a
trained army is but as a man mayned in comparison of a man that has all his
li^mes sound and perfect, and of all the victories that I have here spoken of,
and also of all those that I have red of, besides those that I have seen, I
have not found one given by vntrayned soldiers. Wherefore no army may be
called perfect that wants these two kinds of men in it which is the general
of perfect judgment and the soldier brought up in discipline.

Vigetius says in his.28 chapter of his first Book of art of the wars
that the Epirotes and Macedonines people of great power, adorned with many
victories and also the Thesalique nation who brought under their yoke the
Persians even to the confynes of India, besides these Lacedemonies, Athenies
Marsians and Samnites, The Datianes, Medes and Thratianes which were so warlike
that it was said among them that Mars (whom the hethen call the god of
battle) was borne in their country, all these nations did the Romans
(through their perfect discipline) bring under their rule.

Also Vigetius says in his first Book and first chapter of the art of the
wars, The benifite of discipline.
that the great number of the Frenshe should have denoured the small number of
the Romans, had not ben their discipline only, besides that it had not ben
possible for the Romans to have resysted the populouse and mighty nations of
the Germans but only by theit discipline, moreover they should not have been
able to encou^tte the lusty and puisante nations of Spain had not ben their
discipline, yea by what means prevailed they against the wise and welthy
Affricanes, but only through discipline, by what means brought they under
yoke the mighty and subtle nation of Greeks, but only by their discipline. The
noble Emperor Frederick Barberouse being entered Italy with his army to
chastize the Millaneses for their rebellion, would in no wise offer war to
his enemies until his soldiers had fworne unto him to observe the discipline
of the wars. Paulus Iouius says that the Hungarians so long as they did
observe discipline were well able to defend their own and gave the Turcks
sondrie overthrows, Val^ius Maximus in his second Book calls discipline not
only, the foundation of the Roman Empire, but also the preservation and
maintenance of the same, for in deed it is a hard matter to overthrow a
worthy general, having an army of well chose^ soldiers, obedient, well
exercised in the feats before me^cioned and do know what the weapons are
worth that they bear being well furnished, and well instructed in order
knowing the commodity thereof so long as in battle they do observe it, for
it is an impossibility to give any great overthrow we to me^ that observe
their order in the which they are plased and do use their weapons accordingly.
Wherefore I wish al men of honest spirits to seek to understand the effect of
this discipline, for it does as much and more help to the obtaining of
victory, then does the greatness of the number as Ceser, Appian, Vigetius and
Plutarcke, chiefly do declare. Peradventure some man will say, why sir we need
not this discipline whereof you speak: we can have for our money strangers
which are good soldiers to serve us when we need. But such as are of that
opinion I wish to read the histories and Chronicles of France, The
inco^moditie that comes by the service of staungers.
for France has well felt the commodity of the service of staungers, which
nether serve for honor of their country and prince, ne yet for their wives,
children, goods and possessions, but they seek only to lead the wars at
length and to make their ptoffytt of it, beside this I think it not
inconvenient to show an example or two of the good service of strangers,
Mounser de Lautrec, being in Italy general of the Frenshe army at the sege
of Pauie, the Suissers came unto him and required him either to give them
license to repare home in to their country, or else to go and encountre the
enemies, for they would no lengar tarry in Italy, whereupon fearinge that the
Suissers should leave him, he was enforced to go and encou^tre the enemy, in
the which ^ncountre he was overthrown beside Mylan at a village called the
Pico ^ue, and all his army put to flight as witnesses paradyne in his first
Book of his history.

The like did Andre Dorie at the sege of Naples being in the pay of ^he
Frenshe king and in his service at the seege before Naples and kept their
victualles and relief from them whereupon they furnished the Na^ie of the town
and then the chief princes and rulers of the town em^arcked them selves and
went and gave battle to the said Door, Andre Dorie.
and after long fight, Dorie obtained the victory and took prisoners the
prince of Orange the Marquis of Guasto, Camile, Colona, ^cardo, and a gentle
man of Spain named Gogna, he slew two worthy Captains Feramus ^a and Gabone
and took three Galleys from the enemies after this he left ^he service of the
Frenshe king and carried with him his Galleys and the prisoners that he had
taken and went and served the Emperor and immediately set his prisoners at
liberty, and the Emperor gave him the principality of Melphe with diverse
other castls and lordshipes. The like did ^he Marquis Brandenburge, Marquis
Brande
when he departed from the service of Henry ^he Frenshe king, carried not he the
Duke Domerle with diverse others prisoners with him. Also to comme to our
wars when the town of Haddington in Scotland was holden for our king
Edward the vi. did not the Almaignes Mutyne there, Hadington.
and put them selves in arms against ^s, which (if the enemies had understood)
might have been the loss of the town. Let these few examples fuffyse for
this time, and although that I have in this little preface briefly touched the
worthynes of discipline, yet am I well assured that victory comes not only
by it, but by the gift of God, wherefore I must say with Saint Paull, 1 Cor.
3.
Paull planteth. Appollo watreth, but god gives the increase, eue^ so, the
General commands, the soldiers obey but God gives the victory,
wherefore, let all men seek to know him, and serve him as he him self has
appointed, and then shall all things go well with them.

The translatour to the reader
I Have (good reader) turned into English out of the Italien, these two Books
following, the one is a co^mentarie of Andrewe Lambine* the other a commentary
betwixt George Scanderbeg and the T^tckes and although they be not done in an
exquisite and curious style (which I leave to those that have been brought up
in scoles and are seen in oratorie) yet is the matter of importance, and to
such as delight in martial affairs, both pleasant and profitable, the
knowledge whereof is very necessary, forasmuch as no country, can promise to
it self perpetual peace and quietness. Wherefore take in good part I beseech
the this my traueill, and use it so, that thereby thou may be the better able
to serve to the maintenau^ce of Gods glory and common wealth of thy country.
I have added in the end of the books following a table which declares the
principal matters conteyued in them, what the princes were that brought them
to pass and the years wherein they were done, I have also noted the principal
matters of the books in the margente which mine author has not.

A Comentarie of Andre CAMBINO A FLORENTINE BORNE, OF THE original of the
Turques, and Empire of the house of Ottomanno. The first Book.
THE Turquish nation after the opinion of diverse writers chiefly of these
of^ate years for that they have seen them rule in those parts where the
citieof Troy once was, and having regard to their name, have affirmed that
they are descended from Teu cxi, from whence the Trojans bad their original,
the which is utterly false, for in deed that nation which at this present
dwells in the lesser Asia under the rule of the house of Ottomann^: being of
nature cruel and barbarous, took original from the Scithianes, and as the
philosopher Etico does declare, had their abidinge beyond the montaines
called Pyrithei, not far from the Is^es Tarraconite: directlye toward the
Northwest sea.

And as Otho, brother to Federyckes father of Austriche being Emperor does
declare, that at the time when P^pine raigined in France, these people
departinge from the confines of Caspie were about the year of Christ 760.
being encontred with the people Auari which in our time are Hungarians, and
fighting between them a cruel battle, and great slaughter on both sides
done. The Turques not withstanding continuing their enterprise, ouerran and
spoiled the contreis of Poutho, and Capadocia with other provinces to them
adioyinge. And in the beginning they gathered them selves together secretlye
and dwelled upon montaynes and in strong places, perilous to assail, and
maynteyned them selves and lived of p^oie and spoil, as occasion was offered
them. After that when they grew to some strength, and were provided of
captains, and discipline, they began with open wars to molest and trouble y^
people of those countries near unto them adjoining and to become lords of
their contreis, and these people not being able to stand against and to endure
their force, and cruelty, were enforced forced to give place: so that the
Turques within short space possessed not only Pontho and Capadocia, but
assailed the lesser Asia (which taking his name of the^ is at this day called
Turchia) in such sort, that in short time they became lords, and masters of
Galatia, Bithinia, Pamphi^ia, Pisidia, of the one and other Frigia, of Cilitia,
and of Caria, enlarging the co^fines of their dominion even from the sea called
Ionio, to the banckes of the sea Egeo, and then appointed to every faction and
country, his governor, and in this sort governed for a long time, having among
them another king, ne any man endued with title of souereentie, other then of
captain, according to the saying of Nicolao Sagundino a man very well seen,
both in the Greake and Latyne tongue, and also in the histories as well ancient,
as of later times, for that he had exercised him self alonge time in them, and
having joined to his redinge, experience, having trauayled through, and seen
the greatest part of the inhabited earth who wrote to the pope pio, that
about the year of ye christian health 1330. There arose among the Turques one
Ottomano, of a noble house and small welthe, wise, and of a noble mind, who
by his perswasiones and towardness, had gathered together a great number of
valiante and lusty men, desirouse of alteration, he took in hand y^ which he
knew to be generally acceptable unto the^, which was to make wars against
the christianes which confyned with his contreys, and through his lyberal
distributing of the proies and spoils that he gate from y^ christians, to his
soldiers, his power was so encresed throw the pleasantness of gain and
reputacion that his people had, that he (seeing him self cheyfe of an army
which desired to live licensiously, and was apt to accompanye him in
whatsoever enterprise he should take in hand, determined to make him self
prince of that company, and began openly with wars to persecute those y^
would not there unto agree in the which his enterprise, he was very well helped
by the discord and division that was amongst the principal and chief rulers
of that nation, and he ayding him self with the same division, did continaully
maintain and norrishe the same, and gave now aid to the one party and then
to the other, Subtillitie of Ottoma^ no the first prince of the turks.
until that they were al, so consumed and impouerished that they were not able
to resist his force, when it was employed against them. And in this sort, he
became a Tyran over his own natyon, and made him self lord of the greatest
part of their contreis nami^g him self prince of the lesser Asya. This
Ottomano at his death left to succeed him in his kingdom Orcano his son,
Oreano the second
who following his fathers footsteps did not only preserve the Empire which
his father left him. But also enlarged it greatly, when Orcano died, Amorath
his eldeste son succeeded him in his kingdom, Amorath the third.
who tra^sfering his court to Bithinia, ordained ye seat of his kingdom in
Bursia, which stands at the very foot of the roots of the Mount Olimpo. In
the time of Amorathe, two of the Emperors sons of constantinople fell at
strife about ye possessyon of the Empire, it seemed to the younger son, y^ his
brother did maruelously oppress him, and although his force was not
sufficient to resyst him, he would not yet give place unto him, but sent to
Amorathe for aid, of fering him a great sum of money inrecompence, Amorathe
agreed to his demand, and assembled his power, and with speed embarked his
people and passed into Gretya, and with great subtiltye did lead the wars
at length, and when he saw the two brethren so weak and that they had
consumed the treasure which their father left them, and by their cyuille wars
had so spoiled their country y^ they were not able to maintain them selves in
there estate with there reuene we which was then left them, Amorathe the first
turk that invaded Gretia.
he in one instante employed his force against them both, and in ye first
assault he took the city of Gallipolli, a place very commodiouse for his
state, for as much as it stands in Propontide upon the sea side not far
from the mouth of ye strait of Helesponto. And desiring ernestly in his mind
the Empire of Gretia for as much as he knew their force not able to endure
against him, whereupon he used the occasyon, and did continually spoil and
impouerishe them, in such sort as in short space he became lord of the
greatest part of Romania, Ro^a^y^ percel of Thratia.
which is the principal part of the province of Thracia, the which in ancient
time had his confynes very large, in so much that it is said that on the one
side they stretched out toward the east even to the sea called Eusino, and
Propontyde, and toward the southe to the sea Eugenio, and the floode Strimone
and the country of Macedonia, and toward the north to the river Danubio, and
on the west it confined with the Mountains of Peonia, and with panonia now
called hungaria and with the River Sauo, in the which Thratia they will that
there be comprehendid the one and other Misya, The two co^treis called
Misianowe Seruya, and Bargarya named.
at this day called Seruia, and Burgarya, the inhabytantes whereof do call all
these places lying a long the seacoaste toward the south inhabited by the
Greeks even to the very strait of Elespontho, Romania, when Amorath died, he
left behind him two sons, Saliman, and Baiazith, Saliman dyed in short
space after, then the succession was wholly in Baiazith who took in hand the
goueraunce. And when he had established his state in Asya, Bayazithe the 4
prince of the turks made the second wars in Gretia.
he sent a new power into Europa, and revived the wars began by his father,
against the Greeks, in the which fortune so favored him that in short space
he was possessid of all Romania, and left the Emperor of Gretia nothing but
Constan^nople and Pera the which was possessid then by the Genoueses, after
this he passed on and made his wars even in the very bowels of Gretia, with a
course of maruelouse victory no place resisting him, he occupied Thessalia,
Phocide, the contre of Boetia, with the greatest part of the country of Attica,
that only the city of Athenes was defendid, which being of such force, both
natural and artificial that it was inexpugnable, wherefore he entered into
Macedonia ye which in time past had his confines greatly enlarged thorough the
great force of ye places of the same, and contained in it at that time ye
contreis of Peonia and Paphlagonia, and finding it vnfornished of such as
moughte defended it he possessyd it, and passed on with his people and made a
course through Bossina, and Seruia, leadinge away with him continually great
proies both of men, and catell in most miserable calamity, and thus he went on
consuming and destroing the contreis, Baiazith besegithe. Constantinople.
and then returned into Romania, and brought his army to constantinople, and
shut in them of the city and took from them, all the country about them, in
such sort y^ they were enforced to hold the^ with in the gates of ye city, and
could non without great danger go forth of it no way by land, and tormenting
it continually, had brought it to that pass that the Citizens being out of all
hope to defended it, began alredie, to practice appointment with him. And there
is no doubt, that if god by extraordinary means, had not provided for it, the
city of constantinopole ye which in time before, many hundred years passed,
had been the head, not only of Gretia, but also, of the greatest part of the
world, had at that time fallen into hands of the most cruel and Barbarouse
natione of Turques, had not ben Tamerlano, a parthian borne who with a great
power: entered ye lesser Asia, and assailed it with such fury, that he
co^strened Baiazith to abandone Constantinople: and to pass with his army in
to Asya, for the defense thereof. And having now occasion to speak of the acts
of Tamerlano, and his people, I have thought it, Digre^^^^
not inconvenient, to make some little digressyon, and to declare from whence
this puissant captain had his original, and by what means he did attain to
the high and supreme degree of honor, in the which he then was, when Baiazith
was chief prince, and king of the Turks, this Tamerlano was borne in Parthia,
of base and simple parents, he was exerised in arms even from his childehed,
and did so profit therein, that it was hard to say which had greater place in
him, either strength and lustines of his body or else his wisdom and other
virtues of the mind, so that among the soldiers he was had in great
reputatyon and honor, in such sort that a great multitude followed him, and
cheifely those, which were most experimented in the wars and thus in short
time he became prince of a mighty army, both of horse men, and fotemen, who^
he had gained to follow him, by his virtue, good dysposytion, and lyberalytye,
by whose aid he first delivered his country of Parthya from the bondage of
the saracenes, and then became prince thereof after that with great violence,
he assailed the contreis near unto him and in few years possessyd them: and
brought to his obedience, Scithia Asyatyca, Iberia, the Albaneses, the
Persyanes, the Assyrianes, and Medes, and last of all he brought under his
yoke Mesopotamia and the greater Armenia, and then passed over the floode
Euphrates about the year of our Lord 1390. with a far greater army then was
that of Dario, or that which Xerse brought into Grecia, for it is said that
he had in his camp 400000. The atmie of Tamer lano.
horsemen, and 600000. footmen, with whom he assailed the lesser Armia, upon
whose confines Baiazith the Turk, king of Asia encountered him with a mighty
power both of horsemen and footmen, and trusting in the virtue and discipline
of his people, whose labor he had a long time used with great felicity, did not
refuse to accept the battle notwithstanding he knew him self to be far
inferior in number. Then these two mighty princes approaching the one toward
the other so near as they might discern the one the others order, The batel
between tamerlano and baiazith.
omitted no time but joined in battle, in the which, for the greatest part
of the day there were flayn great numbers on both sides, and they fought with
such assurance, nether part geuynge place to the other, that it was hard to
say where the victory should incline, till at the last the Turks being
werye, and not able to endure the force of the Parthians (who continually
supplied their squadrones with fresh bands) sought to retire them selves in
order, tightynge continually in their retreicte, but the Prince being ware
hereof, commanded certain great troops of horsemen to give charge upon them,
who charged them with such force that they disordered them, and then the
Turks began to flee, leauyng the victory to their enemies, and Baiazith
fought valiantlye a long time in person, till he had lost a great multitude of
his people: and also last of all, his horse was stayne under him and then was
taken and presented to Tamerlano, who commanded him to be encheined, and led
him with him through out al Asia for a spectacle, and it is said that whylest
he did dine and fuppe, he had him always tied under his table like a dog,
and so fed him, and when he went to horse, he caused him to be brought and to
sit him down upon his knees and elbowes. And thus used him instead of a block
to go to his horse on. And thus he held him prisoner during his life in most
miserable calamity.

All those which at any time have written of Tamerlano, Disciplyne of Tamerlano.
have greatly commended him for the discipline and order which he observed in
the conducting of his armies, for they declare that every occupation had his
streate appointed him in the camp, wherein he might use his exercise even in
like order as it had been in a famous city, and there was in it great
abundaunce of all things for the commodity of man, which proceeded of his
severity and justice, for he would not leave unpunished the jest violence
that was committed: not so much as the taking away of one handful of grass
against ye owners good will whereupon it followed that he had as great abundance
of all necessaries in his camp, as if it had been in great faires and
markettes, brought thither voluntarily from the countries about him as he
passed, his severity also was such that it held his Souldyours so within the
bands of modesty, that there was never seen nor head any kind of sedicion
among them, and they say further, which is greatly to be merueyled at, that
he never fought with man, but he had the victory over him, so that he never
tasted of Fortunes bitterness. Thus when he had spoiled and conquered all Asia
even to the floode Nilo, and had taken by force Emirua, Antiochia, Sebastia,
Tripoli, and Damasco, with a great number of other cities more, and put the
inhabitants of them to the sword carried away their spoil, and consumed them
into ashes: leaving them desert and plained to the ground.

Then entered he into Egypt, where he gave many overthrows to the Soldanes
people, and constrained them to flee beyond Pelusyo and would have followed
them hade not the scarcenes of victuales ben, for it was not possible for him
to provide carriage for to transporte sufficientie of victual: for the
norrishing of so populouse an army as his was, through the sandy and deserte
contreis, his corrage was such, that he delighted cheifely in those
enterpryses which seemed most difficile to be acheued in the opinion of others,
Damas^o.
as it came to pass in the taking of Damasco, where a number of the defendants
conveyed them selves out of the town into the castle where in there own
opinion and in the common opinion of others, they were safe, consyderyng the
natural force of the seat, and also ye artificisal^ force of the place,
notwithstanding being desyrouse to avoid the misery and travail of a sege
and to save their lives, they gave out a token, signifiynge that they were
desirous to talk with him, and upon condition to yield him the place, but he
refused utterly to hear of any appointment, although, his captains would
gladly have persuaded him there unto, Tameriano deliteth in difficile
enterprises.
but went and considered thoroughly the seat and force of the place, and seeing
the walls to be such that no ladder might attain the heyght of them, he
determn^ed in any wise to have it by force, whereupon he caused forthwith near
unto the same castle, another castle to be builded of far greater heyght
then the first, from ye height whereof he did so beat his enemies day and night
without cease, that in the end with the loss of a great number of his people,
he took it of force.

After this, having intelligence that in the city of Caphia, a garrison town
of the Genoueses, Policy of Tamer^^o.
was great store of gold and silver in the hands of the marchantes, he
having already purpofed to take that town by force, which stands in
Cheronesso Taurico, not far from the Bosphono and strait Timerico, and
considering that the treasure (although he wanne the town) might easelye be
buried under the ground and so saved, he determined to have both the town and
treasure by this mean, he called to him the skynners of his country, such as
had most rich furs, as Sables, Armines, Genettes, Martirones, and such
like, and gane them commandment, for the more spedie dispatche of ye matter,
that they should not pass, for the sellyng of them at a low price, to the
end, that through the meanness of the price, the marchantes might more
gredily by them, this matter being skilfully handlded was sone dispatched, and
immedialy after that he denounced wars against them, and forthwith, presented
him self with his army to the town, and when he had environed the town with
his camp, he planted his batteries and continued them day and night without
ceasing, in such sort, that in short space he possessed the town, the
marchantes, the furs, and the money which was an inestimable treasure. It is
written also, that this was his order in beseeging of towns, ye first day his
own lodgings were white, and if in that day, the inhabitants of the town did
yield unto him, The custum of Tamerlano in the beseeging of towns.
they receuid no hurt another in body nor goods, the second day his lodgings
were red, which signified to them of the town that if then they yielded, that
he would put to death all the masters of the families. And the third day, was
his last change, which was in to black Pauillions and tents, and then refused
he all appointments and when he had in this sort taken any City or town he
put all that were in it to the sword, not sparing any of whatsoever age or
kind they were, when he had thus done, then would he command to sack the
town, and when the goods were taken out of it, then would he cause fire to
be set in the town and so consume it to ashes and leave it deserte. And there
is a brute which continues even to this day in those parts, that on a time
a certain populouse city defended them selves, till the third day, and then
seeing a great space of the wall laid flat on the earth, and the enemy in
battle ready to give y^ assault they were discoraged, and thincking to
pacify y^ wrath of this cruel, proud, and victoriouse enemy, by humblyng
them selves, sent forth all the women and children of the town in white
clothing: with olive branches in their hands, offeringe him the town, calling
to him with loud voice for mercy, whom when Tamerlano saw a far of coming
toward him, great cruelty of Tamerlano.
he gave commandment to certain bands of his horsemen to charge upon them
and to put them all to the sword, after this, he took the city and sacqued
it, and then burned it, it happened at that time by means of traffic of
marchaundeze, certain marchante, a Genouese borne to be greatly in favor with
Tamerlano, and being with him at that same present discoursing of so^drie
matters, asked him why he used so great cruelty toward those people which he
overcame, but he turned to him with an exceeding troublouse contenance: with
eyes flaming like fire, and said unto him if thou doste think that I am aman
thou art much deceuid, for I say to the that I ^amthe wrath of God, sent to
plague, and punish the world, and I command the that if thou would not
receue due punnishement for thy auditiouse and folishe demand, that thou
get the hence, out of my sight, and that thou comme less in my presence, the
pore marcha^t being much feared with the words of the Tyran departed from him
and was never seen after that by him, they that have sen Tamerlano living,

have said that he resembled much both in face, and manners, Anibal of Carthage,
acordinge to the opinion of diurse ancient writers, and before all other
offenses he showed his severe Justice against thefts, in punnishing the^ most
sharply without any remission. And it is thought that he did it to that end,
that the fear of punnishement should cause them to refrain, to ye end that
he alone might rob and spoil acording to his own desire the whole world
and last of all, his delighte was wholly set to govern, in so much that he
employed him, self continually as in an exercise most virtuous, to molest and
trouble other princes with wars, by the which he had subdued many kings, and
utterly impouerished a great number of tyranes, made deserte many, contreis,
and converted in to ashes an infinite number of cities and towns, and then
last of al, he returned into his country with his army in credibly enriched
with the spoil of those natyons who^ he had subdued, and also he used to take
out of every town that yeldyed unto him, certain of the chief housholdes
with all their substances and riches, and to send the^ wholly in to Parthia.
When he was returned home he builded a new City very bewtifull, and of a
great circuit, and placed their in all those households before rehearsed, in so
much, ye the new City being inhabyted with these rich and noble men of
diverse nationes, in short time increased so in wealth, that yt became the
chief city of all the Orient. And if it had happened, that Tamerlano had had
with him some man of excellent learning and wisdom, who might with his
writings have celebrated the great enterprises that he did, their is no doubt
but that he might, have been numbered among the chief and princypall
captains, either of the old world orels of this present age, but god gives
not all things to one man, and also it seemed that his great crueltye which he
used toward those y^ he overcame, did not deserve to have his fame celebrated
by writing, ne yet ye it might long remain to his posterity, when Tamerlano
died, he lefteto succide him in his Empire which he had thus gotten by ye
sword, Divine justice.
two sons, which after his death fell out and mai^tained civil wars between
them, and were the cause ye the old, and ancient parthicke fame clearly
extinckte and brought to oblivion, and after ward by Tamerlano revived, could
not continewe nor increase.

But now, retorninge to our History where we left, after that the army of
Baiazith was defeicted and he taken by Tamerlano, his sons fled away before
the fury of ye victoriouse enemy, who had berafte them the whole empire of
the less Asia, and when they came into Gretia: they happened into the hands of
the Emperor of Constantinople, Calapin^ the 5. king
who preserved their lives, and held them under good guard, and after the
death of Tamer^ano, he licensid the eldest son Calapino, to pass into Asia,
wheare when he was arrived he was forth with, gratfullye receued of the people,
and in short time recoueryd the Empire which once was his fathers and after
that returned into his state and government in Gretia, and from thence went
against ye king of hungari, who went then for aid to Charles the vi. King of
France, who granted him a great number of men at armies under the conducte
and guide of John Count of Niuerse, who afterward succyded his father in the
governance and principality, of the Duchy of Borgonie, and of many other
Captains as it is some thing plainly declared alredye by us, in the French
History, and in the life of the before said Charles the syxte also that when
there were defeycted in hungarye at Mychopollye, Defeict at Michopolli.
eyghte hundred French lances, the before said John with many other noble
men of France, was taken prisoner, and for the sum of two hundred thousand
ducates were set at lybertye by the before said Calapino, the^ died this same
Calapino, and left Orca his sone, but Moises his brother succided him in his
Kingdom, moises the 6. King.
who berafte Orca not only of his kingdom but also of his life, but he long
enjoyed not that kingdom so wickedly gotten, but died in short space after,
Mahometh the 7 king.
and left his brother Mahometh to succeed in his place, who afterward made
wars upon the people of Valachia, a stout nation, dwelling near the mouth
of the river Danubio, giui^g them many ouerthroes, and consuming their country
with continual courses and spoils, compelled them to search appointment and
to give trybute, after all this he employed his force against certain noble
men of the Turkishe nation, which dwelled in Asya, and he fell to agreement with
some of them, and the greatest number of them he banished from their contreys
and dominions, and took them clean from them. This Mahometh during his reign,
handled the christians that were his subjects very cruelly, and did plague them
with sondrye tyranies, when Mahometh died, he left his Kingdom, to Amorath his
son who was then in Natolia upon the fronters: ^morathe the 8. King.
with an army by the commandment of his father: for the guard thereof who
hearing of the death of his father, came with all speed of Calcedone to pass
ye strait and so to enter into his dominions of Gretia, but the Emperor of
Constantinople: did prohibit him the passage for a long season with his navy,
and set Mustaffa the youngest son of Baiazith at liberty, and also gave him
aid to recover his fathers kingdom, but when Mustaffa, and Amorath were once
joined in battayll, Mustaffa with his power was sone defeicted, and Amorath
with his army remained there with the victory upon ye place, and easyly
possessid the dominions and kingdom of his father, after that he brought his
army into Gretia, and with continual courses did so spoil and impouerishe,
those provinces that yet rested in the hands of the christians, and lad his
army to the city Thesalonica, which was then possessyd by the Venetyanes, by
virtue of a grant made unto them by Theodoro, son to Emanuell, Emperor of
Constantinople, and took it by force and sacked it, and left it in manner
deserte, and following on, the race of his victory, entered in to Epirro which
of men of this age is called Lartha, and from thence into the contreis of the
people called Etolli, contreis in ancient time of great power and nobility,
and at this day are joined to the governance of Macedonia, Amorathe takes
Sckyauonia.
and when he had thus taken them, he annexed them to his crown. And shortly
after he entered into Illiria, which at this day is called Schiauonia, in ye
which their is contained Dalmatya, Croacya, and Istria, with the people called
Iburni, he over ran it with exceeding great spoil and destruction thereof, also
he took there certain towns, and carried away from thence an inestimable
proye of men and catel. And because among the Turks it was lawful for one man
to have many wives, Amorathe takes to wife the daughter of the dispotte of
Seruia.
Amorath although he had alredie a great number of wives yet he joined him
self in marriage with a daughter of George Dispotto of Seruia, but making small
acompte of ye band of affinity with in short space after, he entered into
Seruia as an enemy with his army, but George knowing his force not sufficient
to resist the power and fury of his son in law furnished with men and
monition, the city of Sinderonia, and left in it one of his sons for the
defense thereof, and he, with his wife children and family fled in to Hungary,
and carried with him a great number of prestes, Seruia taken by Amorath^
Amorath in a short time became lord of al Seruia, and then last of all with
his army went to Sinderonia, and took it by force, and finding in it the son
of ye dispotto, he plucked out both his eyes, and carried him prisoner with him,
when George had thus lost his country he continued in hungary many years in
exile, tell on a time John the vaiuoda, which then governed hungary entered
i^to Saruia. This vaiuoda was acompted for his great Judgment in wars, one
of ye most famous captains of Europe, and had given to diverse of the Turks
Sauigiachi, many ouerthroes, and recouerid out of the hands of the said Turk,
a great part of the contre of the before named Dispotto, but he restored him
not to all that which he had recoueryd, lyberalitye of Vauioda.
for some part of it he gave to his captains, other he held to him self,
persuading him self that he had great reason so to do, considering that it
was he that had recoueryd it, and therefore thought it good to hold some part
of it for him self and some for his frinds, and the rather for that he knew the
dispotto, not worthy to be trusted, for so much as as he put no difference
between the Christian relygyon, and the Mohammedan, and for that his country
lay between the hungarianes and ye Turks, and would now enter in league with
the one, and then with the other, and deceive them both, but now retorning to
speak of Amorath, a man truly of great power, and also of great understanding
in wars, who when he had brought under foot those noble men of his nation,
that held any parcel of his dominion, and had reduced to his obedyence, all
the less Asia, with pontho and Capadotia, so that all those that dwellid in it
were his except only Caromano, Caromano prince of Cilicia.
prince of Cilitia, and Asmabeco which governed in Armenia near to the floode
and uphrates, and the lord of Scandalaro which far beionde the city of
Setalia, does possess that part of Cilicia that does face the Iste of Cipres,
and although that Amorath had determined in his mind ye enterprise against ye
hungarianes yet he thought it good to make him self lord of ye rest of Gretia,
the, seat of Pelonesso
or at ye least to leave them, his frynds, at his back, whereupon he entered
into Peloponesso which at this day is called morea, and from thence marched on
with his armies, to ye strait (which beig) in breddeth but five thousand pases
does divide Peloponesso from the rest of Gretia, in sort, that if this
distraite of ye land were cut through, Peloponesso should be and Isle, enufroned
with y^ seas, Egeo, and Ionio) and there rased ye wall of Esmillia ye which in
tim paste was made by the Greeks for a strengeth to their contre, and
Co^stantainte ye dispotto who at that time possessed it seeing him self not
able to defend it, did groe to an appointment with him, and agred to give him a
certain tribute, and by that means made peace with him. When Amorathe had
thus brought to pass the affares of Peloponesso, and possessid the whole
province of Attica and was agreed with the lord of the city of Athenes which
was aflorin tine by Birth, he assembled an army of a hundred thousands of men,
and so passed into hungary, and being there could by no means get, Amorathe
passethe with his army into Hungarye
sufficencie of corn ne victuales, for such an army, for so much, as ye year
before there had fallen so much rain i^ hungary, ye it had in manner utterly
distroied their corn, in so much that ye inahbitants thereof, were enforced to
leave ye co^tery in many places thereof and to seek for relief in other
places, ye which when he considered, he commanded to spoil the country, as
much as in the^ was, and the^ returned home with his army. This scarcety and
want of victual did at ye time save the kingdom of Hungary, for by means of
it, Amorath was constrained to return home with his army, and to co^te^t the^
selves with ye simple spoil ye they there found. the Cardinal Saint Agnolo sent
into Almaigne
The^ Eugenio ye forth of ye name Bushope of Rome, vndersta^dig in what peril
ye country of Hu^gari was, sent in to Almany Iuliano Cesearino his legate
dalatere, Cardinal S. Agnolo, to perswad ye Emperor and other princes of ye
almanigne nation to aid the king of Hu^gari, which Cesarino when he came into
Almagnie, did earnestly desire ye Emperor to take upon him ye defense of ye
Kingdom of Hungary, against ye enemies of ye Christian faith when he had thus
done, he went into Hungary, and there by his authority and effectuous
persuasion, so moved ye people, ye every man took his furniture and weapon and
would not tarry, ye aid ye was promised the^ out of Almaigne, but followed John
Vaiuoda their captain, and marched on into Gretia, until they came to the
city of Sophia, and having often times occasion to deal with the Turks, had
always ye victory of the^ Vaiuoda wanne so great estimation in this journey,
in ye which he did not only fully execute ye office and duty of an excellent
discret Captain, but also of a valiau^t and hardy soldier, so that it was
grown to a Proverb among ye Turks, ye when ye mothers would appease their
children from crying, or else with draw them from any fond desire ye they had,
they would say, here comes Vaiuoda. After this all ye Sangiachi gatherid the^
selves together, with ye Lieu tenant of Gretia, which in ye Turkishe speech is
called Belagarbei, and they united their powers and marched toward the
christians, with a very puysaunt army, both of horse men and foot men, and
joined with them in battle, Battle between vaiuoda and the belagarbei of
gretia.
but the Christians in number, were far in feriour to the infidels, who
fought for a long time very valiantly with the hungarianes, but at the last
being ouercomme, through the virtue, and discipline of ye hungarianes turned
their backs and flied, and in this flight were flaine a great number of them.
In this act ofarmies, ye hungarian Captains did some what augment the
victory, and wrote to frederick the Emperor declaring that they had defeicted
the turkishe army, and slain thritye thousand of them upon the place, and
also taken of them a great number, but it seems to me rather that to be true,
that the Cardinal Saint Agnolo wrote to the pope and the Emperor, which was,
that the number of them y^ were slain, was upon the point of sire thousand,
and that also, they had taken ix. cornets of the enemies, and thus attributing
the glory to God: and then to John the Vaiuoda, whose great understanding, and
magnanimity, he does celebrate with maruelouse praises, when the turks were
returned home from this defeicte, Brute in Turchie
they were more afraied them hurt, by means of a brute that ran among them,
that the hungarianes did not only make preparation to invade them, but the
Almaignes and all the princes of Christendom also, whereupon they being in
great doubt and fear, sent to the hungarianes for peace, who well weing ye
power of ye enemy, imputed the victory as well to good hap as to their
force, and were willing to avoid the danger of any more enhaxarding their
force, to attempt fortune, whereupon with good will accepted the conditiones
offeryd unto them, and in this sort astablished a treues betwine them for ten
years, conditionally ye they should restore again to ye Dispotto of Seruia,
all such towns of his, Trewes between the hungers and the Turckes.
as they then held presently in their possessyon, when ye agreement, was thus
put in writing, them were they on both parts solempnely sworn, to observe and
fulfill all such articles as were notified with in the said treues, and thus on
both sides they ceased from hosti, litie, disolued their armies, and either
returned to his country. The Cardinal who had determined to leuye a new
army, and so to follow the victory, was very much displeased with the
making of this trewes, and wrote his mind to the Pope in that behalf, Note
the commandment of the Pope.
who was very sorrowful when he hard of it, and being a man fully bent to
chase the Infidels out of Europe, wrote again to his Legate: that the trewes
taken between the Hungarians and the Turks, was of no value: for so much as
his consent was not in it, and therefore charged him to command Laodislao,
King of Polonia: who at that time possessed Hungary, that he should break
the trewes made with the enemy, and reuyue the wars, for so much as he and
the rest were dispensed with as touching their oath, by the authority of the
Apostolic seat, then the bishop sent forth his Legates to the rest of the
Christian princes desyring them to aid the King of Hungary in this enterprise
against the Turk for the recouerye of Gretia, but he found none that was any
^hynge moved with godly reale toward this enterprise, saving only Philippe
duke of Burgonye, who put to sea his navy, and sent them toward the strait of
Gallipollie to ioynge with the Galleys o^ the Pope Eugenio, which he sent under
the conduct of Camertingo his nephewe, to the end that they should spoil and
invade the coaste of Asia, and to shut up the strait, that no aid should
come out of Asia into Europe. When Laodislao had received this commandment of
the great bishop, he thought it very fit for his purpose, for so much as he
knew right well that the nobility of Hungary were not well contented that
he should govern and possess their country, wherefore he thought it good to
hold the people thereof continually occupied in wars. And immediatlye
without any difficutie obeyed the popes commandment, sent for men into
Polonia and Bohemia, with other countries near about him, and leuyed his
army, made him ready with great celeritie, leading with him a great number of
Hungararians and also in manner, all the nobility and Prelates of Hungary, he
had also in his company the Cardinal of saint Agnolo, who by the authority
of the Apostolic seat had gathered together a great number of crossed men,
when Laodisiao was proclaimed Captain general of the journey (John vainoda went
with an army, An other journey against the Turcks.
in the which it is written that there were xl. thousand horsemen besides
fotemen) toward Valachia, where he had passage and victual, and then passed
over the plains, and after that, over the river Dauubio, and from thence
marched on into the lower Misia which at this present is called Burgaria, Mysya
now called Burgaria.
intending to pass through ye plains into Romania with his army, when
Amorathe understood the coming of the Christians, and the great power that
they were of, he trusted not greatly to the Greks, ne yet to ye Turcks that
were brought up in Gretiae, but thought it good to provide him an army of the
people of Asia, wherewith he was maruelously troubled, considering the
difficulty in passing them into Gretia, for so much as the nauye of the
Christians lay all along the Coasts, waiting continually to empeche him that
he might pass no army out of Asia to Europe, and thus tossing and tormen
ting him self, serching what way he might devise to pass them, being almost
desperate and out of hope, of any transportage for them, consyderyng the
difficultye thereof, it is said that he was delivered from this care by means
of an offer that was made unto him, by certain masters of Ships of Genoba,
which went to him and offered him, that if he would content them well, that
they would pass him in to Europe what number of me^ he would, and would give
him suertie thereof, of the which offer he was exceeding glade, and agred to give
them for every man that they should pass that served on horse back, a ducate
of goolde whereupon the Genoueses departed and set sail, and sailed to the
mouth of ye straicte toward ye great sea, which place, of them of old worlds
was called the Bosphoro Cilmerico, which lies between Prop^ntide and the sea
Eusino, above Constantinople eight legnes and a half, Asia is there divided by
an arm of the sea which is in breadeth half a mile and half a quarter of a
mile, when Amorathe had brought his army near to Calcedoma: and that the
Genoueses had receued them all aborde, and according to the promise, receued a
hundred thousand ducates, for their passage they passed the strait, and put
them safe a land in Thratia, in this mean time ye army of the Christia^es was
come to a place called Varna within four days journey of Andrinople, where
they saw Amorathe with an army of an incredible nu^bre of me^ marching toward
them whereupon the princes and Captains councelled, what was to be done, Note
this opinion.

tari him in y^ place but to retire them to some high hill, or ground of
advantage, where they might encampe, and not be enforced to battle. opinion
of Vaiuoda.
The Vaiuoda was of contrary opinion, and aledged ye the manner of the Turks
was, ever, to brute them selves to be a greater number, then in deed they were
to ye end to fear their enemies and to cause them to be in doubt of them, but
admit said he, ye they were so many in nu^bre as men say they are, yet ought
we not to give any place, or to fear them, considering y^ they do not so
greatly excede us in number, as our Hu^garians do surmouut the^ in virtue,
discipline, and force, and also ye turks are more curiouse in decking the^
selves and their horses, with brave apparel, rich iuels, costly saddles and
trime bridels, then to arm the^ selves and their horses with good and suer
armours and bardes, with their furnitures, and our Hungaria^s in contrary sort
desiree to be well mounted and armied, so, as their enemies shall hardly hurt
them, and esteem not Bravery any thing at al, more over it ought to be
considered, y^ if we should now give any place to ye enemy, considering ye
great force of our army, being lad also by a King of Hu^gary, and a legate
Apostolic i^ person, being acco^pained with such a number of noble me^,
prelates and gentlemen, ye it may well be affirmed ye al ye nobility and force
of ye ki^gdomes of Hu^garie, Polonia, and Bohemaia is i^ this camp the which,
here after may be such a discorag to ye Hungaria^s when they alone shall have
ocasio^ to deal with them ye they shall not be of y^ nobility of mind once, to
encou^tre them, or to look them in ye face, when Vaiuoda with these, and such
like sai^gs, had exhorted the^ to be of noble mi^d and not to give place, but
there to abide ye enemy, it was wholly agred to follow his opinion, as of a man
most honorable and magname i^ appare^ce: of al those ye there were in counsel,
whereupon they ceased their march, and renged themselves, in battle. The next
morning the infidels presented them selves, enbattailed to them, and whether it
were, for that they were more in number then they were bruited to be, orels it
happened: as often times it both, that to those that are affraied of every
shadow, small things seem great, I Judge not. But when vaiuoda had vewed the
number, Vaiuoda persuaded the king not to accept the battle.
and order of the infidels, he was discoraged by means of the present peril,
and changed opinion, and began to persuade the king, not to accept the
battle, but ye he should do well, to march away to some place of advantage,
unto whom the king answered that his council was given out of time, for so much
as he saw it to be more dau^gerouse to turn their backs ye enemy being so
near then to make good the place, and to accept the battle, for in giving
battle, they had great reason to hope for the victory, consyderinge it has
been often seen that the lesser army has defeicted the greater, and also that
in giving battle, the virtue and discipline of men is of more valewe then the
number, more over, he believed that they would fight with great assurance, for
so much as they fought for the reale of the religyon, of the most high
Monarcque, God (in whose hands are al armies and kingdoms) who would aid and
favor his faithful, considering the justness of their cause, and
contrariwise he was assured, that the victory by fleyght should be given to
the enemies, without loss of their blood or well payinge for it. And when he
had sharply reproved Vaiuoda of the brave and manifique, words that he spoke
the day before, being full of ire, commanded all that were armed to follow him,
and thus very boldly thrust forward toward the enemy, Amorathe
Amorath went up to a little hill, from whence he might well discern, both the
doings of the Christians, and of his people also, and there seeing the
Christians march toward him, already in battle, he commanded a squadron of.
Battle betwine Laodislao and Amorathe
xv. thousand horses to charge them, to begin the battle. The Christians
received the charge of the Turks with great assurance, and then gave the
charge upon them, and thrust in among them and so used their hands that there
was great slaughter on both ^artes, but far greater on the part of the
infidelles, who not being able in the first encountre to endure the ^orce of
the Christianes retired them selves, and the ^ungarianes charged them with such
force that they enforced them to desorder them selves and to turn their backs
and fly toward their camp, when Amorath be held the shameful flighte and
disorder of his people clean contrary to his expectation, he was so dismayed
and overwhelmed with fear, that he turned his horse and began to fly, the
bastias enforce Amorathe to stay.
which when his Bastias and captains of the Gia ^izzaries perceived, they laid
hand of the bridle of his horse and stayed him of force, and so marched toward
ye enemies with him threating him to cut him in pieces, if that, he refused his
place, and in this sort enforced him to tarry, and ye worthiest men of his
army came to him to encorage him, and then restored the fight in the wicch
they employed them selves with great obstina^ie and force on both parts, by
the space of certain hours, the one part having now the better, and then the
other, in such sort that it was hard to judge where the victory should
light, for the slaughter was great on both sides, but far greater on the
party of the infidels, then of ye Christians, for that they were nothing so
well armed as the christians were, soldier like handlyng.
but in the end they so increased with new squadrons of men emploing them in
ye place of the weried, and spoiled squadrons, the which relyfe the Christians
wanted to froonte their enemies with, and being thus ernesly occupied in the
battle for the space of many hours, the hungarianes wexed werie, and being
overcome with the over much travail that they had endured in this battle,
therforce began to fail the^ whereupon, they retired them selfs, by little, and
little, ye which when Laodislao perceived, he took with him a mighty squadrone
of horse men of P^lonia: in whom he had great confidence and to encorage his
people and disorder his enemies, then in manner victorious he caused his troop
to sture them, and passed on with his cariadge, and monition in very strong
order to the hill before said where Amorathe stood with his guard, and assailed
him with such assurance and force, that Amorathe was disordered, with his
guard also, and being utterly dismaie^ determined yet once again to flee, and
through out his whole army there was nothing but disorder an^ confusyon,
they were so stryken with fear that every man determined by flighte to save
one. And it is not to be douted, that if John Vayouoda with his people had come
on and followed the king, and continued ye charge which the king gave upon the
enemies and so followed the course of victory, but that the Christianes had
that day ouerthroen Amorathe with all his power, and taken from him the Empire
of Gretia, but Vaiuoda as soon as he considered the werynesse of his people and
saw the enseignes of the Christianes begin to declyne and give place, serred
him self, with a troop of ten thousand hungers and Valacques his trusty
soldiers, and with drew him spedyly from the fight, without aduertising ye
king any thing at al of his departure, ye enemy yet making good ye place, and
not thorowlie disordered the victory also yet being doubtefull, he sought to
save him self by flight, their are some that for his excuse do say y^ he being
a man of great experence in the wars, saw no means how to save the
Christians from the slaugh ter, wherefore he thought it better to save those

was content to yield his life for the mainte, ^aunce of the Christian faith,
when John Vaiuoda was escaped from the defeicte as we have said before,
Vaiuoda prisoner.
^e came in to Seruia where the dispotto met him: re^eauing him very honorably,
and the day following, ^e appointed to him guard, and in no wise would grant
^im liberty, onles he would cause to be delivered unto ^im: all such towns
and castles as the said John Vainoda and his fryndes, then held of his, the
Vene^ian Cardynall which was lyuetenante of the Nauys ^t the sea, was also
blamed for this ouerthroe, and charged to be neglygent in the doing of his
duty and ^yd not that, that was to be done, in defending the ^trayte and
forbyddynge the passage of the army ^ute of Asya, in to Europe, and also for
that, that when he knew them to be passed: he did not ^duertise the Christians
thereof, to ye end, they might ^he better have provided for them selves, and
as touching ^he number of those that were slain. I can not certenlye say, but
yt the slaughter and spoil of the Turks, did far exceade that of the
Christians, but co^siderynge ye inequality of the armies, the loss of the
Christians (weyng their number) did far excede that of the Turks.

When Amorathe had thus obtained the victory and rested wholly master of the
field, he had no great desire to follow the chase of his fliyng enemies, nor
yet did glory with great words as the manner of the Turks is, ne yet sought
in any kind of sort to amplify the victory: nor showed in his co^ntenaunce
any kind of joy, and being demanded by certain of his familiers: the
cause, Answer of Amorathe.
that after so great a victory, he showed him self so melancolicke, he
answered, I desire not often to obtain victory in this sort. After this, he
raised his canipe and desolued it, and such soldiers as he had left alive,
he sent again to the places from whenre they came, and he in person returned
to Andrinople, where he accomplished sundry vows that he had made to God. A
notable consideration of an heathen prince.
And after this, he called to mind the great peril and danger that he had been
in, and also the great cares that are incident to government, in the which he
concluded that no man might call him self happy, for as much as it has in
it, more of the bitter, then of the sweet, and judging also by examples passed:
the inconstantie of Fortune, who rarely accompanies any man favorably
throughoute to the end, and being desirous to provide for his security, and
quietness, called to him all his Bascias and chyefe governors and councillors,
of his Empire, and by their consent appointed in his stead, Mahometh his eldest
son to be their prince and lord, and to be governed until he came to lawful
age to govern, by Calibasso Bascia, who for his power and wisdom, Amorathe
in private estate.
was the chief counselor that the Turk had, and when he had disburdened him
self of government and was become private, he passed over into Asia,
accompanied with certain of his familier friends, Mahometh the 9. prince.
and there lived religiouslye geuynge him self to solitarine. Al his sons,
Mahometh only excepted, were by ye advise of the Bascias put to death, to
avoid all occasions of tumultes sturres and alteracions that might happen,
The turkishe costume.
as often times it does among the Turkishe nation, with whom the children of
private me^ are more happy, then they of Emperors, the battle of Varna, did
so diminishe and consume the force, of both the Tukes and Hungerianes, that
without any conuenante of peace at all, they held them of both sides with in
the frontiers of of their contreis for the space of many years after, victory,
dearly bought
and neither of them durst to enter the others country, ne yet to provoke by
any manner of injury, the one the other to wars, this quietness was so much
the more perfect, for so much that neither in Turchia: ne yet in Hungaria, was
there any king of age, able to govern him self, but either of them, were
governed by other men, for among the Turks did Callibasso govern, and among
the Hungarianes did John Vaiuoda, govern, both, men of great reputacyon and
credit among their own people, Calibasso had governed a long time under
Amorathe, and being a man very grave and modeste having also great experience,
was Judged of al men a very wise man, Vaiuoda being a man of a percinge
Judgment, Opinion of Vaiuoda.
and valiannt in wars, was holden in the opinion of all men to be the more
skylfull of both, it semid to him that he had lost great reputaci on by ye
overthrow received at Varna, which did much disquiet him wherefore he denised in
him self day and night, how to recover his lost credit, and to be revenged
of the dishonor that he had received, he iugged the quiet being of the Turcks
(who are ambitiouse and desire to enlarge their dominions) to proceed only of
want of governance and force, whereupon he thought to prevent them and to
assail them unlooked for, and although he knew well that they were able to
leuye a great power, yet he persuaded him self that they had no governor able
to command, and also he was not ignorante that a great army inobedient, and
wanting a discrete leadre, was less to be feared, then a wise and experimented
Captain with out an army, whereupon he determined to make wars again
against the Turcks with all speed, and with grea deligence assembled his people
of Hungaria and Bohemia, he entretained in pay also: diverse regiments of
Almaignes and other strangers footmen, and so marched on toward the Turks
with his army, thincking to enter their contre and to take some place of
importance with in the country and so to pass one with his army to
Andrinople, before the enemy should understand of his departure out of
Hungary which he was like to have done, Treason of Dispot to.
had not the fylthie treason of George dispotto ben, who as soon as he hard
y^ Vaiuoda levied bands in Hungarye, he sent to Calibasso Bascia, and to all
the Sangiachii of Gretia, making the number of the Christians far greater then
in deed it was, reporting the matter to be more perilous then of it self it
was, which when they understood: they were so amassed, that they knew not
whither to torn them, for they were out of al hope that Amorath would ever
stand them in any stead, for so much as he was old and had given over all
charge and wholly given him to religion, wherefore he would no more deal in
wars, and for that Mahometh was so young, they thought it not good to
commytte so weighty a matter in to his hands, as the leadyg of an army
against so puissant, and skylfull an enemy as Vaiuoda was, and they feared
that if Calibasso should lead their army, he should not have due obedience,
which is a thing most perilous in all armies. Thus, when the council had
debated sondrie opinions, they agred upon none, but were in great confusion,
consuming the time in discourses of none effect growing to no point at all, at
the last by the advice of Calibasso, here was their only remedy, they agreed
to call Amorath out of Asia, and to enforce him to come, if that with good
will: he would not take in hand the enterprise for the defense of his sons
state, being assured at that time that the Gianizzeries would fight under the
conducte of none but only of Amorathe, and also they thought it not convenient
to commit the fortune of the wars into the hands of any man, Amoonly
exceptedvnder, Ambition of Mahometh.
whose conducte they were always accustomed to embrace victory, this council
of Callibasso very much displaysed the young king Mahomethe who above all
other things desired to have governed that journey, to get him reputacien, and
to give them to understand, that he was sufficient to govern of him slfe,
moreover he suspected that if Amorathe wc^^ called again to govern, he
moughte continewe in the same, for so much as the minds of men are mutable.
When the ambasssadours were come into the presence of Amorathe, they persuaded
him ernestly to the journey, brought him with them to Andrinople, where with
great diligence: he assembled his soldiers and furnished them of al kind of
necessaries. In this mean time, was Vaiuoda come on toward Sophia, and
encamped at a place called Basylia where it was declared unto him that Amorath
was not far of with the Turkishe power, Besilia where the battle was
fought.
which when he understood (although it were contrary to his expertacion)
caused him to put on a noble mind determyninge not to tarry there the coming
of the enemy, but to march on toward him and so to encountre with him, as soon as Vaiuoda had discovered him forth with he put his men in battle and
marched on toward him and with speed joined with him in battle, their began
a terrible fight which continued, y^ space of certain hours with great
obstinatie on both parts, that nether, gave to the oath, one foot of ground

advantage, Note the place of the general of the army.
for against that corner, or wingne of the battle, wherein Vaiuo da was, the
Turckes were not able to endure the force of the Hungarianes, and for a long
time gave place gyuing over the victory in to the hands of their enemies. And
in contrary wise, wheare Amorath was in person, the Hungaianes were not able to
make good the place, after this, Vaiuoda and Amorathe met face to face, and
drew unto them, all the whole weight of the battle, in so much y^ the
Christians were not a ble to endure y^ great force of y^ Turks, although y^
Hungarians did far excide y^ Turks, in virtue and discipline of the wars yet
not with standing, being over laid with nu^bre and not with force, but being
utterly weried, were constrained to give place, and Vaiuoda could nether with
prayer, nor threating, cause them to make head but fled continually, whereupon he
with drew him, with a few of his trusty fryndes with him very skylfully from
the vattaile and so saved him self, there dyed in that battle many noble men
cheifely of the Hungariane nation and some prelatz, y^. footmen were in manner
all slain upon the place, and on the Turckes part the loss was not less when
he came to his reuewe, when Amorathe had thus (with the great effusion of the

first purpose conveyed him self to Bursia, and there lived privately even to

AS SOON AS AMORATHE WAS DED, Mahometh his son cast from him all kind of
subjection: and took upon him absolutely to govern the kingdom, and
determining to reform things that were out of order, he made new laws, he
al^^ corrected such of their ancient constitutions as were ^edeful to be
corrected: with great diligence, he did mar^elouslye enriche his treasury by

he did great^y increase the number of his Gianizzaries, and horse^en, he
caused the acompte of his Bascias, and such like ^s governed in his fathers
time, to be perused, wherup^n he put certain of them to death, and from many
of he rest he took their goods and liuinges, and having ^n ambitiouse head,
could not be contented with that ^mple dominion y^ his father left unto him,
but sought ^o take in hand sum glorious enterprise, whereby he naught be
thought, not only to be equal with his an ^estors: but far to excede them,
whereupon he fully de^ermined to take Constantinople by force, Discourse of
Mahameth.
and to make ^im self lord thereof, persuading him self y^ he could not
lawfully be called Emperor of Gretia, unto y^ time that he possessed that
City, being the cheyfe city and ^eate of the same Empire, and more over by
thesi me^^es, he thought to make his fame gloriouse with there ^ations, if that
he, scarcely creapte over of his c^yld^ ^ede moughte join to his Empire so
mighty and famous a city, and so much the rather, for that it had been
^ttempted by certain of his ancestors to their great ^harge: who never
could obtain it but departed ever without it, and thus he determined the
enterprise making few privy unto it but dissembled the matter, and with all
speed possible caused to build a Castle upon the mouth of the striate of the
great sea, v. miles above constantinople and fynyshed it with great expedityon
and being finished, he appointed a captain to it and f^^ nished it with men
and all kind of munition, when h^ had thus done: without any other denou^cing
of war contrary to the oath and effect of the confederacye, h^^ presented
his army as an enemy, to Constantinople and when he had over run and proied
the whole con^ trey round about it, he encamped near to the citi^ and
environed it with his army, both by sea and land The Emperor and the princes
of Gretia, had a suspicion of Mahometh, Ambassadors sent by the princes of
Gretia to the pope and other princes of Europe.
and being affraied, considering tha^ their force was not sufficient to
encou^tre him, sent their ambassadors and Orators to all the princes of Eu^
rope, to the Emperor, and to the Bushope of Rome using with them al art
possible to induce them to giu^ them aid, declaring to them the manifest
peril where in they were, which was like to be the ruin and loss^ of that
ancient and noble Empire, and last of all, openned unto them the miserye that
they were like to en curre if they should light in the hands of that most^
cruel, Barharouse and blood thirstye nation of the Turckes, which more
thirste for Christian blood the^ for any drink that is in the world, thus
were they enforced with plentiful streams of teres, to move them to compassyon
and to crave aid at their hand but all their travail was in vain, for they
found (that which I do abhore to speak of) the ears of the christian
princes so stopped and their eyes so blinded, yea they found^ them not only
blind and deaf, but they were rather to be Judged out of their wits, if y^
they could not dis^ cerne, and consider that if the Turckes once moughte
possess the whole empire of Grecia, the ruin of al Europe in time, were like
to follow, with y^ utter extirpation of the Christian religion, but I belyue
that they were occupied rather in revenging of particulare causes and about
their private commodities by means where of they contempned their universal
wealth and commodity.

But now, to return to the declaration of our historye, In this mean time,
Mahometh caused to leui^ out of all parts of his dominions, an infinite number
(...) men, The maruelouse segeand expugnation of Constantinople.
and took with him to his camp an exceeding great ^rniture of artillierie and
munition, and when he had ^us beseged the city of Constantinople round, he
plan ^d his batteries and employed his wholeforce to take it and to the end he
would be suer of it, he commanded ^o make certain mines, directly under
certain of the ^ul warcks of y^ to end, y^ his peoplemoughte ^ghte the more
aduantagiously: and the more easyly with their ladders surmounte the height of
the walls, he cau^ed to make a very deep trenche round abaute y^ Town ^eare
to the walls, with the earth whereof, he made great bancke at the foot of the
wall, upon the height whereof they moughte easyly set their ladders and so
en^er the Town, A brydgeof a marvelous length.
and on that side toward pera where ^he sea beatethe upon the Town, he made a
bridge by ^reate art, of twoe miles of length, where upon he ^uylded certain
towers, which in heighte did far ex^ede the walls of the city, and placed
on every one of these, a number of men, to beat alonge the walls that no man
might stand to the defense thereof, with these ^errible and great
preparations, Mahomethe did for ^a long time batter and annoie them of the
Town, both day and night with out cease, yet for all that, they of y^
town determined rather to dye, then to yield the town to his mercy, whereupon
they defended their city with great assurance, Mahometh then: consider^nge
the great breach that he had made, and also the slaughter of the Citizens, was
in good hope to win it by force, whereupon he commanded a proclamation to be
made by sound of trompet throughoute all his camp, that every man the next
day following (which was the five and twentyth of April, in the year of our
health. 1452.) should be in order redye to give the assault, and the Town
being once taken, he gane francklye to his soldiers, all such good des as
they should find with in it and be able to carye out of it in three days,
Fasting of the Turckes.
which proclamation once published, so pleased every man, that happy was he,
y^ could be in the best order furnished, there was not one of them but that
he fasted all the whole day till night that they saw the stars appear in
the heauenes, then every man prepared him to eat, and drink, calling their
frynds and kinsmen to them, and made great chere together, and when the had
thus in banqueting consumed a good piece of the night, they took their leave the
one of the other, with embracing and kissing one an other, as though they
should never have seen again. On the other side, when they of the City
understood the proclamation that this mighty prnice had made and the great
preparation also, y^ prests and other religiouse took in hand the Images of the
Crucifixe and our Lady, and also the relics of Saints and went in solemn
procession with all the inhabitants of the City singing of himnes and songs
with sheding of tears calling to god for aid, in this sort did they consume
all that day in fasting, prayer, and visiting the holly places of the City
until night came, and then they made good chere, and that done, every man went
to the place that he had in charge to defend, the walls of the City were in
heighte and thicknes, comparable to the walls of any City, that then was in
the world, but through their long contynuance, Great negligence of the Greks
and negligence of the Greeks for want of reparation: their vauntemures were
utterly decayed in many places, but the wall was very strong and of
sufficient force to be defended, whereupon the Greeks having good hope in the
force of their walls appointed their people in companies for y^ defense of
the^. Constantinople is in form almost treangle, whereof, the two parts that
the sea beats on, are guirded about with walls sufficiently strong to
defend y^ force of the Armata, the rest of the City, toward the firm land,
beside his wall whereof we have alredye spoken, is enuironned with a dyke, deye
and large, when the third watch of the night was passed, the Turckes being
very gredye upon the spoil of the City, made them redye to the assault and
would not tarry for the day light but presented them selves to the walls of
the town and began to assail it, The first assault.
from whence che arroes and stones flewe as thycke as hayle from the heighte of
the walls, the Turckes were much anoyed by means of the darkness for that
they could not see how to defend them selves from the arrows and stones,
where with many of them were slain and hurt, when it was perfect day, Mahometh
approached near ye town with all his power, Great judgment of mahometh
and commanded when he should give a sign, the town to be assailed round,
to the end that they of the towns should not be able to defend every where
his force, he appointed to every colonel with his regiment a certain space
of the wall to assail, for that they should fight apart, to the end the virtue
of the assaylants, and their worthy acts might be seen, and that thereby they
moughte be the more enflamed thorough desire of honor to commit them selves
to all kind of peril. In like sort was their order given to them of the
Armata, with commandment that in one instant every man should assail that
place whereunto he was appointed, there were brought also nere to the walls
certain towers of wood, which were set upon high grounds of advantage, upon
the which he placed many soldiers, to the end they might with their shot,
beat a long all the circuit of the walls, he had also with his artillery,
taken away all the defenses, so that when they should come to defend the
breach and walls, they must stand all open against his shot. When Mahometh
had done all these things, the token of the assault was given, with the sound
of trumpettes, bornes, bagpipes, and drums, that the air resounded of it,
immediately hereupon the assault began the Turks covered their heads with
roundels and targes, in such sort that it was like the rofe of an house over
their heads, and in this sort came to y^ walls, and set up their ladders, The
second assault.
enforsyng themselves with great courage to clyme to the height of the walls,
on the other side, they of the town endeavored them selves to defend it and
threw down upon them great stones, mighty pieces of timber, and annoyed
them merueylouslye with the shot of their Cross bows, Darts, and such
like, thrown by the arm, they above used their Mykes so well, that they
threw the Turks contynuallye from their ladders down, slew and hurt a
great number of them, and handled them so hardlye that they enforsed them to
scatter, and made them glad to abandone the assaute, whereupon Mahometh drew
near with his company, and encouraged them, calling by name now one and then
another, especyally those that were most valiaunte and worthy, comfortynge
them to revive the assaute, The third assault.
and in y^ end some he threatened with cruel words, and to other some he made
great and large promises, and in this sort wroughte with them, that he caused
them to put on noble minds and to begin again the assault, with far
greater furye then before, and every man sought to get up the wall, one
clymynge on the others shoulder and up by their Pykes like Cattes, some other
wont close together, covering their heads with their targes and roundels and
they that were on the low steps of the ladders, vare before them even of
force, those that were on the highest of the ladders, and many laid hold of
the Pikes and punchinge staves of their enemies as they thrust at them, and so
with great courage gate up walls, and when they were at the highest were
stricken down headlonge into the botome of the dyke, by them of the town, and
also they made such spoil of the enemies by throwynge down upon them, huge
stones, artificial fyres, burning Piche, with Darts and Pikes of fire
works, that it was very strange to behold, yet not withstanding the emperor
maynteyned theassaut with great discretion, and in the place of the weried and
spoiled, he sent always new and fresh bands, in such sort, that he gave
them of the city no jot of time to repose, but still augmented the fight
with new men, so that they of the town were merneylouslye consumed in a
short space, but that, John Iustinia^.
that most discouraged, was: that one John Giustiniano, a Genouese borne, a
Noble manne in his country, who at the time of the seyge happened to be in
Constantinople, and behaved himself so worthelye in the defense thereof, that
they imputed the greatest part of their defense to consist in him, until that
at the last, as he was valiauntlye fightinge upon the walls with the enemies,
through disgrace he was sore wounded, and as it is said seeing him self to
lose much blood, would not discourage the multitude with calling for a
Surgion, but secrently with drew him from the assaute, of whose departure, when
Constantine ye Emperor understood, he feared it wouldbe the loss of the
city, whereupon he went in person to him, and desired him not to leave y^
assaute, but Giustiniano would by no means grant thereunto, but required to
have a gate open to ye end he might go to be dressed and then to return again
to y^ city, al ye gates of y^ braies were shut between them and the town, to
the end that they which fought upon the uttermost walls, should determine
there to obtain the victory, or else to die in the place, for so much as
they being once abandoned, the loss of the town must needs follow, when the
gate was opened Giustiniano went out, through whose absence they of the town
were merueylously discouraged, the assault revived.
and began very coldlye to defend the assault, which when the Turks
Bascias and Colonels perceived, they marched on with their bands and
regimentes serred, and with greater furye then before: assailed the town, and
began to climb the breche, which they had made with their battery, some by
their ladders, and some beside their ladders, by the spoil of the walls, and
began to wax masters of the utter walls, and rep^^sed the Grekishe
soldiers, enforsynge them to fly in great disorder, and every man by
fotemanshyppe sought to save one, and to get into the city through the same
gate, that was opened to Giustiniano.

When the Emperor saw the shameful flighte and great disorder of his people,
he also fled after them, not regardyng his imperial majesty, The death of
Constantine the emperor*
nor seeking as it became so mighty a prince, rather honorably to die with
his sword in his hand, then to show such want of magnanimity. He came on
toward this same gate also, where with the force and thrustinge of those which
repaired thither to get in, he was thrown down to the earth, and in the
preasse trodden to death. And among so great a number of Soldiers as then
were within the City, there were found only twayn y^ utterly despised servile
life, Two noble soldiers.
and like worthy men honorablye died with their swords in their hands
fighting to the vttermoste, ye one of the^ was Theophilo Paleologo, a Greek
borne the other John Stiauo, a Dalmatian, which men este med it to vile: in
such sort to fly, and for a long time defended them selves and the city from
the hands of their most cruel enmies, slei^g a great number of them, till at the
last being ouerlayed with the increase of the number, not discoraged, but
weryed with ouercommyng of others, fell down and gave up the ghost, among a
number of bodies of dead infidelles, which they had slain with their own
hands. And Giustiniano being gone to Pera, and from thence by sea to Scio,
fell sick either of his hurt, or else with thought, and in few days after
died, not enjoying that great honor, which he had won, The death of
Giustinian.
and truly he had been happy if he had died up on the walls of
Constantinople. In the enter of the Turckes at the aforesaid gate, they cut in
pieces.viii. or.ix. hundred soldiers Greeks, and Italians, when the Turckes
were once masters of the town walls, they chased away the citezins that
were come to the gate to defend the entry, and with their arrows and great
stones from above, they made way for their companions to enter. And when the
Turckes were in this sort entered the gate, and become lords of the city, and
had slain as many as they found with weapon in their hands, then they
employed themselves to spoil and sack the town, Unspeakable wickedness.
the number of the triumphantes was in manner infinite, they had no desyrt but
to rob, spoil and to accomplish and fulfill their beastly and fyltye
fleshely desires, being much given to carnal voluptudusnes, they pardoned
neither kind nor age, mixynge murder with their adulteries and fornications,
they made the old men slaves, and other men and women of more lusty years,
and of base condition: they chayned together with great derison and scorn, and
so drove them on, like flocks of sheep before them, and if it happened that
any fair maiden or fair young man came in their way, by and by numbers of
them would strive who should first lay hands on them, and often times
would grow into question for them, and the like would they do when they
happened upon any booty of great value, as well sacred as profane, for every
man would ^aye hands on it, in so much that often times they would ^one cut
another in pieces for it. And this army being of diverse nations and countries,
and also of sundry natu^es and speches, did keep such a stir in
Constantinople by the space of three days (which was their time of ^poile) that
there was nothing unlawful for them to do, although it were most detestable
and wicked.

When they had spoiled the temple of S. Sophia, which was builded by Justinian
the Emperor of Consti^ople, in the which they had a merueylous mass or
trea^ure, both of silver and gold, and precious vessel, and such like
oruamentes, they filled it with all kind of fylthy^es, making it an habitation
of whores, a stable for their horses, a place wherein no filthy exercise was
left unexercised, to the like use they converted all the rest of the churches
and sacred places of the city, out of the which they took the bones and
relics of holy men and women, the which when they had disgarnished of y^
gold silver and stone, y^ was about the^, they threw into y^ street and canell
to be trodden on, not only of men, but also of dogs, swine, and other beasts,
the crosses and Images of saints were broken with great hammers and such like
instruments of iron, and thrownen into the dirt, and when they had with
sundry torments compelled the seuauntes of the citizens to reveal unto them
the hidden treasure of their masters, it is said, that they gate, hidden
under the ground, a great sum both of gold and silver and precious Jewels,
which were by the unwise citezins hydden in the beginning of the wars, the
which if they could have been contented to have employed in the defense of
the city, peradventure they had saved them selves both goods and life, Want
of providence the ruin of all countries and states.
and also to their country liberty and honor. But the old Proverb was
veryfyed in them, which says that covetous men have no power over their
gold, but are subject to it, when the city was thus spoiled of all that ever
was in it: The third day they departed out of it, and brought all their
prisoners into their camp. And Mahometh according to the custom of the
Turks, did celebrate to his Bascias and Captains, a very sumptuous feast,
and when they had eaten and dronken more then sufficient, he thought it good
to honor his banquet with the sheding of Christian blood, and commanded to
bring before him all the chief and most noble prisoners of the city that were
on live, Unspeakable cruelty of Mahometh.
and caused them al with unspeakable cruelty, to be cut a sunder in the
midst in his presence, among the which there was one that came before him
called Rireluca, the chief governor of the city next to the Emperor, whose
eldest son he caused to be slain, in the presence of his father, and
immediately after hanged the father, whose other son, because he was young and
fair, he reserved to his noble and virtuous usage. They had also taken diverse
merchants of Italy, Venetians, Genoneses, and others, whom he put also to
death, except they were able presently to ransom themselves, and Isodoro the

who was sent thither along time before, Legate from y^ pope Nicholas,
disguised himself in simple habit, and when the Turks entered the town, for
few thousands of Aspres, raunsomed himself. They that dwelled in Pera a
garrison town of the Genoueses, hearing that Constantinople was lost, laid
down their weapons, and tarried not the summonynge, but sent to Mahometh, and
offered him the town, who received them, and shortly after rased the walls
thereof, and where he had promised them sauegarde of their persons lives, and
goods, with all other their commodities, contrary to his promise, he took out
of the town for his own virtuous and cleanely usage, a number of the women
and boys that there were, and also taxed the town in a great sum of money
the which he enforsed them presently to pay, notwithstanding the menaging of
these weyghtie affairs he kept secret with in his breast the hatred that he had
conceived against Calibasso Bascia, for that he was ye chief occasion that
Amorath was called out of Asia to take in and the wars against the Hungarians
and finally called ^im to him, and caused to lay hands on him, and examined ^im
sundry days, Calibasso put to death by the commandment of mahometh
by sundry and cruel torments, layinge ^o his charge that he had reveled ye
secrets of those wars ^o the emperor of Constantinople, and upon this took
from him all that he had, which was treasure in manner ^nfinite, and caused him
most miserably to be put to death. When that the loss of Constantinople, and
the death of ye ^mperour was known in Morea, ye Albaneses that dwel^ed in
Peloponesso, rebelled against Thomas and Dime^rio, brethren to the late
emperor of Constantinople, ^hei were a great number, and determined to chose to
their prince, a noble man a Greek borne, who pretennted title ^o it, and did so
attempt it, that they entered into wars a^aut it, whereupon on both sides, they
addressed themselves or aid to Mahometh, who when he hard the matter ^horowly
debated, Judged ye two brethren to have the ^ight, whereupon he granted them
his frendshipas to those that had the right on their side, and sent in their
aid ^ertain bands of men, by whose good help, they sone re^ressed the force
of the Albaneses, Thomas paleologo tributarie to the Turcke.
and enforsed the^ to dwell under ye rule and goueruance, of Thomas Paleologo
there Dispotto, who agreed with Mahometh to pay him yearly ^euentine M. ducates,
and in this sort commended himself and his state to his protection, and for
as much as ye right was descended unto him by the death of his brother the
^mperour, he might lawfully have called himself em^erour of Gretia, in the
which his au^cestors had co^mau^^ed many years, but fearing to offend Mahometh
he ab^tained from that title, and contented himself with the only ^itle of the
Dispotto of Morea. But shortly after when ^e understood that Calixto the
third, a Spaniarde, ^ucceded Nycholas the fyfte, in the Romyshe seat, who
forth with sent his Legates and Cardynalles, ^o all the Princes of
Christendom, to persuade ^heym to make wars against the Turckes, for ^he
recouerye of Gretia. And also vnderstan^ynge, the great preparatyon that was
made in ^talie for the Sea, Thomas paleologo reuolteth.
and the leauiynge of the army in Hungarye, denied flattelye to pay any
Trybute unto Mahometh, and also over rashly refused his friendship and
protection, being deceived in his imagination, perswadiuge himself that
forthwith the Turks should have been chased out of Gretia, but after, when he
saw the bishops preparation took none effect: he was enforsed with great
gifts and payment of the tribute for two years before hand at one payment, to
reconcile him self to Mahometh, and to renew the league between them,
whereupon Mahometh dessemblynge for a time the injury that he had received at
his hand, received him again into his favor and protection, but within few
years after, when he perceived himself to be assured in his seat in Gretia,
he called to mind the foresaid rebellion, and sent his army into
Peloponesso, and took the wall of Esmilia, that was builded upon the strait
called Isthmos, which shuts up that strait of land, being five miles in
breadeth stretchynge from the sea Ionio to the sea Egeo, Esmilia.
of the which seas, all the rest of Morea which aunciently was called Pel^
ponesso is environed. And when the Turks had won the wall, they entered into
Morea, and took the city of Corintho, and made both the Dispotts his
vassalles, the one being divided from the other, and took from them their state
and patrimony. The province of Peloponesso is the chief part of Gretia for
the commodiousnes thereof, and also for the great wealth and power of the
nobility and commons that in the old worlds inhabited the same, that piece of
ground well considered, will declare it self to be the foundation of the
Greek Empire, for as much as in it there are many godly goolfes, many large
and great caves, and promontories, many manifique and sumptuos cities, and
they say that the form of the platte thereof: is like unto that of the leaf
of a platane, Peloponesso in length 175. miles in circuit, it is 5505. miles.
the length and breadeth thereof are almost equal, and from the one end to the
other it conteyneth a hundred, seventy and five miles, and in circuit
(according to the opinion of Pollible) it conteyneth five hundred miles, and
Anthemidoro adds unto it fyftye miles, and and we have declared it is
environed with two seas, saving that piece of land called Isthmos, which
confyneth upon the seas before said and contains in length v. miles, nere
where unto, is the noble and famous city Corintho, and their is contained in
y^ same Peloponesso, Peloponeso now called Morea.
now called Morea, Achaia, Messenia, Licaonia now called Lacedemonia,
Largolica, and Arcadia, which lies in the middeste of them, but now retorning
to the declaration of our history beginning where we left, when Mahometh was
becomme lord of Constantinople, and being determined, there to appoint the
seat of his Empire, the first thing that he took in hand, was to amend and
repare the walls of the city, and to make them defensyble, and also to repare
the spoiled buyldings of the town, and also to furnishe it with inhabitants
for that it wanted a great number by means of y^ great slaughter that there
had been where upon he caused inhabitants to come out of all parts, and gave to
them great privileges and liberties to use what traffic, and also what
religion they would where upon within short space there came thither an
infinite number of inhabitants, namely of Hebrews or Iues which were chased
out of Spain, beside this he used the custume that the princes of the east
parts of the world do use, which is that when soever he took any City or
Town after that time, he would take out of them the chise and most, noble
housholdes and families, with all their treasure and substance, and send them to
Constantinople, to inhabit there, he used the matter so that at ye time of his
death, he left it a City of great traffic: and also maruelously replenished
with inhabitants as soon as he was become Emperor of Constantinople he
determined in him self, the wars against the hungarianes Judging it a great
assurance to his state of Europe, if that he might bring to pass, to subdue
Hungary and make it subject to him, which he greatly defired consideringe the
propinquitie thereof, and also the valiantize of y^ people, he determined to
provide him of and aptaines of great Judgment and of good soul diours and to
assure him in his seat of Gretia, whervp on he deferred the enterprise for
three years, and began to make wars upon the city of Athenes which only
rested out of his hands, of all the province of Attica, which City although
it were then of no great circuit, ne yet any thing in comparysson so
Populouse or rich, as it had been in time before, yet notwithstanding, they had
builded a forte upon the walls that were left of the ancient Temple of
Minerua, Temple of Mynexua.

for so much as he had attempted the princes of Italy in sondrie sort for
aid, but all was in vain, whereupon he fell to composition with him and agreed to
deliver him the Town, in exchau^g of certain houses and yerly rentes that ye
Turcke had Athenes renderid to Mahometh.
promised him for the maintenance of him felfe and his family, and herupon
yielded the Town to the Turcke when the Turk had recompensed him, he took from
him two of his sons and brought them up in his Seraglio to serve him, of the
which two, one proffited so well in the exercise of arms, and also in
governance, that the Turcke had him in great estimation. And in Albania, the
which is that part of Macedonia that lies toward the weste, and stretche the
out from Durazzo, to the ancient City Appolonia, the langage of the Albaneses
is propre to them selves, and does differ from the speech of all those people
that dwell about them, for neither the Greek, ne yet the Schiauonese
understands it, and we are not certain in what sort, nor by what means,
they first arrived in those parts, ne yet of their ancient original,
althoghe it be said that this nation, with diverse others, came out of
Scithia Asiatica, from that ancient City Albania not far from Colchide,
Albaneses discendyd from the Scythianes
and so went on wandering to seek new habitacions and seats, and finally
occupied that part of Macedonia which bears their name, about the time of
the loss of Constantinople the prince of their country happened to dye, whose
name was Camusa, Camusa.
who being descended of christian parents: became so beastly, that of his
own acorde he left the christian faith and embraced the folisheand beastly
religion of Mahometh, but having small affiance in it, even as he had
raishely forsaken Christ, so unadvisedly refused he Mahomet he and returned to
the religion of his ancestors, willing (although he had no great affiance
nether in the one nor other) rather to dye beringe the name of a Christian,
then of a Mahometiste, unto whom, George Scanderbag succided in governance as
lawful heir, who was descended of a noble parentage in his country, and when
he had haunted the wars along time he became an excellent and famous
Captain, and spent the rest of his life in the defense of the Christian
religion, when Mahomethe understood the death of Camusa, he sent one of his
Bascias with an army to Valona, which stands upon the sea bancke, and
although it be but a little Town, it has a suer and a goodly haven, from
whence in to Italy the passage is but short and without danger, and many
years before that time, it was possessed and holden by Baiazithe, and when he
died they threw from them the Turquishe yoke, but Amorathe within short space
after took it again, and from thence for the was it contynually holden by the
in fydels, to the great reproach and dishonor of the Christian princes, and
to the great terror of all Italy, it is possessyd even at this day by the
infidels, when this Bascia had brought his people to valona, he assailed
Scanderbeg, who although he did always worthilye defend him self and his
people, and diverse times with his power had encountered the Turckes, and
departed from them always with the victory, yet notwithstanding he sent for
aid to the king Alphonso of Aragone, Scanderbeg to king Alphonso of Naples.
then king of Naples, and obtained of him diverse band of men at arms, well
furnished in every respect, which passed in to Albania by the way of
Durazzo, not far from the City of Croia, and with the help of George
Scanderbeg they defendyd that contre for alonge time from the Tyranny of the
infydels, when Calixto the Romish, Bishop understood the danger that
Scanderbeg was in, Callirio the Byshope of Rome.
Scanderbeg was in, weinge his power with the unspeakable power of his enemy, he
would not se him wa^te but supplied him with a great some of money to
entertain his soldiers and with these aids he de fendyd y^ country of
Albania, very skylfully and valiantly. In this mean time their was a practice
discouerid, A practiz^ discouerid
ye which a Nephewe of his, his brothers son, who having intelligence with
Mahometh, agreed with him up oncertaine condityones, to sleye his uncle by
treason, or else if he could by any means bring it to pass, to deliver him on
live in to Mahomethes hands, when this practeze was discovered by one of the
menagers of this same, he laid hands on him, and so caused him to be examined,
in the which he confessyd the whole, whereupon he thought it not convenient to
shed his own blood, but banished him, sending him with his process to the
king Alphonso, who commanded to put him into the Donge on called Miglio,
there to continewe during his natural life. And whileste Scanderbeg lived, he
defended Albania from the tirany of the infydels, fyghting only for the zeal,
he bare to the Christian religion and caused his subjects to persevere in the
faith of christ and his word, notwithstanding the contynuall inuasious, and
courses that his enemies made upon his cotre impouerishing his subjects
utterly spoiling y^ laborers of the earth, lainge waste a great piece of his
country, bringing it into unspeakable misery and calamity, when Mahometh
understood the death of Scanderbeg he sent forth with his army in to Albania,
and took the city of Croia with all the rest of the country except those
places that the venetianes held, about that time after the taking of
Constantinople, he did maruelously vex the religion of Rhodes both by sea and
land, but the great master of the Hospital of Iherusalm unto whom the Isle
did appertain, with his soldiers, defended it co^tynnally even to these our
days, and when Calixto the gre at Byshope was called unto for aid he put his
Navy of Ships and Galleys to y^ sea, and sent them to Rhodes, vnderthe
conducte of y^ patriarcke of Aquileia, who being in those seas, had often to
do with the Turckes took and drowned many of their Galleys and fustes,
drowned and slew their people, and departed always from them with the
victory, and when he had taken from the Turks y^ Isle of Salamina^ which in
ancient time was called Le^no, and also that, that is called Tasso, with the Isle
of Ne^bro and certain other little Isles, nere un to them, he went and spoiled
all alonge the sea coasts from helesponto even to the confynes of Egipte, to
the great impouerissing of the inhabitants there of, holding them in contynuall
doubt and fear and it seemed that if he might have continued, he would with
time have greatly prevailed, but as soon as Calixto was dead he departed from
thence with his Navy, in to Italy, leaving Rhodes with all others places that
y^ Christianes possessid in those parts, in great peril. And in Acarnia which
lies in the myddeste between Epiro, and Boetia and is called at this day the
Duchy, and the Dispotto which then reigned in Acarnama and Epiro, which at
this day is called Arta, which beginning toward the weste at the permontories
of Acrocera, do stretch out toward the east to the baie Ambrachio, which at
this day is called y^ golfe of Arta, this Dispotto being maruelously vexed
with Mahomethes soldiers, and being desirous to purchase some forien amity,
by means of the king Alphonso he took to wife a daughter of ye lord John
Vnitimiglia, a Captain of great fame that came into Italy with the king
Alphonso of Aragone, to the winning of the kingdom of Naples, who passed the
sea into Arta, having with him certain bands of Italianes men at arms, and
having often times to do with the Turckes, gave them many defeictes, and set
his son in law free from the inuasio^ and aunoiance of the Turks enforcing
them to return (...) Romania, and to hold them with in the confynes thereof,
but this noble Captain was not so sone departed out of Acarnamia and Dispott^
of Acarnamia betrayed.
gone home, but within short space after, the Dispotto was betrayed by some of
his own people, and delivered on live, in to the hands of Mahometh, with his
contre also when George the Dispotto of Seruia hard of the great preparation
that the Turks made for the wars being in doubt of his state, fled into
Hungary, and left^ his cities and Towns well guarded and furmished with
soldiers and all kind of munition, and when he was there arrived to demand
aid: the king was not there whereupon he went to him where he was in Vienna in
Austrice, where he found also freer John Caprestano of the order of Sainet
frauncis, who being a man of good life, and an excellent preacher did at that
time with great fruit preach the gospel to the Hungarianes, and being destrous
to talk with the Dispotto, sent to him desiri^g him that if it were not a
trouble unto him, that he would vouchesafe to speak with him, whereunto the
Dispotto agreed, and upon a day they met, and by there Turc^ men had great
discourse of the Christian faith and Caprestand did approve by great reason,
the authority of the Romish church, and the opinion of ye same as touching
the Christian faith, in such sort, that he constrained the Dispotto (not
having reason to answer for him self in that behalf) to yield, and would
have had him to refuse ye error, in the which he and his people were, and to
have embraced the religion and faith of the Romish church, unto whom George,
laying all reason a part answerid, I have lived these four score and ten years
in this faith which was taught me by my forefathers, Answer of the Dispotto
of Seruia.
and imprinted in mine understanding from michildhed. And among my subjects
(although I have been an in fortunate man) I have been holden for a reasonable
man, and would thou have me now such a one, as they seeing me changed might
think, that mine age has decayed mine understanding, in such sort that I
might go soocke again, acording to the proverb wherefore I will loose my
life, rather then leave the faith, wherein both I and my predecessors have been
norished and brought up, with which words he departed from Caprestano. And for
that he could obtain no aid at ye kings hand who was much offended with
him for his untruth, he took his leave, (not satisfied acording to his
expectacion) and returned into Seruia, a manifest document to admonyshe men to
take head, how they use double dealinge when George was comme home, he
understood that Michell Zilugo, (whose systre Vaiuoda had to wife) should ^e
governor of the Town of Alba, which at this day ^s called Belgrado, and was
alredye with his brother Laodislao gone into his wagen to pass on his journey,
and as they passed on by the confynes of his centrey he ^ent toward them
certain bands of armed men with commissyon to bring them either on live, or
ded, as ^one as Michell saw him self like to be assailed by the Seruianes, he
left his wagen and took his horse which was at hand lepte upon him, and with
his sword in ^is hand did cut his way through the midst of them and so
with flighte saved his life, the Seruianes finding ^aodislao in the wagen,
slew him, Laodisla^ Zilugo slain.
Michel determining to revenge ye injury that was done him and the death of
his brother also, appointed certain to go, and to understand in what
strength the Dispotto used to ride when he passed from place to place with in
his country, from whom he received aduertizement that George with in few days
after would pass on upon the side of Danubio to visyte certain fortes, and
Towns of of force that he had standing upon the same river, whereupon Michell,
with certain bands of soldiers passed on and marched in the night and
ambusshed them selves upon the way that George must pass, and as ^one, as
George came to the place where they lay in ^mbushe, they showed them selves,
and with great fu^ie assailed him, and in the fight he lost two of his
fingeres, and Michell took him prisouer unto whom he paid a great sum of
money for his rausome, and so returned home to his house, and when he came
there, he could by no means staunch the bledi^g of his wounds which bled
continually in such sort that in short tyme^e died. And this was the end of
George the Dispotto of Seruia, a man exciding troublouse and full of trea^on,
in whose place Lazaro his youngest son succided him, and deprived his elder
brother, whose eyes were plucked out by the commandment of Amocathe, as
before is mencyoned, with in few months after, Lazaro died, upon whose death
their arose great contencyon, who should succid him in state, Of civil
wars in Seruis.
Georg he desired aid of Mahometh, the wife of Lazaro being wydow demanded
aid and obtained of the king of Hungary, certain bands of both horse men
and footmen to maintain her in her state, Carafagio in Almaigne.
by the which means she continued in it, at that time was Carafagio, the
Cardinal Saint Angelo, in Almayne, sent by Calix to the Bishop of Rome to
require them to aid the Hungarianes in that they had begone in the behalf of
the Dowgier, Carafagio at the request of the Hungarianes entered with his army
into Seruia and fynding the Turckes alredie possessyd of it, by means of the
Seruians which of their own acorde had yel ded them, unto them whereupon he
returned back again and escaped hardly, notwithstanding with great
difficulty he came safe to Buda, when all these things were done, it semid to
Mahometh that he had well established his affares of Gretia, whereupon he
prepared his army and all kind of munition thereunto belonging, determining
no longer to defer the enterprise against y^ Hungarianes, for so much as this
occasion was, offerred him to be called in to Seruia by the Seruianes them
selves whereupon he assembled his army, in the which he had acording to the
opinion of some writers, a hundred and fyftie thousand able soldiers, but
their are other that write (of whose opinion rather we are) that they were a
hundred thousand furnished soldiers, and were fully persuaded to were the
palm of that journey, whereupon, he conueid his army over the mountains of
Tracia, and so marched on, till he came to the river Sauo, whereupon John
Carafagio Cardinal Saint Angelo, gatherid together all the power that he
could, promising to as many as would follow him in that journey, full
remission of their sins, Blasphemy of an empudent papiste.
and by the Apostelique authority that he had he gave to as many as should be
stain in that journey eternal life, and by these means and with the help of
ye preachinge of freere Caprestano he had assembled an army offortie thousand
men, of Almaynes, Bohemes and Hungarianes, all crossed me^ not of the welthiest
sort or men of estate, but pore men of the common sort, y^ which for the
zeal of y^ christian faith, were contented to offer them selves to the
danger of the death for the name of Christ Jesus, hopinge in this world to
obtain forgyuernes of their sins, and in the world to comme, foye
everlasting, which matter is hard for preachers to persuade princes, and great
rulers of the world unto, for so much, as many of them (setting their hole
felicity upon these transitory vanities) have no care for the life to comme,
which Christ has promised to as many as walk in his ordynances, for the
great ones of the world for the most part will not hazard them selves to
loose this life for that they ca^ not assure them selves of the life to come,
wherefore they do, not only, not frame them selves to hear the word of god,
but forasmuch as in them is, they flee from it as from a thing
mostedispleasante, John Vaiuoda.
and contrary to their natures: like wise John Vaiuoda had assembled an army
of valia^te men, out of Hungary and Bohemia, both of horse men and fotemen,
Mahometh was in such a triumph by means of the good success that he had had,
that he thought there was no power in Europe: able to encountre him. And
being puffed up in this sort with pride, with great fury presented his camp
to the city of Alba, which stands upon the mouth of the river Sauo,
Mah^meth before Belgrado, in camp.
not far from the Danubio, and at this day is called Belgrado and at the
lodging of his camp he gave a great brauado and a notable charge upon them of
the town, and when he saw the town well furnished with defendantes and his
assaults received with great assurance and that the Hungarianes durst, not
only to defend their town, but also to hold the feelde contynually in arms
within the shot of the Cannon whereupon he thought good to assure him self
from outeward insultes and to plant his batteries, wherefore he gave order with
all speed to fortify his camp with great dykes and strong rampares, and
also they of the town applied them day and night in reparing them selves,
that in short space they were so fortifiede that notwith standing the greatest
part of the wall, was by yt Turckes battery laid flat on the earth, yet
stood they upon their new fortificationes and ripares y^ they had made within
the town in far greater assurance for the defense of the town, then if the
walls of the town ha^ continued in their former state, and the Turckes being
at hands with them contynually, both day and night were entered the breaches
and then the town, and fought with them of the town upon ground of equal
advantage with their new fortificationes, and defenses, and could not enforce
them to give unto them one foot of y^ ground which they had determined to
defend such was their valewe in arms. Order of Mahometh.
When the Turckes had in this sort batterid the town for a long time in
vain, Mahometh being kendled with great fury, and rage determined to hold
them occupied day and night continually, and so to werye them. And when he had
embattayled all his people, and divided them into regementes or squadrones,
apointi^g to every squadrone for conducte thereof a man of great Judgment in
marcyal affares, to the end that they should, one succide an other in y^
assaute with their battailones and so to keep occupied continually them of the
town, to the end that they should have no time to fortify them selves
against them, and then they began on every side to assail the Christians who
also put them selves in battle and appointed also certain extraordinary
bands to be employed where necessity should require, and thus came on nobly
and encountered their enemies, there was between them a long fight, the
assault was full of bloodshedde and cruelty, and also doubtefull, for some
time the Turcks prevailed: as though they would forthewith becomme lords of
the town, on the other side the Christians suppliing the fight often times
with new bands and calling to mind their wonted valiantize did so repulse y^
enemies that some time they enforced them clearly to abandone the walls, so
that the victory seemed aparently to be theirs and in this sort the battle
continued so doubtefully y^ it was hard to say where ye victory should
light, and by means of the great obstinatie on both parts the matter was
like to continewe doubt full till the darcke night whereupon Mahometh
determined to prove whether his presence might anyething prevail to encorage
his soldiers or no, and imediatly came among them, thincking by his presence
so to encorage his soldiers that forthwith they should enforce the
Christians to abandone the walls, whereupon he came to that place where his
guard of Gianizzaries did assail, and as he approached some thing near was
strycken with an aroe under the right pappe, whereupon he was taken and carried
to this lodging, which so discoraged his people, Great co^fusien among the
Turckes.
that immediately they left y^ assault upon the soodden, and abandoned their
artillery to their enemies in proie, and with speed conueid them selves to
their lodginges, and the nigth following they levied their camp with great
silence and marched on with great speed till they came into Seruia, and from
thence into Romania, when the Christians saw the seege raised, and the enemy
gone, they gave god great thanks and were joyful and meruelouse glad. Then
they endeavored to cure their hurt men and to distribute the proye to every man
acording to his place, this great and rare victory was attributed to there men
in especiale, which is to John Carafagio Legate Apostolic, in whose name the
journey was taken in hand. To John Vaiuoda, and to freer Caprestano, which two
were present in all these affares although that Vaiuoda in all his letters
that he wrote to the Emperor and to other princes and friends of his, never
made any mention of Caprestano, nor Caperestano in his letters which he wrote
to the Bishop of Rome and also to the General of his order and other
prelates, made any mention of Vaiuoda, notwithstanding, either of them
affyrmed in his letters that god through him, had given to the Christianes
that glorious victory, wherein it was apparently seen, that the nature of man
being most gredie and desirous of honor, will more easyly depart with
kingdoms, contreys, riches and such like and to approve this, it was evidently
seen in Caprostano, who in time before, could easyly contempne and dispize
all wordly riches, set at naught all erthely pleasures vanquishe and overcome
the desires and motiones of the flesh and yet could not depresse that desire
of glory which then was in him. Although some man moughte say unto me, y^
Caprestano cared not for his own glory but for the glory of god declaringe
his incomprehensyble power by aiding the Christians and gyuing them victory by
the advice and industry of a simple, poor, and un armed freer, to the which
objection I am content at this present to give place, when Mahomethe had
receuid this great bastonade and was returned home, it is said that he became
more temperate, and modeste, and began to consider man's astate, and to
depresse his arrogance, and pride, and he never happened afterward to hear
any talk of the journey of Belgrado, but it would put him in Cholere, and make
him to shake y^ head, notwithstanding that he could well dissemble his cause.
When Calixto was ded, there succided him in his seat Enea Picolhuomini a
Sienese borne, who being desirous to provide for the defense of Christendom,
went in person to Mantoa, a city in Lombardie, where he had appointed a
general council, and at the day appointed their came many princes, and the
ambassadors of all the Christian potentates, and the matter being there
examined and debated for the space of eighte months in what sort they should
make wars for the recovery of Gretta, and chasing of the enemies out of
Europe, and having there a great nu^bre of Christian princes, which were very
cold in that behalf, and did slenderly satisfy the expectation of the pope,
whereupon when it was decreed that ye wars should be taken in hand against
the Turcke, he licensed the Council, and departed toward Rome, determining to
go this journey in person with his Navy by the sea, on the other side Mahomethe
having intelligence of the great preparation that the Byshope of Rome made,
determining to cut of all occasyones that might trouble his state in Gretia,
and calhys enemies thither, Another army in Morea.
whereupon he sent his army again into Morea, and about the year of our
salvation a thousand four hundred and three score, and in a short space became
lord of the greatest part of that country, and having alredie taken the
Dispotto thereof (dimetrio) and sent him prisoner to Constantinople, Thomas his
elder brother being then prince of Acaia, was maruelously in doubt of him
self, whereupon he took with him out of Acaia the head of Saint Andre the
apostle and fled out of his country into Italy with the before said head and
many other relics of Saints, and came and presented both the relics,
and him self to the pope. Who receued the relics, and caused them to be
placed with great solenpnitie, in the church of Saint Peter prince of the
Apostles, in a certain Chapel which he had builded with great sumptuositie,
and to Thomas prince of Achaia, he appointed such promisio^ as might honorably
maintain his state duringe his life, in that same year Mahometh went with his
army against the Emperor of Trebisonda and entered into Ponto with an
exceeding, great Navy and beseged Trebisonda, The see^e of Trebisonda.
both by sea and land, and the Emperor making no great defense nether of him
self, ne yet of his city, was taken, and brought on live to Mahometh, who
sent him prisoner to Constantinople, and became, not only lord of Trebisonda
but also of Sinopi and the rest of the towns and cities, that the Christians
possessyd with in the country of Pontho, when he had thus done, he returned
with his Navy into Gretia, the year following, he put his Navy again to the
sea, and sent it to assail the Isle of Mitelleme in the old world called
Lesbo, which was possessyd at that time by the lord frauneys Gattalusio a
Genouese borne. When he had brought his Navy thither, and landed his people in
short time he took all the fortes, and towns of the Isle, and then he brought
his army ye to City of Mitilleme, wherein was the lord of the Isle with all
his power, Mitilen^ besegyd and taken by Mahometh.
the Turckes beseged the town both by sea and land, in such sort, that they
of the town could nether receive into the town, men ne yet victuales, then
planted they their batteries, and in short space made an exceeding great
breach, and yet they continued it day and night without gyuing any time at
all to the defendantes to repose them, and after many assaults given, the
defendantes were maruelously consumed by death, and hurtes: whereupon they
assailed it round with all their force, and in the end entered (after long
fight) the repares that the defendants had made, and first became masters of
the walls, and then of the city, they put all the men of the town to the
sword except the lord of the Isle whom they took prisoner, they deflored all
the Virgins of the town, and forced all the women of the same, they spoiled
the town of all ye riches that therein was, and they left nothing nether
sacred ne yet profane undefiled and in this sort they obtained an exceeding
rich spoil, both of treasure and prisoners of all kinds, and ages, which
they lad with Gatalusio their lord, to Constantinople and sold them in their
marcketes (by companies like herdes of swyne (for slaves, a piteouse spectacle

the Isle of Scio did apartaine) Manoesy Tributa. ries to the Turcke.
in ye right of their ancestors, who at their own charges wanne it
notwithstanding they did owe sertaine homage to the city of Genoa of the
which, they were citizenes, when they understood of the loss of Mitilene
fearing lest the victoriouse Navy should be employed against the^, thought it
good to make the matter suer, whereupon, they sent an ambassade to Mahometh, and
agreed to give him yearly ten thousand ducates in the name of tribute, and thus
committed them selves to his protection. When the Venetianes understood of ye
taking of Morea, the loss of Mitilene and Trebisonda, Late wise
they began to be in doubt of their Isles and towns that they possessyd in
Gretia, and saw then their own folly in that, Nota.
that they had not in the beginning aided those princes and people, but
suffered them to be denoured, one after an other, and Mahometh to possess their
states and contreis, whereupon, they thought it better to assail, then to be
assailed, and therefore prevented the enemy, being in good hope that the popes
enterprise should go forewarde, and take good effect, by means whereof,
Mahometh should have ynought to do, to defend his own dominions, and
contreys, Wars between the venetianes and the Turckes.
whereupon they put to the sea a great Navy of Galleys of diverse ordres of
ores, and many great ships in whom they bestowed agreate number, both of
fotemen and horsemen Italians, and so sailed on toward the Archipelago or
myddle sea, and when they had landed their people in Morea, the first thing
that they took in hand, was to make again the wall of Esmilia and to make it
as strong as they could, after that they marched on with their army to y^
city of Corintho and besegid it both by sea and land, when Mahomethe was
aduertized of the arriualle of the venetianes, and of the great danger that
Corintho was in, he put his Navy to the sea and embarked his army, gyuinge
them commission to haste with all celeritie toward Corintho as soon as the
infidele army was landed in Morea, they assailed forth with the wall of
Esmilia, Esmylya.
and laid their batteries to it, whereupon the Christianes not being able to
stand to the defense thereof, gave it over to the enemies and retired to their
camp the which as soon as the Turckes Captains espied, they forth with cut
through the wall, and entered, marching on with their army toward the
enemy, who refused not ye battle but marched also toward them and without
delaie joined with them in battle, Battle between the venetianes and the
Turcke.
which contynuinge for the space of certain hours, was both terrible, and
bloddie and in the end the Christianes being werie, and not able to endure the
force of the Turckes (who contynually supplied y^ fight with fresh and
reposed squadrones in the place of the weried, and spoiled) began to retire
toward the sea, thincking to save them selves by fleing to their Navy, and
brake their order, and being followed by the Turckes horsemen, were slain, and
taken in great number, and lost also their artillery, munition and cariadge,
and in this sort, was the sege of Corintho raised, and then with great triumph
returned the infidels to Constantinople, leading with them the Christian
prisoners enchayned, and as soon as they were there arrived, they caused a
great number of them with great cruelty to be cut in pieces in the market
place, the rest they lad with them, like flocks of sheep through the Towns
of Asia, and sold them for slaves in every place y^ they passed by. The
Venetianes being greatly discoraged through this defeicte and fearing that
they had procured to them the Turcks indignation by y^ means of the soodden
wars which they had made upon him whereupon they addressed them forth with to
the pope, ^ sent their Orators to Rome, to desire and solicit the pope with
great instance, to make wars upon the Turcke, and to haste the journey into
Asia, declaring v^ to him that if he deferred the time, Mahometh should have
good commodity to take all the towns in Greti^ that were in the possession of
the Christians, and cheifely those that were upon the sea coaste by means where
of they should not be able to maintain any Navy up on that coaste, having
no havens nor goolfes at their commandment, the Bishop although he knew
that to be true which they said being very sorry to consider the peril wherein
they were, did put them in good hope that he would acomplishe their request,
although in deed, he saw no means how to do it, for that he could get no
aid from beyond the mountains, for as much, as the case eas such, that after
that the council of Mantoa was licensyd, all Europe was filled with division,
and private innimities, and regarded not at al, the good determination of ye
general enterprise against the infidels agreed upon at Mantoa, for in Almanie
there was wars between the Duke of Bauera, Europe filled with wars.
and the Saxons, and either part employed their frindes, and by that mean
drew to them the greatest part of Almanie. The Emperor pretending to succide
in the royal seat of Hungary, his Nephewe Laodislao king thereof, would not
endure that the king Mathias should possess it, wherefore he employed all his
force against y^ Hungarianes. The Frenshe king being much offendyd with the
pope for that he crowned, and admitted to the seat Royal of Pulia the king
Ferdinando a bastard son of the king Alsonso, not regrading at all the right
that the king Renato of Angio his cosen had to the before said kingdom, did
not only refuse to send aid to this general enterprise: but threatened the
pope continually to send his army into Pulia. The Inglishe men, which were
never wont to fail in any enterprise against the enemies of the Christian
faith, being sore vexed with Civil wars, having two kings living at once
which sought no means, but only how the one might chase the other out of
the realm, the people being divided, ye one part favoring henry their
ancient king, the which by Edward, Duke of york was chased out of the
Realm, the other sort sought ^o maintain the party of king Edward unto
whom ye Duke of Burgonie gave aid, and Loise the Frenshe king aided the king
henry, whose son with y^ count of warwick entered England, and gave battle
to king Edward. In Spain the city of Burcelona in the con^rey of Catalonia
revolted against their prince, the king John of Arragone king of Navarre, and
were aided and maintained against him by the king of Castilia, on the other
side the Frenshe king gave aid to the king John of Navarre to recover again
his right who was encamped before the city with his power, and for y^ that
god would not that any part of Europe should be at quiet, he sturred up in
France the Duke John, son to the king Renato of Angio, who passed into y^
kinge^ome of Naples with a great Navy of Galleys and ships, and while he
was there, he so practiced, that he diui^ed the whole force of Italy the one
part thereof fauo^ing the house of Angio and the other part the house of
Aragone, so, that in those wars: all the nobility of y^ kingdom, as men
out of their wits divided them selves into sondrie factiones, not only they
of the kingdom, but of all the states of Itali^. The Venetianes, and
Genoueses, with diverse other princes favored the par^ie of the Duke John. The
pope and the Duke of Myl^ane, discovered them selves in the favor of y^ king
Fer^ante, and sent him diverse bands both of horsemen, and ^oteme^. The
florentines, although generally they were ^nclyned to favor the Frenshe
party by means of ^ league made between the house of Angio and them, and were
bound to the king Renato, yet notwithstanding being governed by the appetite
of their rules, they were persuaded that it was not good for them to take part
in so gerat wars, and to enter into new charges, but to stand as newtres,
but in deed, they showed them selves fryndes to the house of Aragone, whereupon
forthwith: they cassed many of their bands, with the lord Simonetto, one of
their chief conductours, and permitted them to serve the king ferrante, and
thus secretly they aided the party of Arragone, whereupon, the pope being
empeched by means of these emotions determined to defer the purposed
enterprise against the Turcke until such time as the deuisiones and tumultes
of Europe and chiefly those of Italy were appeased whereupon he departed from
Siena and rteorned to Rome purposing to acquiet and redress the temporal
state of his church, which was maruelously disordered and shaken by means of
the aforesaid division, he began at Viterbo which was then holden by one of the
factions, and by his authority called home again those that for fear were
fled, and reconciled them with their adversaries and in this sort left them al
in good peace under his protection and governance after this he sent his
legates into ye duchy and into the country of Marca and finding these
provinces infected with the before said Maladye, one city being in arms
against the other and diverse city being divided in them selves, the one
part of the City against the other some were of the Colonese factino and other
of the Orsius and now had the one the better and then the other, till at the
last by the great providence and industry of the legates, they were all
pacified and left under the regiment and governance of the popes officers in
perfect tranquiletie and quietness: after this when the pope beheld y^
miserable state of his country and the great spoil thereof that had been made
through the Civil disorder and wars y^ had been among them, by means
whereof they had consumed a great number of their people, and also were brought
into extreme poverty, it was a great grief unto him, and then gave he order
that they which governed should by common consent restore again to their
first degres and honors the orders of gentlemen and the twelve, and should
call from exile certain worthy citizens, and in this sort he enlarged his
regiment and state, and left it quiet and in peace till at the last in the
contre of Marca, their arose the lord Sigismonde Malisti, and gatherid an army
and encountered with the popes Legate and gave him a great ouerthroe by means
whereof all the Contre of Marca was in arms and followed this Sigismonde,
whereupon the pope sent thither his legate the Cardinal of Tiano apistolese
borne with the Duke of Vrbine and the lord Napoleone Orsino, which gave to
Sigismondo such an ouerthroe not far from Sinigaglia, that they enforced him
to leave y^ feelde and so repressed his fury y^ in a short time they took from
him Sinigaglia, Fano, and a good piece of the county of Arrimino, and after
diverse encou^tres in the kingdom of Naples, the kings Ferrante remained
victoriouse, and the Duke John with his Angionme faction was returned into
France, and when Ferrante was well established in his kingdom, and that the
pope saw him self delivered of two great wars, and had established the
temporal state of his church and brought it to perfect quietness, he then
called again to mind y^ enterprise of Asia, against the Turckes and being
confederate with the king of Hungary, the Duke of Borgonie and with the state
of Venise, they then consulted and determined in what sort they would make
these wars, the pope sent forth his letters with his messagers to all the
princes of Christendom, exhorting and requiring the^ to come and aid him in
this journey against the infidels, and appointed the time, that in the year of
our health a thousand four hundred threscore and four the xv. day of June,
all the army should be ready in y^ contre of Marca, not far from Ancona,
where they should find the Navy reddie to receive, both y^ popes hollynes
and them also who would in person go, to so glorious an enterprise, and when
the pope had thus determined, he passed on for the recovery of his health to
Siena, meaning the next spring following according to his custume to go to the
baines at Petriuolo: and when he was there arrived, news came to him that
Philippe Duke of Borgonie (seeing the great tumultes and emotiones that were in
France between the king and the nobility) would provide for y^ security of
his state wherefore he would not deal at all in the enterprise against the
Turckes but employed all his force under the conducte of his son Charles
against Loys king of France whereupon he changed his purposed journey to ye
baines, and returned to Rome where he was maruelously troubled with the gout
and also with the fever whereupon he was enforced to contynewe there a long
time contrary to his determination which was the cause that he could not be
at his day appointed at Ancona: according to his proclamation that he had made
of the journey in the mean time their came to Rome severally ambassadors, both
from Loys the frenshe king and also from Philippe Duke of Borgonie, excusing
either of them for so much as being troubled with domesticale wars they
could not at that time give any aid toward the journey, when the pope was
some thing recouerid of his disease, he called the Cardinales to the
Consystorie, and there discoursed of the heresies that then were in ye kingdom
of Bohemia, whereupon he granted forth his citationes, and then with his
Cardinales and other Cortigianes he departed from Rome and passed through y^
contre of Sabina into the Duchy, and from thence into the contre of Marca and
being carried in a horse lytter (in consyderation of his weakness) passed so on
to Ancona and as he passed on y^ way he met with a great number of men ^^ich
came out of Almanie, France, and Spain, of t^^ir own good wills, to go
that journey against the infidels, of the which number the greatest part, and
chiefly those that came out of Almanie brought with them no provision
wherewith to sustain them in that journey, The popes liberality.
whereupon, he gave them his been diction, and absolved them clearly from all the offenses that ever they committed, until that present, and in this sort
licensid them to return into their countries again, and being in Ancona he
looked for ye Navy which was made ready in diverse places of Italy, and should
repare thither to unite them selves and also he looked for the Duke of Venise
with his armata to arrive there in this mean time the fever did so grow and
encreas up on him, that the same day that the Duke of venise landed in ye
haven of Ancona accompanied with xii. galleys and a great number of gentlemen
he yielded up his soul^ to god, which was the year of our health. Pio the second
pope of that name died.
1464. and the ^iiii of August, immediately upon his death y^ Cardinales
returned to Rome to elect a new Bishop, and the Duke of Venise returned
again to Venise with his armata and in this sort the Navy was divided and
all the preparation that was made for the journey into Asia, was but in vain,
and when the Duke was come home to Venise, the Seniours thought it not good to
loss all that which they had bestoed in furnishing their Navy and their army
where upon they made Nicholas de Canale, general of their Navy and sent him
with their Navy to the sea, who sailed alonge the coaste of Gretia, and landed
in Romania and sacqued the City of Euia and took out of it a great spoil and
after that, Enia taken by the venetians.
he entered into the golfe of Patrasso which is in Morea, and there landed, and
being encountered with the Turckes that were there left for the guard of the
conutrey, he flewe two thousand upon the place, and gave them a great
ouerthowe he took the Castle of Vesticio fortified it and left in it a
garnison of his people, there succided pio y^ second, Paulo the second, a
venetian borne, who seemed not to abandone the enterprise that his predecessor
had determined against the infidels, whereupon he joined in league with the
Venetianes against y^ Turckes which had made there courses into Almaignie and
had taken a way a great proye both of men and cattle, Mahometh determining
always to banishe the Christians out of Gretia, Great preparation of Mahometh.

where of they say there were. 200. gaylles and fustes, and when he had
embarcked a great number of horse men and footmen, he sent them under the
governance and co^ducte of Mahometh, Bassa to the seege of the city of Calcide
which stands in the Isle that was anciently called Euboica and now is called
Negroponte, Euboica anciently called Negroponte beseged by the Turck^s.
as soon as the Bassa was arrived at the Isle, he landed his people and beseged
the town and planted his batteries, and when the had continued it for a long
space, they had done in manner nothing, for they of the town be haued them so
well that whatsoever breach was made in the day, they made it up in y^ night,
and rampared it in as great strengte as before, wherefore it seemed to Mahomethe
that his enterprise took no great effect, and that his batteries did not
greatly prevail, he sent for a new supply of men and went thither in person
and when he beheld the great breaches that his men had made he thought that
they might easily enter ye town: whereupon he embattailed all his army, and
appointed certain Colonelles with their regimentes to the assault and
appointed to every of them the place that he with his regyment should assail,
when he had thus done, he called all the captains of his army unto him
perswadinge them with goodly words to show them selves worthy of that good
opinion that he had of them, and that they would approach the town with
purpose that dai to be victoriouse or else there to end their lives, and also
he gave unto them the whole spoil of the town, more over he promised to such
as should first enter the town great rewards, with these exhortaciones and
promises, he did greatly incorage his soldiers, whereupon he continued his
batteries with great fury, for a space, with the noise where of and with that
of drommes, trompettes, and cornetts the air, the earth, and the sea, did
tremble, Mahometh gave order that when the Colonelles of ye first assauite had
continued it for a certain time, Mahometh a noble Captain.
that then other C^lonelles with their regymentes should take their place and
so contynewe the assault, by the which means, he had always fresh
assaylantes, and thus continued he the assault without intermission two days
and two nights, and suffered not them of the town in any wise to repose, and
although that the Christians who were appointed to ye guard of the town
defended it with rare virtue, and noble minds, and used their fires artificial
shot, great stones, and casting spears, wherewith they had flayne a great
number of the infydels, and when the infydels had twyse chased them from the
breach and had entered the town, the Christians serred them selves and charged
them and for with chased them fort he of the town making great slaughter of
the aforesaid enemies but in the end, for as much as the greatest part of the
defendantes were stain and the rest being but few in number and greatly
weried with the long fight that they had endured, and being consumed in this
sort not being a sufficient number to defend the whole circuit of the town,

they plucked the skyn over their ears, and some others they cut a sonder in
the midst in such sort: that all ye streets of Negroponte were filled with
deed boddies and washed with christian blood and after that they took all the
inhabitants of ye town as well men as women that then were living, and made
them slaves and when they had thus done, they began to sack the town both
houses and Churches, in such sort as they left nothing in the town, such
as were fled into the sort made an appointement with him, it was agreed that
they should depart safely with their lives and goods whereupon they delivered
the Castle before that any one piece was planted against it, in deed the Turcke
held not his promise with them, for in deed be put them all to ye sword. And
in this sort ye famous Isle of Eboica about the midst of ye monethe of June
was taken by Mahometh and when Nicholas de Canale was returned to Venise the
Senate laid to his charge ye Negr^ponte taken by Mahometh.
he had not done his duty in that that he had not succored Negroponte,
which he moughte have done if he had durs^^, as they said, whereupon they
laid him in chains and then condemned him to perpetual exile, and created
in his place their general Petro Moranigo, who departed out of the golfe with
a Navy of lx. galleys and xx. great ships and sailed on toward ye Isle and
spoiled and destroyed all the sea coast of Gretia, and Asia. In those days the
Genoueses fearinge least the Turcke should bring his army to the City of
Capha, which stands beyond the strait of Bosporo upon the sea called
Eusino which at this day is called the greater sea, Pon^o Eusino.
and seeing no way how they might send any succors thither, for so much as
the Turcke had his Castles very well furnished which he had builded upon both
the straites, and they thought it a matter impossyble to send any bands
thither by land, considering that the journey was great and the passage
perilous, through the contreys of so many barbarous nations, and being in
this great extremity, there was a Constable which offerid for a certain sum
of money to go into Caffa with his band which was of the numebr of. 150.

whereupon he took his journey and passed through ye country of Friule in
Italy, and after through the country of Hungary, then through Polonia, from
thence through Scithia, which at this day is called Tartarie, and in this
sort conueid him self into Caffa while these things were doing, Mahomethe
had put Practice of Mahometh.

alredie framed certain practizes with the Candiottes that he should be
received by them whensoever that he came, and understanding the Venetian
armata to be alredie arrived there and that the chief conspiratours were taken
and put to death, immediately he changed purpose and directed his Navy into
the greater sea, and commanded a great number of horsemen to pass into
Valachia and to spoil and destroy there what they could, as they were doing
of this, he beseged the City of Caffa both by sea and land, Caffa beseged.
he planted his batteries, and began to tormente them ercidingly with his
shot, the Genoueses which there were, who were many in number and possessid
great riches, both of merchandise and treasour, who being amassed by this
sodden assault, and seeing them selves out of al hope of succor, after that
they had defendyd it nobly by the space of certain days, thought it not good
there to loose both life and goods, whereupon they practiced an appointement.
And agreing upon the same delivered the town upon condition, Caffa yielded to

they took from thence many of the principal families with that they had and
sent them to Constantinople, and constrained them there to dwell and made the
Citizens of Caffa his tributaries and forbadde them upon pains of life to
depart from thence, or to send away from thence any of their substance or
riches. And in this sort the City of Caffa (standing upon the sea called
Eusino) which had been of a long time possessyd by the Genoueses, became
subject to the tiranouse governance of the Turckes, when Mahomethe acordinge
to his determination had clearly banished ye Christians out of Gretia, he
levied an army of a hundred thousand men, and sent them into Albania to
beseege the town of Scutarie, Scutar^ besegyd by Mahometh.
which stands near the river called Buiana (not far from the ancient City
Appollonia) which then was possessyd by the Venetianes and furnished with
diverse Constables and bands of Italianes both fotemen and horsemen, when the
infydels were comne before Scutarie, they enuironned the town with their
camp, and planted their batteries contynewing them day and night with out
cease with maruelouse fury, and they of the town did with no less courage
defend them selves. And through the noble minds and discipline, of the
Christian Captains, all the Turckes preparationes and attemptes were renderid
vain and of none effect, they were enforced to consume all that summer in
vain before that town, and when the Autoume drew on, the Turckes through
the sharpnes of the air, and ye pestilent winds which bette upon them
contynually through the mouth of the river fell into diseases in such sort,
as they were enforced to abandone the seege and to with draw themselves into
those mountains of Macedonia that were nearest to Scutarie, in intention to
return thither again as soon as the infection of the air should cease, and
whileste they wintred there the lieutenante of the army took with him certain
of his chosen bands and made wars upon John Gernoi John Gernoi.
(which possessyd diverse towns in the mountains of Albania) he took from
him the town of Sabiaco, and when he had by force taken the City of Diuastro
and Lisso, he put to death all the men that were within them with sondrie
torments and tiranouse deaths, he made the women and children slaves which he
there found, and went in ye spring following, again to the sege of Scutarie,
although he were out of hope to take it by force, yet he thought in time
through famine to possess it, whereupon he cnnironned the town with his camp
in such sort, ye they could nether send forth to their fryndes any advertise
meant, nor receive from them any in telligence or relife on the other side the
Venetianes could never persuade the pope to abstain from the wars which he
had begone in Tuscane against the Florentynes, and to unite his force with
them and so to enuade the infidels, for so much as they alone without the
aid of any other, Great charges of the Venetianes.
had borne the whole charge of the wars in Gretia by the space of. 25. years,
being with the intolerable charges thereof weried, for that they were enforced to
hold contynually a great Navy upon the Coaste of Gretia, for the defense of
such fortes and towns as they possessed there, and beside that they did
contribute very largely to ye pope for y^ manitenance of his wars in Tuscane
against the Florentines, whereupon like wise men they Judges, that if the
Florentine should happen to be subdued, the enemy moughte also easyly take
from them all such places as they possessyd in the maine land of Italy,
wherefore they thought it good to disborde^ them selves of so great a charge,
and by means of certain Greeks, practiced an appointemente with Mahometh,
and concluded a peace with him for many years, upon condition that for his
honors sake, Scutari given to Mahometh.
they should be contented to deliver into his hands the town of Scutarie and
besides that, that they should pay unto him in consideration of the charges
that he had been at acording to the entreatie had between his and their
commissioners two hundred thousand ducates within the space of two years then
next ensuing, and in consideration of this, he gave unto them she liberty to
have in Constantino ple a Bailo, Bailo an ambassador lidger that has power

when Mahometh had in this sort concluded peace with the Venetianes: he divided
his army, sending the one part thereof into Hungary, which made a great
course there, and the other which was his Navy he sent to land in Pulia,
where they raised a great proie both of men and catell, after that he made

with a great power and when he had landed his people (which was ye xxi. of
May, in the year of our health M.CCCC.lxxiiii) he proied and spoiled all the
circuit of the Isle, which is a hundred and twenty miles, Rodes by
Mahohometh be segid.
and when he had thus done, he presented his camp to the City of Rhodes, and
assailed it both by sea and land, planted his batteries and ceased them
nether day ne night, the great master of ye order, with his kinghtes and
soldiers and other Christianes that there were, defended the town so nobly
and repaired it with such industry as it was a marvel, they salied forth
daiely and scaramoshed with them the enemies used all speed possible with their
battery contynning it without cease both day and night, gyuinge them of
the town no time at all to repose, but held them contynually occupied both
day and night with scaramoshes, alarmes, and false assaults, notwith
standing that, they of the town repulsed them with great assurance, and slew
many of them, and also they lost of there is some time, notwithstanding their
small loss was more prejudicial unto them (forthat they had not means to be
supplied with new men) then the great number of the party of the assailants
which were slain was to them of ye camp, the number of them of y^ of town
consumed and decayed daily, when the Mahometistes had in this sort continued
their seege by the space of two months, it seemed to the Captains and Bascias
y^ they had made sufficient breach whereupon. they thought them selves suer of
the town whenseuer they should assail it, and upon this they made ready for
the assulte all kind of necessaries and determined to give y^ assault
whereupon they divided their people, and gave order to their Coloneles, who
should begin the assault, and which they were that should from time to time
supply it, when this was done they put their peopel in order and approached the
town the. Rodes assaulted the xx. of July
xx. day of Iulye in y^ break of the day with great noyses and cries and
they employed their greatest force upon that side of ye town where the tower
stood that was called Giudeca, which was so flat betyn to the ground that
the spoil and roobishe thereof so filled the dyke that men moughte ea syly
clyme up to ye heighte of the breach, as soon as this was known, they that
were without began ye assault placed their shot to beat their defenses and
breaches to the end they should not be able to stand to the defense of their
breaches, and immediately entered the dike and as they were coming up the
breaches, they were encountered by them of the town with great Valiantize who
appeared in all places where need was throwing out upon their enemies
continually great stones pieces of timber castinge speres and with their shot
they did maruelously anoie them, they th rewe them down contynually from the
walls making excidinge great flaughter of them notwithstanding the Turckes
continued still the assault and renewed it with fresh bands from time to
time, in such sort as the fight continued still without cease and was
maintyned a great piece of ye day with great assurance on both sides, but in
the end ye Turckes through their great number, and also through their means
which they used, to supply ye fight with fresh regimentes and bands,
prevailed murche and in the end certain thousands of ye Turcks serred them
selves and charged with their hole force, up on the Christians, which not
being able to endure the force of their enemies, were constreyned to abandone
the breaches, whereupon by little and little they retired them selves toward the
market, and the enemies entered the town and followed them on well toward that
place Giudeca, and soddenly they stated (not being charged at all by the
enemies) and showed such a token of fearefulnes that it seemed they trembled
with fear, the cause thereof was not certainly known although there were some
found, and chiefly certain sons of one Ge^tile. de Bardi a Florentine,
which affirmed that they saw step forth before them, Strange ad^enture
a man on horseback armed at all pieces with an upper garment of white upon his
armor, which when the enemies saw, they were abashed and durst not deal
with him, the Christians perceuing the cowardice of the enemies, called again
to them noble minds, and put them selves again in order and then charged the
enemies, which fled from the Christians, abandoned the town, leuing ye
victory at that time to their enemies, and therefore that day they of the town
were preserved (contrary to their own expectation) being clearly out of
hope of their health and thereupon comforted them selves and all they that were
in the town both men women and children laid to their hands for the
reparing of the breaches for the space of certain days, till that they had
made it somewhat defensyble the enemies on the other side endeavored them selves
by all means possible to supply their bands and to furnishe them with all
kind of necessaries for to assail the town again. In this mean time the
king Ferrante The christian zeal of the king Ferrante.
dispaiched from Naples two great ships with commision to sail toward the
coaste of Gretia and to succor the town of Rhodes, which ships being well
furnished with men, set sail and sailed toward ye coaste of Gretia, and
the.xxx. of Iulye they arrived within the sight of Rhodes, and holdinge on
their course toward the haven mouth the lesser of the two passed with filled
sails, through ye midst of ye turckishe Nanie, which came and assailed him
thincking to deny him ye passage as he passed through their Navy he slew
many of the infideles and so arrived safely with his ship and people in the
haven of Rhodes, where he was received by the^ of the town with incredible
joy, Franzino pastore that commanded the other ship seeing the peril that
the other ship (that was arrived at ye town) had been in, was discoraged and
durst not follow but made about from the Navy of the enemies to the sea
again toward the midst of the chanel, the next morning being enforced by
his soldiers and mariners, he set sail again having a prosperous wind and
made toward the haven, and soddenly the wind failed him, by means where of he
could make no sail but lay still in great danger of the enemy, who saying
the ship encaulmed, weid their ancres and made toward her with all their Navy,
determinig to burn her and loded a ^alandre with pytche and towe meaning that
whilst certain of their galleis did assail her, others should set her on
fire, whereupon they tawed the palandre after them at ye sterme of some of their
galleys, in their mean time the wind arose and began to blow a handsome
gale, not without a manifest token of the favor of God whereupon the Captain
commanded to pack on all the sails and directed his course full upon the
Navy of the infidels and sailed on with great fury passing through the
midst of them arrived safely in the haven, to the great content as well of
those of his ship, as of them of the town, for the which good hap they of
the^ town triumphed for the space of two days shewinge signs of great joy
in ringinge of belles making of bonefires shoring of artillery and such like,
whereupon ye Turckes began to despair of the taking of the town thincking
that the two ships had brought far greater number of men and monition then
in deed they did. Then began they to attempt the town but slenderly and
devised rather how to abandone the seege then otherwise, and finally conveyed
their artillery and monitions aborde their Navy and abandoned there seege the
xvii. of Auguste, and sailed toward the strait of Gallipoli, Rhodes de
lyuered from the seege of the enemies.
and in this sort was Rhodes delpuered from the seege of the Turckes. In this
mean time Mahometh sent Acomath one of his Bascias with a Navy of an hundred
sails (being furnished with xv. thousand soldiers) toward the Golfe and
upon the sodden he assailed the Isle called Saint Maura, anciently called
Eucadia, and took it, and from thence he passed on toward Cephalonia, and
Hiacinto, ^ in short space became lord of them both, and he determined to
sail back again by the Golfe and from thence into Pulia, in intention as
diverse men thought but to land and spoil the country, consideringe the great
riches y^ ^here was both of men, treasure, and catell, and chief ^y for that
he had intelligence that ye country was left without guard of men of war,
and also that the king was where he could not annoie him, when the Navy of
the infideles was come within fight of that point of ^ande that the Italianes
call Cauo de Ottranto, The head of Ottranto.
they made toward the land and came into the haven of Ot ^ranto, and saying
them of the town to make no resys^ance, but being afearde: showed most
shameful Cowardice, and shut the gates of the City holding them ^clues
within the walls thereof and durst not once to ^okevpon him in the feelde,
whereupon he landed his men ^andhorses, and first he proied all the contre
about Ot ^tranto and then spoiled it and brought to his ships ^an excyding
great proie, Ottranto beseegyd.
without any resystance at all, whereupon he was the more bold (presuminge
upon the Cowardice of them of the town) and thought to attempt to take it,
whereupon he fortified his camp to defend him from outward invasion and
environed the town in such sort, that they of the town could nether
receive in, nor send forth any thing out of it, when this was done he
planted his batteries and began to batter the walls and tormented them with
his batteries day and night, he arrived at Ottranto xxviii. of Iulye, in the
year of our health M.CCCC.lxxix, and the xi. day of Auguste next following he
gave an assanlte to the town, and chased them of the town from the breaches
and took the town by force, and master frauncis Zurlo who was there, for the
king being fled with the Arche bishop of the City into the Cathedrale
church where unto all the the chief of the city were fled also for succor,
was with the rest cut in pieces. and all the rest of the people, with the
women and children were sent into Gretia to be sold as slaves, when the king
Fer rante understood that the Turckes were arrived at Ottranto, he caused to
arm all the ships and gallyes of the realm, with maruelouse celeritie, and
sent also for his son the Duke of Calabria, into Toscane, who at that time
had made peace with the Florentynes and was in Siena making great preparation
for solemn Iustes and triumphs, to celebrate the feast of our lady not
without great suspicion ye he was procured by diverse noughtie Citizenes of
his faction, that day to take the city and to usurp it, when the Duke had
receauid this commandment from his father; he departed forth with out of
Tuscane with all his army, and marching on with great speed brought them into
Pulia and entertained also, as many fotemen as he could get and appointed
them to Captains, he gathered together also, all the men at arms and horsemen
of all sorts that were in the kingdom, and then marched on with his army and
encamped not far from Ottranto, the Navy was made ready with maruelouse
expedition by the great industris of the county of Sarni, and was alredie

the Duke of Calabria fortified his camp with strong rampares and deep dikes,
douting the fury of the enemy, and durst not to approach the town so near,
as he moughte lay battery unto it, but lay some things farther of and
presented him self daily to the town and they of the town sorted forth
contynually and scaramoshed with him and often times repulsed them and made
great slaughter of them. And one day they attached a scaramoshe, and it was
maintained in such order from time to time with fresh bands y^ the whole
power of the camp was at it, and it grew to a battle and continued by the
space of certain hours there was great slaughter, and it was fought with great
assurance on both sides, in that battle was slain the county Iulio de
Aquaiua, one of the kings chief conductours of his men at arms, the fotemen
being discoraged fled, Loys de Capua being general of them, with certain of
his company (thincking to save him self) fled to a certain tower which was
of some force not far from Ottranto, the Turquyshe horsemen followed him, and
when they came to the tower they deter mined to assail it, and prepared pitche
and towe and other necessaries to let fire unto it, the before said Loys being
destrous to live, yeldyd him with all his company to the Turckes, and was
carried prisoner into Ottranto, and after this there was daily scaramoch between
them of ye camp and ye town, but they of ye camp had always ye worse, there
was slain before Ottranto Mattheo de Capua, ye count Iulio de Pisa and diverse
other Captains and officers of ye Italian army, ye king because he would make
the journey the more famous went with his court to Barletta, he sent for aid to
al ye Christian princes ye king of Hungary Mathia, sent him a Colonel with a
regiment of eight hundred Hu^garian horsemen, ye king of Portugale sent him
many Carauelles, well armed and furnished, there came also out of Spain,
Arragone and Catalona, many gentlemen of their own charges and good will, to
aid the king, and notwstanding these aides ye Turckes dismayed not at all,
but assured them selves and fortisied their town, and did not only defend it
but went forth of ye town daily and scaramoched with ye Christians and slew
many of them and also brought of them to ye town, prisoners. And when they had
thus in vain consumed both ye so^mer and ye Autome winter approached and
constrained them to abandone their seege and to lay them selves in
garnisonnes, in y^ towns nearest about eit, and in y^ same winter ye Navy of
ye Turcks spoiled al ye coaste of Pulia eue^ to ye very mou^te of S. Agnolo,

thereof eight thousand chose^ soldiers, and furnished the^ with al kind of
monitio^ sufficiently for ye space of xviii. months, and then passed on with
his armata to Valona, and from thence he passed by land to Constantinople to

determined to go in person into Natolia to aid his son Batazith, against

MAHOMETHE DIED THE LVI. YEAR of his age in the xxvii. year of his reign, he
left behind him two sons the one named Gemma, ye other Baiazithe. The
Turckishe nation being divided after ye death of Mahomethe, the one part,
especially the nobility favoring Sultan Gemma, and ye Gianizaries the party
of Baiazithe, and therefore immediately upon the death of Mahomethe, the
Gianizzaries marched with all speed to Constantinople, and for so much as
Baiazithe was at that time in Natolia, they took a young son of his named
Corcuthe, and when they had saluted him Emperor, they bare him about through
all the city to show him to the people, Baiazithe the 10. king
and caused them with loud voice to cry the name of Baiazithe who about the
midst of May when he was returned to Constantinople, caused him self to be
saluted and confirmed Emperor, being assured through his maniefolde rewards
and liberality, of the favor and aid of ye Bascias and Gianizzaries, and
being in doubt of his brother Sultan Gemma, He began to se his soldiers
very well furnished, and to provide for his own security, Gemma, departinge
from the confynes of Soria, where he was left by his father to make wars
upon the Soldane, brought his army into the lesser Asia, and when he
understood how ye affairs had passed in Constantinople being out of hope to
enjoy any part of gretia, The determynation of Ge^ma.
he changed his purpose and determined to occupy y^ Empire of the less Asia,
whereupon he conveyed his army into Bithinia: to the City Bursia, which when he
had fortyfied, he determined to call together all the rulers of the people of,
Asia and when he had consulted with them, to send for ye rest of his bands that
were in Asia and to unite them with his army, Note this act.
Baiazithe gathered together all ye old bands of Gretia, and assembled his
army and passed them into Asia and sought his brother Gemma, and met him
upon the plain not far from Bursia, the armies being renged, the battle
was presented, they joined, ye fight continued for a long time and after
great slaughter on both sides, Gemma defeicted.
Baiazithe became master of the feelde, Gemma being broken, and abandoned of
his people, fled, with certain of his trusty fryndes with him to Rhodes, and
the great master of ye religion (fearing lest by holding of him he might
purchase the innimitie of Baiazith and so provoke him to wars) sent him well
guarded with certain ships into France, from whence afterward by
commandment of Innocentio the viii. Bishop of Rome, he was sent to Rome,
and being receauid by the Bishop, had his lodginges appointed in the heighte
of the Palace, and was there for a long time guarded with great diligence the
pope agreed with Baiazithe for a yearly pension of thirty thousand ducates so
to keep him guarded duringe the life natural of Gemma. An offer of the king
Ferrante.
In this mean time the king Ferrante being in Italy receauid Aduertysement of
the death of Mahomethe, and caused it to be declared to those of Ottranto, and
offeryd them (that if they would deliver into his hands the City) he would
set them al safely into Gretia with all such goods and treasure as they had
there. The infideles would in no wise agree to this demand forsomuche as they
knew not whether their lord was dead or not, or else for that they stayed to
se which of the two brethren should be their lord, and whether he would send
them succors or no, being assured that if Acomathe were living he would not
abandone them, nor break promise with them. The Duke of Calabria saying their
perseverance in the promise to Acomathe, did with his camp approach ye town
more near then in the time of Mahomethe he durst do, Ottran^o straytly
besegyd by the Duke of Calabria.
he began to entrenche toward the town, and so from trenche to trenche,
conveyed his people to ye very bancke of the town dyke, and then planted his
batteries, and batterid it for certain days and they determined to give an
assault, whereupon he saw his people furnished with all kind of necessaries and
then divided them into battaylones, and gave order for the beginning and
contynance of the assault, and then commanded the trompettes drommes and
cornetts, to sound to the assault and thereupon began to assail the breaches
with great fury, and in short space became lord of them, and when they
entered the town they found in it such new fortifycation as they were out
of all hope of wynning of it whereupon they retired from the assault with the
loss of many of their most valyante men, after this they attempted new
practizes and agreed with them of the town, that they should safely send
their messagers into Gretia, to understand whether Mahomethe were living or no,
and how the affares passed there, upon this there was a trewes taken for a
certain time, the Captains of Ottranto dispatched their messangers into
Gretia, and when they came there they understood ye Acomathe was in Asia, and
had taken part with Ge^ma, and Baiazithe made ready with great celeritie to
go against the^ in person, where upon they returned to Ottranto and declared
what they understood of the affares of Gretia, whereupon the general with the
Captains consulted, and forasmuch as they saw the state of Turchie so
divided leadinge and mayntaining Civil wars among them selves, and that
Acomathe, in whom was al their trust had declared him self enemy to
Baiazithe and was in Asia, and they being out of hope of al succor entered
again into talk of appointement with y^ Duke of Calabria, and messagers both
went and came on both sides, and at the last with much a do they agreed that
the town should be delyueryd into the Dukes hands, upon condytion that the
king should safely set them in Gretia: with all the substance and artillery
that they presently possessyd there, and in this sort the peace was made, and
the performances of the promise confyrmed by oath and when the king and the
Duke had thus promised, the Turckes delivered the town and receauyd into it,
Promise euel observed.
the Dukes soldiers and delivered unto them the governance of the town, when
this was done, contrary to all promise they held all the chief of y^ Turckes
prisoners, and put a great number of the soldiers into the galleys, and held
them of force all, saving certain of them being men of place, and
circumspect, who would rather commit them selves to the faith of the
Hungarian Cononel, then to the Italianes, when Sultan Baiazithe had
ouerthorowen his brother Gemma and put him to slyghte, and receauid obeisance
of all the state and dominiones of his ancestrous in Asia the less, and had
visited the contre of Pontho Capadotia and other provinces and given order for
the governance of them he co^tynued in Burfia for a certain space: to give
audience to the governors of those provinces of Asia, which were subject unto
him in those parts, where he bare him self so modestly and determined his
causes with such humanity that in the end he obtained great good will of the
people, when he had thus done, be passyd the strait homeward and was receauid
into Constantinople with great pomp, acording to the order of the triu^p
hantes of ye old worlds, he then gave order, and altered, the recepte of his
revenues and customs, without any sparcke of avarice or rapine, and when he
had made a reuewe of his Gianizzaries, Baiazithe encreasyth the number of both
his fortme^ and horsemen
he did not only encre^se the number of his fotemen, but also of his horsemen,
and caused them to be well paid, which was an occasion that they were well
furnished and in good order, for so much as they saw their prince to have a
delight ni them and that he was very liberal unto them. And then began they to
be excellently well mounted their horses richely furnished, them selves and
their wives so^ptuously aparellyd, with clothe of gold, silver, Iuelles and
such like, in sort, that the country was changed from rude and gross
furniture, into somtuouse and magnifique ornaments and deckings. And when he
had bestoed a time in visiting his provinces of Gretia, and was come near to
Ep^rro which is that part of Macedonia that is inhabited by the nation called
Albaneses, from who^ the contrei has yet his name and is called Albania, among
who^ at the death of Sulta^ Mahometh, there arose certain leaders seditioussi
and caused a great part of ye cou^trei to reuolte, who^ by his presence he
agreed, and ye rest be took b^ force and so brought the^ to his devotion, and
before ye he would depart out of that contre, Ambassad from Baiazithe to
Ferrante
he sent to protest to the king Ferrante of Naples, that if he sent him not
his artillery and munitio^ wholli, that was left in Ottranto at the delivery
thereof, with his people and all such substance and treasure of theirs as he
then deteyned contrary to his sworn promise, that then he would make wars
upon him and seek to redress his own cause, through the which message the
king (being sore a ferde) embarcked all his artillery, monition and men, with
all such riches as they there had and caused them to be landed safely at
Valona, after that he lad his army into Romania, and continued with his court
in Andrinople, began to make preparation for the wars against Caromano prince
of the one part of Cilicia, Caromano prince of Cilicia
being desirous to revenge the defeicte that he receauid of him a little before
the death of his father. This Caromano was the second prince of the Turckishe
nation that then possessid any dominion in Asia, and they say that when he
neded, he was able to come to the feelde with xl. thousand armed horsemen, and
his principal state wherein he did reside was in ye for dest part of the
lesser Asia toward Soria, called Cilicia campestre in that part thereof where
the ancient and famous city of Tarso standethe, which is builded upon a plain
and is divided through the midst by the river Cidna and is not far from
the Baie Issico, which is at this day the golfe of Iaza, and he possessed
also in the less Armenia, and Capadotia, those parts that confyne with ye
mount Tauro, when Baiazith had prepared al things mete for the journey he put
his Navy to the sea, embar^ked all his soldiers, The voyage of Baiazithe.
both horsemen and fotemen, and passed then into Asia, and then marched
through Bithi, nia both ye contreis of Frigia, Dardania, Ionia, and M^sia,
Caria, Licia Pamphilia, and finally with his people in order, he entered into
Cilicia campestre, forasmuch as the contre of Cilicia has very large
confines, it is by ancient writers divided into two parts, of the which the
less is called Trachea, and has his sea bancke, or shore, of no great
largenes, it has standinge upon the plain thereof, never a great town, for
that the greatest part of it is of the mount Tauro, and is so barren, y^ it
is not well inhabited the campestre beginning at ye City of Tarso and at
Magnopoli (a City in time paste of great power and fame) stretches out to yt
baie Issico now called the golfe of Iaza, and toward the north it confineth
with Capadotia upon the side of the mount Tauro, when Baiazith was entered with
his army into ye country of Abraham Caromano, who had with great diligence
fortified his towns, looking for his enemies and also he had furnished the
straites of his contre, and to the end he would not be enforced to fight he
encamped always in places of strength and great security, and dwelled with
his people as near the enemy as he moughte. The Turckes being lords of the
feelde went and spoiled and proied all the contre: finalli when Baiazithe had
consumed a great piece of the summer and could by no means provoke the enemy
to battle, he deter mined to besege some of his towns, Tarso besegyd by
Baiazithe
whereupon he went to Tarso, and besegyd it round and planted his batterys and
began to batter the walls, not ceasiing day nor night in such sort that in
short space, he had made so great breach, that he thought it sufficient
whereupon he made redye for the assault and put his men in battle, which
thing when they of the city perceived (refusinge to put them selves in
danger of the loss of both life, and goods) they practiced appointement, and
agreed to deliver him the City upon condition that he should suffer them to
enjoy both life and goods, when Baiazithe was come into the City, he used ye
Citizenes very gently, and would not suffer any of his army to enter into the
town but only those that were appointed to ye guard both of his person and
town, and when the Automne was come on, the sharpnes of the wether was such,
that he could not well hold his people in ye field, Policy of Byiazithe
whereupon he appointed them to lie in Garnisones in the towns there about,
from whence he over ran and spoiled all the country and would not suffer the
subjects of Caromano other to sow and plowe the ground, orels to do any
thing in the feeldes that moughte before their commodity, whereupon they that
dwelled upon the plain were in such distress, that of their own acorde they
revolted from Caromano, for the greatest number, and became subjects to
Baiazithe, when the spring of the year was come, Caromano (consideringe the
inclination of his people and being in fear to be forsaken of his soldiers,
or else to be delivered by them into the hands of Baiazithe) obtain of the
Soldane of Egipte, Caromano aided by the Soldain Caribeio.
Caribeio (a man of much fame and worthiness) a great sum of money and also
certain bands of Arrabianes, he sent into all parts of his dominions for
such aid, as there was to be had, and joined them all with his army, and made
it of as great number as he could, and determined to se how fortune would
favor him and rather to Hazard the battle then to give place to his enemy
and in time to be delivered by his own me^ into the hands of his enemies
whereupon being furnished with all necessaries, he took the feelde, and chose a
place of great strength and apt for the service of horse men, when Baiazithe
understood that the enemey was come to the feelde and in camp, he sent to all
his garnisones commau^dinge them to repare unto him with speed, and with them
to bring their whole furniture, and when he had taken reuewe of them, he
marched to the feelde and put his soldiers in battle, and then marched
toward Caromano, The battle between Baiazithe and Caromano.
and when he came wtin sight of him he sent his vauntgarde toward his enemy
some thing spedyly, to begin the battle, and he in person did conducte the
battle and followed the Vauntgarde, he also was followed by the rierewarde, and
all his bagagers, and when he came where the enemies were, they refused not the
battle, he came toward them in good order and joined with them, and
notwithstanding that the force of Baiazithes people was great, and that a
troop of ten thousand horsemen of his went and serred them selves and with
great fury assailed the enemies, persuading them selves, that in the first
encou^tre they would disorder them, but the Ciliceanes recauid their charge
with great assurance, in such sort, that there was not one of them that gave
one foot of ground to his enemy. After this when they were entremelled, there
began a very brave and blooddie fight, men fell down dead and hurt,
contynally on both sides, and their places were always supplied with fresh
men, and in this sort they continued for the greatest part of the day with
great assurance, nether party gyuinge place to the other, so that it could
not be Judged on which part, the virtorye should light, for the battle
continued doubtefull even to the darcke night, Abraham Caromano showed that
day, of what value he was, for in his order he showed him self a Capten of
great Judgment, and afterward in his fight he showed him self a valiante and
stout soldier, and last of all (by the providence of god his time being at
hand) saying his people to give place, being charged by a great number of his
enmies whose force they were not able to endnre, be thruste on spedilie
toward them with his guard, and a good number of other of his soldiers and
gave in up on them in such sort, that he perced even in to myddest of their
squadrone, and being known by the enemies was by the^ forth with environed,
and charged on every side with such fury, that they slew his horse under
him, where upon he was constrained to fight on foot in the which he behaved
him self so nobly: that with his own hand he slew diverse of those which
assailed him, and in the end through the great loss of his blood which
contynually fell from him: through his diverse and sondrie woondes which he

they were so amazed and discouraged that immediately they dysorderid them seules
and left the fight scatteringe them selves all the the feelde over, hoped to
make flighte their sauetie but being followed by ye Turckyshe horsemen the
greatest number of them were slain and a great part of the rest were taken on
live and delivered to Baiazith, Ripe judgment of Baiazithe.
when he had in this sort obtained so great a victory, he determined
forthewith to use the same, whereupon, he began to occupy the rest of Cilicia
campestre, and marching on over all the country, the cities and fortellezes
yeldyd unto him enerie where as he came without making any resystaunce, and
having in short time brought under his obeisance all that country that
Caromano possessed in Cilicia, he devised then with his Captains what was
best to be done, finally it seemed best in the opinion of every man, first (or
he took in hand to pass the mount Tauro and so to go on to conquer that
which Caromano possyd in the less Armenia and Capadotia) to possess the other
Cilicia called Thrachea to the end to leave no enemy behind the^ ye might
empeche them, whereupon he caused to moostre and pay his men and then gave them
a little time to repose, that done, he united them and sent them toward
Setalia, Setalia.
which is a City in that province then newlye inhabited, a city of great
traffic and maruelously well inhabited by means of the decaie of the trade
that was in Delo, which in time passed was a City of the greatest traffic
of all Asia, and chiefly for the great number of slaves that then were there
boughte, and sold, which were in number in manner infinite, whereof it grew
into proverb, marchantes make your voyage to Delo, and there vnshippe, for
whatsoever is brought thither is ready money, when the traffic of this City
was decayed the whole traffic and trade of merchandise was put over into
Setalia, and through the great repair of merchants it was become the
chief, and best in, habited City of the less Asia, in so much, that the
sea coaste all there about losing his old name, is called the golfe of
Setalia even at this day, upon the which golfe, directly over against the
Isle of Cipres, stands a noble City, Scandaloro.
and a popolouse called Scandoloro, the lord whereof being a Turcke borne. and
all ways in doubt of them has ever ben an enemy to ye house of Ottomano,
and also to Caromano, and confede rate with the great master of Rhodes and
the King of Cipres, did preserve his state until that day standing as a
newter between them both, but when he saw Baiazith come upon him with so
populouse an army upon the sodden, Iudginge him self not of power to witstand
his force, for all the power that he was able to make did not excede the number
of xx. M. men on horsbacke where upon examining him self, he determined to
prove, rather y^ clementie then force of so mighty a prince, and when they had
talked upon certain articles of agreement, Agreement between Baiazithe and the
prince of Scandaloro.
they concluded, that upon condition, that Baiazithe should give him certain
reuenewe in Natolia, he would deliver unto him all his possessyon and dominion
of the country of Cilicia called Trachea, whereupon it came to pass that when
Baiazithe was become lord of both the contreys called Cilicia al yt towns of
the sea coaste from propontide or straicte of Gallipoli even to the confines of
Soria, were under his obeisance so that all was his even from the one to the
other, when Baiazithe was in this sort agreed with the prince of Scandaloro,
and become prince of both the one and other Cilicia, and also of a great part
of the mount Tauro, he continued there until that he had made ye whole: one
governance or province, and appointed unto it for governor, one of his
Bascias, leuing with him for guard thereof, an army sufficient this done he
determined to precide in his enterprise, and to subdue the rest of the state
and possession of Caromano which was in Armenia the lesser, and in Capadotia,
whereupon, he passed the mount Tauro, and descended into the less Armenia and
became lord without any difficulty of all the countres, and towns that
there had been possessyd by Caromano, all the people came and yeldyd them selves
to him of their own a cord, when he had thus done he marched on by the side
of the mount Tauro toward the north and all the people and towns y^ restid of
the Jurisdiction of Caromano came and renderid them selves wholly unto him, and
when he had thus in short time acheuid so great an enterprise he determined to
lead home ward his army, and entered into Licaonia, and in Iconio, and
Tocato, be left his Astatique army in garnison, under ye charg and conducte
of Mustaffa his Bascia, and then he entered into Galatia, and from thence into
Bithinia the nearest way to Bursia, and from thence went down into the Golfe
of Nicomedia, and there embarcked him self with the rest of his army and
sailed toward Romania and there landed with all his people sately, when he had
this done, he took the sea again, with his soldiers of Gretia and sailed on,
Baiazithe returned to Constantinople
and landed in the haven of Constantinople, where he was receauyd of all the
people with exciding great joy, and there took his horse and rode about all the
City and thus with great pomp acording to their custume he went to lodge in
his palace called Seraglio, which stands upon that point, that is called
Cauodi santo Demetrio, being determined in the next spring following to go
again into Cilicia with all his power, to make wars against y^ Soldane,
chiefly for that he had aided Caromano against him, contrary to the order of
a league between them, wherefore he was much offended with the Soldane, The
voyage of Baiazithe against Caromano.
and departed from thence with his court and went to Andrinople, and all that
winter he was occupied in making preparation for that journey, and gave order to
lenie out of all his dominions of Europe new bands. The number of his
artillery which he carried with him, was great, and when ye spring was come,
in the beginning of Apryll, he assemblyd his army, embarcked them and passed,
them in to Asia. And when he had passed through Bithinia and Galatia, he
brought them into licaonia to Iconio, and ioyued them, with his army that he
had left there with Mustaffa his Bascia at his departure from thence, when he
had this done, he entered again into Cilicia toward the mount Tauro and
Armenia, and there receauid aduedtizement, that the Soldane, as soon as he herd
of the death of Caromano, fearing left Baiazithe (being puffed up in pride
through the great victory that he had obtained against Caromano in the
revenge of the aid y^ the Soldane had sent him) should attempt some great
enterprise in Soria, Diadaro, a name of honor appertaini^g always: to the
admiralles of Alexandrie.
whervppon he sent all the Mamalukes that were in his court under the conducte
of the great Diadaro to the confines of Cilicia, acompanied with a great number
of Arrabianes, wherefore Baiazith was some what in doubt what was to do
(considering the great preparation of the enemy) although he were acompained
with an army of well trained soldiers, and had brought with him more, then
one hundred thousand soldiers on horseback beside his guard of Gianizaries,
and other bands of fotemen, yet notwithstanding fearing y^ virtue and
discipline of the Mamalukes, whose name was feared through all Asia, for as
much as they were counted a people invincible in battle wherefore he thought
it good not raishly to try his fortune in battle, nor on the other side, to
show any token of fear whereby he moughte encorage his enemy to deal with
him, but admisedly put his army in order and then marched on toward Tarso,
the Mamalukes being aduertized of the Turckes coming toward them thought it
not good to tarry and suffer them to enter Soria, but marched toward them to
mete them upon the way and when they were entered Cilicia, marchinge toward
the Turcks (of whom they made small aco^pte) approchinge near unto Tarso, as soon as they came within syghte of them, they put them selves in battle and
marched on toward them, when Baiazith beheld ye coming of his enemies he
also presented his people embattailed and as soon as the Mamalukes came any
thing near unto them, Note this battle between Baiazithe and the great
Diadaro Admiral of Alexandri^
Woute deferringe of time, the great Diadar^ advanced him self with
asquadrone of xv. thousand horsemen, when the battayles were joined, he gave
in upon the Turckes with such force, that not wythstandinge they received the
charge (being well serred) and prepared with great assurance, and gave to
their enemies no place at all, yet for all that they had much to do to
preserve their order, that the Mamalukes had not broken it, and after this when
they approached the one the others squadrones they were so joined that they
could use no long weapon but were driven to use there Scimitarres, and so
continued they in so streyte order fighting with great assurance for a long
time, y^ no man could see of either side, any advantage, and Baiazithe
although there were far greater slaughter of his people then of the
Mamalukes and Arrabianes, yet did he always supply his weried and spoiled,
squadrones with new and fresh bands and having far greater number of
soldiers then the Diadaro had, he continued the fight in this order from the
myddaye, till after the go ing down of the sone, whereupon the great Diadaro
determined to use all force possible to the end y^ the night should not
sonder them without victory, The great diadaro an excellent Captain
whereupon he chose out of his, a number of soldiers in whom he had great
trust and when they were some what reposed he renged them in battle very
closely and then ladde them in person and charged the Turckes again with such
force that he thought verily in that charge to disorder them, but
notwithstanding that the Turckes received the charge with great difficulty,
yet they maintained their order still and brake not, and although that they in
diverse places, making head to the enemy they defendyd them selves but
slenderly and were in manner ready to break, yet Baiazithe through his good
order relyued them in such sort with his presence and his reposed guard of
Gianizaries, that he encoraged his people, Good providence of Baiazithe
renewed the fight and repulsed some what the Mamalukes, and fearing that if
his people should be charged again by the Mamalukes, he should not be able to
maintain their order, whereupon he thought it good to prevent this mischeife,
and with all his force to charge the enemy, and then retiring by little and
little to abandone the fight, thincking in this forte to give place and to a
noid the loss of his whole army, rather then to make good the place and to be
charged by the enemy and so put to fight, whereupon he retired his people (in
that same order wherein they had fought all the day before) with their faces
to ward the enemy, fightinge co^tynually in their retreyte in good order,
although notwtoute great loss, and in this forte brought his people into his
camp to their lodginges, which he left well fortified with trenches and
rampares, and also well guarded with soldiers, whereunto, when the Mamalukes
approached the next morninge following, and consyderid the fortification thereof,
the great quantity of the artillery placed upon the bulwarckes and rampares
thereof, and also the number of the guard there unto appointed, they durst not
to assail their camp but retired them selves. And it seemed to Diadaro that he
had for that time well provided both for the security of Soria, and also for
his estimation, thincking it not good to enter into further peril whervppon he
returned again to Aleppo from whence he came, and when he had consumed the
rest of the summer in proinge and spoilinge the confines of the Turckes
country and that Automne was comme upon him he appointed his people to
garnison upon the confynes of Soria, and Baiazithe appointed his in the like
sort in the province of Cilicia, then Baiazithe practiced an atoneme^t with
the Soldane and many Orators were sent between them, from the one to the
other, Digressio^
whereunto it was an easy matter to persuade the Soldane notwithstanding his
victorious success. This Soldane was the chief in degree and acompted him
self y^ first prince of the Mahometane relygion, and taking upon him the
name, and dignite of Soldane, he is sacred in his creation with great
cerimonie, and beside that, the eldeste of a noble house in Cairo, and it is
said that anciently they were the princes, and held the soueraintie thereof and
were named Caliphi, the Soldane is crowned with an Imperial Crown whereby he
is acompted as y^ father of all the Mahometystes, they have always ben
contented with their dominion of Soria, and Egipte, they have not used in time
passed, to make wars upon any prince of their sect and relygion, unless they
had been enforced, in ye defense of their own state, or else of some other
Mahometyste prince, there confederate and frinde, in such sort, that holdinge
that principality and kind of government for ye space of three C. years and
more, they never enlarged their confynes, nor sought to possess the dominions
of others, the which, there manner and order of governance did chiefly cause,
for they provided in y^ beginning and made a law, Note.
that none should be Soldane, but be election, and that also he should be of
their communaltie, that is a slave, not yet worthy to be admitted into the
order of the Mamalukes, with whom was the whole governance, and authority to
elect and chewse the Soldane, the children of the Soldane never succeeded their
father in governance, no more did they of y^ Mamalukes succeed in the place of
their fathers, neither in wars, ne yet in any public prehemuinence, they
did live pryuately as other Citizines did, and possessyd y^ propre goods and
enheritaunces of their fathers, which they left unto them at their death, and
used the same exercise and trade of life that other of the country did. But
now to our history, when Baiazithe by means of his ambasciadours, and
Orators, had pacified the Soldane, renewed and confirmed y^ ancient league and
confideracie y^ had been of a long time between the Soldanes, and his house,
and established his government in Cilicia, he returned to Bursia the nearest
way and then embarcked him self with his souldionrs of Europe, and returned
into Gretia, and when he be came thither he ceased from al hostility, and gave
him self wholly to provide for the quietness of his people, and sent his
soldiers to garnisones, and gave order for the administration of Justice in
all places. after this, he gave him self wholly to the study of the
Alchorane, Alchoran a Book wherein are contained the chief points of the
Turcke his Religion.
and of natural philosophy, in the which he had great delighte, in so much
that he had always about him, of all nationes me^ excellently well seen in
phisycke, in whose company he passyd the greatest part of his time, and when
he had in this sort spent many years he was moved to take in hand new
enterprises, by occasion that was offery^ to make him lord of Corcira now
called Corfu, being certifyed by certain Greeks of the Isle who had practiced
with them of the fortes and so brought to pass y^ they would render the
fortes unto him at all times, Practice of Baiazithe to betray Corfu.
upon condition, that he should consider them acordinge to their service, and
offeryd them also to take the City and the rest of the Isle and to deliver the
whole into his hands this matter seemed unto him lykely, and possible to be
brought to pass, and also that he could not make a conqueste more mete for
the assurance of his state, no more apt to anoie the enemies of his religion,
immediately he determined in him self the order of the enterprise and for that
he would not that y^ Venetianes should suspecte him, he began to make ready
his Navy, and to prepare his army by land, and bruted that he would make
wars upon the people of Valachia, and Moncastro and when he had made ready al
things both by sea and land the Venetian Navy retorninge from Candie, whether
it were by chance, or else y^ ye general thereof had some kind of intelligence
of the practice, he came to Corsu, and acording to their custume, when he had
seen the moniti on, and vewed the gardes of the fortes and towns, he took
away the old soldiers and put new in their places and took with him
certain men that dwelled in Corsu and when he had spoiled all the sea coaste of
the Golfe he returned with his Navy to Venise, which when Baiazithe understood
he dissembled the matter as though he had meant nothing at all that way, and
would not discover his practice by the sodden vnrigging of his Navy and so to
loss the greatest part of the charges that he had been at, whereupon he
determined to take in hand the enterprise which he had bruted and put his Navy
to the sea and sent them toward the sea called mare magioro, and he in person
with his army, Baiazith in Valachia.
went by land through Burgaria toward the prince of Valachia, who dwelled in
the loer parts thereof toward the sea Eusino, he entered into his cau^tre
inuading and spoiling a great part thereof, the prince thereof, knowing him self
not able to withstand the force of this mighty prince, determined to prove if
he might by any means grow to an appointment with him and so to save him
self having great hope in the cortezic and goodness of Baiazithe, whereof the
fame was spread all the country over, and filled so the minds of men that all
men had good hope of him, and sendinge his Orators unto him in very humble
sort to demand peace of him, ye which when Baiazithe had herd, he granted
their request without difficulty, upon condition that he should pay unto
him yearly a certain sum of money in the name of a tribute, whereupon he
would receive him into his protection, when he had thus done, he passed the
river of Danubio and marched on until he came within the syghte of Moncastro,
where he had also syghte of his Navy, Moncastro stands upon the sea bancke
near to the mouth of the River Nester where he entrethe into the sea, The
seat^ of Mancastro.
called Maremagiore, the seat of it is naturally strong, and the town is
also artificially strong and of great emportance, by means of the commodities
of the conntre, of the river, and of the sea, and it is of great reputation in
all the countres about it, which it wone in the time of Sultane Mahometh, who
went thither with his camp and besegyd it, and when he had batterid it by the
space of a month, he was enforced by mean of y^ great cold to levy his
camp, and to depart thence without it, when Baiazithe had spoiled and proied
all the country about it, and saw that they of y^ town came not forth to the
feelde, Baiazithe besegeth Moncastro in very good order.
he caused his Navy to approach near to the town and forthewith besegyd it
both by sea and land, in such sort that they of the town were nether able
to send forth, nor receive into them any man, and when he saw the
inhabitants thereof determined to defend it, he planted his batteries, and
began to batter and make sondrie breaches, and when he had continued his
battery by ye space of many days, he had made so great breaches that it semyd
unto him that his men moughte enter the town at their pleasure, wherefore when
he had appointed his Colonels how they should succeed the one the other in
the assault, y^ next morning following at the point of the day they
presented them selves in battle before the town.

Those of the town were ready at the breaches, and had maruelously fortified
against the cannon, with strong rampares and exceeding deep dykes, and
defended them selves nobly, in such sort, that when the enemies presented
them selves to the breaches to enter the town, straight way they were with
them at the pushe of ye p^ke and bestowed upon them such store of shot,
artifeciall fyres, casting speres, and great stones, that they enforted them to
leave the breaches, and they bare them selves so worthily in their defense, that
they stewe and hurt an exceeding great number of ye enemies, and repulsed them
often times clean from the breaches but ye enemies were always supplied with
new regymentes, and renewed still the assault, and gave them of the town no
time at all to repose, and they had of their people slain, and hurt
contynually, and had not means to be supplied with new, whereby the defendantes
began excidingly to decay and not to be able to answer all places, whereupon
they receauyd greater hurt of y^ few which they lost, then did the enemy of
the great slaughter ye was made of his, when Baiazithe had in this sort
continued the assault the greatest part of the day, he commanded to sound
the retreicte and brought his people home to their lodgings, determyning the
next morning so to divide the regymentes of his army, that he would apointe
the Colonelles of the first assault so to be supplied from time to time with
new regymentes, that they of the town should rest, nether day, nor night,
and in this sort, he meant to consume them, and to cut through their new
works which they had made against ye Cannon, and so to enter the town, and
being in this determination he commanded his people to go to rest: wylling
them to be ready in battle the next morning before the rising of the sun to
assail the town again, and never to leave the assault til they had repulsed,
the enemies and taken the town of force, or else there to leave their lives,
when they of the town understood the great preparation of the enemy for the
assault, they dyscoraged not at al (not withstanding the great peril y^ they
were in, for that they wanted defendantes, consydering their people were
maruelously spoiled and consumed, but laid to their hands as men of noble
minds, and repared those places that were needful and prepared them selves
with such force as they had to defend there town to the uttermost. The day
following Baiazithe brought his people again in order to the walls with great
noyses and cries, and undoubtedly they assured them selves of the victory,
they tarried for nothing but for the token of ye assault, Baiazith being
desirous to save both the people, and the town, Great cortesy of Baiaziih.
determined to praue if that he could (by making them to understand the peril
wherein they were) cause them to yield the town upon condityones, and to save
their lives, whereupon he fignified unto them that he would talk with the^
sending his messager unto them, gyuing them to understand that be came in full
purpose, never to leave the assault, day nor night, until he had taken the
twone by force, and also, that if they tarried the assault he had given the
Town in proie t^ his soldiers, and would not spare age, nor kind, but that
he would put to the sword all that ever he found there, but if they would
yield unto him, he would give them both their lives and goods, and also it
should be in their choice whether they would continue there still or else
depart the town, when they of the town had herd the offer of this noble
prince, and had no means to save their lives, consydering that their people
were so consumed that they had not number sufficient to furnishe the breaches
that were made, wherefore they took a time to answer, whereupon the chief of
the city gathered together, and after certain conference had, they determined
to accept the conditiones that were offerid unto them, being in good hope
through the good opinion that they had of Baiazithe to have them faithfully
observed, whereupon they agreed, and sent their messagers to him offering him
the town, which Baiazith willingly accepted, and observed his promise with such
faith, that they were hurt another in person nor any one jot of their
substance, then he licensyd all such as would depart the town, to depart, with
all their goods and to conuei it whither they lest, and no man upon pain of
his life to touch them, or theirs, when he had this do^e he left the town
well guarded and furnished with all kind of mention and necessaries, and being
assured ye on that side he could not be molested and having brought under his
obedience all the coasts of the sea called Mare Pontico, he made it so safe,
that no man could pass y^ way but by his good will, for as much as he
possessyd all ye hauenes and ryuers that enter into ye same, when he had
acheuid this enterprise he returned home ward and brought his army into
Romania, where he sent them to garnison and he with his court tontynued in
Andrinople, and calling to mind again the enterprise of Corsu, Batolo an

could in no wise immagine how the Venetianes should understand of his
practice, unless it were by means of their Baiolo, or marchantes which dwelled
in Constantinople and Pera, wherefore he thought it not for his commodity to
kepeas it were in his bosom his natural enemy, who moughte daily
understand his practizes and give advertisement thereof, yet would he not seem
to touch particulerly the Venetianes, lest that by means thereof, he moughte
discover, what he had meant toward Corfu, whereupon he made proclamation that no
forien nation moughte after a certain day Consul is a secretari and
determynethe the differ^ces between the marcha^ts that are al of one country.

that should have any public authority or Jurisdiction he laid to ye
Venetianes charge that they had dealed disceitfully with him, wherefore he
stayed them and took from them all such goods as they there had, and thus
were they there kept many years, and their goods taken from them. Among
who^ the chief was Andre Gritti, when the peace was in this sort broken
between the Turcke and the Venetianes, Baiazithe determined to make wars upon
them, about the year of our health M.CCCC.lxxxxviii. and put his Navy of
Ships, Galleys, fustes and other vessels to the sea, and caused them to
sail toward Peloponeso now called Morea, and he in person went thither by
land with his army, Lepanto taken. Modon be segyd by Baiazithe
and when he was entered into the Golfe of Patrasso, he encamped before Lepanto,
anciently named Naupatto, and besegyd it both by sea and land, and in the end
obtained it upon condition, then followed he his enterprise and ye next year
following he passyd with his Navy to Modone and besegyd it round, and they of
the town being well furnished with all kind of necessaries, defendyd them
selves in such sort ye they made him to consume many months in vain, and
being men of much worthiness were determined to defend it to the vttermoste,
but at the length they began to have great scarcity of victual, Antonio
Grimmano, then Captain of y^ Venetian Navy, fraughted a great ship with
corn and sent it toward Modone, and when he came within syghte of the town
having a full wind and a good gale thereof packed on all his sails, and say led
directly toward the Turckyshe ficete, which lay in his course, directly
between him and the town, and came on with such violence, that none of them
durst to encountre him but gave him way and in this sort he passed through
the middeste of the enemies into the haven safely, the general of Modone
saying the ship safely arrived within the haven, commanded all those of the
town to go to the hauenes side, to unload the corn, and to bring it into
the town, when they of the town had received this commandment (being very
desirous of victual) both inhabitants, Great want of understanding of the
Modoneses.
and soldiers ran to the haven leui^g their town unguarded, as though their
had no enemi near them, of which great disorder Baiazithe being aduertized,
commanded his vantagarde to march toward the town in all haste and he with
the rest of his army followed, he assailed their ripares with great fury, and
finding them unfurnished of defendants, entered them forthewyth and became
master of them and then they took all the places that were of any force with in
the town before ye they ye were at the ships were able to succor it, when
the Turckes were in this sort become lords of Modone and had put their guard
in the market place, and also upon the bulwarks of the town then began they
to seek all places of the town, and to cut in pieces whosoever they met with
armor or weapon, then fell they to the sack of the town and spoiled as well
the sacred, as profane places, making men, women, and children flaues, and
spoiled them in exceeding miserable sort, so, that they left nothing to be
had, and their were such number of them gone into ye Citadell that they were
not able to endure there, but practiled an appointement, and were enforced to
render it having their lines saved then they of the Iste of Corone, which
stands right over against Modone, seeing Modone posfessyd by the infidels,
being desirous to save both their lives and goods, sent forthewith their
messagers to Baiazithe, offering him both the City and the Isle up on
condition that he should take from them another lives nor goods which
conditiones when Baiazithe had promised to observe, Corone de lyuered up to
Baiazithe.
they delivered him the town, and received his officers and soldiers into
it, Baiazithe determined to continue that winter in Morea and to make prouisyon
for the fortyfyinge of Modone, and provided new inhabitants to dwell in it,
and changed ye name of it, naming it Tangari Verdi which in our tougne
signifies, given by God, he appointed there a notable garnison of his
soldiers and in the spring folowinge, he sent one of his Bascias toward
Valona, and assailed the City of Durazzo with xl. M. men and the walls thereof
being fallen into decaie, and the City slenderly furnished, was a mean
whereby he sone became lord of it. Nota.
And the Venetianes acordinge to their old custume and order, laid the whole
fault of the loss of Modone in Antonio Grymano Captain of their armata, for
y^ he had not with his Navy succored it, whereupon they sent for him to
Venise, co^maundinge him to be brought in yronnes: prisoner, and banished him
into the Isle of Proconesso, from whence afterward he bracke, and came to
Rome, they appointed in his place Captain general of their armata, Marchio
Treuesano, and seeing that of them selves they were not able to endure the
charges of so great wars, they sent to the king Lois of France for aid, who
sent them out of province and Genoa, seven ships well armed and furnished,
and fyftene galleys with a great quantity of artillery, and also certain
thou sands of footmen, the greatest part Guascones, under the conducte of
the lord of Grauistence, who departed from Genoa and sailed toward ye
Archipelago (which deuideth ye less Asia from Gretia) to join with ye
Venetian armata and when he came to Scio, he depated from thence to Mitilene,
entered the haue^ and landed his people, and immediatli proied and spoiled al ye
Isle and finalli came and encamped before the town which was the chief of the
Isle, Mitilene besegyd by the frenshe
and assailed it with great fury, and the first day that they came before it
they planted their batteryes and batterid in such sort that they so feared ye
Turcks of the town with their sodden assault, ye notwithstanding there was
within it a granison of great fame, of men of great experience, yet they were
so affraied that they sent their posts by sea and land, to Baiazithe to
declare unto him the great preparation and force of the Christianes, and the
fury of their batteries, protesting unto him: that if they were not spedylye
reliued they should not be able long to defend it, when the arryual of ye
Navy of France was commonly known in Constantinople ye force of y^ nation
being then augmented and increase so at that time, did put such fear into
the whole City, and to all the rest of Romania, that ye Mahometistes being
out of all hope to continue any longer in Gretia, immagined how to provide
ships and other vessels where with to flee into Asia, rather then to put
them selves in order to succor Mitileno, where up on Baiazithe being
excidingly moved with the confusion that he saw among his people, making
none account of his astate guyrded his gown to him, and came downto ye
haue^nes side where his people were, so^ meembarcked, and others ready to
enbarcke, and entretyd his people that they would embarcke and pass on to
succor Mitileno, and whiles the court continued in this sort making no
prouisyon at all in effect for their defense, their is no doubt that if the
Venetianes had gone on with their Navy and united them with the Navy of France
and increased ye power of the Christans (cheifely of footmen, whereof the
frenshe had great want) but when they had taken Mitileno and some other one
place in Gretia they should have brought the Turckes to that pass, that they
paraduenture of them selves would have fled into Asia, and have for saken
Gretia, but the Venetianes, whether that it were for that they were all
redyentred into practice of a peace with Baiazithe which afterward they
concluded by ye means of Andre Gritti) and would no further procure his
indignation, or else that the good success of the frenshe did not like them
whereupon they in deed procided slowly in all their affares, and cheifely, in
furnishinge the frenshe Navy with victual and men, whereof they stood in great
need and prolonged so their coming to unite them selue^ with the frenshe that
when they had continued there for a certain space and made so great breaches
ye if they had had men sufficient to hane given the assault they moughte
easylye have taken the town, but when they saw the tarying of the Venetianes
and the small haste that they made, the Captain of the frenshe, being in
great distress of victual by means whereof he could no longer continue there,
and being also much offendyd with there stacknes, doubted that they went
about te betraie him and his people, and had them in great suspicion, where
upon he embarcked his people and artillery, disolued the sege and set sail,
passed the Golfe and then alonge by Scicilia and returned with his Navy to
Genea, and then be in person took the post and went into France, when
Baiazithe considerede the great peril wherein he had been determining no more to
incure the like, chiefly for that he was of nature given to be quiet and not
ambitious nor desirouse to enlarge the confines of his dominions whereupon he
determined to attempt the Venetianes for peace, and delivered Andre a Gritti
upon suerties for his return, and then embarcked him and sent him to Venise to
entreat the peace, when Gritti was come to Venise and found the Senate, the
Duke, and all the commons of the City, well inclined to peace, after that he
had had great conference with the Senate, he received auctorye and commission
from them to conclude the peace, whereupon he returned to Constantinople and
concluded the peace upon such conditiones as at this day are observed between
them, and Baiazithe when he had in this sort ceased his hostility, he lad his
life in great quietness and spent the greatest part of his time, his court
being in Andrinople, at a certain house of his not far from the City, a
place of great pleasure, where he builded for his commodity maruelouse
sumptuous and goodly lodginges, and in this sort he passed a great piece of his
time in great quietness, and being come to the age of.lx. years, and having
governed in the Empire.xxx. years, to the great content of all his subjects,
he began like a wise man to consider that he was old, and not helthefull of
body, and that he was like every day to be surprinsed by death and to be
taken away, wherefore he was desirous to provide for, and establyshe his
succession for the quietness of his subjects and to take away all occasyon of
tumultes that moughte happen by his death, consyderinge that he had three
sons of lawful years, whom he had appointed in three sondrye parts of Asia to
govern upon his confynes, and every of them had under his charge a great
army, wherefore for only remedy, and maintenance of unity in his Empire, to
the end that through the discord of his sons it should not be divided and
consumed with Civil wars, for so much as there was not a better remedy for
to avoid such disorder then to follow the example of Amorathe his graud
father, which was to give over the governance, and to provide in his life
time for the establishement of his succession, and to appointe who should
succeed him and to give over into his hands al power and rule, and to put him
in possessyon of the Empire which should be an occasyon of great quietness, for
so much as be (being old and syckly and not able to endure so great labor
and travail) thought that the people should be better governed by a younger
man and the other bretherin should be out of hope to attain to the Empire
which should be all ready possessyd, by means whereof, they should be
enforced to obey, if that they would not receive further incommoditie, and he
being entered into a private life should be more in quiet, and should provide
better for his health, and when he had in this sort discoursed in him self,
be then immagined which of them he were best to appointe to succeed him in the
Empire, whereupon he thought it not mete to take from any that that was his
right, wherefore he determined that Acomathe his eldeste son should succeed
in his place and meaning by the discoueringe of his purpose to give him greater
reputacion, he brake it chiefly to the principal Captains and leaders of his
Gianizzaries, and horsemen, whereupon he dispatched away one of his servants
to sygnifie unto him that the should leave his confynes well guarded and repare
into Gretia to his father when Acomathe had received this commandment from
his father, and being all ready certified from his servants which late at the
port, of the cause of this message, he forthewyth, took his journey acompayned
with a great number of gentle me^ and courtiers, and so passed through
Licaonia Galatia and Bithinia and then passed the strait and landed in Gretia,
and there understood that Baiazithe was with his court in Andrinople,
whereupon the rode thither, and when he came to his father, he received him
very joyfully and arose out of his chair embraced him kissing his fore head
in token of the great love ye he bare him, and lodged him in his own lodginges
presenting him with many rich, and honorable presents and beside that they
did contynually acompanie together by the space of certain days (which was
not his ordinary) and had between them great and secret dyscourses, and
finally when they had agreed upon ye time and order that he should observe
when he should come to receive the government, The port is a passag between
Europe and Asia not much unlike the escluse of oye.
be licensyd him and sent him again to his charge when Selim the other son
of Baiazithe, was aduertized by his servants that he had at the port of the
coming of Acomathe to the court and of ye great entertainment that his
father gave him and also how that his father determined to make him Emperor
in his life time, and to resign his place unto him, Selim having a troublouse
head and being very ambitiouse, could in no wise be content that Acomathe
should command him, wherefore he sought to prevent as much as in him was,
that such succession should take no place, whereupon he determined to comme to
the port in person and departed from Trebisonda where he had his abydinge,
without askinge his father license, or gyuinge him any thing to understand
thereof, being acompanied with six hundred horse men Tartarres and Pontoises
and passed on all the sea coaste of Eusino and passed on through the country
of Valachia, and Burgaria, and so came directly to Andrinople, and when he came
to his father he found him greatly altered, and was rebuked of him, for that,
that he contrary to the Constitution and order of the Empire, was departed
from his charge without his license, Selim was not amassed for that he saw his
father offended with him, but allegid in his defense many things, and
declared that in his coming at that present, he followed the example of his
brother Acomathe, desyringe (for that his father was old) to see him before he
should dye and to receive his blessyng) Baiazithe being some what moved with
the words of his son, was contented to suffer him to kiss his fete, and
then he took him up and kyssed him in the forehede, and embraced him, and gave
him certain gifts, and then licensid him and gave him in charge to return to
his governance with all speed, but Selim deferred his departure by all means
possible, and thought by being conversant with the Gianizzaries and his horse
men, and vsinge among them great liberality and actiuitie, by these means,
to assure him self of them, making it to seem unto them that he delighted in
nothing so much as in the exercise of weapones, and rydinge of horses, and his
whole discourses were of wars, horses and weapones, he was in gyuinge,
exceeding liberail, and did contynually purchase frendshippe among them. This
taryinge of his did greatly displease Baiazithe, wherefore he sent unto him that
he should forthewith depart, and get him to his charge, but he ever allegid
one excuse, or other, and in that sort as much as in him was deferred his
departure, in so much that his father being excedingly wroth with him, sent
to declare unto him, that if he did not forth with depart the court he would
so give order that he should depart to his pain, whereupon he took his leave
and departed with all his train, and rode on with his people toward Seruia
iiii. or v. days journey, and there stayed at a place called Scazacara, and the
place was very commodious and mete for his purpose, being from Andrinople
iiii. days journey, and from Phillipoli ii. days journey, and it stood up on a
certain passage that whosoever came out of Europe to go to the port, he
must comme that way and lodge there, when Selim had lodged his people, and
fortifyed his lodginges with thick and mighty rampares and deep dykes, he
caused to brute that he would tarry there for a space and assemble his power,
and then to go into Samandria against the Hungarians, when he had in this
sort fortifyed his lodginges, he stayed as many as came that way, and
chiefly all such as came out of Gretia, dalmatia, Bossina, Seruia, and
Burgaria, and carried to the port, ye rentes, customs, and gabelles that the
Turcke received out of those contres, and with such su^mes of money he
entertained as many horsemen, and fotemen, as he could get being well
furnished and exercised in arms, and giving great entertainment his fame
spread so through out the country that all the best soldiers thereof came unto
him, in such sort that within a short space, he had under his ledinge a
mighty army both of horsemen and fotemen, able to encountre any prince,
when Baiazithe understood or this he was much offendyd and although be could
when it pleased him, flater them, yet for all that, it was a grefe to him to
use his force against his son, and to foul his hands in his own blood,
and acordinge to his great cortesie and humanity, sought by all means
possible to remove his son from his lewd, and audacious enterprise, but all
was in vain, for Selim would not harcken to any thing that was spoken, but
contynually increased his power, Baiazithe departs from Andrinople.
whereupon Baiazithe iudginge Andrinople not to be a mete place for his purpose,
thought it good to go to such a place where he would not be enforced to
fight but yt he would be at his choice whereupon he departed from Andrinople
with his course and all his power both of horsemen and fotemen, and took the
way toward Constantinople, thickinge that being there he moughte use the
matter as he lysted when Selim understood of the departure of his father, he
difserrid not the time but marched forth with all his power, leuinge his
carriage and bagage behind him in his camp, and with great speed marched
toward Andrinople to ouergette his father, and he passed on with such speed
that he ouergate the rere guard of his fathers army within l. miles of
Constantinople, and finding them in battle, without sendinge of heralde,
trompett, or any other messager deferred no time, but charged them and began
to join in battle, and to lay hands about him, when Baiazithe beheld the
fury of his son executed cuted upon his people as if they had been his
natural enemies, yet could he not be contented to use his force against him:
but sent unto him to persuade him to leave of his folyshe and audationes
enterprise and to return again to his charge, but all was in vain that he
did for Selim was always the foromoste, and gave in upon them as if they had been his very enemies, but in the end when Baiazithe saw that he could by no
means appease him but ye still he perseuered in his beastly rage against him,
he laid a part all respects, and also his fa therly love, and called to him
his Baftias, and ye Captains and guard of his Gian izzaries, and commanded
them to use all their force possible against Selim, as against their mortal
enemy, for so much as he saw in him so great beastlines as to use against
him, such barbarique cruelty and rage, which enforced, him to beliue that his
mother had deceived him, and breaking her faith toward him had conceuid him
by so^me adultery, when ye Bas cias and Captains herd these words of their
lord, they were maruelously enflamed with Ire and Just indignation against
Selim, and took their weapones and The bat^tayle between Baiazithe and Selim.
with such fury charged his people that they (not being able to endure their
force) were in one instante disordered, scaterid, and put to flyghte, and
being once broken, every man sought to save him self by flyghte, but being
followed by the horsemen of Baiazithe, the greatest number of them were flaine
upon the feelde, and Se lim with a few of his trusty fryndes with him escaped
through ye speed of their horses, they stayed in no place but fled contynually
day and night, till they were passed Varna in Burgaria, and then they went
into certain mountains that were of great heighte and tedious to clyme, and
there continued for a time. And Baiazithe being full of sorrow, not knowinge
in what sort he were best to use his son, continued on his journey to
Constantinople, and when he came thither and saw ye ambition, and audacitie of
his son it caused him to continue more firmly in his purpose, to provide for
his succession in his life time, and to establishe one in his place and
determining not to prolonge the doing thereof, sent to signifye to Acomathe to
make him redye with all con uement speed, and to come to the port to receive
the go uernance, in the which mean time Corcuthe being his third son
which continued in Magnesia to desend all those provinces against the Soldane,
when he un derstode of the rebellion of Selim against his father, whose
determynation and commandment, he was well content in every respect to obey,
and was not moved at all with the coming of Acomathe, but afterward
suspecting ye ambition and cruelty of Selim, disguised him self and with one
only galley, departed from Magnesia, and conveyed him self to Constantinople,
and when he came in his fathers presence, after that he had done his due
reverence unto him desired him that in the estabishement of Acomathe in the
Empire, he would pro uide also for his security puttinge him in remembrance
how that in his absence, being a little child he was by the Gianizzaries
placed in the Imperial seat, and of ye promise that he made unto them in his
behalf as touching the succession, Baiazithe being excedingly well pleased
with the good words of his son, did meruelously embrace him, and wylled him
to be of good chere, and gave him a great mass of treasure and appointed
four galleys of his to attend upon him home, and in this sort sent him to
his charge well satisfied and contented, and as soon as Acomathe had received
commau^ deme^t from his father, he began to make great preparation for his
journey, and used not in a matter of such importance, such celeritie as he
moughte have done, but thought that he should comme in good time whenever
that he came, he made redye all such things as he would carry with him, and
then rode one ordinary journeys toward Europe, when Baiazithe understood of
his coming (meaning to receive him honorably) he made great preparation in
Constantinople, and put to the sea many galleys, and Palandres, rychely
furnished and trymmed, to send into Turckie to transporte his son, who being
comme down into Bithina was comme to Scutarie, a place that stands upon the
sea bancke nere unto the aucient city Calcedonia, dercetly over against
Co^sta^tinople, y^ which when Baiazithe un derstode, he commanded his guard of
Gianizzaries and diverse of his Sanzachi to embarcke with their compaines and to
go to receive Acomathe, but the Captains of the Gianizzaries not being
wyllinge to accept Acomathe for their lord, for that he seemed unto them in
his coming and contynnance at the port, not to be a man mete for so great a
charge, and besides y^ being a fat man, they thought him not active on
borsbacke nor soche an one as would seek to enlarge his Empire, and exercise
him self in wars, but rather woldegyue him self to his ease and to
pleasures, and make small acompte of his men of war, and cheifely because
they knew him to be of nature, scarce, and not liberal, and contrartlye Selim
to be of nature ambitiouse, not delighting so much in any thing as in the
exercise of weapones, and rydinge of horses, and also they knew him to be very
liberal and bounteouse, wherefore they Judged it to be more for their commodity
to have him to be Emperor then Acomathe, and they were the more moved with it,
because they saw things stand in such tormes as they did at that present,
where with they nothing pleased, whereupon they determined to resyste it, and
soddenly rebelled and made a great tumulte in the City, and took their
weapones and ran in every torner of the City and began to sack the house of
the Sadi, Sadi is an officer that determines differences, as dettes and such
like monei matters.
and of two of the chief Bascias, and there went with them a great number of
horsemen, they went down to the sea and entered into the Galleys and Palanders,
spoiled them of all their riches and ornementes, took away their sails and
helmes, because they should not be able to sail, and in this great stir
and trouble their number always increased, they went on to the place y^ is
called Saint dimetrio and came to the gate and called, requiringe to have
Selim sent for, and that he might comme and kiss his fathers fete, Baiazithe
used al mea nes possible to diswade the Gianizzaries from this uproar, and in
the end offered them an infinite sum of money, if they would agree and
consent that Acomathe should be coroned, and saying that he could by no mea
nes appease them: but that the more that he entreted them, the more insolente
they were, and began to threa ten him with proud, and beastly words, whereupon
Baiazithe was enforced of necessity to give over, and to grant their
request, yet for all that, did he not leave of, but sought by all means
possible how to alter the^ and to bring them to his devotion, but he kept
him self always out of their hands, when the Agar and others of great
place, had received this grant of their lord they dispatched one fleing,
toward Selim, to will him to comme his way with all speed, he received not so
sone this message, but he came his way with all speed and upon the way, he
met with a thousand horses which were sent unto him for his guard, by the
Gianizzaries, with whom when he was entered into company they went upon y^
spur to the City, where there came to encountre and receive him, not only
the Gianizzaries, but also the greatest number of the Spachi, and other ordres
of horsemen, with a great multitude of the people, and when they had brought
him into the City they saluted him Emperor, to the universal contentation,
and satissying of the people, and when he had riden about all the City, they
placed him in the Imperial seat, and coroned him with all kind of Imperial
ceremonies, and finally they swore openly to be obedient and faithefull unto
him, and in this sort Selim, without any resystance took upon him the state
and governance of the Imperial City, Subtilitie of Selim
and then sent to his father wlllinge him not to dismaie for any thing for he
was not comme to use any force against him, but being called by his
soldiers and by the people he thought it not semely to deny so general a
consent, and therfoore he signified unto him that he would not take him only
for his father, but also for his lord, desiringe him not to deny ye universal
request of his people, but to confirm and approve what they had done, and
that he moughte with his favor and good will govern, promising that he would
always be an obedient child toward him Baiazithe saying the offers of his
son, and that there was no means to altere that that was done, and that if
he should not willingly consent there unto, he might sone be enforced to do
it, whereupon he granted his request and especially, for that he was persuaded
in his own opinion, that this great and sodden change of men's minds, was
the very work of god, and to bring to pass to reuele in time: secrets which
then were hid den, and being moved in this respect, contented him self,
would no longer resyste, but sent into the City one of his Bascias to salute
Selim Emperor, and to promise obedience in his name, the next morrow folowinge
he went in person into the City, and came to his son and fallinge prostrate
on the ground kyssed his fete who arose and lyfted him up, and kyssed him in
the forehed, and therwas great token of frinoshippe showed on both parts and
then they with drew them into a place separate from the rest, where when they
had had great conference together, Baiazithe required Selim to grant him that
he might live discharged of al cares privately, and that he moughte with
certain of his familiers depart and lead his life at ye Dinaotico, which is
a certain house of pleasance near unto Andrinople wherein y^ time of his
governance he used much to lie, and had builded there sumptouse and costly
lodginges, Selim answered him very franckly that he should not only have
that house, but also any other house that he would, whereupon Baiazithe caused
to make prouisyon of all such things as he would carry with him and then went
again to visit his son, and took his leave of him, and then went with his
company toward Andrinople, and in hi journey he fell syke, either of thought,
or else of poison, acording to the opinion of many, and died in the year of the
Christian ^elthe 1512

Ottomanno. The fourth Book.
WHEN ACOMATHE UNDERSTOOD of the coming of his brother Selim to
Constantinople, and in what sort things had passed there, he thought not him
self suer at Scutaro, whereupon he departed from thence to Bursia, and when he
understood of the death of his father, he departed from thence with his army
that he had in Natolia, toward Capadotia, and when he came thither, he went
nere to the mount Tauro, into that part that Caromano had possessed, and
fortifyed him self at the foot of mounts Tauro, with great rampares, deep
Dykes and artillerye and the place of it self being strong he had made it
inprenable and had furnished it plentifully with victuals and all other kind
of necessaries in such sort that he moughte or a long time lie safely there,
whereupon, for as much as he saw him self suerly encamped, and that Selim
could not enforce him to battle onles he list he determined not to go
forth of his camp for any occasyon that should be offered him, but to lie
still there and to se what time would do, perswadinge him self that god would
not permit amongeste men, such an one long to enjoy an astate wone so
wickedly, on the other side when Selim had possessed his fathers treasure,
which was thought to be innumerable, he distributed a great part thereof to
the Gianizzaries, and to ye rest of his men of war toward whom he used
great liberality, and gave them exceeding largely, after that he began to
reform theordynances of his predecessors as touching his men of war, and
gave them to under stand that their great bravery was to no purpose for it
behooved good soldiers to provide to cover them selves, and their horses with
good and suer armor that being suerly armed they moughte hazard them selves
into greater peril and fight the more valantly, and not encorage the enemy
to enforce them selves to all peril, for the gain of the gold, Iuelles, and
silver, ye they did wear upon them. After this he established his country of
Gretia, and then passed the strait with his army into Bithinia, and then into
licaonia and Capadotia meaning first to take away that impediment, his
brother Acomathe, and brought his army and encamped not far from his brothers
camp, the next day he left his camp, and with his people took the feelde,
and put them in battle, ready to fight. But for all this Acomathe would not
once stir nor suffer one of his soldiers to go forth of his camp, when
Selim had consumed there a great time in vain and could by no manner of
Injury procure him to the battle, although he had used all means possible
that moughte prouoque him their unto, and in the end saying that he could by
no means cause him to accept the battle, and that it was not possible to
enforce him to it, he was sort that he had lost so much time, and determined
to defer the enterprise to an other time, wherefore he raised his camp and
took the way toward the sea and from thence into Magnesia to deal with his
brother Corcuthe who continued in Magnesia, and being a man of uo travail nor
understanding of the wars, nor had in the time of his father, nor afterward
taken in hand any great enterprise, and mistrusting nothing, was taken
unprovided without guard, Symplicitie of Corcuthe.
but Selim determyninge to dispatche all those of his blood, and to reign
without suspicion rode on with such speed that he was entered the confines of
Magnesia, or that Corcuthe had intelligence thereof, or of his coming at all,
whereupon Corcuthe saying him to come with so great fury and having no
preparation wherewith he moughte encounter him, he determined to se if ye he
moughte by flighte save his life wherefore he disguised him self, and with
certain ye he most trusted he departed secretly out of the town, and took
the way toward and hodes, and when he came to the passage he found it, with
all ye sea coaste occupied with the galleys and fustes of Selim, and when he
saw no means how to get out of the country, he determined to hide him in
certain woedes there at hand, and when he had continued there in caves for a
certain time and lived of wild honey, and roots, Selim promised openly to
give great reward, to whomso ever would give him knowledge where he was, or else
de liver him into his hands, in the end he was discovered by certain men of
the country who aduertysed Selim of him whereupon he sent to take him, The death
of Corcuthe.
and as they were bringinge of him toward the town, he was upon the way by
the commandment of Selim, put to death when Selim was in this sort
possessid of Magnesia and of all the provinces of ye lesser Asia which lie
alonge the sea coaste eue^ to Soria, and had established the goueren meant
thereof, he brought his army to Bursia, and when he was entered into Cilicia in
great triumph, he determined to get into his hands certain young men, sons
of two of his brethren that were dead, which Baiazithe there grandfather had in
his life sent thither to be nori shed and brought up, whereupon, he ordained to
celebrate a maruelouse sumptuouse feast to his Captains acording to the
Turckishe manner, and to diverse other inhabitants there, among whom he caused
to conuite his Nephews, and when the feast was endyd he licen sed all men
sauinge his Nephews, Barbarque cruelty.
with whom he declared that he would speak, and caused them to be put into
sondrie chambres, and then by his Mymstres caused them most cruelly to be
strangled, in such sort that of the plentyfull issue that Baiazithe left
behind him their rested none leuinge but only a son of his, and his
brother Acomathe, with two sons of his, whose death he did contynually both
day and night frame when he had appointed the government of Bursia, he went
to Niconedia and from thence to the Golfe and finding his Navy there,
embarcked him self with his people and passed alonge the coaste of Propontide,
sailinge directly to Constantinople, and landinge at the steres there he took
his horse and rode through all the City and then lyghted at his palace at
Saint Dimetrio his ponte, and being there, discoursed maruelously in him
self of the order how to overthrow his brother Acomathe, and knowinge, that
if he would continue in his camp, it was so strong as it was not possible to
pluck him out of hit, wherefore he determined to se if he could by any means
betraie him, Selim practisethe to betraye his brother Acomathe
whereupon he entered into practice with the Agar of the Gianizzaries and two of
his chief Bascias, and brought to pass that they should enter into practizo
secretly with Acomathe, and declare unto him that they were not contented with
the governance of Selim, wherefore they would take part with him, and help him
to recover his state and promised to help him by all means possible, and sent
to him secret ly by certain of their trusty fryndes, that consideringe the
unspeakable cruelty that Selim had used, both toward his father, Corcuthe,
and his Nephews, they did deteste and abhore him, and by means of his great
insolence and tiranie that he used in his governance they were suer nether of
their goods, ne yet of their lives, and that they did repent that aver they
created him Emperor, and also if he would comme and take their part, they
would cut him in pieces and deliver them selves of his most intolerable
servitude and therefore whenever that they should understand that he would
come forewarde with his army to Bursia, that immediately thereupon they would
either cut him in pieces, or else rebelle openly against him, and leave him, and
comme and join their powers with him and when they had in this sort accepted
him for their lord, they would then acompanie him to Constantinople to place
him in the Imperial seat, and they exhorted him therefore, not to lose, such
an occasion, for as soon as they should understand that he was entered into
Bithinia, all the Gianizzaries and horsemen would for the with rebelle, and
stey Selim, and comme to him and accept him for their lord, when Acomathe had
received this message, he doubted in the beginning, of their faith,
suspectinge them to be but intisinges to cause him to leave his strength, and
to betray him, wherefore he gave small ear, and weid it not at all, but they
contynuinge still in sendinge their messages, did so urge, and importue him,
requirynge of him nothing, but to comme to the feelde with his army, and
showed him the order how they would bring it it pass without any peril,
and in the end persuaded him to accept their offer, and yet he suspected the
matter even as it came to pass, and determined to go no further then to
Bursia, whereupon he promised them to comme meaning not to depart from Bursia
until that he herd that the Gianizzaries, and horsemen, had taken their arms,
and revolted openly against Selim in Constantinople, and to this intent he
departed from his lodginges and marched with his army directly toward Bursia,
Selim on the other side had contynual spyalle upon Acomathe, and was from time
aduertized of his procedings as soon as he had in telligence that he was
marchinge and drew near the confynes of Bithinia, he ordained to make ready
his people secretly, and passed them in the night with great silence into
Turchie, and rode on with all speed the nearest way toward Bursia, and when he
came upon the plain of Bursia, he met with Acomathe and his army not far
from the town, and assailed him with great furye, charginge him in such
sort, Battle between Selim and Acomathe
that his force was such, that the soul diours of Acomathe not being able to
endure them, were in the first encounter dysordred, and put to flyghte, and
being followed by the horsemen of Selim the greateste part of them were taken
and slain, and Acomathe, having his horse stayne vuder him, and lyinge upon
him on the ground could not shyfte him self from him, and being enuironned
with a great number of enemies was taken, he desired to be brought to the
presence of his brother, and as he was on his way going toward him, there
met him, certain that were sent from Selim, which stayed him, and strangled
him most miserably, Acomathe brought to the feelde with him two sons,
Amorathe, and Aladino, which in the rencountre that they had with Selim, as soon as they saw their people begin to recule, in ye beginning of the battle,
conueid the^ selves away, and would not come in his hands, but took sondrie
ways, the one of them fled into Persia to the Sophie, who entertained him
honorably and gave him great provision, and a wife, thinckinge to aid him
against Selim, but in the end he became so insolente, that he was in
tolerable, wherefore he put him to death, the other took his way alonge the
sea coaste and passed into Sorta and came to Cairo, and Selim after this great
victory had against his brother having taken away all occasi ones of Civil
wars returned into Gretia, and having determined in his mind a journey
against the Sophie and could not endure that he should enjoy a number of
towns in the lesser Armenia, which were wont to be governed by the princes
of the Turckishe nation, and beside that, that he should enlarge his
dominiones eue^ to the confines of Turchie, doubting much the fait he of those
people, for so much, that the greatest number of them were infected with the
superstition or heresy, y^ the Sophie is, being divided from the rest of the
Mahometistes into a peculier sect, also he would not that the subieces of the
Sophie should travail into his country nor traffic any more with his
people, and when he had arested all the sylkes, and goods, of ye marchantes
that were subjects to the Sophie, which dwelledin Bursta and were called
aggiammi, he sent them to dwell in Constantinople. And Iudginge the enterprise
against the Sophie to be of great importance, Preparation of Selem.
consydering his great force and power, he thought to take the matter in hand
by great aduisement, and to make great preparation and to go strongely,
wherefore be determined by all means possible to augement the number of his
Giantz zaries, whereupon he sent into Turchie for all his slaves that he had
there, that were sufficient to use weapones, and caused them to be enrolled
among the rest of his Gianizzaries, Note here the great Judgment of Selim.
and appointed them to ordinary masters to show them how to use their
weapones and knowinge that his enemy was nothing so well furnished with
artillery as he was, he determined to alter the artillery that his father
left, and to make it, into such pieces as moughte more easyly be carried and
like unto ye which the Christianes use at this day, wherefore he caused to
break all the great Bombardes, and to make them in to half cannonnes,
falcouetes and pass volantes, and caused to make a great number of cariages
for them and provided for a great u^mber of Cannonters to use them, out of
Almaigne, Hungary, and France, and gave them great entertainment, he
provided also for other masters of artillery as makers of powder, of shot,
of fire woorcks and such like, besides that Judging harquebuziers on horsbacke
very mete to encounter his ene mies, for so much as they had seen no such in
time before by means whereof, they should be a great terror to the enemy,
cheifely to those of the east parts, whose horses not beings acustumed to
hear the like noyses, as soon as they should hear the crack and thondre of
the harquebuzrie they would be so affraied, that they would run away and
disorder all, maugre those that rode them, and therefore he provided a great
number of them and chose them young men and caused them to be daily erercised
in the use thereof and made perfytte, he provided them of horses and appointed
to every new band a certain number of old soldiers, such as had been well
trained to govern and lead them, unto whom he gave great entertainment, by
means where of there came unto him, out of all parts of christendom, in
such sort as in a sort time he had more then a thousand on horseback, beside
a great number that he had on foot then he determined also to amend and
increase his Navy, and caused to make in all places upon the sea side (where he
used to have any Naute) arseuales to the end, that in time of peace his
ships moughte lie co^ered wherein time before they were wont to lie always at
the rode and so within a few years to rotte and con^ume, and when he had made
these preparationes he then ^etet mined to provide how to maintain al these
thigs and with all diligence increased his revenue, and railed new impositions
upon all kind of marchandizes in ^anye places which they call Comechi, he
also cut of, ^ll superflouse charges, such, as appertained only to ^ompe and
bravery and when he had in this sort re^ormed his state, and augmented his
bands, both of fotemen, and horsemen, when he saw time conuement he went to
the feelde with his army, and would no len gar defer the time, but caused to
pass his army out of Gretia, into Asia and joined them with his soldiers
of Asia, he had then in his camp more then a hundred and fytie thousand
horsemen, beside his Gianizzaries, and a great number of fotemen, then he
caused them all to march on toward Persia, and passed on through Capadotia,
and Licaonia, into Armenia the less, and when he had brought it under his
obedience, he determined (or that he would pass the river Euphrates) to make
suer all the passages of the mount Tauro, to the end that ye passage of his
victualles should be free without empechement, and therefore sent his
ambasciadours to the prince of Adola) who possessed many places in the
mountain, to require him to join with him in league who answered that he
would be enemy to another of them nor would deal in there differences, between
the Sophie, and him, but would stand frinde to them both, and would give to
either of them free passage through his country, and also such victual as he
had, which conditiones at that time Selim was contented to accept, because
that he could obtain none other, and to avoid the loss of time did not
mean as then to take the country of force for so much as the prince possessed
in ye mountains, many places of great force, both natural, and artificial
and excedingly well furnished both with men and monition, and also was able to
bring to the feelde of his own subjects armed, thirty thousand men on
horseback whereupon when the conditiones were artified, and oath given on both
sides for the performance of the same, he marched with his army to the floode
Euphrates, then fastenned he his botes from the one bancke to the other of the
same, and laid his bridge upon them and passed over, his army, and when he was
entered into his enemies country, he began to spoil and proie it when then
Sophie was aduertized of the aryuall of the Turckes army he deferred no time
but took his horse and marched with his army toward the river Euphrates to
encountre Selim, and mete with him in the myddeste of the plain one this side
of ye City Tauris four days lorney, The battle between the Sophie and
Selim.
and without any delate, put their people in order and then came on with great
fury, and joined in battle, the fight was terrible and bloody, it
continued long in good order, without any aduau^tage seen of other side, but
at the last the Persians serring them selves and coming on having their
horses of more force, and better armed then the Turckes horses were, began to
prevail, which when Selim perceued he caused his squadrone to open, and to
suffer the Persianes to pass al most into the myddest of the squadrone and
when they came there, he caused upon the sodden to discharge certain peers of
artillery which he had placed in ye myddest of his squadrone, which made so
great anoyse that the air did ringe, and the earth did shake with it, and
having stayne in the discharge of that volee an exceeding great number of men
and horses, it so feared the rest of the horses which were not used to
thondringe and noise of artillery, that they ran away, and scattered all over
the feelde, and they ye rode them were not able to govern them, when the
Turckes horsemen saw their enemies flee in that sort, they followed them with
all speed possible, and when they ouergate them, they slew and took an
infinite number of them, ye roste fled every man his way, and suffered there
enemies to enjoy the victory, and at the first discharge of the artil lerie
the Sophie, with a great number of his nobility, with drew them selves,
Selim, of great judgment.
saying their people in so great disorder, Selim determyninge to use the
victory, lodged his army that night, where the Persianes lodged the night
before, and gave all the spoil of their camp to his soldiers. The next
morning as soon as it was day, he took his horse and rode toward the city
Tauris and when he was comme near unto it, the Citizens being discoraged
through the overthrow of their prince and saying no man to apeare upon the
feelde in their defense, would not by defendinge them selves hazaro both their
lives and goods, determined among them to yield the city, whereupon they sent
forth certain of their Citizens to talk with Selim, and in the end agreed
to deliver him the City, sauinge their lives and goods, when this was agreed,
they received him into the town and his people also, and there is no doubt,
but if that Selim had had provision in Tauris for the sustenance of his army,
Tauris yielded to Selim.
but that he should easyly have possessed the kingedome of Persia, and
banished the Sophie the country, but he had sone consumed all the country and
prouisyon that there was, and on the other side the princo of Adule, as soon as
he understood that ye Sophie had his army upon the feelde, Iudginge that he
should have the better, brake his promise with him, and took the feelde with his
army and occupied all the straites and passages, by the which men must pass,
out of the Turckes dominions into Persia, and took from all the victuallers
that came, Great ertremitie.
their victualles, and warned them, that from thence forth they should no
more come there whereof it followed, that having consumed the victualles which
they found there, and having no relief out of their country, they were
brought into great penury, and intolerable famine, in such sort, as they
were enforced to stey their horses, and eat them, and also to ear both roots
and herbbes that were unwholesome for man to eat, by means whereof: they were
not only unable to follow the victory against ye Persians, but also to stand
upon their feet, through the which incommoditie Selim being excedingly
afflicted, and seeing his people daily to consume, with the great loss of
horses also that he had, and seeing no way how to remedy this mischefe, being
of necessitye constrained, he determined to put of this enterprse and to
return into his country meaning (that when he had assured him self of the
passages, and made better prouisyon) to return thither again ye year
folowinge and to renew the wars, and when he had taken out of Tauris a
great number of the chief Citizens, with their whole families and substanes,
and also all such as could make armor, he sent them to Constantinople and
departed with his army out of Tauris and passed the river Euphrates, and
detormyning some what to recreate his afflicted army he assailed ye town of
Mascuall and took it of force and gave it in proie to his soldiers, and in
this sort contynuinge his voyage by small and easy journeys, for that many of
his horses were so feeble that they could scaresely go he brought his army
into Licaonia, and sent them to garnisones into ye country about Iconio, at
this day called Cogni, so spoiled that they showed them selves not only, not
victoriouse, but rather defeicted overthrown, and spoiled when Selim had in
this sort placed his people in garninifones, he then sought how to supply
and furnishe them again whereupon he made a reuewe of his armies and sent into
Gretia all those that had endured and suffered most misery, to reliue them
selves, and caused new and fresh men to be sent in their places, and the
Sophie being upon the consynes of Persia, and having intelligence of the
departure of Selim from Tauris, was so discouraged, that he durst not deal
with him, by means of the overthrow which he had receaueo, and also the fear
that he had of the artillery, Nota.
and cheifely for ye that he had lost ye greatest number of his old
soldiers he durst not attempt any further, Selim determined to be revenged
of the wrong, that the prince of Adula had done him and also to assure him
self of the passages wherefore he sent Sinan Bassa with a great number of
horsemen and fotemen to spoil his country, Battle between the prince of
Adula and Synan Bassa.
and as soon as he came into his country, the prince encountered with him and
after long fight was taken by him and al his people overthrown, whereupon he
possessed all the state that he had in the mountains and sent him prisoner to
Selim, who caused to stryke of his head and to set it on the point of a
lance, and then sent it to be showed in every place through out his country
in token of victory, he then being whollye occupied in making his prouisyon
of men both on horseback and foot, of money and other monition which he meant
to use in his enterprise that he determined to take in hand the spring nerte
following, calling out of Asia and Europe, all such of his subjects as had been well trained in ye wars and had determined to winter at Iconio, for ye he
would be at hand to take in hand again the enterprise in the spring
following, the Gianizzaries being determined to go home into Gretia, went unto
him and when they saw that they could not persuade him to pass into Gretia
for that winter, Muting of the Gianizzaries.
they began to threaten him, and declared unto him, that if he would not go
with them, they would them selves go, and when they came there they would
swear obedience to his son, with the which words, Selim was marueiously
troubled, and began to suspecte, and the night following disguised him self
and with certain of his familiers with him, took the post, and ran day and
night until he came to Scuta to, and passed ye strait and discovered him
self to none, until he came within his Seraglio: where he continued three
days and would give audience to noe man and in the end being enforced by
Pernio Bascia and ye Cadi to declare the cause of his great melancholy,
answered that he was no more an Emperor, for so much as the Gianizzaries
would have enforced him, whereupon they desired him to be of good chere, and
declared unto him that he should have good means to punished them and to be
revenged upon them for their rebellion, and when they understood of him, the
chief auctours of this disorder, they wrote to all the bands of the
Gianizzaries in general, and gave them to understand the whole matter, and
the auctours of the disorder also, whereupon they so sturred them up, that
soddenly they took their weapones, and then laid hand of those which began
this matter, and brought them in cheynes to Constantinople, and presented them
before the gates of the Serraglio, and with loud voice asked pardone, puttinge
the whole defaute in their leaders, and delivered them all in cheynes,
requiringe him to put them to death, in example, to those that should come
after them, Selim accepted their exceuse and pardoned them, and put to death
all the chief of the sedition, which severity wroughte so great terror, that
Solimano his son, fcaring lest his father should have him in any sospition
by means of the words of the Gianizzaries, went to kiss his fathers fete,
being moruelously affraied, and excused his innocentie, when Selim had left
his frontiers of Europe well guarded, and had provided hoth men, and money for
his journey, he returned again to Icomo to his garnisones. In this mean time
the Sophie sent his ant bassodours to ye Sultan for aid, declaring unto him
the great peril wherein he was, and prayed him that he would have regard to
their common welthe, and send his army to unite with him. The Soldane was
maruelousty moved by the perswationes of the Persianes, great fore syghte of
the Soldane.
and understanding the great confusion and disorder into ye which the Sophie
was brought, with all his country of Persia, and fearinge lest that he,
being thus affraied should seek such peace at the hands of Selim as he
moughte obtain, and that when the Turckes had brought the Sophie under foot,
they should employe their whole force against Soria, whereupon he gave them to
understand that he would in no wise fail them but would for their welthe
hazard, both his person and all that he had else, and that they shoudle will
their prince to be of good cheer, and as soon as the spring should comme on
he would in person, with all his power of Mamalukes and other soldiers that
he could make, descend into Soria, to unite his force with his, to the end,
that when they had had united their forces, they might prenente the enemy and
go to seek him and make the wars at his own door, and for that ye Soldane
would detract no time he began immediately to levy his bands and gather his
army, and to make ready for ye enterprise on the other side when Selim
returned to his garnisions he began to supply his bands with fresh
soldiers, and to see them thorowlie furnished with money and al other
necessaries, and as soon as the spring of the year tame he assembled his
army, and put to the feelde marthing toward the mount Taurs: to pass into
Armenia and as he approached near the mountain, he had aduertizement that the
Sultan was departed from Cai to with all his ordinary bands, and a great
number of Arabianes, and came down into Soria to aid the Sophie, and to unite
his force with him, whereupon he caused to state the march, and then called to
council his Bascias and other Captains, declaringe unto them ye coming of
the Soldane into Soria, and when they had thorowlye discoursed of the matter
what was to be done therein, they allowed the opinion of Selim, which was to
preueut the enemies, Ripe judgment of Selim.
and not to suffer them to unite their forces, but to go and encountre the one
of them, Iudginge it more easy to overthrow one, then both their powers
being once united, and discoursing in him self which of them it were better
first to assayls he thought the enterprise against the Soldane mostemete, and
easyer then it of Persia against the Sophie, for that the Soldane being an
old man, and not trained in the wars, was more weak, and for that his army
had been a long time at rest, and had dealed with no enemy of great
experience in wars, but that their name was feared in all y^ east, for ye
acts which thye and their predecessors had done in time past, and being in
this sort persuaded, he determined the enterprise against the Soldane, and
marched with his army a long by the foot of the mount Tauro holdinge the way
of the right hand and so passed into Cilicia: where he understood that the
Soldane had entertained in his pay a great number of Arrabianes, and that he
was entered into Soria with, xv. thousand Mamalukes coming toward Aleppo, where
upon he made the greater haste and went toward him and when he came near to
Aleppo he understood that ye Soldane was encamped upon the river of Singa
tenmyles from that place, whereupon, he put his people in battle, and marched
on toward the enemy with great fury, and when he came within syghte of them,
he foude that the Soldane began to disiodge and to take ye feelde puttinge his
people in order in the myddest of the feelde declaring him self ready to the
battle, The battle between Selim and the Soldane.
whereupon without delaie they joined in battle, and there began a very
brave, and bloody fight, and it continued a great piece of the day without
any advantage of either side but at the last a certain number of the
Mamalukes marched on so closely in order that they were as strong as a mighty
wall, and charged the Turckes with such force, that they not being able to
endure the force and power of the Mamalukes and their horses, were enforced to
disorder and break their ranckes and by means thereof: gave them way to enter
their squadrone, and when they were comme to the Gianizzaries, they disordered
them also, and passed on until they came to their enseig nes where the Turcke
was in person, and he saying his people thus in disorder, and that there was no
means to hold them together and to keep them in order, he commanded his
master Cannoniers to discharge all their artillery at one Instante upon them,
the noise of the artillery was such, that the horses of the Mamalukes could
not endure it, but returned back and ran away scattering all over the feelde
in dispite of those that rode them, and thus by flighte, left unto their
enemies that victory, which they had all ready in their hands, they had not
lost of their people before the discharge of that volee of shot, scarcely
one thousand. The soldiers of Scilin, saying the flyghte of their enemies
began to encorage them selves, and followed them, making great flaughter of
them. The Soldane behaved him self that day like a worthy man, and did not
omit any thing that appertained to a worthy Captain, and had sondrie times
that day, supplied with great discression where need was, and where his people
were in disorder and began to flee, whereupon he was enforced to use both sayre
words, pro messes and threatinges and by these means had diverse times that
day stayed them from roning away and putting them in order again sought to
renew the fight, but he found them so amassed and stonied by means of the
noise of the artillery, to the which they were not acustomed, that they
(lainge a side all reuereuce) did not once hercken to any word ye he speak
but continued still their flyghte, and disorder, and when the Soldane saw that
he was left of his soldiers, and alone upon the feelde, he would not comme
on live into the hands of his enemies wherefore he folowinge after his people,
sought to save him self by flighte but being ercedingly hot and faintie in
his armor, for so much as he had taken upon him ye day great travail, and had
continued the hole day on horseback, without receiving meat or drink, in
the end being utterly weried, and with the force of the press of those ye
came after him, who being so affraied that they flede continually in a confused
sort, having no regard to their duetye, but every man made shyste for one,
and among them he was overthrown both horse and man, and beings once down,
being an aged man, and his armor of great weyghte, The death of Campsone Cairo
Soldane of Babilone.
he could no more rise, and having lost his force and sensses, gave up his
spirit among their horses fete, and this was the end of Campsone Cairo
Soldane of Babilone, a noble personage, and of great virtue, who found the
kingdom of Egipte, and Soria, so consumed and spoiled, by civil dissension,
and wars, y^ in short time their were stain among them selves in these
esmotiones, four Soldanes, when this man had accepted the governance, he so
reformed it, by his great wisdom and Justice, encreasyng it both with
reputation, and obedience, in such sort, that he brought it to an exceeding
great quietness and tranquillity, so that for y^ space of.xvi. years, wherein he
had governed, they had not only, not experimented what the wars were, but
also not herd them once named among them: in all y^ kingdom of Egipte, and
Soria. After this when the night came, the enemies fled fast toward Aleppo,
and left the feelde, and also their camp without defense, in proie to the
enemies, but Selim mistrusting ye fynesse of the Mamalukes, would not that
night enter into their camp, but encampted where the battle was sought,
Selim an excelent Captain.
and held a great piece of his army all y^ night in battle, and when it was
day he sent certain vante corriers to vewe the camp of the enemies, who
fynding it without defendantes, gave such aduertizeme^t whereupon Selim
marched with his army and entered y^ camp, and found the lodginges of the
Soldane full of riches and gave it in proie to his soldiers, and when he
understood that Gazzele, with the rest of ye Soldanes Captains, were departed
from Aleppo in the fourth watch, and gone to Dammasco, he marched on to
Aleppo, and when he came thither, Caserbeio, which was governor there for the
Soldane, without making any resystance at all, went forth to him and yielded
him the town, and being maruelously embraced and honored by Selim, confyrmed
the opinion of many, which was ye he had always ben a traitor to the Soldane,
and had in telligence with Selim, and also that he had aduertized him of the
coming of the Soldane into Soria, and exhorted him to leave the enterprise of
Persta, and to take in hand that of Soria against the Soldane, when Selim was
entered into Aleppo, he granted ye Citizens many liberties, and being greatly
oppressyd by the impositiones and taxes which the Soldane laid upon them, he
meaning to gratify them, and to preserve the great traffic, and encourage
the marchantes that there were and others also to comme thither with their
merchandise, he released diverse of the impositiones, and also diminished a
part of the custumes of the merchandise, and when he had continued there
certain days, he received aduertizement, that all the Mamalukes that were
left living at the overthrow of Aleppo, with Gazzele which was ye chief
Captain among them then (considering that the lord of Damasco was slain in
the battle) were determined to go and to create a new Soldane whereupon they
departed from Soria and rode toward Cairo, Selim departed from Aleppo and
marched on to ward Damasco, and when he was comme before the City with his
army, they of the City thought it not good by resystance, to put both them
selves and y^ they had in peril, whereupon they sent forth to Selim Orators,
and granted him the City, upon condittion to enjoy: both their lives and
goods, when Selim had accepted their offer, he entered into the City being
accompained only with his guard, leuinge all the rest of his army without in
camp, because the City should not by molested, nor grieved, nor the strange
marchantes that there were out of all parts of the world, the Cities of
Soria, which stand upon the sea coaste followed the example of Aleppo and
Damasco, and the principal of them were, Tripolli, Sindonia, Baruti, and
Tolemarde, which yeldyd, and received diverse bands of the Soldiers of Selim
into them, Selim determyniing to establishe the government of Soria, called a
cou^ cell in Damasco, and thither came messagers out of all the cities and
towns of the province, and he sat in the myddest of the market place, with
diverse grave and discrete councillors about him which he used always when
he gave audience openly, and there he herds, and determined many controversies,
and when he had appointed governors and officers to every town and city, and
had abolished diverse of the custumes of the ancient Soldanes as unjust, and
intolerable to the people, he did moderate them with new laws, and when he
had continued in Damasco a long time about the reforming of the country, and
had well reposed his army, he then determined in him self to make wars a
against Egipte, for so much as he understood that all the Mamalukes that were
dispersed abroad into all the cou^tres, were comme to Cairo to create a new
Soldane, and being once together, they chose Tomombeio the great Diadaro,
Tomombeio elected Soldane
a man of great reputation and credit, and of great experience, and excellent,
in the discipline of the wars, Selim being upon the point of his departure,
sent before him to make suer the way Sinan Bassa, and gave him in commissyon
to pass on to the City Gaza, and there to tarry him, and he in person
departed from Damasco with the rest of his army and followed, and being
desirous to visyte that most famous temple of Ike rusalem, took with him his
guard of Gianizzaries and a certain number of his horsemen and entered into
Judea and passed on to Iherusalem, and when he had visyted ye temple, and other
holly places of the City, he returned again to his army the next way. And
Sinan Bassa with his company which was.xv. thousand horsemen having
overthrown the Arabianes and repulsed their inuasyones which often times they
had attempted against him, and had made the passage free with much a do, and
was comme on to Gaza, which stood near unto the sea upon the confynes of
Egipte in ye place, where men enter into the sandy deserte passinge from Judea
to Eairo, and when he came before the City with his army, they of the City
willinge to avoid the sack and spoil thereof, gave place to time, and yielded
ye City unto him, where he continued, and tarried for commissyon from his lord
to direct him in those affairs. As soon as Tomombeio had received the
government, he determined forth with to supply the bands of Mamalukes which
were maruelously spoiled and consumed, wherefore he caused to enrolie all their
slaves ye were of lawful years and apt to use arms, he provided armor and
weapon for them and also horses, also he had entertained in his pay a great
number of Arabianes, and lost no time, but contynually provided artillery and
Monition, with all other necessaries, and being aduertized by those of Gaza
(which did very well affecte the Mamalukes) of the coming of Sinan Bassa,
and in what sort he lodged there. The Soldane at their request de. termyned to
send a power to encountre him, having great hope in the good will of the
Citizens, whereupon he dispatched Gazele, Sinan Bassa a discrecie and worthy
Captain
and sent him with sire thousand horses, and a great number of Arabianes, and
as soon as Sinan Bassa was aduertized of his coming, by his bands that he had
alwaie upon the feelde, not trusting them of the City, he determined to go
against him and to encountre him, and when he had rydden xv. miles, he stayed
at a village where he might well lodge, for that that in the vilage their was
a fountain very plen tuouse of pure watter, whereupon he commanded to lodge
there, and began to appointe the quartiers, and before that they had done the
alarm was given, and he was aduertized by the scoultes of his vantgarde, y^
they saw afar of a great duste, soldier like aduertizement.
wherefore they Judged the enemy to be there coming toward them, Sinan Bassa
had scarcely time to put his people in order, before that Gazele was come with
his, and began to assail his vantgard and after that they had fought a
certain space, Gazele saying his peopble ouerlaide, with uumber, and a
rtillerie, and that they began to recule, and seeing y^ they of Gaza apeared not
in his favor (in hope of whose aid he had taken in hand the battle) with
his sword in his hand did make his way through his enemies, and so returned
to Cairo with the loss of his carriage, and a great number of his soldiers,
and when Selim was departed from Iherusalem he came to his army, and brought
them to Gaza, where he found Sinan Bassa returned with great victory, and had
put to death many of ye Citizens which had procured ye Soldane to send his
people thither, when Selim had reposed his soldiers for a time in Gaza, he
determined to march on toward Cairo, and would not give the new Soldane time
to furnishe him self of new bands and to put him self in good order,
wherefore he made great provision of hogs hedes to carry watter with him, and
sent Sinan Bassa before him with his bands of Europe, and he followed him always
within one days journey with his whole army, macharea a place where the precious
bal^e does grow.
and in this sort passed on through the deserte, and came near to Cairo
within few miles, a little from a villadge named Macharea, where the Soldane
had a garden, where that most precious licour called Balsme did grow, which is
a certain goome, that distillethe through certain clestes made in the barcke
of ye trees in the time of the gathering thereof, by the gardeners, which cut
them with exceeding fine knynes made of yuorie, Tommobeio determined to tarry
the enemy in y^ village, whereupon he entrenched it very stongly with great
rampares, and deep Dykes, and had bent al his artillery upon the way where
the Turcks should come and as soon as he herd of the coming of the
Turckishe army he departed from Cairo with, twelve thou sand Mamalukes, and a
great number of Arrabianes, and other soldiers on horseback, and on foot,
and came and lodged in his lodginge that was fortified for him of purpose,
where, when he had put his people in order he tarried the coming of the enemy,
and as soon as Selim understood of the Soldanes order, he refused the way that
the Soldane had bent all his artillery upon, and would not assail his enemy
upon the frounte of his battle but determined to assail him on the flancke
where he was not so well provided, whereupon he disvanded agreat number of
shot and sent them to assail the trenches of y^ Soldane, and immediately the
Soldane marched forth with his people in order, and there began between them a
notable fight, and a furious, and having fought from the fourth hour of the
day, to the sun goinge down in very doubtful sort, even to the darcke
night, Tommabeio caused to sound the retreicte, The battle between Selim
and the Soldane.
and left the village and marched to Cairo and the Turckes as victoriouse
entered into the Soldanes lodginges and their lodged that night, there were
slain of ye party of ye Mamalukes the great Diadaro, strycken with a
falconete and of the Turckes party Sinan Bassa, Two worthy captains slain-
and when the Soldane was returned with his armies, he lodged them between the
City, and the river Nilo, and determined to supply his army with new bands
and to defend him self, and therefore sent for all the Mamalukes yt were
appointed to the guard of other contreys, and commanded them to repair to
Cairo with all speed, he took out of the Monition house of the Castle, all the
furniture of armor, and weapon, that there was and distributed it to the
children of the Mamalukes and to twelve thousand slaves which they took up in
that City, besides that he sent into Judea and Arabia, his Captains to levy
and enrolle all such horsemen and fotemen as they should find, that were
trained, and experimented in ye wars and for that he would as much as in him
was save his people from the force of the artillery, he determined with all his
power to assail his enemy in the darckest of ye night, for that he was
assured that in the night they could not well use their artillery without
the slaughter of their own people as well as of their enemies, and discovering
his opinion to certain of the chief of ye Mamalukes, he provided to put it in
execution, but he could not use the matter so secretly, but yt among those
few with whom he had debated the cause, their were some traitors which did
aduertize Selim thereof who caused to make great fyres without his camp
round about it, which made all the parts about the camp to be as well
seen as in the myddeste of the day, and in this sort provided that he moughte
well use his artillery, and then put his army in battle lookinge for his
enemies, Tommobeio in the night* approached near to the Turckes camp, and when
he saw all these fires he was then assured that his enterprise was discovered
yet would be not so return, but assailed his trenches in such sort that he
entered them and synding them very well furnished be returned again to his
lodging from whence he came, and after that (being enforced by the Mamalukes)
he was constrained to lodge within the city, and to defend it, and for that
he would provide in every respect, he caused with all speed to fortifye it and
when he had made strong the principal places thereof, Providence of Selim.
he put strong guard into them, Selim as soon as he herd that the Soldane
with his army was lodged with in the town, he marched with his army into the
town, which he moughte easyly do, for that the city was not environed with
wall, nor rampare, being within the City with his army, he fought three
days continually, with the enemy, and when he had slain a great number of
them he became lord of the greatest part of the City, and the Mamalukes
saying their force daily to de caie, and that they were no longar able to
continue in the City, went from thence to the river Nilo and took the boats
that they found there, and passed all their army with the Soldane over the
river into the Region Segesta, which is a part of Africa that liethe toward
Cirene, and Tomombeio for that he would not give over the matter, sent for
those Mamalukes that were appointed to grade the City of Alexandria, and for
y^ there came daily into his camp, Arabianes, Affricanes, and other Mores, of
ye prouices there abouts, he began to be again in good hope to defend his
own, whylest the matters of Cairo passed in this sort Gazzele whom ye
Soldane had sent into Thebaiade, to levy as many bands of both horsemen and
fotemen as he could, was come near to Cairo and had brought with him a gerat
number of Arrabianes with their Captains also, and when he understood of the
loss of Cairo, and that his lord was fied beyond the river Nilo, and being
out of all hope of the preservation of his country under the government of
the Soldane, saying it paste all remedy determined to observe time and to
pronide for his safety by yelding him self to the victour, and when he had in
this sort debated the matter with the Captains of the Arrabianes, which he
had brought with him, and had per swaded them in that behalf, he came to the
gate of Selim and required to be brought to his presence, Gazzele rendered him
to Selim-
and when he came before him, he fell prostrate to the ground and ryssed his
fete sainge, for so much as he had done for y^ preservation of the Mamalukes
state and of his lord, all that was possible for him to do, and never brake
his fait he, so long as there was any token of hope left for the preservation
of this same, and now saying his high nes possessyd of the City, and placed
in the Imperial seat, and his lord to be fled and to have left his
kingdom, wherefore he had determined with him self no longer to respste, but
trusting in his clemency, and goodness was come wholly to commit him self
into his hands with out any manner of condition at all, but to be well contentyd
with all that, that should please his highness to deteremyne of him, Selim
receuid him very corteously, and willed him to be of good comfort and to
assure him self not to want place with him mete for a man of his worthiness,
he caused him to be written among ye rest of his chief Captains, and
appointed unto him an honorable, prouisionin like sort he caused ye Captains
and chief officiers of the Arrabianes to be brought unto him, and gave them
very good words, and entertained them in his ordinary. After this he
understood of a certain man of Segesta (which was comme to seek him) of many
of the purposes of Tomombe is, and how he was contynually solycited by
certain Mores the principal, and chief of Cairo, in such sort as he was
fully determined to return thither again, when Selim understood of these
preparationes, he thought good to pre uent it, whereupon he determined to pass
the river Nilo and to seek him, and to the end that he moughte the more
spedyly pass his army, and artillery, he provided a great number of botes
and fastened them to both the shores, and then laid his bridge made of bordes
and called into the Castle such Citizens as he suspected, and ^caused them to
be safely kept, when Tomombe is under ^tode that Selim was making ready to
pass the Nilo with his army fearinge the inconstancy of the people and seeing
no way how by flyghte he might prolonge the wars, determined to prove what
fortune would do, once more in battle, wherefore he thought it good to
assail the bridge, the bridge assailed.
and to se if that he could (synding his enemies occupied in their passage
over) take them unprovided and so to onerthrowe them, whereupon he used greats
celeritie departing from Segesta in the last watch of the night and rode
with four thousand Mamalukes, and four thousand Mores and Arrabianes, and
came to the bridge before that the Turckes had understanding of his departure,
and fynding only y^ soldiers of Asta passed, with their Captatne Mastaffa
Bascia he forth with, charged them with such force, y^ the Turckes, not being
able to endure their virtue, were disordred and began to flee, in such sort
that Mustaffa not being able to keep them in order, they were excedingly
spoiled and stayne, when Selim understood of the peril that his people were
in, he hasted to the bridge in person, and sent over with such speed as he
could, aid fro^tyme to time unto them, and in short space he had put over so
many that he was Master of both ends of the bridge and when he had assured
the bridge he went in person with certain bands with him thither where y^
Soldane was syghting, and soddenly charged him, in sorts, that he enforced him
to retire, whereupon the Sol dane being out of hope of the victory,
determined with those few that he had left, by flyghte to seek to save him
self and when they had rydden three days contynually, they came to a certain
village called Secusa, and Selim determyninge to follow him wheresoever he
should go, Judgment of Selim.
did send after him Mustaffa Caterbeio, and Gazzelle with a great number of
light horsemen which when they drew near to the place where he was, and had
flayne upon the way as they came a great number of his men, and had given
commandment that all the men of that country should follow them wheresoever
they went upon great Penalty, and also appointed great reward to whosouer
should deliver him either dead, or living, when the Soldane had lost the
greatest number of his men, and fearinge the persecution of the men of the
country seeing none other mean to save him self changed his garnementes, and
departed secretly, and did hyde him in a marese there by, and covered him self
with reed and such like as did grow thereupon, but the country men being very
gredie of the reward that was promised, went and serched al secret places,
where in he moughte be hidden, whereupon certain of them went into the marese
and serched very diligently, and in the end found him hidden in the water up
to ye throat and then took him, with diverse of his chief and principal
councillors, and presentyd him bound to Mustaffa and the rest of the
Captains, who forthewith sent him an toward Cairo in miserable sort, and
presented him to Selim, who would not speak unto him but delivered him to his
mynistres and caused him to be examined with sondrie torments to make him to
confess where the treasoure of Campsone the Soldane was, and when they had
done all that they were able to do, they could not only, not cause him to
manifest it, but also could not with all their torments cause him to speak
one word the constancy of his mind was such, Constanci of Tomo^beio.
the nerte morning folowinge he caused him to be lad openly therowe the City,
to the gate called Basuela and hanged him by the neck, A lamentable end of
the valiante and noble Tomombeio.
and then put a chain of Iron about his neck and caused him continually to
hang over the gate. The cause why Selim did this cruelly, and shamefully put
Tomombeio to death, was for that, that after he was gone into ye Region of
Segesta (acording to the opinion of diverse) Selim sendinge his Orators to
him, to require him to be content and to give over and to commit him self to
the faith of Selim, who promised him great place, and dignities, the Mamalukes
contrary to all reason, and order of men, would not suffer them to comme in
his presence, but cut them in pieces, when Tomombeio was dead, he caused to put
to death all the Mamalukes and soldiers that he had in the prisonnes, and
left none on live ye were able once to hold up head against him, when the
inhabitants of Alexandria understood what was done at Cairo, they b^gan to
rebel and made an uproar, took their weaponnes and cried the name of Selim
through out the City they took upon the sodden the fortes of the City and
the Fareglion also, Fareglion the chief forte in Alexandria.
and took prisoners all the Mamalukes and officers, that the Soldane had there,
Selim determined to possess al such countres and Regiones, both he on this
side, and beyond the river Nilo: as were wont to obey the Soldanes of Cairo,
Cairo with all the provinces thereunto belonging possessed by Selim
wherefore he sent many of his Captains with their companies to take
possessyon: who syndinge none that made resystance, caused them al to swear
obedience and truth to Selim, and in short space brought all to his
devotion, moreover diverse kings of Africa which were confederate always
with the Soldanes, and did pay unto them certain tribute, when they had
vuderstandinge of the success of Selim, sent their ambassadors to renew the
confederacy, in such sort that both on this side and beyond the Nilo, there
rested not in Egipte one haven eue^ to the confines of Judea, out of the
obedience of Selim Emperor of Turckie, saving only the Arrabianes, cheifely
those that dwelled in Africa, such as from the beginning had their confines
upon the river Euphratos (and at this present have them stretched out to the
very Dceane) and after that having filled al Africa and Egipte, Digressyo^
with their multitudes, contynually erercised in wars upon the people that
confyned with them, but rather after the manner of theft, and stelthe, with
making of courses, and prays, then to unite them selves in camp, and soto

them certain ancient inimities left unto them by their predecessors they are
contynually accupied with cyuyllwarres and dissentiones the onercontynually
spoylinge the other, but retorninge now to our history, when Selim had
received the obedience and faith, of the whole Empire of the Soldane he meant
to see Alexandria before that he would depart out of Egipte, whereupon he
embarcked, and sailed down the river, and in few days arrived at Alexandria,
and when he had seen and vewed his Navy which was newlye arrived there from
Constantinople, he appointed them what to do, and when he had furnished the
Farreglion and the rest of the fortes, with bands of his soldiers and
monition, he then established the government of the City, and when he had put
to death all the Mamalukes that were there in prison he returned again to
Cairo, and took out of it five hundred housholdes, of the most noble and
principal of the City with all their children and substance, and sent them to
Alexandria to his Navy who conveyed them with all their riches and treasoure
to Constantinople, he sent thither also in diverse passagers, hired ships, a
great number of the children, and wives of the Mamalukes and when he had thus
appointed his departure he lefts in Cairo a great guard of Turckes and
appointed Carerbeio to be his lieutenante in all Egipte, ho, which at the death
of Camsone the Soldane, was governor in Aleppo, this ellection did very much
displease Iunio Bassa who succeeded in y^ place of bellagarbei of Gretia, Sinan
Bassa, who was y^ chief, and in greatest favor with the Emperor who had
promised him y^ place, he could not endure to se Carerbeio a new man to be
preferred before him, and not being able to disse^ble his wrath, began to
gouerue y^ that was committed to his charge ouerthwartli, and troublonsly, The
pay of the soldiers (...)
chiefly such as might seem i^ any respect to touch Carerbeto whereof when
Selim was aduertized he called to mindother displeasures also, and began tohate
hi^ excedi^gli whereof afterward proceeded his death as shall be declared
hereafter y^ soldiers with were lest at Cairo required their lord that they
moughte have their pay augmented, who commanded Iunso Bassa to see it done
and to cause the treasorer that he left there to do acording to his order,
when the Emperor was departed from Cairo Iunio semyd not to remember it, and
gave no order at all in that behalf, wherefore it followed, that when Selim was
gone from Cairo into Judea, and that the pay came, the soldiers had not
their entertainment encreasyd, whereupon they began to Mutyne and rebett
against Carerbeio, and he excused him self, and caused them to send with all
speed after the Emperor and to complain unto him or their wrong, they sound
him near unto Iberusalem, declaring how that at ye time of their pay they
received nothing but their ordinary and that the Treasurer declared that he
had no commission to augment their pay, they declared unto him also, that to
live there was very chargeable and that their ordinary was not able to
maintain them there, whereupon Selim was excedinglye wroth for that that his
order which he left, was not put in execution, and adding to this diverse
other complaints which he had received from Cairo, of the behavior of Iunio,
cheifely touching the families that were sent to Constantinople, whereupon he
commanded him to comme to him, and as soon as he came to him he commanded him
forth with to be hanged, and when he had established the government of
Palestina, he went into Soria, and appointed Gazzelle to be governor of
Damascs, Note this great voyage, to lead an army so far by land.
one of the Captains of Campsone, he appointed also a governor to Aleppo, and
to all the rest of the towns of the province leuinge them all well furnished
with all kind of monition, and men. And determyninge to provide for the
defense of Soria against y^ Sophie, he left Mustaffa Basria in Cilicia, at the
foot of the Mount Tauro with xl. M. horsemen, and when he had this done he
determined to go home into Gretia, and coasted all alonge the sea side of the
lesser Asia and so passed into Bithinia to the City of Bursia, and from thence
passed on to ye Golfe and fyndinge his Navy ready there he embarcked his
soldiers of Europe and then sailed on to Constantinople, and when he was
there arrived he sent his people to garnison, and consumed all that winter in
visiting the towns of Gretia, and late in Castoria, a long time and took great
pleasure in chasinge, when the spaynge of the year came, he went from thence
into Remania, and gave order to make ready his Naute, and caused them to take
out of the Arsenale, all his Galleys, fustes, and Palandres, willinge them to
be brought into Propontide, and in short space he had between Gallipolli, and
Constantinople, upon the sea, more then two hundred Galleys beside his other
ships with all their tacle, and furniture, and having alredie sent to the
foreste many carpentres, he caused to cut a great quantity of timber which
caused many men to think y^ he made this provision to emploie it upon the
Isle of Rhodes, notwithstanding that then, and afterward, there were diverse
that thought it not made for Rhodes, but to be employed against Italy, and in
the end when every thing was ready he commanded them to roe down to the
mouth of the strait and there to ride, and every man thought y^ within few
days they should have been paid, and commanded to set sail and to do sum
great enterprise upon the sodden: which few understood, after this their came
commandment soddenly, that forthewith they should discharge and vnrigge the
Navy, and license y^ maryners to go home to their dwellinge places, after
this the cause of this great preparation, and the soodden disoluinge thereof,
could never be understand, yet sum men think that a sycknes that then was
come upon Selim was the cause thereof. When he had vnrigged his Navy, he
departed from thence to Andrinople, and seminge to take some pleasure in the
chase, he lay in little villages about it and consumed the rest of the summer
there, with y^ Automne also, and the winter folowinge after this, there
appeared in the raines of his back, an incancred appostume, which did so eat
his flesh ye a man moughte have put into the sore his whole hand and they did
cut away y^ flesh round about it which was so dead that he felt it not.
And I will not here omit a notable matter, which was declared unto me in
Florence of him (by a Persian of ye Mahometane religion) having for my turciman
a citizen of ours named Iohu Cerini, and it is this, that on a time as his
disease did grow and increase upon him, restinge his head upon the thing of
Perino one of his Bascias, he said unto him Perino I do consume, and must dye
within short space without all remedy, upon the which words the Bascia took
occasion to talk further with him, and said unto him my lord, if thou know y^
thou must dye, why doeste not thou give order for the disposinge of those
goods which at thy commandment were arrested and taken from the merchants
called Aggiammi in Bursia which are subject to the Sophie thine enemy, the
goods are worth at y^ least, certain hundredes, of thousands of gold
ducates, and if thou should now dye and not give order in that behalf they
should be conveyed, and stolen away, were it not better that thou should
bestow them upon so^me hospitale, A notable answer of Selin being a hethe^
prince.
whereunto Selim answered, would thou that I should honor my self with the
goods of other men and to bestow them in vertuose worckes in the remembrance,
and commendation of me I will never do it, whereupon Perino replied, saying,
what would thou then that there should be done with them? He answered, that
they be delivered to them from whom they were taken, and also he called to his
remembrance, y^ there were three thousand ducates of a Florentyne son to one
Thomaso de Aiolfo, he commanded also that they should be delivered unto him,
Whereupon after that, the money, merchandise and sylkes that were arrested in
Bursta, were delivered to the owners and he that reported this was one of them,
and had received a great quantity again and had brought of the same salkes to
Florence two fardells, and this is spoken to confound many of our Christian
princes, among whom in the like case, it is a very hard matter to find one,
that shall have such remorse of conscience, but now to our history when Selim
was in this sort consumed with his disease, in the end of the monethe of
Septem her, the vere of the Christian health. 1520. having in right years
which was the time of his reign, brought to pass so many maruelouse
enterprises, the reign of Selim, the death of Selim*
he ended his life, in whose place succeeded Solimanno his only son a young
man of great worthiness in whom their was great hope for the great modesty
that was in him, he was of the age of. xxviii years, and being in Natolia, y^
news were brought him fleing of the death of his father, wherefore in the
beginning he was in doubt of them, fearing lest it had been feigned by the
commandment of his father wherefore he would not stir at all out of Natolia
till such time as Perino Bassa came into Natolia to him, who did not only
assertaine him of it, but also constreyned him to pass over into Gretia to
Constantinople, where, as soon as he was arrived, he was received and coronned
without any co^tradicti on at all, and accepted Emperor with the vntuersall
joy and contentacion of his subjects, and in this sort he accepted the
government, using in all his determynations y^ council of Perino Bassa, whom
he honored as though he had been his natural father, in this mean time when
the death of Selim was published in Egipte and Soria it did greatly move the
people of those countres, and Gazelle being pricked with ambition persuaded
him self that he moughte recover both Egipte, Gazele reuolte. he.
and Sorta and erecte again y^ of state the Mamalukes, acording to y^ ancient
order thereof under the Soldanes whervppon he caused the City of Damasco first
to rebelle, and possessyd it, calling him self openly lord there of, and
utterly cast from him all obedience toward ye house of Ottomanno, which
brute when it was sprede abroad throw the province, caused all the Mamalukes
that were left, which were hidden in Asia, and Africa, to comme unto him, and
then according to their anient custume they created him Soldane, who made all
preparation possible to defend his state, and gathered together a great number
of Arrabians, and of the coun^res near about him, and sent his ambassadors
to Cairo to desire, Carerbeio to join with him and to help to restore the
Mamalukes state to his ancient liberty, offering him to give him what part of
the domynion y^ he would, yea, to resign unto him his place and to make him
Soldane, when Carerbeio had given public audience to his ambassadors, and
understood their demand without gyuing them any answer, caused his
Ministers to cut them in pieces, and having also proved Aleppo and diverse other
Cities of Soria, he found none that would join with him in this enterprise,
whereupon he determined to defend him self as well as be moughte and levied in
all countries, such bands as he could get to serve him, when the news of
the rebellion of Da masco was comme into Gretia Solimanno commanded forthwith
the Bellagarbei of Cillicia which was appointed for the guard of the lesser
Asia with.xl. M. horsemen, to go thither who entered into Soria, acompained
with the lieutenantes of Aleppo, and of the rest, of the cities of that
province and came before Damasco with his army in battle, he was not so sone
comme before the City, but Gazzelle having determined for only remedy to
hazard the battle, and would rather dye honorable with his sword in his
hand, then to be delivered by some practice: lyuinge into his enemies hands,
whereupon he marched forth of the City with his army and put his people in
battle, and then marched on with a noble mind to encountre his enemy, who
marched also toward him, The battle between the Belagarbei of Cilicia, and
Gazzelle.
and without delaie joined in battle and fought for a long time with
great assurance on both parts, the virtue and discipliue of Gazzelle, and of
those few Mamalukes that were with him was such that notwithstanding they were
excedingly ouerlaid with number yet for y^ space of certain hours they so
endured the force of their enemies that they were nothing at al disordered nor
gave to their enemies one foot of place in the end: having slain a great
number of their enemies and many of them being flayne also, and the rest in
manner all hurt, being ouercomme with very weary nes, and not able to use their
weapones, and Gazzelle finding him self environed by the Turckes, fought
valiantly against them till at the last he fell down dead from his horse
among them, Gazzelle diethe honorably.
the Mamalukes being in the end disordered, and seeing no way by flighte how
to save them selves determined to dye like worthy men with their weapones in
their hand, The noble end of the Mamalukes.
and so fought to y^ vttermoste, in such sort, that very few were taken
living by the enemies. As soon as Mustaffa Bassa had obtained this victory, he
came forthwith with his army be fore the City, the Citizens made no resystance
but openned the gates and received the Bassa with such people as he would with
him, into the town, who entered acompanied with few, for that he would not
have the City spoiled nor ye marchantes which were: there out of all parts
of the world to exersyse their traffic, he pardoned the Citizens and
confirmed their liberties and freedoms which Selim had given unto them he
lodged his army without the City, and in this sort dispatched the rest of
the Mamalukes. And established Soria, and all ye provinces of Egipte in
perfect peace, which were wont to obey unto Selim, leuinge them under ye reule
of Solimanno Ottomanno their lord.

FINIS.
A COMMENTARY OF THE WARS OF THE TVRCKES MADE against George Scanderbeg
prince of Epirro and of the victories obtained by the said George, as well
against the Emperoures of Turchie, as other princes, and of his rare force and
virtue worthy of memory.
SCanderbeg prince of Epirto was son to the lord John Castrioth, ye which
possessid y^ part of Albania, that was called Emathia, and Tumenestia: and the
mother of Scander beg was named Volsaua, she was daughter to the prince of
Pollogo, which is a part of Macedonia, and also of Burgaria, this John was a
worthy man, and of great Judgment and experience in the wars, and having
wars with Amorathe Ottomanno prince of the Turckes, and seeing him to be wexed
very stonge in Gretia, and Albania, in such sort as in the end he was not
able to encountre him, wherefore he made peace with him, and for hostages
delivered him his sons, which were Repossio, Stanissa, Constantino and this
Scanderbeg which was then named George, but when this tiran Amorathe caused
him in his chyldhod to be circumcised, he gave him the name of Scanderbeg,
which in our speech is, lord Alerandre, and after that, the Turcke caused him
to be instructed acording to the rite and custume of the Mahometane sect
Amorathe truly seemed to be exceeding glad when Scanderbeg (being a child but
of eyghte years of age) was brought to his presence, and saying him beautiful
and to have a majesty in his countenance, he iugged in him self that if he
should live long, he would prove a worthy man, wherefore he determined never
to suffer him to return home again, but to keep him in his court, to the
end that when he was comme to y^ state of a man he should serve him, and
therefore appointed him worthy masters to instruct him, and to be careful for
him and to se him brought up in lerning, and civility he allowed both for his
table and apparel even as if he had been his own son. After this when
Scanderbeg was something grown he delighted to ride, and to run, and also
with his co^mpaniones to use the lance, and y^ rabattued sword, and he did
excede them all both on horseback, and on forte, and chiefly if it were in
y^ presence of Amorathe, who had great felicity of se little boys in such
exercises, and did maruelously rejoice to se such force and towardnes in
Scanderbeg who always remained victoriouse. After this when the Turcke made
wars against any prince, he commanded to bring Scanderbeg always with him
whythersoeuer he went and when so ever he sought with his enemies Scander beg
behaved him self so well that all the Turckes maruellyd at his doings and
would say among them selves, that if he might live till he came to perfect
age no man should be able to continue against hem. When Scanderbeg was come to
y^ age of.xix. years. y^ Turcke made him a Sangiacco, which is as much to say
as a conductour of sondrie, bands, and gave him ye leadinge of five thousand
horses, and some time the title of geuerall of an army which in the Turckishe
speech is called Bassa, sending him against his enemies, accompanied with mani
other Sangiachi which were appointed to be directed by him, and to be at his
commandment, and being in that part of the lesser Asia that is called
Natolia, and having many rencountres with his enemies he always made great
slaughter of them and departed from them with the victory, by means whereof?
he took many towns and Cities of that country and brought them under the
obedience of the Turcks, who from that time forth, would always say that
Scanderbeg was his right arm, his heart, and his eye, and his most assured
defendour, and augmentour of his dominions, whereupon all the rest of the
Turckes did marueloslye love him, and had him in great estimation. After this
Scanderbeg being of the age of.xxv. years and attending upon his lord in
Andrinople, being in the company of many noble men, A Tartare chalengethe.
there came thither a Tartare of a great stature, and an exceeding force, and
challenged to fight with any man in all the Turckes court to ye utterance and
there was no man that durst to answer his chaleng, for that the brute was
that he never fought with any but that he overcame him, and had stain many
men in the like combattes when Scander beg saw this, he went to the prince and
declared unto him and to all the noble men there, that he would encou^tre him,
and fight with him to the death, but his lord with all the rest of the noble
men, would in no wise agree unto it, but were all very sorye to see him so
disposed, yet for all that, he made so ernest request and continued it with
such Instancie, that in the end with great difficulty he obtained his
request, and then made him ready and went in the presence of them all with
great as to encountre this Tartarre, who disdained him even as Goliathe did
David, and said that it grieved him much to fight with so young a man, wherefore
Scanderbeg was excedingely wroth with him, and struck at him and so behaved
him self in the combatte that in the end he obtained y^ victory and slew
the Tartarre. Shortly after Amorathe went to Bursia: a City of Bithinia where
two soldiers of Persia one named Iaia and y^ other Za^psa which made a like
challenge to that that y^ Tartarre made sauinge that they would fight on
horsbackes with lance, sword, and Targe, whereupon as soon as the challenge was
made, Scanderbeg made ready and encou^tred with Iaia and as they were ernestly
fightinge, this cruel Zampsa assailed him in treason, but Scanderbeg
discoraged not at all for that but assured him self in god, and put on a noble
mind and within short time he slew them both, for the which notable acto he
was much praised of all those that were there present, after this y^
Hungarians came to make wars upon the Turckes and to enuade their country
wherefore Sca^derbeg was sent Captain general, with a great army against
them, and in that enterprise he behaved him self so discretely and
circumspectly that the Hungarians returned again without battle. He always
had that attended upon him Christianes of his fathers subjects, who always in
structed him in the Christian faith which he had received at his Baptesme,
wherefore he found the means that the Hungarianes returned without battle
and be also returned with his army safe to Andrinople, where he was excedingly
embraced of the Turcke and honored with great presents, and he said to his
most famylier fryndes, that the Hungarianes feared the virtue and worthynes of
Scanderbeg and therefore returned and would not give battle, he desired
Scanderbeg to require some great gift of him but Scanderbeg aunsweringe very
modestly said that he required nothing but to dwell in his good grace, and
favor, wherewith he should hold him very well satisfied, when they had ended
these discourses, The father of Scanderbeg deceassed.
news came that the lord John father to Scanderbeg was deceassyd whereupon
Amorathe in all haste dispatched a Captain of his named Sehalia `with an army
into Albania who as soon as he came thither took y^ City of Croia with the
whole state of the lord John, to the behofe and use, of the hostages, gyuing
the people to understand, that the great Turcke would immediately deliver it
to one of the sons of the prince John deceased, but after that, the Turcke
performed noe one thing y^ the Bassa had promised in his name to the people,
Three of the brethren of Sca^derbeg poisoned.
but kept all y^ contre to his own use, and caused three of the brethren of
Scanderbeg secretly to be poisoned, and fed him with goodly words, keeping
him always in good hope desyring him to have patience for a little time and
that as soon as he had dispatched certain affares, he would restore him to all
that which was his right to have, and he should be always assured of his
good will and frynd ship, but Scanderbeg like a wise man, and one that well
knew his determynation to be full of cruelty and wickedness, declared him
self to be w^ll contented with whatsoever should be his good will and
pleasure, notwithstanding, in wardly he was full of sorrow and heaviness, and he
thought on nothing day nor night, but how to find some means, by the
which he moughte bring to pass to enjoy that patrimony which was his
fathers, and to live in liberty of conscience as a Christian ought to do, and
the rather for that he was out of hope to be delivered by the Turcke, and to
be restored to his right. After these things, when the year was ended, the
Hungarianes at the request of the pope Eugenio, assembled a mighty army and
went against the Turcke in the behalf of the dispotto of of Seruia, which when
the Turcke understood, he gathered together his army, and sent the Bassa of
Romania Captain general of the same, being acompanied with Scanderbeg, to
the end that by his help, he moughte the more assuredly obtane victory, and
contrarily, Scanderbeg prayed to god that it would please him to give y^
Hungarianes the victory. And in the end the two armies metinge near the
River called Moraua, joined in battle. And the discipline and virtue of John
Hu^niade, Captain general of the Hungarianes was such, by the help of god
that the Turckes after a long fight were disordered, and put to flyghte, with
exceeding great flaughter and spoil of them, Scanderbeg did maruelously
rejoice for this victory, and yet he fled among the Turckes, till he came to
a secret place, where he was safe from peril, and afterward when it was
night, the Turckes chief secretary came unto him and said. O Scanderbeg what
doeste thou here, thou which never was seen to flee or this time? Scanderbeg
descretly aunswering said, that the power of man, moughte not resyste the will
of god, wherefore there was no remedy but patience, and when he had thus said,
he commanded to lay hands on the Secretary, and to set yronnes upon his
legs, where with be being excedingely amassed said, that it semyd strange
unto him, consydering his faithful service always, and that he had never
offendyd his lord y^ Turcke ne yet Scanderbeg, then Scanderbeg smyling
au^swered that he held him so for no cause, but only for that he should not
stele away, A policy of Sca^.
and for that he should make him a letter, in y^ name of the Turcke to the
governor of Croia, that forthwith upon syghte thereof: he should deliver the
City to Scanderbeg, as governor in the name of the Turcke, and he would also
that the Secretary should go with him, and he would give him greater place
then that which he had with the Turcke, and would ever esteem him for his dear
frynd, and brother.

The Secretary answered with a troubled countenance, that he would not make
such a letter for any thing in the world, whereupon Scanderbeg drew his
sword and threatened to kill him if that forth with he made not the letter,
whereupon he being excedingly affraied took pen, yncke, and paper, and wrote
the letter accordingly as Scanderbeg gave him instruction in the Turckishe
language, he could not deceive him therein for Scanderbeg understood well the
Turckishe tongue, the Arabian, the Greek, and the Schiauon, when this was done,
The secretary of the turcke slain.
Scanderbeg wylled the Secretary to go with him, but he refused utterly so to
do whereupon he caused him soddenly to be slain to that end, that he should
not go and declare the matter to the great Turcke, and in this sort he was
prevented.

Then Scanderbeg with three hundred Albaneses, valiante and faithefull men, who
had always served him and were well trained and experimented in the wars
took his way, and rode very secretly, and spedyly, and in short time aryued
in Albania, where he found certain of the Turckes soldiers, whom he caused
very cortesly to souppe with him, and after sondrie pleasante discourses, asked
them if that they had herd any thing of the cause of his coming thither, who
answered him no, then he declared unto them that for sondrie respects, the
Turcke had sent him to change the governor of Croia and to supply that place
for a season, whereupon they au^swered al at once franckly, that they were
assured that he was sent for some greatter purpose then that, consydering, that
they were well assured that the Turcke loved him as his brother, and one of
them, offered to go before with the messager that he sent, to certyfye the
governor of Croia hereof, wherewith Scanderbeg was well contentyd, and sent
them before to Croia with speed. As soon as the governor understood the Tenor
of the letter, he made ready to do, all that was commanded him in that
letter. Afterward when Scanderbeg came into Croia, becaused to take down the
Turckes enseigne and to set up his with the splayed Egle of sable in a feelde of
gules, The enter of Scanderbeg into Croia.
and they cried in every place long may Scanderbeg live, and then he caused
to sley all the Turckes that would not be baptized, and in four days he
recovered all his fathers country, and by that twenty days were ended, he had
possessyd all that which the Turcke had woonne in Albania, and cut in pieces as
as many Turckes as he found there, in sort, y^ in an in sta^te he became
prince of Albania, where he had of yerly rent two hundred thousand ducates,
accomptinge his salt pittes which he hade near to Saint Nicolo dela Pietra,
where Cesare the Dictator, fought that terrible battle with Pompeio, his
father in law, Captain general of the Roman army.

When the Albaneses were thus delivered from the Tiran, and from his wicked and
cruel government, and from the intolerable yoke of the infydelles, they
thancked god in every place, and they cried through out, long may our
prince Scanderbeg live, and in few days Scanderbeg had an army of.xv. M.
Albaneses well trained in the wars, some on horseback, and some on foot then
ho appointed officers of se Justice duly executed, Note his age.
and appointed Captains to his towns and fortes in y^ year of our lord.
M.CCCC.xliii. and in the year from his birth xxxiii.

When the Turcke did understand this fynosse of Scanderbeg, and the victory
of the Hungarianes, he had so great sorrow, as in all his life he had not had
y^ like wherefore he determined to be revenged and to employe all his force
against Scanderbeg, but Scanderbeg being very wise and one that know what he
had to do, being aduertized of the Turckes determination and purpose, went to
Alessio, a City in Albania, then under the government of the Venetianes,
where at his request all the princes held a council, with the rest of the
nobility of Albania: of whom these that follow were y^ chief Aramthe Conino
which was afterward father in law to Scanderbeg, Andrea Thopia, Paulo
Ducagino, Nicolo, Pietro, Spano, Lech Dusmano Leche Zacharia, and the honorable
lieutenantes of the Senate of Venise, to whom Scanderbeg spoke in this form.
The oration of Scan.


Very honorable fathers and magnificent princes. I doubt not, but that it is
well known to us with how great inimitie, and dispite, the Turckes do
persecuteour most Christian faith, and how greatly they are enemies to all
virtue, and especially: they never keep any promese that they make, and if
their power were agreeable to there will, they would make all Christian princes
to pass by the edge of the sword, as by experience it has been seen here to
fore, when god for our offenses has permitted it, yet I by the mighty arm
of god have chased the usurpers of my fathers state, out of it, and have cut
all the Turckes in pieces that made any resystance against me, and besides
that, I have won all that which ye Turcke did possess in Albania as it is
manifest to all men, wherefore your excellenties may be well assured, that
that cruel dog, will employe all his force possible against me, and that with
speed and if that by chance (which god forbydde) he should ouercomme me, he
would immediately make wars upon you, wherefore I do erhorte, and erneslly
desire your highnesses, that for the love you hear toward god and our most
holly faith, and also for charity, that it will please you to vouchesafe to
unite your forces with mine, and if it seem not good unto you so to do, for so
much as you are at peace with the Turcke, yet I shall ernestly desire you, to
stand by, and nether to aid the Turcke nor trouble me, and hereof I do
attend your gentle answer, for that that I hope with the mighty right hand
of god, to defend my self against y^ great Tyran. Then all the princes and
noble men of Albania, withdrewe them selves with the lieutenantes of the Senate
of Venise, and went to talk in secret, and when they had considered, and
debatted the importancie of the matter, they made answer to Scanderbeg in
this sort, most excellent prince George, our dear son and brother, as
touching your age, but in respect of your virtue and worthynesse, our
honorable father, we have very well considered, and weyed thy just, and most
necessary demand, full of wisdom, and worthy in every respect to be
herd, wherefore we give you to understand by common consent, that we are
determined to unite our powers with the for ever and to esteem thy state as our
own, and our state as thine, and will continue this league according to our
promise in wealth and misery, which of them that god shall send, moreover we
make y^ our Captain general, to defend our liberty, hoping in the mighty
god that there is no power, that shall be able to resyste our most holly union,
wherefore be of good comfort, and make provision of such things as shall be
necessary, and command, for you shall not want, and also we will allow you
a yearly stypende toward your own maintenance, and you shall not lack that
that we shall be able to do in any respect, when this most holly league was
concluded, the aforesaid princes of Albania went and dyned with Scanderbeg
their new lord, and thancked god of this concord, and then some of them took
leave and returned to their provinces, and others accompained Scanderbeg to the
city of Croia.

A brief declaration of the chief princes of Albania included in the
aforesaid league
GEorge Castrioth, else named Sca^derbeg, appointed Captain general by their
common consent, desernethe to be first named, after him his father in law
Aranith Conino, then the sons of Musachio Thopia, called of many Carlnich
which in the Schianuon tongue betokennethe gloriouse, and they are called the
sons of Charles, for so much as they are descended from the house of
France, then were the lords of the house of Ducagini, and the noble men of
the house of Spain, the lords Cernouichi, and Dusmani, but the Venetianes would
not enter into this league for the good will they bare to the house of Angelo,
which is descended from the Imperial house of Constantinople on the one side
and on the other: from that of the dispotto of Scruia, and of y^ noble
princess Margaerite of Monferato, duchess of Mantoa, who beside her other
patrimony, had diverse parcells in Albania, and chiefly Driuasto, Antiuari
and Croia: and possessethe at this present Antiuari and Dolcigno, with other
places that have not howed the knee before the Idol Baale, which is Mahomethe,
and it may please god to give them the grace to convert the Turckes and other
infidelles to our most holly faith, or else to ouerthro we their great powers
as diverse times Scanderbeg has done.

Sum man might ask me here, from whence Albania had his name? Whefore you
shall understand that Plinio in his Book entitled de Hominibus Illusiris in
the third Chapter, The original of the Albaneses.
does declare, how y^ Tullio hostilio the third king of the Romans, when
he had destroyed the City of Alba, which was not far distante from Rome, and
had been often times enemy unto it, commanded that the Albaneses should come
and dwell at Rome, but a great number of them (acordinge to the opinion of
diverse writers) went into Asia and dwelled among the people thereof which
possessed the country y^ lies between the mountains called hiberi and Caucast
y^ Albaneses increased, and multiplied from time to time so that at the last,
their country was called Albania Iberia, which this same Plinio describes in
y^ vi book of his natural history, and in the third chapter, from whence
one part of the Albaneses departed, and came down into Europe, of whom the
one part dwelled in Epirro, others in Macedonia, sum, in one part of
Liburnia which at this present is called Esemptia ye loer near unto Macedonia
and Epirro, some dwelled in a certain part of Dalmatia: and Illiria which is
called ye hie Esemptia near unto that part of Liburnia where of we spoke
before, when the Albaneses had long continued in the aforesaid countres, they
were so increased and multiplied that of all those provinces was made one
Region and government, and was called Albania for that it was inhabited by y^
Albaneses who so named it, other some say that the Albaneses are descended
from France, peradventure for that they see a natural frindshippe between the
noble men of both the cou^tres, which thing is perfectly known by certain of
their princes as by the lords of Durazzo, surnamed Thopia which are descended
from Charles the great, some other from Meschino, and sum from others, and
for a token of good will, Charles is made in the City of Croia of an excellent
stone, engraven with great skyll and, art and set in the chief place of the
City, others say they are descended from Griffon de Altafoglia as the house
of Ducagine and the house of Spagni as ye noble men of both houses them selves
say.

Let all men know that this new Albania which is this discribed, liethe in
Europa, it is very fertile and plentyfull of al things nedfull to y^
maintenance of man's life as is possible, it brings forth men naturally so
strong, valiaunte, of noble minds, and apt to any thing that they take in
hand, chiefly, for the wars as is possible, they are constant and faithful
to their natural lords, and will rather commit them selves, to all kind of
danger and peril, then to have their displeasure, the fardest part of this
Albania is near to the seas Adriatico, and Ienio, and liethe over against
Puglia, froo^ Durazzo to Brindizio, is an hundred miles and from Valoua over to
Ottranto three score miles by sea. Now to our purpose.

After all these things there came aspiall from Andrinople to Scanderbeg, and
declared unto him y^ Alibege, one of the Turckes Bassas came against him
with.xl. M horsemen, then Scanderbeg without delay rode to his confynes
with.xv. M. Albaneses, and when y^ Turckes were comme within two miles of him,
A perfect Captain must be able well to speak his mind.
he made an oration to his army whereby he did so encorage his soldiers, that
they desired nothing so much as to encou^tre with the enemy, in this mean
time the Turckes came on with such a noise, that it seemed that the heavens
should fall, but Scanderbeg with his worthy soldiers refused not to encountre
them, but made ye sign of the cross upon him, and then he cried follow me,
and thruste toward them and was the first that struck, and charged them with
suck force and virtue, that in short time he disordered them, and when the
battle was ended, there were found dead on the place.xxii. 22. thousand
Turckes slain.
M. Turckes, and there were taken a thousand, of the Christians many were
hurt and one hundred stayne upon ye place all the spoil of the Turckes as
money, Iuelles, horses and such like, was presented to Scanderbeg, who cansed
it wholly to be disstributed to his soldiers, which were all very joyful.
The next day Scanderbeg commanded to sound to horse and rode into the
Turckes country a great days journey, and cut in pieces as many Turckes as he
met or could find, and raised fire in all places where he went. In this
mean while Alibeg Bassa returned to Andrinople, and was greatly blamed by the
Turcke for his evil government.

Laodislao king of Hungary, who then made preparation to go against Amorathe
with an army, sent to Scanderbeg (understanding of y^ great victory y^ he had
obtained against him) to desire him that he would go in his company, with such
bands of soldiers as he should think good, wherefore when Scanderbeg had
read his letter, he called unto him his Captains showing them the letter and
asking their advise in y^ behalf, who answered by one consent that he might
in no wise refuse ye king in so reasonable a demand, for y^ it was for the
destruction of the common enemy of our faith, then Scanderbeg wrote unto the
king Laodislao that he moughte assure him of all the aid that he should be
able to give him, and then Scanderbeg by ye help of Paulo Ducagino and other
princes of his nation had levied other xv. M men, besides those that he had
alredie under his conducte with whom he defeicted the aforesaid Alibeg, which
amounted in the whole to the number of xxx. M. and then he began to march, but
George Vucouich dispotto of Seruia a man valiante enough, but of a traitorouse
mind, and regarded not any religion, neither Christian nor Mahometane, for
that he had given Amorathe to wife, his daughter named Hierenia, and of some
Catagusina, which was sister to the wife of Alessio Spano called Isabetta, and
of some others Milizza, which was sister to Lazaro, Stephane, and Georgio,
Nephews to Andrea Augelo by there mother side, for certain hatred that the
Dispotto bare to the Hungarianes, and chiefly to John of Transyluania, who had been the cause that certain castles and towns of his were holden from him
whereupon the Dispotto fortyfied all the passages of his country, whereby he
troubled Scanderbeg in such sort that he could not pass without great
loss of his people into Hungary.

In this mean time John with the Hungarians, and Polonianes, being aided also
by Iuliano Cesarino Cardinal S. Angelo, made ready his army to march toward
Varna, where they must needs fight: and Amorathe looked for aid out of Asia
to comme to him and therefore avoided by all means possible the battle and
prolonged the wars as much in him was, Science of John Vaiuoda of
Transyluania.
and would not comme to the battle, which when the worthy Vayuoda
understood, he procured him to the scaramoche in so skylfull sort, that in the
end he enforced him to come to the battle, and in the end after long
fight the virtue of the Hungarianes was such, that ye Turckes were disordered
and put to flyghte, The battle between Laodislao and Amorathe
when Laodislao understood this, he became excedingly wroth, by means of the
talk of certain folyshe and ambitious yong^ men, who said, that John Vaiuoda
sought to have all the glory of the victory to him self, which was y^ cause
that he appointed the king, always to tarry within his squadrone, Ambition of
rayshe young me^ distroiethe all.
the king being moved with these words marched forward with his troop of
ten thousand Hungarianes, which was very strong, and fronted y^ Turckes great
squadrone, where after long and cruel fight Laodislao, was stayne, by means
whereof, the Hungarianes which were even ready to follow the victory, were
constrained to torue back again and to loose al-in such sort that John
Vaiuoda their Captain general was enforced to flee to the house of the
aforesaid Dispotto of Seruia as to a place of security, but he being the
only cause of this overthrow (for so much as he suffered not Scanderbeg to
pass through his country) caused Vaiuoda to be kept under good guard forth
with, until such time as he restored him to al his towns, Sca^derbeg sought
contynually to pass through the country of the Dispotto, and hearing of this
miseral le chau^se was in such a rage that he brunte and sacaged all y^ country
of the Dispotto, and returned into his own country and as he went homewarde he
met with diverse Hungarianes that were at the battle of Varna he declared
that he was erceding sorry for it and how he was coming to aid them, and gave
money to every of them to help them with.

After all these things Amorathe the great Turcke sent an ambassador to
Sca^derbeg with a letter of this tenor, Amorathe writethe to Scan.
Scanderbeg by this my letter.

I Amorathe Emperor of all the east part of ye world may not salute the
more nor less for that thou art become my greatest enemy, and haste used me
with such ingratitude considering that I brought the up and norrished the even
as thou had ben my natural son, and always sought to do the honor and
thou have now rebelled against me, and have done me great displeasures as thou
right well know, and all men may witness thereof, and I know not from
whence it does proceed, unless thou waste angry with me because I did not so
sone restore the to the dominions of thy father or else for that thou have
always ben minded to refuse the faith of the perfete Mahomethe and to
return, as thou haste now done, to the Christian faith to the loss of thine
own soul, truly if I had understood this desire of thine I would have done,
what thou woldeste have required me, and that thou know well (as I have
always declared unto the) that I would pleasure the in any request that thou
would make to me, for I was so bound (consydering they rare virtues) to
favor the above all others, and thou know that I promised the within short
space to restore the to all thy fathers dominion, and for that thou have done
contrary to thy duty, thou art certaynely worthy of great blame and of my
displeasure, yet not withstandinge when I do consider the virtuous acts
which in time passed thou haste done in my service and conservation of my
state, I am enforced to qualifye mine ire toward the: and am contented y^
thou possess the inheritance of thy father, upon condition, that thou restore
unto me y^ part of Albania, which I have gotten from others and not from thy
father, which thou against all right have spoiled me of, and holdeste it
without my good will, wherefore se that thou do restore it unto me, orels I
swear unto the by god, and by his prophet Mahomethe, by the soul of my
father, and by my sword, that I will employe all my force against the, and
will chase the out of that country in dispite of the, and if that peradventure
thou escape with life, you shall be enforced to beg thy bread. Thou know
well that beside all mine other forces. I can put to the feelde more then a
hundred and fyfty thousand fightinge men, and thou having but a handful of
soldiers art not able to resyfte me. I say these things unto the, because
I would not hurt thee, I have set before thee, the good, and the evil, it is
now in thy chose to take whether of them thou will, and thou maiste credit
my servant and am bassadour Airadin and whatsoever he shall promise by mouth I
will fulfill, from Andrinople the. 16. of June. 1444.

When Scanderbeg had read the letter, and heard the ambassador, he made him
to be entertained very honorably, and after five days he dispatched the
ambassador, and delivered him a letter of answer, of this tenor folowinge.

George Castrioth some time named Scanderbeg, An answer to the turcks letter.
prince of the Albaneses, sendethe salutaciones infinite to the lord Amorathe
prince of the Turckes, by Airadin thy seruante and ambassador, I have received
a letter, in the which for good beginning thou say you can not salute me
more nor less, whereunto I answer, y^ if it seem to the by that which I have
alredye done, that I am becomme thine enemy: yet if all things be
indifferenly weied it shall be rather judged that I am thy frind and for a proof
thereof I say that their is nothing in y^ world to be done to do the
pleasure: that I would not for thy sake do, so that it be not, against the will
of god, and of this thou may assure thy self, for I determine to be thy
frynde, but if I have recovered my liberty, with my fathers country, I think
not therein to have done the any wrong, for that it apertayned to me, and not
to the beside that, if the Turckes thy soldiers which lay in those parts of
Albania that thou possessedst, confyninge with my country came against me with
armed bands to assail me, and if that I, acordinge to their deserts have
ouercomme them and chastized them, recoueringe also that country, y^ defaute is
not mine, but there is, or his who sent them against me, moreover if I have
defeicted thine army which thou dydste send with thy Bassa Alibeg against me. I
think I have done but as I ought to do, to defend me and mine, against
such as would offend me, and to conclude, if I have refused the most damnable
and detestable sect of Mahomethe, and am returned to that most true and
lively faith of Jesus Christ, I am well assured that I have chosen the better
part, for in keeping his most holly commandments I am suer that my soul
shall be saved and not (as thou say) damned, wherefore I beseech the, that for
y^ health of thy soul thou will receive one good council at my hand, which
is, that thou will vouchesafe to read the Alchorane, which is a brief
collection of the commandments of god, and there thou mayeste easyly
consider which of us is in the wrong, and my hope is, that if y^ will
indifferently consider, being vanquished by the truth, thou will receive
and embrace the Christian faith, by y^ which oneli, all men y^ seek to be
saved ar saved and without it all men are damned, God grant, y^ thou may
suffer thy self to be Illumined with his holly. Spirit, and to receive his most
holly Baptesme, and to begin to lead a Christian life, and then I would desire
to see y^ the greatest prince of y^ world, and I would be unto thee (eue^ as I
have been here to fore) a very frind and a faythefull seruante, which thou
may easyly understand by these my exhortacions. And I do assure thee (that
although I have defendid me against y^) I am thy frynde, and I promise thee
that if thou do this, where unto I do exhort thee, which is to becomme
Christian that I will not only restore unto the that part which thou
requirest at my hand, but also all mine own that I do possess in the world,
and wylbe duringe life thy trusty seruante: otherwise, I do assure thee that
I may not do it for any persuasion that thou may use, and chiefly for
that the Turckes be always enemies to y^ Christianes, and euel neighbors
also, wherefore I will not put that in hazard which god has given me, and
marvel not at it, for it is my right, and not thine, to possess that which
does appertain to the Christians, although it did not apertaine to my
father, it is mine for that I am a Christian and have lawfully recovered it with
my sword in my hand. This also should provoke thee to becomme Christian, for
that the possession of the towns, and the government does apertaine (to the
Christianes, and not to the infydelles) wherefore again I beseech thee, that
thou will becomme Christian, for otherwise I will contynually moleste and
annoye the in all that I may, and I hope rather to take from the ye which thou
vsurpest of the Christianes, then to yield in to thy hands one handful of
ground. And as touching thine oath that thou haste made (...) me out of my
country, and that if I be not slain, I shall at the least be enforced to
serve other men, unto this I answer, y^ if I were not a Christian, I durst
not encountre thee: but committing my self into ye tuytion of God, in whose
hands are states, and kingdoms, I say unto thee, y^ I have an assured hope
to defend me against thy great power, where with thou have threatened me, and
you may well think, that victory consystethe not in number of men, but in
having god, and right of his side, and then in the virtue of the soldiers
and disipline and judgment of the leaders, Note here things of great
importance.
and if hit hereunto we have possessyd all these things aforesaid, as I do
belyue thine own people have or now witnessyd, wherefore to conclude I say
that another thy sugared perswasiones, ne yet thy cruel threatings may alter
what I have said, but if that you will becomme a Christian, I shall then be
enforced to all that thou have required of me, further more I promise unto thy
highness, that I will not enuade any part of thy dominions, onles that thy
people do first begin. And thus I commend me unto thee, in such sort as
shall please thee, from our camp, the xiiii. of July. 1444.

When y^ ambassador was departed with this letter, Scanderbeg called unto him
all his Captains, and declared unto them in order what the Turcke had written
unto him, and in what sort, he had answered him whereof they were all very
glad, and hoped, that their affares should have good issue, unto whom
Scanderbeg spoke afterward in this sort.

My dear companiones in arms, I do believe that as soon as the Turcke shall
have considered my letter, Scan speaks to his soldiers.
and herd his ambassador, he will immediately determine to emploie against me
al his force possible, and therefore it is necessary, that we be provided, to
the end that we may defend our selves, The order which Scanderbeg gives to
his soldiers.
and also that we be vigillante and attentive, observing such order as I shall
appointe unto you, which is, that we continue together always in arms, and
contynually whiles we eat, or sleep, our horses to stand brydled, and
sadled, and that every man with his horse also keep that place of ye squadrone,
wherein he shall fight. and when the ordinary time shall comme to give them
prouender, to give it then in little sackettes and then to hang their brydles
upon the pomelles of there sadles whiles they eat, to the end that if the
enemies should comme upon y^ soodden to assail us, we might be sone in order
ready to answer them and besides that, I will always have wtoute my camp a
good guard, for that they shall not surprins us, wherefore I would that you
should well observe this order but forsomuche as I am certain, that as yet no
enemy will offend us, I will that every man depart to his dwellinge place, and
provide him self of necessaries: and repose him self, for I will forthewt,
with mine ordinary bands go to ye confines of my country: and will there lie
now in one place, and then in an other, and will hold the enemies in doubt,
and when it shall be nedful to fight I will send you word, and when so ever we
shall encou^tre with the enemy, let this commandment remain always with
you, that no man pain of life take any spoil, so long as one enemy shall
make hedde against us, until the battle be ended for I say unto you that a
man that is loded with bagage can never fight worthily. And therefore I give
you to understand, that I will be obeid, and what so ever he be that like the
not this let him remain here, and not go with me, and when that god at any
time shall give us victory I promise you as a faitheful soldier, that all the
spoil shall be yours. Then with great reverence, and humanity, the Captains
and chief soldiers answered, that what so ever he would command should
be done, and then every man took leave and returned to his dwelling place and
Scanderbeg with his two thousand chosen horsemen and one thousand fotemen,
passed on to his confines and there continued, Scanderbeg continued in this
sort up on his confines in manner without any lodgings saving certain tents
that he had to (...) him from the heat he had by his good prouiden^^ exceeding
good prouisyon for all his horses, he kept ta^^ for all his Captains and
principal soldiers, his (...) to eat once a day, and acording to that ord^^
his tables were most plentuously furnished, notwithstanding, whosoever did well
consider his stature, and complexio^, and the exercise that he did daily use,
and also his diete, might well perceive that he delighted not greatly to eat
but only to sustain nature and maintain force, The description of Scan.
Scanderbeg was of a goodly stature, and fair, well fewtrid of al his members
and of an excellent good complexion, well able to endure hete, cold, and al
kind of travail, as touching ye virtues of his mind, he was wise,
circumspect, and magnanime, full of liberality, and cortesie, and just both in
deed and word as moughte be possible, valiante and merciful, apt to forgive
wrongs if it were required of him he was an enemy of al vice, and especially
of that of the City of Gomorra, he would never suffer his soldiers to sley
women nor children of his enemies, nor that any woman should be enforced, in
prosperity he was never proud, nor in adversity never discoraged, and
besides these his rare virtues, his experience was such in the wars, that
his people never received overthrow if y^ he were with them, and being in the
feelde he never lay out of his armor, nor was without his weaponnes about
him, but slepte on the ground upon a carpett, five hours sleep suffised him.
In the beginning of any battle, he never said to his soldiers, on good
fellows, but follow me, he was always the first in giving the charge, and the
last that returned from it, his soldiers were richely apparelled, in sylke
and gold, but he wore always course clothe, onles it were upon sole^pne
feasts then he would show him self very richely apparelled.

Whylest Scanderbeg was in this sort upon his confines, there came a spyale
unto him, declaringe that the Turcke (understanding that he had disolued his
army and licensed them to repose them at their houses, and how y^ he with a
few soldiers with him lay upon the confines of his country) had commanded
Ferisbeg one of his Captains to take with him.ix. M. Turckes, horsemen, and to
depart with all speed toward the frontiers to take Scanderbeg unprovided, and
the spial was of opinion ye they would be with him that day, when Scanderbeg
understood of this, he sent for no aid, but made him ready with all speed
possible with his two thousand horsemen and one thousand fotemen embattailed,
and then tarried his enemies, Battle between Ferisbeg and Sca^.
and as soon as they came, he signed him self with the sign of the cross,
and charged them with such fury, that although the Turckes resisted for a
time, yet in the end they were disordered and put to flight Ferisbeg Bassa
aforesaid, gallopped up and down the feelde, and with many iniuriouse words
chanlenged to fight with Scanderbeg, he of the other part commanded to
follow the chase, and to execute by all means possible, and went forthewith and
encountre with Ferisbeg, and slew him at the first stroke that he gave, with
the which, the fear of the Turckes so increased, y^ happy was the foremost
man, when this was done, Sca^derbeg returned with the victory to his confines,
A custume of a good Captain
and the next day following he entered the Turckes country and brought an
exceeding great proie from thence.

When the Turcke understood these doleful news, he appointed forthewith and
other Sangiacho named Mustaffa, and made him his Captain general of.x. M,
Turckishe horsemen, with commission not to encountre Scanderbeg, but to enter
his country by an other way and to spoil, and proie the same, but Scanderbeg
having intelligence hereof, and of the place: where the Turcks determined to
enter, he forth with made him ready and sent for two thousand horsemen more,
Good foresyghte of Sca^.
which made in number. 4. thousand horsemen, and one thousand foremen, and with
these he went as secretly as possible, to imbosque him self near to that
place where the Turckes determined to begin their forcy, and as soon as they
were comme thither, they began to scatter over all the country, and Scanderbeg
took his time and charged them, and there began a cruel fight on both sides,
but in the end Scanderbeg with his soldiers, so behaved him self, Mustaffa
de^e^cted.
that the Turcks were disordered and put to flight the greatest number of them
were slain upon the place and Mustaffa their Captain with certain of his
principal soldiers fled, there were slain of Scanderbeg soldiers. xx. upon
the place, in the end of this rencountre all the spoil was presented to
Scanderbeg, who distributed al to his soldiers, and then licensed ye two
thousand horsemen that came last, and with the rest he returned again to his
accustumed confines.

The Turcke for all this left not, but sent Mustaffa before said with a greater
company then before, to ye confines of his country, with commission not to
stir from thence without a special commandment from him, but that he
should stand well upon his guard and look diligently that Scanderbeg did not
endomage his people, and spoil his country, which when Scanderbeg understood
he determined also not to move, onles that the Turckes did first begin, but
stood always upon his guard acordinge to his order, in this mean time there
came news to Scanderbeg that leche Ducagino fonne to the lord Paulo had
slain Leche Zacharia lord of ye City called the Dagnio which standethe in
Albania near unto the Ryner call Drino, for whose death Scanderbeg was very
sorry, for y^ there had been always great fryndshippe between them, and for that
he dyed without children Scanderbeg determined to succeed him in his state
after ye decease of the lady Bossa his mother by virtue of certain couenantes
ye were between them notwithstanding the Lady Bossa by mean of the
lieutenante of Scutari agreed with the Senate of Venise, upon certain
conditions, and delivered them ye Dagnio with the rest of her state, for the
which Scanderbeg was greatly offendyd and assembled al his power and went in
person and beseged Dagnio, and left (not withstanding) upon his confines his
trusty frind the countye Vurana one of his Captains for the guard thereof, with
three thousand soldiers, when the lieutenante of Scutarie understood this, he
aduertized the Senate thereof, and received commission from them to levy an
army, where upon he took out of Scutarie many bands of Italians and levied a
great number of Albaneses and made general of the army: the worthy Damel
Sebenico, and as soon as he had al things ready he marched toward Scanderbeg,
who as soon as he herd hereof, passed the river Drino with all his army, to
go toward the Venetian army and to encou^tre them, and then spoke to his
soldiers in this manner that follows. Scan. to his soldiers.


My compainons in arms, if it be so that a man may lawfully demand his
right without doing wrong to any man, truly in that, that I have demanded
my right, and beseged Dagnio, and taken the straicte or valley thereof, I do
beliue, I have done no injury at al to the Senate of Venise, but am rather
wronged, notwtstanding I have them partly excused, consideringe the false
information that has been made unto them in the absence of the contrary
party, and truly I can not persuade my self, but that they being just, and
most Christian, and knowing the great affection and good will ye I have always
borne them, would never have concluded in my prejudice: if they had first
understood my right, notwithstanding, for that they have now addressyd their
army against me, we must needs this day fight against the Christians, which
in deed is greatly against my will, wherefore now I say unto you that it
behooves you to fight more circumspectly and valiantly then you have done at
any time else, consydering that you have to do with men that do far excede
the Turcks in valewe, but yet I hope in God that the victory shall be ours
wherefore I do commau^de you, that when we shall have broken them, that no man
after that, sley any of them, but to take them prisoners and to follow the
chase even to the gates of Scutari, and when he had thus said, he spoke on
high, The bettayle between Scan and the Venetianes.
sainge, follow me, and then marched on with his army in battle and joined
with the Venetianes, the fight between them was continued with great obstinatie,
but in the end Scanderbeg disordered them and put them to flighte, following
the chase even to the gates of Scutari, and did sley none of them in the chase
but took a great number prisoners, and especially men of acompte, which were al
presented to Sca^derbeg, who like a noble prince caused them al to be well
entertained and sent them home wit houte any ransom, and of al those prisoners
be caused to dete^yne two men of acompte, the one was Simone Vulcatal, of the
country of ^ cutari and the other was Andre Humoi brother to ye Captain of
Croia, which he sent into his own country, and kept them prisoners in a
forte of his ye was of great strength called Pietra Bianca, where they were by
his commanded very well used and had great provision appointed unto them, after
this Scanderbeg passed with his army through all the country which appertained
to the Venetianes, thinckinge to have taken it, but he could not, whereupon he
fortified a rased City, name Balezzo, which had been distroied by Attilla
Flagello di Dio, he fortified it with walls, trenches, and bastio^nes, he
furnished it with all kind of menition, and valiante men, and he appointed to
be their Captain one of his Captains named Marino Spa^, a man of much
worthynes, to ye end that he should with contynual courses spoil, Judgment
of Scanderbeg.
and impouerishe the country, and keep them in continual doubt. And when he
had established this order he returned to ye seege of Dagnio. After this they
of Scutari, understanding ye Marino Span was gone forth of Balezzo, they went
thither with all speed, and spoiled the City to the very foundation wherewith
Scanderbeg being greatly offendyd destroyed all the country of Scutari.

When the Turcke venderstode that Scanderbeg had wars with the Venetianes,
and consydering that that country lay between two mighty enemies, he was
excedinly glad thinckinge for that the Venetianes were of great force, that
they would sone chase Scanderbeg out of his country, wherefore he sent
commandment to Mustaffa, which lay upon his co^fines, with xv. M horsemen to
go, and spoil al Sca^derbegs country, yet for all that, Mustaffa cansydering
the bands that Sca^derbeg had lying upon his frontiers in redynes, would go
no further then that place, which is called Dronich where he set up his tents,
and lying with his army encamped there, he held the country in contynual
fear, whereof as soon as Scanderbeg had aduertizement, he departed from Dagnio
with two thousand soldiers, and went to his other three thousand soldiers,
that lay upon his confines: and when he had exhorted them to behave themselves
valiantly, he put them in order and assailed ye Turckes with such fury, that
within a short time he put them to flighte, Mustaffa defeicted.
and slew.x. M. of them, and took Mustaffa with.xii. others, men of great
acompte, whom he caused forthewith to be sent, where Andre and Simon was, and
then made a great course into the Turckes country, and brought with him a
maruelouse rich proie, and distributed al to his soldiers, and gave among
them afterward.xxv. M. ducates which he had for the ransom of Mustaffa and
ye other xii. When Scanderbeg had done this, he returned to Dagnio, and held
that country in such travail, that he brought it al under his obedience, yet
notwithstanding the Cities defended them selves, and chiefly Driuazzo, whiles
Amesabeg Nephewe to Scanderbeg, spoiled the country about Drinazzo, the worthy
Andre surnamed Angelo, descended of the Romans, which in time passed
possessed the Empire of Constantinople, being Captain of Driuas tynes, ysued
out of the town with such fury, and assailed the army of Scanderbeg so
worthily, that he put them to flyghte with great spoil of them, so that after
that, it was always said that Sca^derbeg was always victoriouse, onles it
were before Driuasto, but his excuse was, for that he was not present at that
rencou^tre.

In the end Scanderbeg made peace with the Venetianes, upon condition that he
should restore unto them al those places that he had taken from them, and in
recompense thereof, he should have one part of the valey or strascte of
Scutari, beginning at the bancke of the river Drino toward Scutari, and so
stretching out to a certain place called Busgiarpeni, which portions in deed
were much more co^modiouse for Scanderbeg, then the town of Dagnio.

When this agreement was made, Scanderbeg spoke to the ambassador of Venise in
sort as follows, right honorable my lord ambassadors, it is the opinion of
such as are wise where a man louethe once in deed, he must needs love alwaie,
and peradventure the proverb has hereof his beginning, which says that
the discord of frinds: engenders an increase of good will, wherefore I give
your honors to understand, that notwithstanding our difference I have been
alwaie well affected toward my lords of Venise, for so much as their state is
most Christian, and that they are fryndes of al kind of virtue, wherefore I
would not suffer at the battle of Scutari (the victory once being mine) to
sley any more of their soldiers, and to the end that it shall be well seen
that I am their frinde in deed, I shall hold me well contentyd and satiffyed
with any thing that may be commodiouse to their state, and for that they
shall well understand that I make less acompte of mine own commodities, then
of there is, I do make them a present of al ye which is mine for the which we
have had this difference and do hold my self as well contented, as if I had
them contynually in my possession, and further, I will them not to fear the
Turcke, for I trust in God to defend both their state, and mine own also,
and thus I commend me to your honors. When Sca^derbeg had this said, he
embraced the ambassadors and returned into his country, when he came thither,
he caused to take out of prison, Simon and Andre aforesaid, and when he had
delivered them, he did them great honor and gave them great presents, in token
of the goodwyl that he bare to the Senate of Venise.

At that same time Scanderbeg made a great course into the Turckes country,
and burned and spoiled al ye country as he passed through, and brought a great
proie from thence: whereupon the Turcke called unto him, all his consellours
called in the Turckishe tongue, Vestri, and also his Bassas, Sangiachi,
Captains, and others of his principal order of soldiers, and spoke unto
them in this sort.

I am maruelously troubled and amassed, with the manifold da^mages, and
dishonours that I have received at the hand of Scanderbeg, my mortal enemy,
wherefore I do now determyne to be revenged and to employe al my force
possible against him, and so much the more for that I could never give him
overthrow, but he has always triumphed over my people, and over the
Venetianes also in one instante, and now (for that he is a Christian) he has
made peace with them, and contynually makes wars against me, and makes none
acompte of me at al, in so much that he does not only, not determine to
deliver unto me that which he has taken from me, but contynually threatnethe
to spoil me (as he has al ready certyfyed me by his letters) of ye rest.
Wherefore I do determyne to make provision, and to use my whole force against
him, wherefore I give you to understand that I will go thither in person, and
first I will besege the City of Croia and take it, and then all the rest of
his state, wherefore make you ready, for woe shall he be, that is not ready at my
mustres, Scanderbeg was spedyly advised of this great preparation, and with all
speed furnished the City with all kind of necessaries and good soldiers,
Albaneses of great experience and faith, he gave them for their general Vurana
aforesaid and he in person stood well upon his guard, in this mean time there
came a great number of Turckes into Scanderbegs country, and encampdd before
Sfetigarde, a city that stands from Croia. 58. miles, when Scanderbeg
understood of this, he went forthewith as secretly as he could and encamped
within.vii. miles of ye Turckishe army, with. 4. thousand horsemen, and one
thousand fotemen and being thus encamped would not suffer day nor night any
fire to be made within his camp by means whereof the enemy understood
nothing of his being there, Note.
in this mean time Scanderbeg determined to put in use a Strategeme, whereupon
he wylled the valiante Moises, A Strategeme.
and his Nephewe Musachie de la Angelina to take with them.xxx. horsemen, and
to disguise themselves and the next morninge to attempt as though they would
go into Sfetigard leadinge with them certain Asses loded with corn, and it
was so done acording to his commandment, and in the morninge as soon as the
guard of the Turcks camp saw them (thincking y^ they had been victuallers)
they hasted to encountre them and when Moises with his companiones had fled a
little way, he turned and charged the Turckes and forthewt slew.viii. of them,
and hurt many: whereupon the rest suddenly fled and hasted them to the camp
to declare the news, but the Bassa being very circumspecte mistrusting (as it
was in deed) that they were no rascalles, consyderinge the wounds, and great
blows that they had given, commanded. 4. thousand horsemen to follow them,
and to take them lyuinge, Moises which always had regard to his, saying them
comme began to flee, and to hide him in a certain deep valey, and the Turcks
followed their tracte with great fury. Good providence of Scan.
In this mean while, Scanderbeg who did attend such an occasion, furnished
the entres of the valey and then with certain bands with him, entered the
valley and charged them, and flewe the greatest number of them, and the rest
fled in maruelouse disorder, and had it not ben that the Bassa looked for
Amorathe in person, he had then returned again with all his army into the
Turckes country.

After this the. 14 of May. 1449. this Tiran came to his camp in Albania
with. 160. Sfetigard beseged by Amorathe
thousand Turckes, with many great bombardes, and a great quantie of other
artillery, and beseged Sfetigarde very straightly, where Pietro Parlato was
Captain, who with his soldiers that he had out of high Dibra and the rest
that were with him in that seege, behaved them selves so valiantly, that
although they were contynually occupied in ye defense of their town, and in
scaramoche, yet they always left with the best, Cysteren a place where in is
received the rain water.
but in the end a certain traitor, did cast a ded dog into their chief
cisterne of ye town, by means whereof the people were greatly consumed, and
the Tiran Amorathe took the town, and in the beginning he did entertain this
traitor very honorably, and gave him great presents, but after certain
days he was no more seen of any, for in deed princes do often times love the
treason, but not the traitor nor never trust them after, and therefore it is
not to be marvelled at, that the Turcke saying such horible villainy in a man,
would never trust him after, consydering that for his private lucre, he could
be content to shed not only the blood of his countremen, but also to destroy
his religion, and betraie his country. After this Amorathe went and beseged
Croia round, and planted his batteries and battered for the space of. 4.
montthes, notwithstanding he did them of the town small hurt for that the
City was very strong on every side, and yt they had within the town a
plentuouse fountain of goodly water, and an other very fair fountain behind
the Castle, which the enemies could never possess. In the mean time that the
Turcke beseged Croia in this sort, the noble prince Scanderbeg, now in one
place and then in an other, assailed the Turckes camp, and spoiled contynually
al such victuallers as came to his camp notwithstanding for that his number
was very small he could not enforce them to raise their sege. In ye end of ye
fourth monethe aforesaid Amorathe commanded to give a general assault to ye
town and to assail it round in the which he prevailed not, but returned
from the assault with great spoil and loss of his people, the death of
Amorathe.
for the which he took so great an inward grefe yt forthewith he died. Then
the soroweful, amassed dishonored, and confounded Turckishe army, abandoned ye
sege, and returned home in great disorder, and were followed and spoiled in
many places as they passed, and were very euel handled, in such sort, as they
came home greatly diminished, and Scanderbeg remained in his country with
great triumph and victory, contynully praisinge the Almightye God.

When Amorathe prince of the Turckes was dead Mahomethe his son succeeded him
in his kingdom, he that was son to Hierenia, or Catagusma, daughter to
George the Dispotto of Seruia, and for that he was not yet suerly established
in his seat, he could do no great hurt, wherefore Scanderbeg (being
desirous to leave sum heir of his boddie after him) took to wife that
excellent fair, and virtuous lady named Doneca, daughter to Aranithe Conino,
but as soon as Mahomethe the new Turckyshe prince was established in the seat
of his father, he began immediately to threaten Sca^derbeg and could not endure
that he should possess Croia, and Epirro, then Scanderbeg with his. 2.
thousand horsemen, and a thousand fotemen, which were his ordinary guard, went
to his confines, determyning not to enuade at all, onles that Mahomethe first
began, and being in this sort upon his co^fines he understood that ye Turcke
had no army in redynes to send against him, and consydering that it was
nedeful to visyte his country, he took with him his aforesaid wife, and made a
visitacio^ in his country, mynistring Justice in such sort, with mercy, that
he was both honored, loved, and feared, of both^ more and less, a man might
safely have gone through all that country with horses loded with gold and no
man would have touched it. After this Scanderbeg sent for a great number of
masonnes and laborers, and went to a certain high mountain over the which
there liethe away that leadethe from Turchie down into the country of
Scanderbeg, and upon the heighte of the same mountain he builded a forte of an
exceeding force, and named it Medrissa, and then furnished it with all kind of
necessaries and a good guard of fotemen, which should at all times when they
saw the power of the Turcke comme, shote of certain pieces of Artillery to
aduertize the country of their coming, to the end that they moughte be redye
to defend them selves, when Scanderbeg had in this sort fynished, and
furnished his forte, he passed on with his army to his wonted confynes, but
first he entered the Turckes country and sackaged it putting al to fire and
sword without compassion.

Then the aforesaid Mahomethe prince of ye Turckes, desyring greatly the utter
ruin and spoil of all ye country of Scanderbeg, sent against him a worthy
Captain of his named Amesabeg, with.xii. (...) chosen Turckes on horseback
and as soon as this most vigillante Scanderbeg hard the sound of the cannon,
he lept forthewith on horse, with his ordinary three thousand soldiers and
passed on toward the Turckes, and as soon as he was comme near unto them, he
sygned him with his wonted sign of the cross, and with great fury charged
them, The battle between Sca^. and Amesabeg
and after that he had fought with them a certain time, he enforced them to
disorder and to flee, folowinge the chase with all speed possible, executinge
the enemies, with great terror and force. In the end Amesabeg was taken with
diverse other Turcks of great acompte, and were presented to Scanderbeg. The^
Amesabeg with tears spoke to him in this sort, Ah thou worthy Scanderbeg,
thy highness does know right well, that we do eat the bread of our
master and lord, wherefore we can not but serve him, wherefore we beseech
thine honor to use, some kind of mercy and cortesy toward us, for the love
of God which thou do worship, and for all the virtues of ye same.

Then Scanderbeg as a magnanime prince au^swered in such sort, as he caused
not only the prisoners, but also al those that were present with them to shede
tears, after that in token that he pardoned them of their lives he caused them
all to eat at his own table, and Amesabeg to eat at his own mess and in
one dyshe with him and when he had in this sort comforted them he caused them to
be safely kept, and appointed unto them honorable provision. In the end
acording to the couenantes between them, there were paid for Amesabeg x. M.
ducates, and for the rest.iii. M. and in this sort they were delivered. Then
Scanderbeg called his soldiers unto him and acordinge to his custume
distributed these sommes of money unto them, notwithstanding certain of his
chief soldiers who for their obedience towar^^ him did not refuse to receive
it, yet in his presence spoke franckly and under correction, saying, that not
to seem to direct him, but to declare their opinion unto his highness,
maruellinge much that he followed not the council of the old proverb, which
says, dead men do make no wars, but that he did always suffer his
enemies so to depart with their lives, by means whereof they might return an
other time and annoie them. But Sca^derbeg answered them in such sort, that
he satisfied them all very well, but his conclusion was that if they came again
an other time, he would also take them, and distribute their ransom to his
soldiers, and also he partly excused them, for that they lived by their
lord, he said it was reason that they served him, when these words of
Scanderbeg came to the Turckes cares and also his cortesye toward all such as
were taken prisonners, and how that he took ransom of such as were rich,
and gave money to those that were pore and sent them home freely to their
country, their common voice was in all places that there was but one Scanderbeg
in the world, and after him their should not come such an other, and in
this sort it did grow into proverb amongst them and contynuethe to this
day.

When Mahomethe had received this difeicte, he sent forthewith an other
Sangiacho named Debreambeg for his general, with.xiiii. M. Turckes, and as soon as Scanderbeg understood that they began to approach to his confynes, he
took his horse with his soldiers, and rode in the night through a great
valey, and at the last came up the hill where the Turckes lay, without any
suspection, and charged them upon the sudden, and whiles his soldiers were
fyghtinge with the Turckes he in person went directly to the tente of the
Captain Debreambeg and found him in order ready to comme forth whereupon he
assailed him, Debreambeg slain.
and with his lance struck him clean through the belly, and then he returned
to him, and with his sword struck of his head, and as soon as the Turckes
understood of this, immediately they disordered them selves and fled,
notwithstanding it proffyted them smally for the greatest number of them
followed their Captain Debream. When this was done Sca^der beg distributed the
spoil to his soldiers, and returned safely into his country with all his
soldiers, with victory and triumph.

After this Scanderbeg being much offended with Mahomethe prince of the
Turcks: went and encamped before a City of his called Belgrado (not that of
Hungary) with.xiiii. M. soldiers on horse and foot, and left for the guard
of his confynes a famous and worthy Captain, named Moises which was of high
Dibra, with 2. thousand soldiers fotemen and horsemen, and when he had of a
long time continued his seege and batteries Scanderbeg left his cosyn the
lord Musachio Topia, which was son to the aforesaid Andre: Captain general
of all his army, before that town, and appointed a guard alwaie to be forth
of his camp, to that end that the Turckes should not take them unprovided,
and then he departed from thence, and took with him. 3. thousand horsemen, and
a thousand fotemen, and went to visete certain places of his. In this mean
time a Bassa of ye Turckes called Sebalia came with.xl. thousand Turckes to
raise the seege, and having by means of corruption had intelligence, with
those traitors of the guard that was without the camp, unto whom he gave an
exceeding great sum of money, by means whereof the guard suffered them to pass
without gyuing any advertisement to them of the camp thereof, whereupon
immediately they slew the general of the army, Musachio and put all the camp
to flyghte in maruelouse disoder, and followed them doing great execution upon
them with great noyses and cries. And by the providence of God Scanderbeg was
alredie on horseback, coming to visyte his camp, with his. three thousand
horsemen, and one thousand fotemen, and as soon as he herd this great noise,
he suspected the treason of the guard. Then he put spurs to his horse and
with all speed came into his camp, where he saw the Turckes making great
spoil of his people, he charged them with such force that in manner in one
instante, in dispite of them, he made them to leave of, sauinge that one part of
them continued still the chase: which so kyndled Scanderbeg, and his worthy
soldiers, that the force of the Turckes could by no means stand against
them, Sebalia, defeicted.
but as they were wont turned their backs and fled, toward the City to
their great shame. Then Scanderbeg like a worthy Captain thought it good no
further to follow them, iudgeinge it to be a great grace of God, y^ he had so at
an instante delivered his people from death, and therefore sounded the
retreicte and passed into his country safe, with honor, and when he made a reuewe
of his army, he found that there were flayne of his soldiers. 2. thousand
horsemen, and. 3. thousand fotemen, which for the more part, were comme out
of Apuglia with the aforesaid Musachio his cosyn and Captain general, and
there were of them taken four score, which did much offend the mind of
Scanderbeg, within few days after he supplied his army, and went again to
ye seege of Belgrado, but the Citizens and Turckes that were within sent an
ambassador to Scanderbeg, who behaved him self so wisely, that he contented
Scanderbeg in such sort, that he returned suddenly back again, and
dissolved his army.

After this Scanderbeg with his. 3. thousand horse men, and one thousa^de
fotemen, returned to his confynes to his acustumed places, and when he came
there, he licensed the. 2. thousand soldiers which there were, under ye
conducte of ye aforesaid Moses.

This Moises for his virtues, and worthynes, was so much embraced and favored
of Scanderbeg, as any man that was with him: in token whereof Scanderbeg had
given him many towns, and great possessyones, armours, weapones, horse,
aparell, Iuelles, clothe of gold, and sylke, with great sums of money,
notwithstanding after this overthrow of Scanderbegs people this Moses was
out of hope that ever Scanderbeg should be able to defend his country,
whereupon he began to contemn him, and left his service and went to the Turcke
aforesaid, Moses reuoltethe.
and offered him to chase Scanderbeg out of his country, so that he would
deliver him xv. thousand chosen Turckes: with this condition, that when he had
banished Sca^derbeg, that then he might remain lord of the contre, painge
yearly to the Turcke such tribute as he should think good to appointe him to
pay. This offer pleased the tiran maruelously and he gave unto him very
attentive ear: and answered Moises, that if he could bring that to pass,
he would furnishe him in every respect, and grant him all his demaundes, and
for that that Moses said that he would fley Scanderbeg, and would challenge
him openly to fight with him upon the feelde in synguler battle, ye Turcke
promised him to give unto him a hundred thousand ducates so that he brought
unto him the head of Scanderbeg, and also he would have no tribute at all of
him for Sca^derbegs country: but it should suffice him to have him obedient,
faythefull, and his good frynde, and for the greater assurance he commanded to
put al these conditiones in writing.

Then Moses took his journey and passed on with his xv. thousand chosen Turckes
well monted, and came against Scanderbeg through Thracia, and Macedonia. As soon as Scanderbeg understood of this practice, he did unite his army to the
number of r. thousand men, on horse, and foot, and went to tarry the coming
of Moses in the plains of the base Dibra. When Moises was come into those
playnes and saw the army of Scanderbeg in so good order, he became even
amassed, and went forth from his people, and with loud voice challenged
Scanderbeg to fight with him in syngular battle, using against him many
villanouse words, but Scanderbeg with more sharp voice au^swered, saying, o
thou rebelle mete for the gallows, tarry, and I will sone make the to repent
thee of that, whereof thou thinckest not to repent the at all, then many of
Scanderbeges soldiers were much offended with him and would have gone forth
out of their squadrone to fight with him man, to man, but Scanderbeg with
incredible fury spurred his horse toward him, so that they were both out
from their people, and as soon as Moises beheld the troubled there, and
furiouse countenance, of his lord, he began forthewith to flee, and returned
into his squadrone, and Scanderbg followed with great fury, but he could not
over get him wherefore he returned to his people.

Then when all things were in that order that he would, he commanded them
with a loud voice to follow him, and they all being alredie excedingly wroth
followed him, but he being in a great fury was ye first that struck upon
them, and the Turckes were excedingly amassed to see that most shameful flyghte
of Moses their Captain, Moses defeicted.
and almost with the first charge, were put to flight, so that a few of them
ever returned home, Moses went again to the Turcke, but he was not only,
suffered to comme to his presence, but also was greatly laughte at: and skorned,
and esteemed to be a vile ma^and of no worthynes. Then Moses became almost
desperate, and began to discourse in him self what he were best to do, he
could find no means whereby he might remedy his evil, in such sort as he
might with his honor show him self in any place of the world, consyderinge
that he had in this sort purchased the name of a traitor, in the end being
moved in conscience he called to god for mercy: and then he was fully persuaded
to put his trust in God, and in Scanderbeg, who had diverse and sondrie times
pardoned penitent offenders. Then he disguysed him self, and came into
Albania secretly, with a cord about his neck, casting him self down at the
feet of Scanderbeg with tremblinge, and tears demanded mercy. Then
Sca^derbeg forth with put forth his hand, and took him up, and began to
discourse with him, even as though there had been never any offense made
against him discoursing of the practizes that the Turcke had framed against
him. Then Sca^derbeg commanded to apparel him honorably, and when they had
supped he restored him to all his liuinges and goods that before were
confiscate, in token that he had franckly pardoned him.

After this when Scanderbeg saw Moses faithful and diligent in all his
affares he received him into his faueur, as before, and accepted him better.

When the Turcke understood the contynuall victory of Scanderbeg against him,
and against his father in his life time, he gathered a great army and sent
Isaahe, Bassa of Romania, Captain general with xl. thousand men against
Scanderbeg, and as soon as they were comme into his country, Scanderbeg seemed
to be in great fear and fiedde into Alessio a City of the Vene tianes. Then
the Turckes were out of doubt of Scanderbeg, and so ran over his country at
their pleasure, even to the very sea, but they could raise no proie great nor
lesser, for that he commanded them before hand to flee with their goods and
cattle into places of force and security, so that the Turckes found them
selves greatly deceived and abused, the same night they lodged upon the side
of the river called Mathia, and rested them as though they had been at home in
their country, but Scanderbeg enemy of all sluggishenes, the day folowinge
about nonne came with his. 7. thousand horsemen to a mountain which joined
to the plain where they encamped, and then with certain of his Captains went
up to the top of the hill, to consider, and behold in what strength his
enemies did lie, and whether he moughte have any occasyon to assail them upon
the sudden. When Scanderbeg was upon the heighte of the mountain, he saw the
Turckes lying without guard under the trees in shodowe, and in their tents,
for it was in the hotest time of the summer, and in the myddest of the day:
wherefore he departed from the mountain and went to horse with all his
soldiers and began to ride in great have toward the Turckes, and met with
their scoute, and slew them immediately al saving one, who with the speed of
his horse escaped to ye camp crying in this sort Scanderbeg is bear,
Scanderbeg is here. But Sca^derbeg in person followed him, and could not
ouergett him for that he had so much ground before him at the first. Then
Sca^derbeg commanded to sownde the alarm with all such instruments as they
had and then gave in upon them with such force (unprovided as they were) that
in the first charge he put them in such disorder, and flyghte as was
meruelouse to se, so that he slew of them there. 30. thousand upon the place,
and all ye ever ye Sangiacho Amesabeg (neuewe to Scanderbeg and rebelle against
him) could do or say could not stay them from ronning away, Amesabeg
Mesithbeg taken.
wherefore in the end this same Amesabeg, with Mesithebeg, both Sangiachi, with
500. Turckes more were taken prisoners, and Isaach the Bassa, Isaacke Bassa put
to flighte.
with such scatered Turckes as were living fled and was followed for a certain
time and great execution done upon his people. After this Scanderbeh divided
the spoil to his soldiers, acording to his acustumed order, there were
slain of his souidiours. 60.

This done he returned to his confynes, and made acourse into the country of
his enemies and sacaged it, and burned a great part thereof, and returned into
his country with an exceeding great boutie safely, and gave thancks to God for
his great victory.

The Turcke rested not for this but sent new bands to guard his confynes with
two other Captains, ye one of them was named Hannebeg, and the other Sinanbeg
with expressed commandment not to deal with Scanderbeg, nor to enter his
country, onles they received from him other commissyon, and this he did for
that he saw he could not overcome Scanderbeg, and therefore he determined to
prove if he moughte prevail against some other princes, wherefore he took in
hand first the enterprise against the Imperial City of Constantinople, and in
short time took it, flewe the Emperor thereof with an infinite number of
Citizens and other Christians, and then conquered al his state, in the year.
1453. After this he went against the before named Dispotto of Seruia, a prince
of great welthe possessinge a marvelous mass of gold and silver by mean of
certain mines that he had not withstandinge, he chased him out of his
country, in the year. 1459. The king of Bossina put to death in miserable
sort.
After this he went against the king of Bossina, and took him and caused him
to be sawed a sonder in the midst, and took his state.

Then Scanderbeg beholdinge the great prosperity of his enemy (in the
prejudice and subversion of the Catholic faith, threating also to take the
countres of diverse Christian princes) determined to go and encou^tre with the
two Captains aforesaid.

In this mean time the ambassadors of the pope Pio the. Faro the strait at
Misena between Scicill and the maine land of Italy.
2. and of the king Ferrante king of Puglia, and of Scicile, passed the Fero
and went to Scanderbeg saying, most noble prince, we give thine excellentie to
understand in the behalf of our lords, and Masters, that the Duke John,
son to the king Renato of France is comme with a great power of Frenshe men,
into the kingdom of Sicille against your dear frinde the king Ferrante, and
there are revolted against the king (taking part with the aforesaid Duke)
the princes of Taranto, and Bossano, with the greatest part of the nobility of
that kingdom, and he has entertained in his pay ye Cou^tie James Piocinino
with all his regiment so that his army is very great and strong, and he has
alredie conquered the whole kingdom, sauinge only Napls, Capua, Auersa,
Gaieta, Troia, and Barletta, where the king is now straitely beseeged, and in
danger to be taken, and the power of the pope and ye king can not pass over
to succor him, wherefore the popes hollynes, and our king also, desire your
highness in most ernest wise, that it may please you to comme into Puglia in
his favor, and when the ambassadors had this said they presented unto him
the popes bulls with the kings letters, wherein there was contained ye like of
that, which they had declared by mouth.

Then Scanderbeg being greatly affected toward the popes hollynes, and the
holly catholic church of Rome, and for that also he was entered into great
fryndshippe with the king Alfonso, father to Ferrante, fermer, and tributarie
to the aforesaid Bishop, he determined to aid him with all his power
possible, and so after great entertaineme^t made to the ambassadors he
licensed them in very cortese sort, and forth with sent one of his chief
Captains his Nephewe, named Cairo Stroisio, a man of great understanding, and
worthiness with. 500. chosen horsemen, who passed the sea, and landed in that
part of the country that yet held for the king Ferrante, where he did great
good by means of his worthiness.

In the mean ty^e Scanderbeg made a treues forone year with the T^^cke, by
means whereof he had as good opportunity as he could have wyshed for so much
as shortly before the ariuale of the ambassadors aforesaid, there came a
messager from ye Turcke, to demand peace of Scanderbeg, but he was departed
wtoute grant thereof, for he was fully determined to deal with the Turckes
Captains that lay upon the confynes, but as soon as he understood of this, he
sent his curreuers after the ambassador and caused him to return, and then
concluded the aforesaid trewse.

After this he committed his state into the hands of his well-beloved wife, and
others, his most faithful frinds and appointed to defend them a worthy Captaie
with sufficient number of soldiers, and when he had hired a great number of
ships, and galleys and other vessels for ye sea, he caused his army to
embarcke in them being well furnished of horses and coursers of great price,
and with abundance of virtuall, and then he caused them to set sail: and in
short space he arrived at Ragusio, and he with certain with him landed there,
and was by the chief of that place honorably received. And when they had a
long time talked together, he went to the church to hear service, and then
took his leave and went aborde and set sail, and having a prosperouse wind,
in short time approached near to Barletta, and when the Duke John, and the
county James and the rest of the nobility, saw so many sails, they Judged
Scanderbeg to be there, for it was bruted that Scanderbeg would comme and aid
the king, whereupon they raised their camp and went to encampe at a certain
place from thence, far of. In this mean time Scanderbeg landed, and the
king forthewith went out of Barletta and came and embraced Scanderbeg, weping
for joy, gyuinge thanckes to God, and then to him, for so great cortesie, and
grace, after this Scanderbeg caused to vnshippe his furniture, to comfort the
king, and all the rest of his people: and the next morrow he rode into the
country which had rebelled against the king aforesaid, and brought from
thence and exceeding great proie of cattle of all sorts and drove it to
Barletta, and for the space of all that day, there was made great joy in hope
of victory, and the morninge following he made an oration to his soldiers, in
form as follows.

My dear frinds, Scan. to his souldours.
the cause of our being here as now is to aid and succor the king Ferrante
our frynde, whom in one momente by gods help, we have delivered from a
perilous sege, hitherunto: wtoute drawing our swords wherefore to make an
end of this enterprise, it is needful to use our weapones very skylfully,
and to keep very good order, in such sort, as the king may recover the
country that he has lost: which thing can not be done without gyuing
battle, fyghtinge the same with great assurance, and in maruelouse perfect
and strong order, but I think not that you will do otherwise here in
Italy, then you have done in Albania against the Turcks, and other our
enemies notwithstanding, this may not be unadvisedly taken in hand
forsomuche as these the kings enemies, are Italianes, and Frenshe men and are
armed suerly even from the head to the foot, having lances of great force and
stocks both strong, and well piercinge, wherefore if we should stand fyrmly
and receive their charge, they would handle us very rudely, and we should be
able smally to anoie them, for that our armor is slender in comparyson of
there is, we were Iackes of mayle, Targes, long and slender lances, and
although that our swords and Scymytaries be heavy, and that some of them will
cut any kind of iron, yet all this is in manner nothing, consyderinge that
their number does far excede ours, and they be men of greater virtue and
force then are the Turckes, wherefore with such enemies it behooves us to deal
discretly and valiantly, puttinge our trust in God to obtain victory,
acording as we are acustmed to do, wherefore it behooves you to observe this
order thoroughly that I shall now give you, we will go and seek these the
kings enemies, and when we shall find them, we will without delay offer to
charge them, and if they will offer to countrecharge us, we will then seem to
rone away, and after ye will torn suddenly upon them, for when they have
followed us a little time, they wylbe sone weary for they can endure no great
travail, for they are loded with heavy armor, and their horses are great, and
heuye, and wylbe sone weary: but we are able to endure to the end of any
travail, and then will we with our swords, Scymytars, and Mases, so beat
them about the heddes that we will enforce them to fall from their horses
half dod and using the matter in this sort there is no doubt but that we
shall obtain the victory, truethe it is for that they are baptized, it
greueth me much, but there is no remedy, Great blasphemy
for every man is bound to defend him self, and we have the right on our
side, and the popes blessing and grace, who is lord of the whole world, both
in spiritual, and temporal matters, for that he is Christ's lieutenante,
wherefore I pray you and also command you, that every man enforce him self
(more now then ever he did) to do well, for that we are in a strange cou^
trey, and are enforced to obtain this victory for the glory of God, and the
welthe and commodity of our frindes and for our own honor, and to the loss
and dishonor of our enemies.

The next morning folowinge Scanderbeg with his soldiers, went with great
assurance to se the kings enemies, and he attempted a scaramothe to se the
manner of his enemies, and in what order they fought, but they behaved them
selves valiantly for a long time, Judgment of Sca^.
and in the end they wered werye, and there were xxx. of them ftayne, and xx.
taken prisoners, and of those of Scanderbeg there were only iiii. hurt, and in
this sort Sca^derbeg returned victoriously to Barletta.

The next day following in the morning, Scanderbeg returned again to the
enemies determyninge to fight with them all that day, and the night following
he divided his army into three squadrones, The order of Scan.
ye one of them he would leave in person, the other he committed to ye conducte
of Moises a notable Captain of his, and the other he gave in charge to the
county Gintrizza his most valiante. Nephewe, and he presented these three
squadrones and assailed the enemy in three sondrye places at once, and the
battle continued all that day and in the end the enemies wered weary,
wherefore, that most subtle county James determined to find a remedy, for
that most eminent peril wherein he was, and therefore went forth of his
squadrone, and with a loud voice called saying, most noble prince Scanderbeg,
may it please the that I may safely, comme to speak with thine excellentie
of matters that shall in no wise displease the, Scanderbeg answered that he
should go, and comme safe upon his faith, then the county replied requiring
him that it moughte please him, to comme forth of his squadrone, and he would
do the like to the end y^ they might talk together from their companies,
whereupon Scanderbeg without any difficulty went forth from his squadrone
acompanied with a few soldiers, and when he came near where the county
was, he caused his soldiers to stay a part from him, then James said my
lord our talk will require some time wherefore may it please your highness
that for this day the battle cease, and that commandment be so given to
both the armies, Scanderbeg was well contentyd, then the county was very
glade and began to talk of peace, and amity, both to the honor of the king
Ferrante and also to the honor of Scanderbeg. And as they were thus talkinge,
Moses and Gintrizza, two of his Captains brought in four squadrones of
soldiers which they had taken prisoners, Squadre of toteme^ 20. of men at
arms 25.
and presented them to Scanderbeg. Then the county began to be affraied and
suddenly feigned a Iollitie, and said he doubted not at all, but trusted wholly
in the prome^ of Sca^derbeg, who answered, behold I give them all to you,
notwithstanding that they were all taken before the commandment was given to
the armies, and then he caused them to be set at liberty, in the end. When
Scanderbeg had understood the opinion of the cou^tie in certain points he
answered that it was needful to take good advise, upon these matters, and to
understand the kings pleasure in that behalf, and to give answer the next
day folowinge, when he had thus said, they took leave the one of the other, for
that it was very late. In ye mean time as Scanderbeg made him redye to go
toward Barletta, a soldier of the counties came to Scanderbeg, and showed
him that all the parliament that the countye held with him, was but very
disceite, only to to deliver his army which was so weary, that of necessity
they must have been overthrown, and also for that he had practiced with some of
his soldiers, to se if y^ they could betraye Scanderbeg, and take him
lyuinge and this was the only cause why he came forth in person out of his
squadrone, for if Scanderbeg had not given ear to him but continued still the
battle, there is no doubt but that he had overthrown all the army for they
were all ready so weary, that they were determined to yield them selves. Then
Scanderbeg more furious then any Lion, cried out with a terrible voice
saying, O y^ most wicked murderer and thou county James thou traitor Ganio,
was it not snfficient for the with craft and subtilitie in this sort to
avoid the destruction of thy flugguyshe and unprofitable army, but that thou
must under pretense of so poisoned a frindshippe, seek to betraie me which am
innocent. Wherefore look well to thy self for to morrow thou shalt be
recompensed for thy well doings, when he had thus said he departed with his
people, and went to Barletta, and when he had supped he commanded to give his
horses prouender, and rewarded the soldier that reveled this matter, and
departed in the night by the moon light with all his soldiers with him
toward the enemy, and when he came to the place where they encamped ye night
before, he found all the army gone, for Zachuria Groppa, one of the countes
soldiers declared unto ye cou^tie even as it came to pass, wherefore the
count with his army departed with speed, and went to enrampe, to a place that
was far of. Then Sca^derbeg returned, and the next morninge he took the
king in company with him, and myngled their soldiers, to avoid strife, and
then went on folowinge the tracte of the enemy, and in short time they
discovered them, and he caused to march on the one side Frederick Duke of
Vrbine lieutenante of the popes army, and Alexandre Sforza lieutenante and
brother, to the Duke of Milane, who desired ernestly y^ they might so pass
over, then when they had al things in order, they marched on to a City called
Troia. The Duke John with the county James and all his army were in a City
called Nucera from Troia viii. miles, acordinge to the mesure of Apulia,
between which two Cities their was a mountain called Segiano, from Troia two
miles, and from Nucera viii. miles, Scanderbeg therefore, knowinge that ye
armies must fight, between those two Cities, rose up in the night, and with his
soldiers went and took that hill, and furnished it with men sufficient to
defend it, to the end that if peradventure the kings power should be
overthrown, they might take that hill and defend them selves, the cou^tie
James who in deed was skylfull, and of great experience in wars, meant also
to take the same hill, and therefore he departed also in the morninge betyme to
take the hill, and when he found that Scanderbeg had alredye taken it where
with he was very sorry, and said to certain of his most trusty frinds: that
he was then out of al hope of victory, notwithstanding he left not of for
that, but did in every respect the office and duty of a good Captain,
exhortinge and encoraginge his soldiers, puttinge them also in order
acordinge to the time, and place. The next morning they determined to give
battle and made them ready on both sides, enbattayled their people, The
batbetwene the Duke John and Scan.
and encountered, the fight was between them most terrible, and continued till
the evening in ye end the Dukes army was so overthrown, and spoiled, that he
was glad that he moughte return into France with shame, and dishonor, and with
the loss in manner of all his Frenshe bands, in likewise the county James, with
all the unfortunate noble men of Apuglia, fled through most difficulte passages
every man his way, and it was the great grace of god y^ they escaped with
their lives. Then the king was delivered from his enemies with great glory,
and triumph, through the worthynes of the magnanime, puissante, and
victoriouse prince Scanderbeg. After this the aforesaid king Ferrante, rode with
Scanderbeg to see if that he could recover his Cities, and towns, which he
had lost, he entered into Naples in great triumph, and afterward went on
their journey notwithstanding, many Cities, and towns continued in their
former purpose, and would in no wise obey the king Ferrante, but said that
they would rather dye with their weapones in their hands, then to yield them
into his wicked hands, for they were well assured that he would be revenged on
them, and would observe no promise with them, but they were contented to yield
them to Scanderbeg upon his faithefull promise, in the end when the king, and
Scanderbeg had talked together, it was agreed that the king should swear to
perform all promise that should be made in his name, and that Scanderbeg
should promise his subjects and assure them thereof: otherwise they would not
yield but would fight it out to the uttermost, for it seemed unto him a thing
most unseemly for a Christian prince, to break his faith, which is the seal
of his salvation, and every Christian is bound to observe it, even to his
enemies. Then the king swore openly that he would perform in every respect
what so ever his good father Scan. The oath of king Ferrante.
should promise, when this was done, Scanderbeg went and assured them all
that the king should perform his promise in every respect, and should use
them all as his very fryndes, and louinge subjects by means whereof al places
whersoeuer he came yielded unto him, but as soon as Scanderbeg entered into any
place he caused to set up the enseignes of the king Ferrante and made them
swear fidelity, and obedience to ye king. In this mean time Fusano a
Sicillian, a man of great prowes, a rebel, and a mortal enemy to the king
aforesaid was then in the City of Trani, in the forte thereof, and with the
soldiers that he had, he made co^tynuall wars against the king Ferrante and
did greatly annoie him, wherefore Scanderbeg being much moned therewith, rote
to Trani and took it and Fusano also, who for that he would be set at liberty
and might have means to escape, commanded his Nephewe to yield the forte
into the hands of Scanderbeg. When this was done, Scanderbeg set Fusano at
liberty and suffered him to run his way. When Scanderbeg had recovered
again all the kings Cities, towns, and fortes, which were wont to obey him,
he went straight to the king and restored him to them al, praying with great
instancie, and modesty his highness, to perform and keep all his promises
which he had made to his subjects: which thing the king promised, and
fulfilled for the great good will that he bare unto Scanderbeg. Then ye king
caused to make soleme triumphs. Iustes torneies, and huntings, with other
sumptuouse shows. After this he gave to all Scanderbegs Captains, and chief
soldiers, great presents and gifts, and to Scanderbeg he gave certain
fair Castells in Apuglia, and then after great thanckes, and cortese offres of
both parts Scanderbeg returned into Albania safely, when the Albaneses
understood of the coming of their lord, with so great triumph and victory,
the chief of them went to do reverence unto him, and to visyte his highness,
with great presents and gifts of victual, as fatt Calves young Oxen, Kiddes,
Lames, Wethers, Feisants, Partridges Quails, Tortelles, Thrusshes, Woodcokes,
Snypes, Pluuers, Henes, Pigiones, Capones, Hares, Conniesred Dear, Valoe,
Dear, Boares, Gyse, and other beasts, and fowls, both great, and small,
wild and tame with all kind of other victualles, and with fyshe
notwithstanding, his court was always very well furnished of victualles
(besides these presents) for he had in his court that lived by his meat, and
drink. 5300. persons, and his custume was to give meat and drink to all
his subjects, that came about any suits thither he entertained very
honorably all such as came to visyte him, his chief cou^cellers sat always
at his own table: every man in his degree, often times he would cause them to
drink out of his own cup: a thing in that country of great estimation,
as when a soldier has put him self in great peril for the safety of his
prince in token of the great favor that he bare him: he would some time
drink to him, and cause him to drink out of his own cup.

After this Scanderbeg went to his confynes to visit his Captain that he had
left there? When he went into Apuglia, and there he made great banckettes to
his Captain and all his soldiers and gave to diverse of his fryndes, and
thief soldiers great gifts, to some he gave apparel of clothe of gold, to
others sylke to some scarlate and other colors, to some he gave horses to
others money, to some one thing, and to others an other, acordinge to every
man's deseruinges, so that every man was very well pleased, beside this he
never denied alms, to any poor man that asked him for Christ's sake, and in
those days he gave great alms, and chiefly to the sons of those noble men
that had been chased out of their countres by the Turckes, and to diverse noble
strangers that came to him from far, to whom he gave not only money and
apparel, but also possessiones to maintain them honestly, to live like
Christianes in the fear of god. When the Turcke understood that Sca^derbeg was
returned safely with such triumph, and honor it greuyd him much as it is well
known, for Mahomethe did never understand that Scanderbeg had been in Apuglia
in person, but thought that he had sent only that Captain Coico with. 500.
horses to the king aforesaid for if the Turcke had understood that Scanderbeg
had gone in person, he had (notwithstanding the trewse) employed all his force
to destroy, spoil, and conquer all his country.

When the trewse was ended the Turcke gave commandment to his Captain that
he should in no wise enuade Scanderbeg, onles that he began with him, and in
this mean time he went with his army against the Dispoto of Morea, a man of
great estimation, he chased him out of his country, Morea taken by the Turcke.
and conquered it, in the year. 1460.

After this he went against the Emperor of Trebisonda, he took and conquered
all his state. After this he went against the Isle of Meteline and immediately
took it, after this he marched against the Duke Stephano Hierceco, and took
from him all his country, saving ye Castle of Noui, which stands upon the
mouth of Cataro, and at this present is possessid by the Turcks. The same
Tiran took also many other places that did appertain to the Christians, by
means whereof he was becomme much more puissante then before, when the Turcke
saw him self in this sort victoriouse, and triumphante, by means of the
great enlarginge of his state, he determined to make wars upon Scanderbeg
wherefore he appointed to Sinan his Bassa aforesaid 23. thousand Turckes
horsemen, gyuinge him commandment to go upon the sudden and to assail
Scanderbeg, whereof as soon as Scanderbeg was advertised, Synan Bassa sent
against Scan. and defiected.
he sent for five thousand soldiers more, horsemen and fotemen, to the. 3.
thousand which he had alredie with him, and then departed, with great silence
in the night, and laid his people upon the way that the Turcke must pass,
and took an hill which is not far from a place celled Mocre over the which
hill, the Turckes must in any wise pass when the Turcks were come to the foot
of that hill, they began to go up toward the heighte thereof, not thinckinge
any thing at all of Scanderbeg, and immediately he caused to sound the a
larme, and with such force charged those scatered Turckes (in such sort)
that he put them to flyghte in such disorder, that none of them turned for his
fellow. But Scanderbeg continued still the chase, until y^ he had flayne the
greatest party of them beside those that he took prisoners. After this he
distributed all the proie to his soldiers, who through their contynuall
exercise in battle, Note what exercise does
were becomme invincible so that they were of exceeding noble minds, al fear
was banished out of their heddes, they could endure al kind of travail and
misery, this was the only cause why Scanderbeg obtained so many victories, I
say ye second cause, for the first was the grace of god. The next day
following Scanderbeg made a great course in to the Turckes country, and took an
exceeding great proye, and returned into his country safely with all his.

After this the Turcke sent an other Captain of his called Assa^beg, with an
exceeding great army into Albania, and sought a battle with Scanderbeg, and
with in short space all the chief conductours of his army were slain,
Assambeg defeicted.
whereupon the Turckes fled and the greatest number of them were slain, and the
Bassa was hurt in the right arm with an arowe, and for that it was late he
with drew him self with certain with him, in to a secret place. But
Scanderbeg being advertised her of, went the next morning to the place where
he was, and then Assambeg came forth to him without any weapon, and used so
good words toward him that he merited pardon.

After this the Bassa Iussubeg took in hand to encou^tre Scanderbeg, with an
army of.18. thousand Turckes, and came near a place called Scopia:
notwithstanding, he had not so euel hap as the unfortunate Assambeg had,
Iussubeg defeicted.
for Scanderbeg passed on and met him upon the way as he was coming, and
charged him upon y^ sudden and put him, and his people to flyghte. Yet
notwithstanding, the vain desire of fame and glory, stirred up the old
Carazabeg which had been a companion with Scanderbeg, in the wars of Natolia,
and other places, who had done the Turcke great service, wherefore he went to
the Turcke, and so persuaded with him that in the end he obtained license to
chose as many soldiers as he would, to take with him, whereupon he chose. 30.
thousand horsemen, and made him ready, to go to seek Scanderbeg, and to
assail him upon the sudde^ but Scanderbeg being advertised hereof, went
against him passinge through the two countres of Dibra until he came to the
confynes of Triballe, where it was certified unto him, Carazabeg experimented
in wars.
that Carazabeg must pass, as soon as he came there he was ware of. 4.
thousand Turckes, which Carazabeg had sent before to discover his passage but
coming into the bosom of Scanderbegs army, the greatest number of them were
immediately slain which when the Bassa understood, he was excedingely sorry, and
chiefly for that he was so discovered: more then for the death of his
soldiers.

Then this subtle old Ruter sent to Scanderbeg a messager, requiring him to
fight with him like a prince in appointed battle, and not upon suddennes in
such sort like a stradarolle and thief, seking always to take the enemy
unprovided. But Scanderbeg being as circumspecte as he, and knowing well the
decepte of ye old man, who would seem to blame that in an other man, yt he him
self would faynest have brought to pass, if yt by any means he moughte,
Scanderbeg sent him answer, saying, Celeritie does much prevail in wars.
I will answer the old folishe follow well enough. Then whiles Carazabeg
did consulte of the matter acording to the manner of old men, Scanderbeg with
his army in very good order, came and assailed the army of Carazabeg with
such force, and noise, y^ it was not possible for one of them to hear an
other, and by means of the great rain, and wind that then was Scanderbeg
could not follow the chase acordingely as he was wont to do, although he
handelled them very rudely. But Carazabeg being greatly ashamed and
confounded, took the shortest way to Constantinople, where he was not a little
rebuked of the great Turcke, and also mocked, after that by means of his
fryndes, he was well commended of that Tiran, for that he had passed the journey
with less charges, and spoil of his people, then any of the rest of his
Bascias had done, and brought away his people with less slaughter.

When Mahomethe saw that he could by no means obtain his purpose against
Scanderbeg, he then determined to prove whether he might deceive him or no,
wherefore he determined to send to him for peace, to the end that he might
proceed against other princes in the mean time without let of Scanderbeg,
wherefore he sent an ambassador to him, with a letter, and great presents, A
letter from the Turk to Scan.
beside the clothe of gold, and sylke, y^ he sent him, who received the
ambassador with his letter in very cortese sort. The tenor of his letter
was. The lord Mahomethe the mighty king, and Emperor, of all parts of the
world, from the East to the west, to the noble prince Scanderbeg greating: we
give thy worthynes to understand, that notwithstanding the great offenses
that thou have committed against our house and state, yet when I call to
mind, and consider the great trauayles and pains and the worthy and
excellent acts, that thou have so faithfully wroughte, for the conservation,
increase, and honor, of our state, when thou were oftage with our father
Amorathe and did eat his bread in Andrinople, and were more favored, and
honored in his court, then any other Sangiacho, Bassa (or good seruante) that
he had. I can not but forget all the aforesaid offenses, wherefore I give the
to understand that I have determined to pardon the all offenses, and to
becomme thy frynde, and to make a perfect peace with the, upon this condition,
that y^ will suffer, that my people may pass safely through thy country, to
make wars upon the Venetianes, my enemies and in consideration hereof. I will
franckly give the all that that thou possessyst in Albania, which of right did
appertain to my father, and from henceforthe I will call the prince of the
Epirotes, and will do the all the pleasure and honor possible, I will also
that for performance of this peace, thou send me John thy son, who^ I will
use as though he were mine own son, and moreover, for that that I do
desire to se the personally for the great fryndshyppe that has been of a long
time between us, may it please the to comme and visyte me that we may rejoice
together, and god does well know the great entertainment that I will make y^, I
would also that thou would grant that the merchants of mine Empire
moughte safely pass through thy country, and I will grant the like to the
merchants of thy country, and thou may credit my seruante, and
ambassador Mustaffa the bringer hereof, and whatsoever he shall say unto thee,
I will perform, from Constantinople the second of May. 1461.

When Scanderbeg had read this letter he smyled, and then talked a great time
with the ambassador, and by him wrote answer to the Turckes letter, in this
sort. The soldier of Jesus Christ, George Castrioth sometime named
Scanderbeg, Answer to the Turckes letter.
prince of the Albaneses, and Epirotts, to the most excellent prince of the
Turckes Mahomethe sends greating. By thine ambassador, and letter. I have
understood the mind of thine excellentie in certain points, whereunto I
answer, first that the Venetianes, beside all other fryndshippes that are
between them and me, by the which we do estime here our states as one, are so
honest good Christianes, and do so well observe their promises, that although
there were none other hand of our Catholic faith, under pain of greatter
excomminycation, that Christianes should not wyllingly permit the hethenes
to anoye Christianes, I for the aforesaid virtues, and goodness that is in
them, may never condescend to this first demand, for so much as I am not
returned to ye Christian faith to stand a cursed, nor hurt such as be
faithful. As touching that, that thy highness says you will from henceforth
call me prince of the Epirotts, that shall not offend me at all for thou shalt
do but right to give me that title, which God of his goodness has given me,
for his own honor. And where thy highness requires my only son John, which
is the solase of his mother, this thing also I may not grant: having
noyssue but only him, for I am careful of him, and can not otherwise
answer thee, and as to that thy maiesrie says thou desyrest to seem
personally, for ye great frindshippe that has been betwyne us of long time, I
say also that if it were a thing that moughte be done without peril I would
sone do it, but now for so much as God has appointed me to be absent from
thee in this sort, I do think, that as it does suffice me, so it should
suffice thee to se and behold me with the eyes of thy mind. And to this last
where thou say that thou would that the merchants of our countres
should safely traffic the one, into the others country through out in all
places, I am contented to make peace with thee with this last condition, and
offer my self (in all just and reasonable cause) to be at thy commandment,
and thus fare well. And what I want in writing thy ambassador shall certify
the by mouth, from our camp the. 30. of May. 1461.

When Scanderbeg had endyd his letter, the ambassador departed, and carried the
letter to the Turcke, and after that by commandment of the Turcke within 40.
days, he returned to Scanderbeg with an other letter: of this tenor. An other
letter to Scan. from the Turcke.
The lord Mahomethe, the mighty prince, and Emperor of all parts of the
world, from ye East, to the west, to the magnificent prince Scanderbeg prince
of the Epirotts, sends greting. By Mustaffa my seruante and ambassador, and
by thy letter responsyue I do understand in what sort thou art content to
make peace with me, and also how thou do excuse thy self as touching
certain of my demaundes, wherefore to show how much I do favor the, and
how greatly I do tender thy state, I am content to make a perfect peace with
the, acording to thine own will, and as I have alredie of mine own goodwyll
called the prince of Epirro, so will I always from henceforthe call thee, and
of my liberality I do franckly give the, all the state y^ thou at this day
do possess, as well that which appertains to me in the right of my
father, as the rest. And credit Mustaffa my seruante and ambassador, for
whatsoever he shall promise in my behalf, I will perform, and agreing with
him, thou shalt confyrme the peace, which thou shalt sign with thine own
hand, and seal with thy seal, and send me, farewell, from Constantinople the.
22. of June. 1461.

When the peace was in this sort concluded, and published in all places,
betwyne Scanderbeg and ye Turcke the Senate of Venise, by common consent of the
Senataurs in the time of Christofero Mauro, being then their Duke, sent into
Albania a new lieutenante, a man of great understanding, named Gabriel
Deuisano, to ye end that he should be much in the company of Scanderbeg,
and to prove with his perswasiones, if that he could cause him to break the
peace that he had made with the Turcke, who made cruel wars upon the
Venetianes, notwithstanding Scanderbeg remained constant and firm, for sondrie
respects, and chiefly for that he saw his people glad, and desirous of
peace, considering the long wars that they had endured.

When a certain time wss passed, the aforesaid lieutenante of the Venetianes,
went to the Arche Bysshope of Durazzo, which was in great estimation not only
in all that province, but also in Rome, and diverse other parts of Italy, and
did right well deserve it, for he was of a very good nature, learned in the
Greek, and latyne, eloquent, well seen both in Divinity and humanity, beloved
of al men, and honored chiefly of the princes of Albania, and especially of
Scanderbeg, who reposed him wholly upon him, his name was Paulo Angelo, he was
son to the aforesaid Andre, Captain of Driuaste, of the excellency of
whose house I mean not to speak any furdre, for that it is manifestly known.
This lieutenante declared the mind of the Senate to the aforesaid most
reverend Arche Byshope, whose house being of ancient frindshippe with the
state of Venise, and besides that for other sondrie good respects (as soon as
he understood of this) he went forth with to Scanderbeg, where through the
credit, authority, and affiance that Scanderbeg had in him, he so persuaded,
that calling together diverse other noble me, and soldiers of great
understanding, they concluded with the Arche Byshope, who aleged the
infidelity of the Turckes, and how that they never kept their promise, but
to serve them selves with all, and with such like arguments, he brought to
pass, that he joined Scanderbeg, and ye Venetianes in such an amity and
fryndshyppe, as ever after continued betwyne them. And for this there was made
great joy in every place.

After this the Turcke promised to give an hundred thousand ducates to who so
ever could fley the Arche Bishop, and. 2. hundred thousand to whosoever
would present him unto him living. Then Scanderbeg upon the sudden gathered
together his army, and made a rode into ye Turcks country and raised a proie
of. S. hundred thousand sheep. 60. thousand head of Kyen, Oxen, and Bullockes,
and. 3. thousand Mares, with their coltes, which were of the Tnrckes own
race, Scan. takes an exceeding great proie out of the Turckes domynions.
he took beside this great riches, and burned a great piece of ye country, and
returned home safe, and dispersed all the proie to his soldiers.

When the great Turcke understand of these great spoils that Scanderbeg had
made, and how he had broken the peace with him, he was excedingly wroth, and
day, nor night thought of any thing but how to be revenged of Scanderbeg,
and of the Arche Byshope yet for that he understood that the pope Pio the. 2.
would in any wise make a great Croysade, and go against him in person, he
determined to attempt if he could by any means pacifye Scanderbeg, and to
confyrme ye peace that was alredie made, for he doubted that if that Scanderbeg
should comme with the Croisade, that he should then be vtteriy ouerthorowen:
as the Turckes them selves declared in all places. This kind of Croisade was
determined in the concistorie at Rome, by the aforesaid pope, being moved
through the suggestion of diverse prelates, and Cardinals, men of great
worthynes, and chiefly by the fryndes of the before named Arche Byshope Pauolo,
so that this most worthy pope Pio the second, had determined to go in person
and to see this journey: and when he should have been in the City of Durazzo,
to have celebrate in the Cathedrale church thereof a most solemn mess, and
to have given to this most worthy Arche Bishop the hatte of a Cardinale, for
that he was alredie pronounced in the concistorie at Rome, in the month
before, and also to give ye Regale corone to Scanderbeg, and to make him king
of Epirro, and of all the whole Albania, and when he had so coronned him, to
give him tro^chion, appointing him general of the Croisade, and in that sort
to proceed to the utter destruction of the Mahometane sect.

When the Turcke therefore understood this, he sent the before named Mustaffa his
ambassador to Scanderbeg with a letter of this effect. The great and mighty
prince Mahomethe, Emperor of all parts of ye world from the East, A letter
from the Turcke to Sca^.
to the West, to thee magnificent Scanderbeg, prince of the Epirotts, I have
none occasion to send thee greting, nor to wyshe the health as well for that
thou have broken the peace made betwyne us, as also in that thou have not
holden thy promised faith, but have done me so many manifest wrongs:
notwithstanding, for so much as I understand that the Venetians mine enemies
have deceived thee, and caused the so to do, for this I will have sum
respect toward the, and have ye partly for excused, and so to pardone the
these offenses, so that thou will be co^tentyd now, to make peace with me,
which is to confyrme the tenor, and conditiones of the last peace made betwyne
us, and that thou shalt swear this second peace so confyrmed upon the faith
which thou owe to thy God, The estimation of an oath, with the Turcke.
for so much as I am thoroughly persuaded, that if thou had sworn y^
first, that the Venetianes, nor any others could have caused thee to break
it: wherefore I beseech thee, if that my request may have any place with the:
that thou will make this second peace with an oath, and I swear unto thee upon
my faith, that I will observe my promise in every condition, and never to molest
thee, but to be always profitable, and frindely to thee, and ready to honor
the, and otherwise I do assure thee, that I will leave all other enterprise,
and will contynually follow, and plague thee in such sort, that if thou
escape with thy life, I will banishe the thy country, and then it shall be seen
whyther the Venetianes be able to maintain ye against me or no, thou being a
simple, and mean prince of that part of Albania which thou now posessist,
and I am Emperor, king, and prince, of so many powers and countries, that
thou shalt never be able to wtstand my furye wherefore have regard to thy
self, and make this peace with good will, to the end that thou may dye
lord of thy country, and leave that honor to thy posterity: otherwise, it
shall be to thy hindrance: thou may give credit to my seruante and abassadour
Mustaffa, in all things that he shall say unto thee, from Constantinople the.
7. of May. 1463.

After that Scanderbeg had herd the ambassador, and red the letter which the
Turcke had sent him, he wrote him answer in this sort. The soldier of
Jesus Christ, Answer to the Turckes letter.
George Castrioth some time named Sca^derbeg prince of the Albaneses, to the
excellent Mahometh prince of the Turckes, gretinge, forsomuche as I under
stand by thine ambassador Mustaffa, and by thy letter also, the great
complaints and injuries, wherewith thou chargest me, I am enforced to answer:
and to say unto the, that I do not repent me at al in that that I have in
this sort broken the peace with thee, for it is not lawful for the great
prince to make his will a law, and to disdaigne the lesser, as thou have done
me, in that, that on a time a peace being made betwyne us, thou immediately
brakest it, with thy faith also, and that this is true, God is my witness,
and the world also knows it, that whylest I dwelled in peace assuring my
self upon thy promise, thy soldiers did greatly endomage me whereupon I sent
my messager to thee, to whom thou gave answer, that thou would chastize
them that had so offended, notwithstanding thy promptness was turned into
air, and I remained frustrate, and the offenders without pu^nishment, which
does plainly declare it to be done by thy consent, wherefore know thou, that I
had great reason to redress my wrongs: and not to make scrupule in breaking
of peace with him, which estymeth not peace, but does immagine how to abuse
ye world, and then will say that the Venetianes have deceived me, who always
observe their promise, not as thou do. And therefore I give the fully to
understand that in no case I will make peace with thee, though I be as simple
a prince as pleasythe God, and thou so mighty and puissante an Emperor as thou
say, even from the Orient, to the ye Occident, which no man says but only
thou, which through thine audatitie, pride, and presumption, do arogantly
take upon the to usurp such an Imperial name, which only appertains to
the Emperor of Rome, which is coroned by the pope of Rome, being gods vicar
on earth and thou by the permission of God art becomme a mighty tyran to
punish the wickedness of the Christianes, for the which thou thinckest it
lawful to usurp so excellent a name, whereby thou make them laughe y^ read
it, forsomuche as the world is divided into three principal parts, that is
Asia, Africa, and Europa, the first is in manner as great as both the other,
and is divided into Asia ye greater and the lesser, in the lesser which is
called Natolia, are many kingdoms, whereof thou possessest only that part,
which I by mine industry have brought into subjection of thy house, which is
a small portion in comparison of the rest. In the greater, there are very many
kingdoms in the which thou have nothing to do. In Africa there are
exceeding many kingdoms, and provinces, whereof thou possessyst no jot, but
in Europe which is almost the greatest inhabitation of the world there are
many kingdoms, and provinces, of which ye possessest only, Tracia, Gretia,
Seruia, Bossina, More a, Bulgaria, Achaia, Magnesia, Mitelline, and certain
others which were, and shall be of the possessiones of the Christianes, wherefore
I do not a little marvel that y^ which can give me good council, can so
suffer thy self to be blinded with ambition, that thou doeste not consider
what thou say: and although that for our scourge thou art becomme a great
tyran, possessing in Asia, and Europa, more then thyrtie provinces: yet I give
the to understand that I esteem the not for all that, but do trust in my
lord Jesus Christ that he will cause a thousand hethennes to fall down before
the face of ten Christianes: so that I am not to be diswaded nether for
flattery, nor threatening, onles that thou will openly embrace the Christian
faith wherein of a child thou ha^ ben instructed, and also that thou will
cause al thy subjects to be baptized, and doing acording to that part of the
Alchorane which says that the Gospel is good, and is the best thing that is
upon the earth, and in this sort thou may have of me what thou will.
Otherwise, understand that I will defend my self, and that not without thy
hurt and shame, for I fight for the honor of him, that will help me, from
our camp the xxv. of June. 1463.

As soon as Scanderbeg had sealed this letter, Note this ^cte.
he went to horse with all his army, and carried with him the aforesaid
ambassador, and went into the Turckes country and raised a great proie, and
assailed Sfetigarde which of right should have been his, and took the town
and set fire on it: notwithstanding the citadell which stood on the heighte of
the hyl was in expungnable, wherefore be returned, and took his leave of the
ambassador very cortezely, declaring to him by mouth beside his letter,
wylling him to say unto the Turcke from him, that at the coming of the great
priest of Rome, with the Croisade, he would comme to satiffie his desire, that
he had so greatly to see him: and when the ambassador had taken his leave, he
rode on of his journey. Then Scanderbeg returned with his army into his
country, and distributed the proie unto them, and then gathered them together
and said. My fellows in arms, I beseech you be of good chere, for if the
Croisade be but as many in number as the iiii. part of the Turckes power, we
with their help will chase him undoubtedly out of his domynyons notwithstanding
I hope that the Croisade wylbe of far greater power then his army shall be,
and so much the sonner, for that that God is with us, and the soldiers are
Italianes, Frenshemen, Spaniardes, Englishmen, Almaignes. Hu^garianes,
Pollonianes, Vallaques Schiauoneses, Greeks, Albaneses, besides our people
and others, by whose means, and by the grace of God. I hope that the Turcke
shall be utterly ruynate, and chased out of his dominiones, and his tyranny
clean plucked up by the rotes, and the church of God to be at rest, if it be
the pleasure of God.

In this mean time ye ambassador Mustaffa brought Scanderbegs letter to the
great Turcke, who when he understood the tenor thereof was filled with great
fury, not without exceeding great fear whereupon he sent forthewith to all
his towns of force and fortes, great iud^ment of Maho^^the.
that he thought were of most importance, and fortifyed then by all means
possible: and then called to him Seremeth beg his Bassa, and sent him with
xiiii. thousand Turckes against Scanderbeg, to lie upon the confines of his
country for the guard thereof and of his City that he (...) much estymed,
called Orchride, or else Aeleria, which is not far from Scanderbegs country,
and is near unto a certain lake out of the which ye river Drino does rise,
in y^ which lake their is great abondance of carpes Trowtes, and other delicate
and noble fyshes. When Scanderbeg understood of the coming of those Turckes,
he determined to seek them although it were a hard matter to deal with them,
for so much as the one part of them were lodged within the City, and the rest
wtoute not far from it, in this mean time their came news unto them how
that the pope Pio ye second was come in person with the Croisade to the City
of Ancona, meaning as soon as the Duke of Venise should comme thy there, to
take ship, and to sail toward the Turcks notwithstanding he fell syke
there, and in short space dyed, The pope poisoned.
being poisoned acordinge to the opinion of many by certain hipocrites and
false Christianes through y^ which, the noble Duke of Venise which was then
there not only with his own armata, but also with the aid of diverse
Christian princes was excedingly amassed, and returned to Venise much
discomforted: and in this sort was the great Croisade frustrate.

When Scanderbeg contrary to his expectation understood of this, he was
stricken with very great sorrow forsomuche as in that was his only hope. Then
with tears he lifted up his eyes to the heavens, saying O most merciful
lord Jesus Christ very God, I do see ye thine omnipotent, A prayer made by
Scan.
and divine majesty (fountain and spring of all goodness) will not send
forth this Croisade, to the destruction of both thine, and our enemies. And
I fear it is for our offenses which are Christians for that we have greatly
provoked thee to wrath, wherefore I humbly beseech the for thy mercyes sake, by
the which thou pardonedst the these hanging on the Cross thou which art only
comme to call sinners to repentance, that it may please thee to defend us thy
servants, which do fight day and night, in the defense of our most
Catholic faith: to the end that the enemies say not, where is the God of
Chrystyanes becomme, notwythstandynge thy will be done, and not ours.

When Scanderbeg had thus ended his prayer, he t^ned him to his soldiers who
with tears also had prayed with him, and to comfort them he said. My dear
frinds fear nothing, but be of good chere, for God does never leave those
that put their whole trust in him, and does all things for the commodity of
both body and soul of his faithful, wherefore we humbly render thanckes unto
his divine maistie, and to morrow we will go to seek the Turckes our enemies,
with whom we will fight, and deal with them acordinge to our wont. Three
hours before the break of day, Scanderbeg rode with xii. thousand horse men
and footmen, and came near unto the City of Orchrida aforesaid, and spoke
to his soldiers in this sort. This day is the vigile of the assumption of
the virgin Marie Queen of heaven, Great blindness.
in honor of whom and for the obedience of the commandment of holly church,
every faithful Chrystian does fast, or at the least does eat fyshe, but I
do use always to fast, and for that confidence, and faith, that I have in her.
I will assuredly promise you, that at dinner time you shall have to dyne with,
as great abondance of good fyshe, as ever you saw, wherefore consider, that the
custumer of this town is a man of great welthe, strong lusty, and valiante,
and he wylbe the first that shall comme against us: wherefore see that you give
him place and in no wise stryke him, nor do him any hurt, but take him, for
after our victory (the which I hope we shall obtain, through the grace of
Marie the Queen of heaven) we shall have plenty of ducates of the same
custumer, and also as much fish, as shall suffice you wherefore be of good
chere.

When he had thus said he called unto him Peiche Emanuell and Pietro Agenlo
brother to the Arche-Bushope Paulo, and appointed to their conducte v. hundred
chosen horsemen, and gave them commission to go near the town of Aeleria to
provoke the Turckes to comme for the, and as soon as they should come near
unto them, he willed them to flee and to seem to be greatly affraied, and to
draw them on to the place where Scanderbeg moughte cut between them and the
town, and so to assail them in two sondrie places at once, whereby he moughte
easyly defeicte them, as it came to pass, for that the aforesaid Captains
were men of great Judgment, Great judgment of Scan.
and trained the enemies spedyly paste the place where Scanderbeglaye in
ambushe, and as soon as they turned upon them and charged, they took this
custumer and immediately upon their charge, Sca^derbeg discovered him self, and
charged them on their backs and slew x. thousand of them, and took the son
of Seremethbeg with xii. Turckes more of acompte, which were presented unto him
fearing lest they should be all flayne: The defeicte before A^laia.
but Scanderbeg, being courtesy it self, caused them to be gentylly
entreated, and of his great courtesy, laid the greatest charge upon ye
custumer, who although he were very soroweful, yet with a pleasant contenaunce
he sent for so much fyshe, both fresh, and salt, as did fully satiffye the
whole army, wherefore they said through out the army, that Scanderbeg was an
Apostle of him that fed the multitude of y^ Jews with v. barley loves and
two fyshes. After this for the ransomes of the custumer, the son of the
Bascia, and the other xii. Turekes, there was presented unto Scanderbeg, the
su^me of xl. thousand ducates, in Gold, and money of the Turekyshe Coin,
then Scanderbeg caused it all to be laid down upon carpettes and distributed
al with his own hands to his soldiers, gyuinge every man his offering, but
not as the priest does upon the solemn feasts. After this he suffered the
prisoners to depart into the town, and he returned into his country safe and
with great joy.

When the Turcke understood this he dispatched an other fearce Captain of his
called Balaban Badera: called Aga, with xv. thousand Turckes on horse, and
three thousand fotemen, the which Balaban came to y^ City of Ocrida, or
Aelcria, and sent secretly to Scanderbeg diverse great presents, to purchase
frindshyppe with him, to the end that paraduenture he being taken prisoner at
any time, moughte be assured of his life, as it was declared to Scanderbeg by
the secret arie of Balaban, which was taken by Scanderbegs soldiers in a
rencountre betwyne the Turckes and him, this Balaban was an Albanese borne, and
a country man, subject to the father of Scanderbeg, and was taken in his child
head by the Turckes, with diverse other children, as they were keeping of
Cattle, notwithstanding, his hap was to serve men of acompte, and so became
a valiante man, and for that he was the first that entered into Constantinople,
when the Turckes gave the assault unto it, the great Turcke exalted him to y^
degree. When he was in this sort appointed against Scanderbeg, he semyd
outewardely to be much his frynde, although inwardly he was the greatest
enemy that he had in all y^ world, as by the proof it was seen, for he was
ever attentyue to take in hand all such enterprises as might tend to the
destruction of Scanderbeg, under the pretense of dissemblyd fryndshippe, to the
end he moughte do the more hurt. And when Balaban understood, that
Scanderbeg with his soldiers was in the valley called Valcal, he made him
ready with xv. thous^d horsemen and three thousand fotemen, to go in the
night to assail Scanderbeg: but he being aduertysed hereof by his spiall,
went to encountre him, whereof Balaban being certyfyed and being a shamed for
sondrie respects (and chiefly for that his treason was so discovered, and also
his fained frindshyppe) he returned with speed. The^ Scanderbeg came over the
valley aforesaid, and encamped upon the heighte of the same with all his
people which were in number 4. thousand horsemen well mounted, and v. hundred
fotemen, to whom he spoke in this sort. My companions, I doubt not but to
morrow: or the next day at the fardest, Scan. to his soldiers.
this most wicked traitor Balaban will comme to seek us with all his power,
wherefore I think it good that we tarry him, and when we se him coming that
we depart from hence, and go to that little hill that is behind us, to the
end that they may think that we flee from them, consydering our number is
small in the respect of them, and therefore may the more boldly and assuredly
chase us, and then, when I shall give you a token, every man to make hedde, and
to charge them being so scatered, by means whereof, we may easyly overthrow
them, which if it so happen (as my trust is in God that it shall) I command
you all upon pain of my displeasure, Note the Judgment of Scan.
that you follow the chase even to the mount, or hill of Valcal and no further,
for I am assured that they will leave some troop in that valley, to the end
that if they should be broken, and we should follow them paste that place,
they moughte charge us behind, and they whom we should follow should charge
us in the face, and all in an instante, and by that means overthrow us at
their pleasure, for the place is very apt for an ambushe.

The second day after that Scanderbeg had thus exhorted his soldiers,
Balaban with all his power came to find Scanderbeg, who acordinge to his,
determynation went with his soldiers toward the aforesaid hill: then the
Turckes with great fury assailed Scanderbeg, and he fled for a certain
space, and then in an instante turned and charged them (he being in very good
order) with such force that after long, and terrible fight, he enforced them
to torn their backs, and to flee in great disorder, in such sort that in the
end y^ greatest number of them were found ded upon y^ feelde and the victory
was followed to the aforesaid appointed place. Balaban defeicted the first time.
But the aforesaid Moses, Gintrizza, Musachio Dela Angelina, Gino Musachio,
Giouaniperlato, Nicolo Berisio, Georgio Cucca, and Gino Manesio, every one of
these were able to give order to an army, and had often times governed right
great charge. These men being very ernest in executinge the enemy, by means
of the great hatred they had toward Balaban and his Turckes, Nota.
did not remember, or else in their fury esteemed not the commandment of
Scanderbeg, wherefore they passed the appointed place following y^ victory
fleing, and cuttinge in pieces, their fleing enemies, until that they came to
the myddest of the valley of Valcal. Then the squadrone of the enemies
(acording to the saying of Scanderbeg) that there was laid, charged wholly
upon these eighte Captains, which after long and cruel fight in the defense
of them selves with the great slaughter of those amassed Turckes, passed of
force through the myddeste of that valley, and clymed up an hill upon the
heighte whereof were the Turckishe fotemen, unknown to them, whereby they were
deceived, thinckinge that they had been of their own men, they were taken by
these fotemen, and delivered to Balaban who forthewith sent them to y^ great
Turcke, who then was at Constantinople. When Scanderbeg understood this
piteouse case, he sent immediately and ambassador to the great Turcke, to
desire him that he would be contentyd to restore to him those prisoners safe,
and in exchange of them he should have others, or else, as much money as they
did weighe, but he being full of fury, and cruelty, and being aduertysed by
Balaban of their worthynes, would in no wise gratifye Scanderbeg, but in
greater dispite caused them to be flayed by little, Barbarique cruelty.
and little, for the space of xv. days contynually, and in this sort they dyed.

After this the Turcke supplied his army, and commanded Balaban in any wise
to continue the wars against Scanderbeg, notwithstanding Balaban durst not
to make any attempt against him, but sought to qualify the matter, and to
be at peace with Scanderbeg who never put any trust in him, nor yet granted
him peace for any gift that he could send, but contynually made his courses
into the Turcks country, and brought from thence great proyes, and spoils, and
ever returned to his confynes, when Balaban saw that he could by no secret
practice pacyfy Scanderbeg, he determined to prove if that he moughte by
treason surprise him and so upon the sudden to defeicte him for he was out of
all hope to overthrow him in battle, wherefore he discoursed in him self by
what means (in executinge his intent) he might defeicte Scanderbeg, with his
army also and in the end he found means by gyuing an exceeding great su^me
of money to corrupt his guard that he held contynually without his camp, to
give aduertizement from time, to time of the coming of the enemy. In this
company were certain Albaneses his kynsmen, in whom Scanderbeg had great
affiance, not thincking it a possibility, for any such treason to have had
place in them, Balaban took his journey in the night with xv. thousand
horsemen, and.3. thousand fotemen to assail Scanderbeg, and marched until it
was with in an hour of day, and then approchinge near to the camp,
Scanderbeg by means of the great noyses of their horses suspected the treason
of the aforesaid guard and made him ready most spedyly, with his iiii. thousand
horsemen and one thousand five hundred fotemen, even as though he had been
aduertized of the whole practice, so that his enemies thincking to take him
utterly unprovided, found him in very perfyte, and good order, at the which
the enemies were excedingely astonished notwithstanding, through the great
encoragementes of Balaban, they encounteryd with Scanderbeg, and charged him in
terrible sort with great fury, but in the end through the providence,
Balaban defeicted the seco^tyme.
and conducte of Scanderbeg, they were all disordered, and put to flyghte, in
such sort that few of them carried any news home but of the army of
Scanderbeg there were only ten flayne.

When the great Turcke had aduertysement of this he determined in any wise to
proceed against Scanderbeg, and knowing Balaban to be of no less valiantize,
and experience in wars, then the best of the rest of his Captains: and also
y^ he was an Albanese borne and a great enemy to Scanderbeg, he sent him
again with xviii. thousand horsemen, and iii. thousand fotemen, with who^ he
arrived at the City of Aelcria, where he continued for a long time without
gyuing any at tempte against Sca^derbeg, and did continue his secret sendinge
of presents unto him, and declared unto him that he was his very frynde, and
seruante at commandment. But Scanderbeg who did well know him to be a great
murderer, and Traitor, and that it was his only suit to be sent again with
charge against him did not only, not trust him, but also to declare, that he
made none acompte of him, and beside that, that he had received his presents,
sent him in change somptuose presents growing about the villages wherein
Balaban was borne, which was sacks of a little yelowe grain and also of cocle,
and such like of vile price, with a ploughe harrowe, pycke axe, spade, van, and
flayle, with such like instruments,

Then Balaban well understanding his meaning by this, was marueloufly offendyd:
and knowing that Sca^derbeg lay contynually upon his confynes with viii.
thousand horsemen, and ii. thousand five hundred fotemen, he marched with his
whole army against Scanderbeg, and when he saw Balaban coming he made him
ready, put his people in order and marched toward him and joined with him in
battle, the fight being terryble, Scanderbeg with his own hand slew y^
day many of his enemies, and as he was in the prease fyghting with his enemies
(through ille fortune) his horse was slain under him, and fell down to the
ground with him, and in the fall Scanderbeg lighted upon y^ trou^cke of a tree
that was cut down, and by means of y^ great fall, he was greatly bruised, and
chiefly in his right arm in such sort that he could not in manner stir it
at al. Then the Turckes thincking that he had been ded, caused certain to
descend from their horses to stryke of his head, whereupon he called unto him
his wonted magnanimity and notwithstanding his exceeding great bruise he lepte
up and stood upon his fete, and with his sword flewe all the Turckes that were
so lyghted from their horses, and as many more of others that environed him to
y^ intent to have slain him, his acts that he then did were maruelouse. At
the last, one of his soldiers brought unto him one of his best coursers and
when Sca^derbeg was mounted on horse, he gave in among the Turckes in such
fury, as in his life he had not done the like, and always one stroke was the
price of one enemy with him, and he assailed the enemies with so great
assurance, and force, that he constrained them to disorder, to torn their
backs, Balaban defeicted the third time,
and to flee, and in the chase he flewe them in manner all, but the said
Balaban with a very small number with him, did flee into y^ City of Orchrida
aforesaid.

After this, Sca^. disposed y^ whole spoil to his soldiers very liberally,
according to his custume but after y^ victory, he endured such pain in his
arm, y^ he was iii months and could not ones lift it, to take of his cappe
to gratify such as did salute him, Great absurdity
ne yet to reverence y^ Image of our Savior, nor of the virgyne Marye, ne yet
of the saints. And also when he herd mass he was served as is the high
Bishop when he does assyst in solemn feasts, for he could not help him
self at all with one of his hands.

In this mean while Balaban being very sorrowful and asshamed, returned with
few with him to Constantinople, and was greatly blamed reuyled, and
condemned, by the great Turcke, but he like an old Ape and subtle fox,
endured all thing patiently, and when the fury was past he found such
means that he so excused him self, attributing his overthrow to the
providence of God, that the Turcke was well satisfied with his excuses and
committed the whole charge of these wars to his discresion: whereupon
forthewyth he took in his company the Captain Iaguppe Arnanthe a man of great
value, Iagup Arnanthe signifies in our speech Iamez the Albaneses. When he
was marching, he divided his army, and wylled James with one part thereof to
pass through Tracia, and Macedonia into Epirro and in any wise to keep him
secret, and not to enuade until he had advertisement that Balaban was arrived
in Albania, and he that first approached the confynes to tarry his companion, to
the end that they moughte upon the sudden assail Scanderbeg.

Balaban on the other side took with him xx. M Turckishe horsemen, and iiii.
thousand fotemen, and came first into Epirro, and encamped in the before named
place of Valcal, which when Scanderbeg understood being always provided, and
in redines, sent iii. spiones into the enemies camp to consider the order of
the same but one of these spiones was a kinsman of Balaban, and was y^ cause
that the other two returned not at the hour appointed, whereupon Scanderbeg
being a soldier most vigilant, took with him five soldiers and went to
discover the camp of the enemies, but that subtyl Balaban who had good
experience of the usage of Scanderbeg, appointed to that place which was most
apt for such purpose, certain soldiers on horse, and being there,
encountered with Scanderbeg, and were at the blow of the sword for a time. But
in the end Scanderbeg was enforced to flee and take the nearest way to his
camp and passing through a strait found by mishappe, a tree lying
ouerthwarte his way, notwithstanding, he put spurs to his horse and lepte
over it and so did one of his soldiers: but the other four could not by
any means, whereupon they turned to y^ Turckes, and charged them, and slew
certain of them, but in the end they were all four slain. In this mean
time Scanderbeg being moved with pity turned him and espyeing a Turcke that
had lopte the tree after him following him, he encountered him with such fury
that at the first stroke he slew him, and then he fled until he came to
Pietra Biancha, which was viii. miles from him: where be found his viii.
thousand horsemen, and iiii. thousand fotemen tarying for him.

Then he changed his horse, and in few words encoraged his soldiers to
fight stoutly, and when he had thus done, he marched on toward the enemy,
and or that he would encountre him, he took a certain hill not far from
them, and then ordained all things for the battle, and presented his people
in four squadrones the one he committed to the conducte of Thamssio Thopia,
lord of the country near unto Durazzo and cosyn to the Arche Bishop Paulo
Angelo aforesaid, the second he committed to the leading of Zacharia Groppa
the third to Peiche Emanuell and the fourth he lad in person and this was his
order, but Balaban who tarried for his companion would in no wise accept the
battle whereof when Scanderbeg understood, he disbanded certain men and
entered the scaramoche with the Turcks augmenting it from time to time, Note
this order.
in such sort, that he in the end enforced them to comme to the battle, and
then presented all his squadrones in front saving only one which he held
hidden behind the rest, the battayles being joined the fight was terrible,
in this mean time the fourth squadrone came in upon their flancke vnsoked
for, and charged them with such courage that the Turckes not being able to
endure the force of the Albaneses, acording to their old custume disordered
them selves and fled, so that they were hurt, and flayne in manner all,
Balaban defeicted the fourth time.
notwythstandinge Balaban with few with him conveyed him self in to a place of
security.

This victory being newely obtained, their came a messager in great have to
Scanderbeg from his sister ye lady Ma^nizza, declaring unto him yt Iagup was
comme into Albania by the way of Belgrado, and had proied, spoiled, and burned
a great piece of his country, when Scanderbeg understood of this, he immagined
forthewt the determynation of the two Captains to have been togather him in the
myddest betwyne them both, he instructed his army, and encoraged them
greatly, not to doubt xvi. thousand Turcks, consydering that they had in short
space before, overthrown xxiiii. M. whereupon he marched toward the lesser
Tirana where Iagup with his army lay, Scanderbeg as soon as he drew something
near his enemy stayed and chose five hundred horsemen to go and provoke the
enemy to the feelde. As soon as Iagup saw this, he ranged his army in
thresquadrones, and with certain disbanded horsemen charged them, and put them
to flyghte following the chase with those disbanded horsemen, marchinge after them
with his whole power, and when they came where Scanderbeg was he cried unto
them to turn, whereupon immediately they charged the Turckes, and Scanderbeg
with his army in order came on and joined with them, Nota.
and in short time put them to flyghte, by means that he saw where Iagup was
in person, whereupon he chose unto him certain assured soldiers and severed
them selves and charged the squadrone wherein Iagup was, Iaguppe slain and his
army defeicted.
and so of force entered it and with his lance smote him under the chyn through
the throat and flewe him, wherewith the Turckes being amassed and discoraged
stood like unto sheep without a shepherde: and were flayne miserably, and
main of them were taken prisoners, so, that acomptinge first those of
Balaban, and secondaryly these of the Bassa Iagup, there were xxiiii. M.
slain, besides vi. thousand that they herd no news of at all. After this
Scanderbeg caused to gather together all the gold, silver, and other riches,
which the Turckes had gotten in his country and carried al into Croia in great
triumph making great feasts to the contentacion of all that there were, and
he sent messagers to sondrie princes and others his fryndes that dwelled near
about him, with the news of this great victory, and sent them also presents
of the Turckyshe spoil, as horses, coursiers, slaves, Armor furniture of
horses, rich garments of men, and such like.

When the great Turcke understood the dolorouse defeicte of these two armies,
he determined to go in person with all his power against Scanderbeg but he
having intelligence hereof, made provision for y^ defense of his country, and
especially furnished Croia with men and all kind of necessaries, his
soldiers on foot were of the garnisons of the Senate of Venise, their
governor was a worthy man named Baldisera Perduci. In those days there was in
that part of Albania which was subject to the Seigniorie of Venise, their
Proueditour a Venetian borne, named Iosaphat Barbaro, a man of great worthynes,
who by commandment of the Senate, did often times attend upon Scanderbeg,
and the Arche Byshope Paulo, who for the great zeal that he had toward the
Christian religion, was in those days contynually with Scanderbeg, onles that
he were sent in his name or in the name of the Seigniorie of Venise in
ambassade to any Potentate for the preservation of there countres, as often
times he went to Rome, Milane Naples, Venis, and other places.

In this mean time there came from Constantinople to Scanderbeg two Turckes,
saying that they were comme thither to becomme Christianes, and to serve him
faithefully, and also to save their souls, being assured that the faith in
Jesus Christ, was the only true and holsom faith, and in the contrary, the
faith Mahometane to be false, unjust, and dampnable, as was evidently seen,
by the great things that god did daily work by one only man, which in
comparaison of the Turcke was a very lamb, and yet did contynually triumph
over a most fearce and cruel Lion. Then Scanderbeg received them courtesly and
gave them large provision for their maintenance, causing them to be instructed
in the Christian religion, even as they had been of his own nation:
notwithstanding, this coming of there is was to a deuelishe end, which by y^
goodness of god was discovered, who never fails such as unfeignedly trust in
him, for on a time these two Turckes fell at words and in fine struck together
with their fistes in sort that they lost much blood from out of their
noses, and the one saying to the other in great fury, you traitor dog sent
by the great Turcke to sley the most gentle and good prince Scanderbeg, when
the Captains of Scanderbeg understood this, they took these two forthwith, and
presented them to Scanderbeg, who caused them immediately to be tormented and
then they confessed the whole matter in every point, and showed the dagguers
which they carried secretly about them for y^ purpose, declaring also how that
y^ Turcke had promised them an infinite sum of money, and also to make them
great lords, if that they could sley Scan. he then being a prince of great
magnanimity and one that did honor y^ Turcke would not for his sake use them
acording to their deserts, but caused them to be brought out of his
Padiglion, and so apparelled as they were, caused them to be hanged upon the
heighte of two great trees, where they moughte be well discerned from all
parts of the feeldes about it, when he had thus done he took his horse, and
with all those soldiers that then were with him and in all the country near
unto him, entered into y^ part of the Turckes country where he never was
before, and when he had spoiled all the country, he then raised fire and burned
all the country where he passed through, and returned home safe with all his
people in to his country.

After this the aforenamed Mahomethe, came into Albania with two hundred
thousand men on horse and foot, and encamped before the City of Croia,
promising them of the town great gifts, if that they would render the town
unto him upon composition, and otherwise he threatened to put them all to the
sword, but their answer was, with the fair Ca^uonade, harquebuzade, and
such like, in sort, that they slew many of the Turckes, and continued the
same daily, until the Turckes dislodged from thence and abandoned the seege.
Whiles the Turcks lay before Croia, Sca^derbeg was always attendante upon
their camp, now in one quarter, and then in an other, destressing their
foragers, and also their victuallers coming to their camp, and often times in
the night assailed their camp, now in one quarter, and then in an other so,
y^ he made great slaughter of them. Then at the last the Turcke saying Croia
to be in expungnable, and having received there both great loss of his
people, and also great dishonor, he determined to leave before it a camp
volant, and so in y^ end by famine to take it, whereupon he left the
aforesaid Balaban to execute that enterprise with xviii.M. chosen horsemen and
five thousand fotemen of the best in all the army, with viii. Sangiacchi, men
of great experience, and Judgment in wars, to the end the better to advise.
This done, the great Tiran departed from thence, retorning toward
Constantinople, and in his journey be took certain fortes of Scanderbeg, and
put his garnisons into them, with officers to keep them in his obedience,
beside this, by means of a wicked Traitor he took a place called Chidua,
wherein were viii. M. of Scanderbeg soldiers, beside women and children, and
others y^ were not able to use arms, to whom by means of this traitor he
made great promises, but being once within, he brake his faith, and caused
them all to be cut in pieces, which was greatly to the hindrance of Scanderbeg,
not withstanding, within short time he recovered al again and cut in pieces as
many Turcks as he found in those places, which the Turcke had thus taken from
him, the Turcke returned to Constantinople very sorowfully and Melancholyque
for the great spoil, and loss of his soldiers, which he had sustained in
that journey.

Scanderbeg, consydering the Turckes that besegid Croia were valiante and of
great experience, and had so fortyfied them selves that it was an
impossybilitie to assault them, for that they had alredie taken y^ hill Crniuo
by means whereof, it was expedient to have a great army to take in hand that
enterprise to raise them from that place, Scanderbeg having lost the aforesaid
eight thousand men in Chidua, was enforced to demand aid of other Christian
princes, whereupon he went to Rome in person and declared his cause before the
pope Pio the second and his Cardinales and other prelates in their Concistorie
and was gently herd and great promises were made unto him, notwithstanding (at
his departure) by means of evil tongues, he received small succor at the
popes hand who was a Venetian borne, but not over full of devotion, and for
that that Scanderbeg was greatly esteemed of sondrie of them, it is no marvel
if others did envy him, by means whereof he obtained no more for his travail
then. 3000. Ducates only, the which Iunetrio being one of the chief Citizens
of Driuasto, cosyn to the Arche Byshope Paulo Angelo, and Steward to Scanderbeg
received, Scanderbeg was excedingly troubled with this, notwithstanding he
gave thanckes to God and returned safely into his country. Then he went first
to Scutari where he found Iosafat Barbaro aforesaid, lieutenante to the
Venetianes, who levied bands of those that were subjects to the Seigneours of
Venise and joined them with his soldiers, and provided them of al kind of
necessaries, there went with him also to aid him, Leche Ducagino, with his
brother Nicholas, with four hundred horsemen and as many fotemen, chosen
soldiers and of great experience in wars, with an hundred men at arms also
well armed and mounted, he had also five hundred fotemen of Italy, Venetianes
borne of the garnison of Scutarie with a thousand Lances and.3. thousand
foteme^ of the countres about Scutari, Driuasto, Antiuaro, Alessia, and
Dirachio, which made an army of.13. thousand and.4. hundred chosen men, with
whom Scanderbeg marched toward Croia, and when he came near y^ town, he spoke
in this sort. My lords, and you my good soldiers: although often times
good words do comfort weried and troubled minds, yet I will at this present
as well encorage you by my deeds as by my words, for that I do know you to
be of noble minds, and desirous to put our enemy to the flighte, wherefore my
trust is in god, that if the Turckes which do besege my City, were as many
more in number as they are, we shall undoubtedly overthrow them and put them to
the sword.

When he had thus said, he divided his army into two parts, Vaiuoda lyeu:
enant to a prince in field or town.
committing the one to Nicolo Moneta Vaiuoda of Scutari, and sent him over
through a plain and certain woods to a certain strong place called
Gionenemi, not far from that place where the Turckes lay in camp before
Croia: he commanded the aforesaid Nicolo not to depart from thence in any
wise until that he herd him shote of certain Cannones, which he did acording
to his promise. In this mean time Scanderbeg went with the rest of his army
and upon the sudden took the heighte of the mou^te Canino in dispite of the
enemies, and determined to council with the aforesaid Nicolo, of what sort
to proceed, Balaban having intelligence of the coming of Scanderbeg, went
forthwith to Croia, requiringe them to yield the town upon Conditiones, making
them of the town great promesses in the behalf of his Master, persuading
him self, that hy these means he should obtain victory, acording to the
intelligence that was given him, whereupon he had exhorted his army to be of
good chere, declaring to them that if they moughte have the town delivered
unto them, that then he would with his army lodge in the town, and would not
care for the coming of Scanderbeg if that he should happen to comme, but if
that it so chansed y^ they did not obtain it, he would leuye his camp and
depart thence, whiles Balaban looked for answer there sorted forth of the
town certain soldiers to scarmoche with his people. Then he being exceeding
wroth, and out of al hope of recovery of the town, with his soldiers that
were then with him, gallopped toward them to give a charge on them but the
Christianes perceauing it, drew near y^ town under the defense of the
shot, Balaban slain before Croia with the shote of a Harquebuze.
whereupon George Alesy an Albanese, discharged his harquebuze, and struck
Balaban under the chin into the throat, and gave him his deaths woonde, not
withstanding this great blow Balaban fell not but put spurs to his horse and
gallopte to his tente when the Turckes understood of this, and also that the
mount Crina was alredie taken, they abandoned the seege, and being greatly
affraied conueid them selves spedylye in to the feelde named Tiranna.

Then Scanderbeg fynding no man to resyste him went down into Croia, and
caused to bring into the town all the meal, barley, and other victuales that
were left in the Turckes camp, which were sufficient to sustain them of the
Town for one whole year, when he had this done, he lodged in the City and
sent certain bands to take the passages and straites, through the which the
Turckes must pass, for he determined to seek them and to give them battle.
That same very evening came two Turckes of acompte to Scanderbeg desyring him,
in the name of their whole army to give them their lives, and that they would
with one consent give him willingly all that they had and excused them saying,
that they were enforced to comme to that seege by the commandment of their
prince, whose bread they did eat, so that with great humiletie they desired
Scanderbeg to grant them that, which he never denied to their fathers, when
Scanderbeg had herd y^ request of the Turckes, he commanded them with a
fryndly contenaunce to be well lodged in a fair pauillion, and to be honorably
entertained. After this, the aforesaid Scanderbeg called to him the aforesaid
lieutenante with the noble lords Ducagini, and other lieutenantes, me^ of great
virtue, unto whom he declared the request of y^ Turckyshh army, requiring
their advise and answer Iosaphat Barbaro (which the Venetianes had sent into
Albania to be contynually in company with Scanderbeg) spoke first and said
that he would do nothing but what should please Scanderbeg to commau^de him
wherefore he would do as it should seem good to Scanderbeg in this matter.
After this spoke Leche Ducagino very franckly saying, Embetha, which in our
tongue signifies, upon them, for that he thought it not requisite to use mercy
toward infydels, but to cut them in pieces of the same opinion were diverse
other noble men, and Captains of great value. Then Scanderbrg spoke unto them
saying, you noble men, and you worthy Captains, I trust in the lord, and am
well assured, that if we shall happen to encountie the Turckes, we shall sone
defeicte them. Notwithstanding, for that they are ye choice of all the
Turckyshe army, and now becomme desperate, and determined in deed to emploie
their hands and for that also that the end of wars is doubtefull, and that
god for our offenses should permit them to have the victory, as it may
well comme to pass. It should be the ruin of us all. Ripe judgment.
Wherefore to play suer it seems to me reasonable that we respect the
attempt until such time as Croia be supplied with victualles and other
necessaries for many years: and then to go on to encountre them with
assurance of mind, and to overthrow them for so much as they can escape in
no wise for that the passages are alredie taken. The opinion of Scanderbeg was
well lyked of many, and of others not lyked at all, and chiefly of such as
were subjects to the Venetianes, who desired ernestly to be revenged of the
Turckes, and of some others which had not experimented the force of y^ Turckes
very often. Then Scanderbeg called for the two Turckes aforesaid, and wylled
them to declare unto the whole army, that as they came not with his license to
besege his City, no more should they depart out of his country with his
license. In this mean time be sent his army to y^ River Isimi where he had a
great number of ships loded with corn meal, biskete and other victuales, and
caused all to be vnloded with speed, so that in three days he furnished Croia
for sire years. And then went with all speed to encountre the Turcks, but he
had tarried a long, for they in these three days saying them selves so assailed
with famyne, went to the passages, and passed of force, not with out great
slaughter and spoil of their me^, and in this sort fled. Then every man in
manner was sorry, and murmored against Scanderbeg, and laid the whole fault of
their escape upon him, but he with his great cortesye, and gentle words
pacifyed and contentyd them all, lainge for his excuse the old proverb, that
to the enemy that flees a man must make a bridge of gold, and then gave to
every man presents and gifts, acording to his place. In this mean time many
Albaneses of the Venetians country, and of the countres of other princes came
and presented to Scanderbeg a great number of the heddes of Turckes, with
horses, armor, and other spoil, in the end Scanderbeg very honorably,
licensed his army. Saving only his two thousand horsemen, and one thousand
fotemen with whom he went forthewyth to his confynes.

When Mahomethe the Turckyshe prince, understood that Scanderbeg had raised the
seege of Croia, with so much honor, to his great shame, and loss of his people,
he was much gryued there with, whereupon the year following he returned into
Albania with two hundred thousand Turckes, and went to besege Durazzo, Mahomethe
again in Albania
a noble City and of great antiquity, which had been a garnison town of the
renomed Romans, he did greatly molest it notwithstanding he departed from
thence without it, with spoil of his people and great dishonor, from thence
he went with speed to Cro^a, and beseged it round, and sent his messager to
signify to them of the town, y^ if they would deliver him the City, he would
advance them, and deal liberally with them all, and otherwise it should be
to their pain, for he was determined not to depart thence without it, and
would be revenged up on them to the uttermost. The answer of the beseged was
not far to seek, but was given by the mouth of the Cannon, Colueryne,
harquebuze, and such like instruments. Scanderbeg, on the other side did
often times assail the Turckyshe army, now in one quarter and, then in an
other, making great spoil of them, holding them in continual fear and
doubt, when the Turcke saw that he could by no means obtain the town, he
departed with all his army thence, and marched to a place called capodelli
Rodane, near unto the Admatique sea where Scanderbeg had builded a City named
Chinril, which was not fully fynyshed nor replenished with inhabitanes, he took
it and raised it to the very foundation, after this he passed through the
country of Scanderbeg, thincking to take it from him but he could not take the
symplest forte that he had, he went also into certain mountains of Albania,
where there were multitudes of Albaneses, with their whole familes and
substances, and assailed them, but he was repulsed with great dishonor, spoil,
and slaughter of his people: but Scanderbeg who was ever vigillante, and
followed the Turckyshe army day and night, making great spoil of them, in
such sort that Mahomethe being in manner out of al hope was constrained to
return to Constantinople by the shortest way.

When the Turcke was comme to Constantinople be appointed Alibeg and Alesbeg his
Captains to have the conducte of xxviii. thousand men, and sent them to his
confynes with expressyd commandment that in no wise they should go to fight
with Scanderbeg, nor to enter his country unless that he first began, but
only to guard well his confynes. These Captains came to the frontiers and
obeyed the commandment of their lord, and secretly sought to have
fryndshippe with Scanderbeg, and sent unto him presents of great price and
value, he also used them very cortesly and fryndly, not in that that he feared
them, but because he would not be counted ingrate: for he never trusted them,
but stood always upon his guard. In the end Scanderbeg understanding
certaynely, that these Captains had expressed commandment from their lord
not to make any attempt against him, but only to guard his confynes, and
also how that they were desirous to be in peace with him, he left the one
part of his soldiers upon his confynes, and took the rest with him and went
to visyte his country, and to administer Justice and reason to such as had need
thereof, and to se that none were oppressed. After this, Scanderbeg came to
Alessio about certain affares that touched both his state, and the state of
the Senate of Venise, and chiefly for order how to take a certain new City
called Valma, which the Turcke had builded and there fell sick of a feruant
fever, in such sort, as he was enforced to lie long in that place, and seeing
his death at hand, he called unto him all his Captains, and had a long
discourse with them, who shed not a few tears to see him in that case, and in
the end he called unto him John his only son, and in the presence of his
mother the lady Doneca and of y^ rest, spoke unto him in this sort.

My good son know thou, that I find my self so evil disposed in my body,
that I am assured y^ the time of my departure out of this world is at hand,
which thing seeing it is by the providence of God, his will be done: but for
that thou art very young, and not able to defend our state: for that our
enemy is of exceeding great power, I have determined to leave it in the
protection of the Senate of Venise, as my dear brother, and good father, Paulo
Angelo the Arche Byshope, our hope (whom I leave in my stead of the
governance thereof) has often times persuaded me. And further I do command
the my son, that thou be always advised by him, for in so doing thou shalt
not do a mysse, consydering his great wisdom and experience to be such, as
I can not but hope well of the, and of the rest of my subiecttes, if that you
be governed by him, for I am assured that for my sake he wylbe as careful for
the and thine, as if thou were his own son, wherefore when thou have shut
up these mine eyes and buried me, go thou then into Apuglia to our Castles
and towns y^ we have there, and continue there until thou comme to age able
to govern, and then go to Venise, and be always advised by the Senate
thereof, who will gladly see the, and set the safely into thy state and
dominion, I commend unto the all my subjects, who^ I have always found
faithefull and obedient, use them so, that they may rather love the, then
fear the, which thou may easyly do, if thou se justice truly admynistred.

Scanderbeg had scarcely given full order for his testament, when a messager
from the governor of Scutari came, with a letter signifiyng unto him, how
that Hamathbeg one of the Turckes Basas, was comme from Seruia with x. M.
horsemen, and v. M. fote^en, and had passed a very sharp and difficulte
mountain named Illugi, which did appertain to the Venetianes, and was comme
down into their country, and had made great spoil there. Then that noble and
magnanime prince Scanderbeg, being greatly moved with these news caused to
make him ready, and appointe his soldiers to make them ready to ride: in this
mean time his desease did so increase upon him, that it troubled him in such
sort, that he was enforced to send his soldiers away to Scutari and to
tarry that day in his lodging, commanding them to do whatsoever the
lieutenante should command them, and that he would the next day be with
them to deal with Hamathbeg and his power, when his soldiers understood this
they rode on their journey sheding of tears and came to Scutari, and forthewith
by commandment of the lieutenante before said passed on over the plains
until they came to the river named Cli^o. Then a certain of the Turckes which
were on the other side of the river making guard (as soon as they saw them)
knew them to be of Scanderbegs soldiers, and maruelling at their sudden
aryuale, called unto them asking where Scanderbeg was, it was answered that he
was in Alessio, and that the morning following he would look upon them, where
upon the Turckes repared to their Captain Hamathbeg who lay in camp upon the
territory of Driuasto, and declared unto him the news that they had herd.
When Hamathbeg understood these news, he was excedingly affraied, so that he
was enforced to stand all that night in battle, and in the morning very
tymely to march away, and to pass over Mountaignes by very difficulte
passages and ways, so y^ it was the journey of all y^ day to attain to the
highte of that hill, and that same night following there fell so much snow,
driven with a vehement wind being in the monethe of January, that y^
greatest number of those poor, and fearful Turckes died in that night, and
they which were left on live the day foloing, marched away in exceeding great
fear, and looked often times behind them if that they might se Scanderbeg to
follow them, and had determined, if they had seen him comme, to fall upon their
knees, and to yield unto him, as it was declared to the Driuastianes by sondrie
Turckes which they took, and in every place where these poor Turckes passed,
they were cut in pieces, and spoiled, and miserably handled, in sort, y^ few
of them ever returned to their dwelling place.

This same very day that the Turckes thus fled not being followed by any
enemy, The death of the Christian prince Scan.
this most Christian prince Scanderbeg, left this earthly life, yeldinge his
soul to God in the year of our health. 1467. and in the year from his birthe.
63. he was buried in the Cathedral Church of Saint Nicholas, in Alessio,
with great solempnitie, and honor, for whose death the bewaylinge was so
universal, as the like was never seen in those parts of Epirro, for in all
places a man should have hard them weep betterly, of all estates, and
chiefly the nobilitis, and Captains, cried out in most piteouse wise,
saying, O Scanderbeg our good king, our defendour, our only comfort, our
father, and brother, why have you thus left us Orphans as sheep without a
pastor, how may we now any lengar escape the hands of those most cruel,
and wicked Turckes, our enemies, woe shall be unto our pore people, woe to both
great and small, woe to Albania, and to all the provinces thereof, and to all
the provinces near about it, In like sort did the princes, and people of
other countres near about it, morn, and lament, for Sca^derbeg was their
eye, and watch man, the defendour of the states of all faitheful Christianes,
and of his own, he was entirely beloved of all Christianes onles it were of y^
false Christianes disciples of Judas. Also the unreasonable creatures lamented
his death, for one of his best horses upon who^ he had done great acts, and
ben also in perillause battayles, which was a very well doing horse, and of
great travail, in battle like a Lion, of such fearcenes as it was marueled
at of all the noble men and Captains, that had seen the doings of the horse,
and out of battle he was as gentle as a lamb, this horse as fone as his
Master was dead, began forthewith to braie terribly, and to beat him self
from the one side, to the other, wtoute taking any rest day nor night, he
would never after that day suffer bridle, nor sadle to be put on him, nor
would never taste any kind of hey prouender or other sustenance, but
contynually braying and beating him self day and night till at the last
through very fayntnes, he fell down to the earth, and never rose again upon
his fete but dyed, the signification hereof I commit to the secret purpose
of God, who knowethe all things, notwithstanding I wyshe all Christians not to
cease, but contynually to give thanckes unto his divine Majesty for his great
benefits bestowed upon us, and to pray him to deliver us from the cruel and
wicked hands of the Turckes, and to give us victory against them, and all
other infydels, as he always did to his faithefull soldier Scanderbeg, which
was not unlike in victory to Judas Machabeus, Scanderbeg was much like to the
Emperor Eracleo, which by the help of God did overthrow the proud hethen
prince Cosdroe, Scanderbeg in all the before named battayles, and others whereof
there is no mention made in this treatise, was never ^hurte nor maimed at any
time, except once that he was hurt in the right leg with an arowe, but the
poor soldier which shot it, was forth with espied of him and flayne at
one only stroke, and cut in two pieces, his arms were always, covered with
armor, he was not enchaunted, as the folyshe ignorante people did affirm, for
if he had been echaunted, he could not have been hurt by the arrowe, and it is
written y^ he never fought but his arm was well armed his use was ever to
throw of his braciall, Usage of Scan.
as soon as he had put his enemies to flyghte, to the end, y^ he might the
more franckly stryke, for he bestowed never more then one blow, upon one
enemy in chase, at all other times he was very well armed, and did join with
his rare force, wisdom and experience, and would never at tempte God.

After that he was ded, the worthy Captains peiche Emanuell, Zacharia Groppa,
Leche Cucca, Paolo Manesi, with diverse other worthy men, and worthy of
credit, who had been with him in manner in all his doings did affirm how that
Scanderbeg in those battayles wherein they had accompanied him, had slain with
his own hand more then. 3. thousand me^, his order was such that his enemy
did never long stand against him but spedyly he put them to flighte, and as
touching his natural force, it was not much unlike to y^ most rare force of
Orlando, and Rynaldo, with other famous Knights of the mighty king Charles,
he gave ones a great blow in the presence of all his army, being in a great
fury for otherwise I belyue he should hardly have done it, there were taken
in battle ii. soldiers of Balabanes kynsemen, which were rebels unto
Sca^derbeg, these were presented unto him, and had done him much hurt, and
displeasure, he would not suffer y^ any other should sley them, but drew his
sword, and with one only blow he cut them both in pieces, in such sort that
they fell down ded to the earth, not without marvel and trembling, of all
those y^ beheld it. The Turcke on a time understanding by report that
Sca^derbeg had a sword: wherewith he would stryke of some time a man's arm
being well armed, and would cut in pieces a helmette or any other kind of
armor made of iron, sent unto him desyring him to give him y^ sword
Scanderbeg had more then three of that temper and goodness, and sent the Turcke
franckly one of them, the Turcke was very glade of such a present and caused
the sword to be proved by certain of his most valiante men, to se if that
they could cut iron with it, but they did not much hurt the iron with it, no
more did their strokes the sword. Then the Turcke sent to Scanderbeg that his
sword was no such sword as it was named to be, but Scanderbeg answered that
the sword was sufficiently good to do more then had been reported of him, so
that it were governed by his arm, which he kept to his own use. And for
testimony of his force I think it not inconvenient to recite certain
strokes that he gave for pleasure, to the end, that such as be of Judgment
may think what he moughte do, being well armed and kyndled against his
enemy, Scanderbeg has been seen to chase the Bear, the wild Goat, the
Wolf, the Heart, the Bore, and such like beasts of great speed: over the
playnes on horseback, and with one only blow to have stryken any of the
before named beasts ridinge, to the ground ded.

And on a time it happened the king Ferrante to hunte in Apuglia, being
acompained with many noble men acording to the use of that country, and when
any beast came forth of the woods to the plain, the king used to apointe
some noble man to sley it with his sharp Gianetton, and it happened that a
great Bore came forth to the plain, the king smyling said that that chase
belonged to his dear father Sca^derbeg, who then without saying any more, or
taking any Gianeton with him (which is a weapon appointed for that purpose)
put spurs to his horse and galloped after y^ boar in the syghte of them all,
having no armor upon him and ouergate the boar, and drew his sword and
running with one stroke cut him a sonder in the myddest and put up his sword,
and returned again to his company, where at the king, and Queen, with all
the nobylitye maruelied much, to see a man of a goodly stature, upon an high
Courser running, to do such a miracle. An other time in a wood of the lady
Mamizza, his sister, in albania their was a wild Bufallo a bull very great of
body, and he was much feared, he had done much hurt to diverse valiant men,
hunters, and others that passed that way, and chiefly to such as did were
read garments, Scanderbeg did always use to were on his head a scarlatte
cappe, after the manner of Carmannola, and on a time being in this wood at the
chase, and seeing this Bufallo coming out of the wood all they that were
with him began to flee, where at he smyled and thruste his horse toward the
Bufallo, and dealte with him with such agilitie that at one stroke he smote of
his head, whereat all men marvelled, and especially his valiante Captains, which
before fled from the beast, but in the end, they did greatly rejoice at
that strange blow, the sword that Scanderbeg struck the best with was a
Scimitar bending like unto a falchion he was a right damaskyne, he used
sometime to wear two in one scaberde, and sometime to break them both in one
battle, or else so to spoil them, y^ he might no more with his honor were
them. At the last there came an excellent Master out of Italy, who made him
three Scimitaries, not only good, but excellent, where of he gave one to the
Turcke, they would cut all kind of iron and never hurt the edges of them,
Scanderbeg did with these swords great acts against y^ enemies of the
catholic faith, in the honor and service of the almighty God, it was never
seen that Scanderbeg fled from any man, on les it were once from a soldier of
his own on whom he had compassyon. This soldier on a time (as Scanderbeg was
debating with his Captains of certain services of importance) answered so
unadvisedly, and with such insolency, that he moved him in such sort that he
laid hand on his sword and ran at him, but the soldier turned his horse
redyly and fled. Sca^derbeg followed him until that he came to a river: then the
soldier turned him and drew his sword and spoke unto him very aduysedly,
saying, that he could flee no further for the river. Great magnanimity of
Scan.
wherefore he was enforced to defend his life, when Scanderbeg understood this
who would not have lost such a man for his weighte of silver, he considered
both how reverently and manfully he behaved him self toward him, he was
moved with compassyon, and said unto him, be of good courage, doubt not, comme
on with me. I will not hurt the, and in this sort repressed his fury, and
returned to the company gyuing great commendations to this worthy man and
plased him in the number of those that he most favored.

When the Turcke understood the news of ye death of Scanderbeg, he would in no
wise belyue it but said to his visiri and chief Captains, that it was a
fynesse of his enemy, to feign him to be ded, meaning thereby to do some
strange fact, wherefore he was in great fear and stood more upon his guard
then before, and would not attempt any thing at all against Scanderbeg nor
against any other neighbor of his until one whole year was paste, but as soon as that most cruel enemy of the Christianes was assured of the death of
Scanderbeg, he was more glad then ever he was before at any time and
immediately assembled his army and sent them not only into the country of
Scanderbegs, and of the Venetianes, but also into the countres of all y^ rest
of y^ princes of Albania, not once, but often times, as to the siege of Croia,
Scutari, Driuasto, and sundry other places, making wars upon them for the
space of.xi. years without cease, notwithstanding through the help of God,
that country did always defend it self, not wtoute great spoil, and slaughter
of the Turckes aforesaid. In the end this mighty Tyran came into Albania in
person with all his power, and all the princes thereof that fled not, were other
slain, or lad away in miserable captivity, he took in manner the whole
country of Albania in a very short time, but the victorius City of Scutari
(not fearing his long seege) did always defend it self not wtoute the
slaughter and spoil of an infinite number of Turckes. In the end y^ Senate of
Venise to conclude a peace with the Turcke, were content to give him that
City, saving the lives and goods of the Citizens acording to the conditions
of the peace that was made with Tauth Bassa of Romania by means of y^
magnificient Pietro Angelo, who was sent with commissyon honorable in
ambassade, from the mighty Antonio Loredano, general of y^ Venetian Armata,
to the aforesaid Tauth with whom Ducagino was prisoner, by whose means he
obtained a safe conducte, for the Senate to send an ambassador (for the
conclusion of the aforesaid peace) to Constantinople. Then the Venetianes sent
their secretary John Dario, ambassador to y^ great Turcke, and concluded that
peace.

In this mean time all the inhabitants of Scutarie came to Venise, and were
received by the Senators, and rewarded largely for their faithefull and true
service. After this the Turckes took the City of Alessio where with all
deligence they sought for the body of Scanderbeg, and as soon as they had
found it, although in his life time they feared it, and also hated his name,
yet being ded they worshypped it: as we use to worshipe Canonizad saints, and
in the end happy was he that could get some piece of his bones, esteming it
for a holly relic, and set it in gold or silver, and hanged it about their
necks as things of great hollinesse, saying that thereby they hoped to have
alwai victory, which is a paganishe superstition. Although that for the
offenses of us Christians, which are so divided among our selves by means of
our Ambition, and gredines, god has given the Turckes many great victories
a, against us, even to this present day acording to our most just deserts
and merits.
