CERTAIN Discourses, written by Sir John Smythe, Knight: Concerning the forms
and effects of diverse sorts of weapons, and other very important matters
Military, greatly mistaken by diverse of our men of war in these days; and
chiefly, of the Mosquet, the Caliuer and the Long-bow; As also, of the great
sufficiency, excellency, and wonderful effects of Archers: With many notable
examples and other particularities, by him presented to the Nobility of this
Realm, and published for the benefit of this his native Country of England.

SIR JOHN SMYTHE his Proeme Dedicatorie, to the Nobility of the Realm of
England.
RIght Honorable and most noble Lords:
Even as the wisdom and humility of the notable men of later ages, have
given greater honor to the excellency of men in all Arts and Sciences of
former ages and greater antiquity, than to themselves; not only acknowledging
themselves to be inferiors unto them, but also, that the greatest skill and
knowledge which they have attained unto, has (in the greatest part) proceeded
from such notable men, either by hearing and observing their opinions, or by
reading of their works, or else by reading of others that have written of the
judgments and actions of such excellent men: Even so, the vanity and
ouerweening of young men, and chiefly of our Nation in this our time (I mean
within these twenty years) have so exceeded and superabounded, that they have
not been ashamed, not only to attribute unto themselves greater wisdom and
sufficiency in all Arts and Sciences, and specially in the Art Military,
than to the notable men and great Captains of former ages and greater
antiquity, but also to dishable them in respect of themselves and their
sufficiency, and all others also yet living, that are men of greater years
and antiquity, than they are, both of our own Nation, as also foreign, that
have seen and served in the well ordered wars of Emperors or Kings, in
times past; saying, (to make the same more probable) that their wars are now
grown to greater perfection, and greatly altered from the wars of times
past; under pretense whereof, they have of late sought both by public and
private persuasions and inducements, to reduce all our ancient proceedings in
matters Military, which they are utterly ignorant of, to their own errors
and disorders, procuring also (as much as they can) by their vain and
frivolous objections against our Archerie, to suppress and extinguish the
exercise and serviceable use of Long-bowes. But now, let us come to consider,
who are these of our Nation that do attribute unto themselves greater wisdom
and sufficiency in all Arts and Sciences, and especially, in the Art
Military, than to the excellent men of former times and ages, and to the
ancient experienced men yet living. Are they newly fallen from heaven with
some divine instinct and gift, to renew, reform, and teach us the Art
Military? No, no such matter, but even such as we knew children, or very young
men within these twenty years. What then? are they Noblemen themselves by
title, or descended of noble and excellent fathers, or themselves of great
sobriety, continency and worthiness of mind? No truly, for such as are
Noblemen by birth, or descended of noble fathers, or themselves worthy, do
know by good education and instruction, that experience is the mother of
Science, and therefore, will not neglect nor contemn the wisdom and
sufficiency of former ages, nor the opinions and judgments of the ancient
and experienced men of this time; but will (with humility) yield themselves to
hear and learn by their experiences. What then? are they endued with any
such rare gifts, or corporal presences, wisdoms and virtues, as I have in my
time known diverse, and do yet know some very few young Gentlemen endued
withal, that therefore we may admire, and think them to be extraordinary
and notable men? No in troth, but some young, and some now grown to be of the
middle age, all which, are but after the common sort, both in their corporal
presences, and in their wisdoms and virtues, unless (peradventure) sometimes,
when they fall into argument of some such matters, that they would seem to
have great skill of, then indeed, they show themselves to be extraordinary: for
in stead of alleging reasons and examples, according to the use of other
Nations, with quietness and courteous phrase of speech, they argue for life and
death, with hasty and furious words, as though there were no more in the
experience of men of greater years, but that which they say: which in the
opinions of all men of any judgment, that are of wise and brave Nations, is
thought more meet for the common sort of such as are chiding women, than for
men that do profess any knowledge in Arts and Sciences, and chiefly Military.
What? is the number great of these controllers of Antiquity in matters
Military, that are infected with so great an ouerweening? Certainly, no, the
number of the chief of them is very small and few, and therefore, saving for
Arithmetikes sake, not worthy to be called Number. And those that are
possessed with this ouerweening, are such as do presume of their long
experience in such wars as they have served in, all which are more addicted
to self-will, new fashions and fancies, than to any reason and experience
Military. What, have they no imitators? Yes, many, that are abused by their
persuasions: but yet they are such, as I do think may be easily persuaded
and reduced to better judgment upon sound reasons and demonstrations unto them
showed, or upon the experience of some new and well ordered wars. But now, I
pray you, in what wars of Emperors, Kings, or formed Common wealths have
these our such men of war served, and learned their great pretended skill and
sufficiency? by the which they may with the more reason and experience assume
unto themselves, to condemn the ancient orders and proceedings Military of
diverse foreign warlike Nations, as also of our most valiant and wise ancestors;
or the experience in the Art Military, of many both foreign as also of some
ancient men, yet living of our own Nation, in respect of the wars that they
have served in; and therefore, that upon their greater experience and
judgment, they should seek to reduce all our ancient proceedings and orders
Military, to their own opinions and fancies, and therewithal, to procure the
utter suppressing and extinguishing of our ancient and peculiar weapon the
Long-bowe? Certainly, all men know, that the chiefest wars that they ever
served in, where they have learned any experience, has been in the disordered
and tumultuarie wars of the Low Countries under the States, or
(peradventure) some little diverse years past, in the intestine and licentious
wars of France. Well, if it be so (without any further question) I do not
then marvel, that they do allege to set forth and beautify their own
sufficiencies, and to disable all others both ancient and modern, that have
served in the well ordered wars of Emperors or Kings, that their wars are now
grown to greater perfection, and greatly altered from the wars of times past,
in the which I do concur with them, and the rather because they verify the
old Proverb, which is, That such as were never but in Hell, do think that
there is no other Heaven. For true it is, that the civil and licentious wars
of France, and the tumultuarie and disordered wars of the Low Countries, which
have been their schools, and the chief wars that ever they saw, have
been altogether without any formed Milicia and discipline military, and
therefore far different from the well ordered wars that have bin in former
times, betwixt Emperors, Kings, and formed common wealths.

And now, because I intend in this Proeme unto your Lordships, as briefly as I
can, to show by what means our Nation has very much decayed, or rather
forgotten all our ancient orders and exercises Military, with the wonderful
evils that have in other ages, and do now (through long peace) threaten us
again to happen, as also that it has been impossible for them, or any others,
to learn any Art or Science Military in the civil wars of France, nor in
the disordered wars of the Low Countries under the States, but rather the
contrary, that is, disorder and confusion. I therefore will first make
manifest by diverse examples, by what means and accidents, the Art and Science
Military has in many Empires, Kingdoms and Common wealths, as also in this
Kingdom, come sometimes, to be utterly forgotten; and at other times, to
grow to great disorder and confusion: and so finally, that it is most
evident, that such of our Nation as have seen and served in no other wars, but
in such confused and disordered wars, as aforesaid, could no ways attain to
any such understanding in the Art and discipline military, that they may be
any ways deemed, or thought worthy to control or find fault with the
orders and proceedings of our wise and worthy ancestors, nor of the old and
ancient Noblemen, Gentlemen and Captains yet living, that have been trained up
in matters of arms, as it shall evidently appear by a few of their infinite
vnsoldiorlike proceedings and disorders, which I will set down in the end of
this Preface. I think it is evident to all men of wisdom and discretion,
that have read diverse notable Histories, with consideration and judgment, as
also that have well considered of this our age, that there are two things of
all others that are the greatest enemies to the Art and science Military, and
have been the occasion of the great decay, and oftentimes, the utter ruin of
many great Empires, Kingdoms and Common wealths: of the which, the first is
long peace, which ensuing after great wars to diverse Nations that have had
notable Milicias and exercises Military in great perfection, they by enjoying
long peace, have so much given themselves to covetousness, effeminacies and
superfluities, that they have either in a great part, or else utterly forgotten
all orders and exercises Military, in such sort, that when they have been
forced to enter into a war defensive for the defense of their Dominions
against any foreign Nation or Nations, that have had a puissant and formed
Milicia, they have been so void of the orders and exercises of war of their
forefathers, that either they have bin conquered by their enemies inuading, or
at least, have been put in hazard of the loss of their estates and dominions,
as it may very well appear by the Egyptians, who being one of the first
Nations of the world, that had the Art and science Military in great
perfection, by the which they ^^tained many victories and conquests. And
thereby finding no Nation that durst assail them, they did after by enjoying
long peace and prosperity, so give themselves to their delights, covetousness
and effeminacies, neglecting all orders and exercises Military, that being in
process of time, and in diverse ages assailed and invaded by diverse other
warlike Nations, that had the Art and Science Military, in great perfection,
and were allured thereunto, partly by the wonderful fertility of Egypt, but
chiefly, because the Egyptians were grown effeminate without any orders and
exercises Military, they came to be by them subdued and conquered, and ever
since have lived in subjection, and servitude to diverse other Nations. The
Macedonians and Grecians also, that had under that notable conqueror,
Alexander the great, and other notable Princes and Captains of those Nations,
the Art Military in great perfection, whereby they achieved many notable
victories and conquests, did after, by living in long peace, accompanied with
great dissension, covetousness and superfluities, so forget al their orders and
exercises Military, that they came to be conquered by the Romans: and of late
years by their like negligence in matters of war, were utterly subdued and
brought into servitude by the Turks. The Romans also themselves, after that
they had by their notable milicia, achieved wonderful victories and
conquests, through the peace but of a few years, did grow so to decay in
their discipline Military, that Hanniball that notable Captain of Carthage,
atchieuing diverse victories in Spain against the Romans, and marching with
his army through France, and passing the mountains of the Alps, did (before
that the Romans could renew and reduce themselves to their ancient Milicia)
invade Italy, and won diverse notable battles, and killed diverse of their
Consuls and their whole Armies, and put Rome it self in great fear to be
sacked and conquered. And if we list to consider of our own Country and
Nation in diverse ages, omitting infinite numbers of other examples of greater
antiquity, as also of later ages; we may see, that our ancestors the Saxons,
that conquered and expulsed the Britans (the auncientest inhabitants of this
Realm) by reason that they found them altogether without any orders and
exercises Military, wholly given to idleness, vitiousnes and delights, the same
Saxons after, by long peace with foreign Nations, being given to covetousness,
vice, and superfluities, as also to civil dissension amongst themselves at
home, did so confound and forget their Art and Science Military, by the which
they in former times had been conquerours, that they themselves came after to
be conquered by the Danes, and shortly after by the Normans. All which examples
of conquests, and dangers of conquering, with infinite others of great Empires,
Kingdoms and Common wealths have proceeded chiefly through the negligence of
their Princes, Rulers and Magistrates, who through long peace, and overmuch
security, did govern their subjects only by laws politic, neglecting and
contemning all orders and exercises Military. And this does most manifestly
appear by many notable Histories that do contain great actions.

The second cause which does confound and disorder all discipline and orders
Military, is, intestine and civil wars, as we may see by many examples, of
the which for breuities sake, I will only allege two; the one ancient, and the
other of this time. The first is of the Arabians, which nation, under Mahomet
that false prophet, and his successors, Halifas, conquered a great part of
Europe, Affrike and Asia, and were (so long as they had but one supreme Halifa
or Prince, to govern the Arabians and al their dominions by them conquered) so
mighty through their excellent Milicia, that no foreign Nation durst assail
them. But after, by their long living in peace and great prosperity; in the
end, through the viciousnes and insufficiency of one of their supreme Halifas,
that at that time reigned over them, fell into revolt and intestine wars
amongst themselves, striving for the supreme throne and government; in such
sort, that in few years, they did so corrupt and confound their ancient
discipline Military, and so weaken themselves by many co^fused battles,
sackings and spoils; and by dividing their great Empire into diverse parts,
under diverse Halifas, that the Turks (a new Nation, who had an excellent
Milicia) did invade their dominions, and within few years brought them into
subjection to the Turkey Empire.

Now the other example, which is of our time, is France, which kingdom
(until Jews the eleventh did serve himself with mercinaries) had a well
ordered Milicia, offensive and defensive, and that chiefly on horseback, and
yet diverse years had some relics and remnants of the same; but now in this
later time, the French Nation, having continued seven or eight and twenty
years in civil wars amongst themselves, they have so corrupted and
confounded all their ancient orders and proceedings in matters Military, that
they have at this present, no show, token, nor mention of the same, but
disorder, disobedience and confusion; which has proceeded of the like causes
that brought the Arabians and many other Nations (through intestine wars) to
corrupt and confound their Art and Science Military, as it shall more
particularly appear by that which follows. I think all men of experience and
judgment in matters of war, do know, that the first and principal thing
that is requisite to assemble and form an army, or armies, and to keep the
same in obedience with good effect, is treasure, to maintain pay and reward,
with severe execution of excellent Laws Military. Which, what Prince soever
he be that has, with sufficient Generals, and other Officers, to command and
govern, may very well have a well ordered Milicia; by reason that no
soldiers well paid, and chiefly being subjects to the Prince that they serve,
can use any excuses not to observe all laws and orders Military, of Sea or
Land, Town, Camp or Field. Besides that, upon any transgression of orders, it
is lawful for the Captains and higher Officers, to correct, reform and
punish, according to the laws and ordinances Military: from whence it comes
to pass, that even as the Citizens of a well ordered City, through the
execution of good laws, civil and criminal, by excellent governors, do live
in great order, quietness and prosperity, without any civil dissension: Even
so, an Army in the field, being well paid, provided for and governed, do
live as orderly in town, camp and field, without robbing, spoiling, or
otherwise iniuring any other, but the common enemy.

Now to maintain, and continue the same, it does behoue a King in his
kingdom, and chiefly in the body of the same to be well obeyed; that by the
quiet obedience of his subjects, he may receive all his customs, rents and
revenues, with all other subsidies and aides, that of antiquity his
progenitors have accustomed to receive; with new supplies of men and munitions
from time to time to ranforce his Army or Armies. All which, the French Kings
(through their subjects so often taking Arms, and such intestine wars so
many years) have so come to want, that they have not had any means possible
to maintain any other but a deformed and disordered Milicia; by reason that
the Nobility and Princes of the blood, upon diverse legitimate causes by them
pretended, with their friends and followers, taking Arms against them, a great
part of the reuenewe of the Crown, with all other customs, subsidies and
aides, have in diverse Cities, Towns and Provinces, come to cease, and the same
to be enjoyed by the Kings enemies armed: by means whereof the French Kings,
that have lived in the times of these intestine wars, have not had treasure
to pay their Armies, whereby to keep their men of war in any discipline;
Besides that, by those continual dissentions, they have lackt a great part of
their Nobility and subjects, to ranforce their Armies. The Nobility also, and
Princes of the blood, that have continued in Arms against their Kings
(notwithstanding their usurped reuenewe and treasure of the Crown) have been
as little, or less able to pay their men of war; so that, all the intestine
and civil wars, that have continued so many years in France, with the
slaughter and destruction of such infinite numbers of all sorts of people, have
been maintained and continued tumultuaritie, more by spoil, sedition, passion
and faction; than by any pay, order, and discipline Military.

Whereof it has come to pass, that such Armies as have served under the
French Kings, or under the Nobility, that have continued in arms against
them, (how good Officers and governors soever they had) could not have any
certain nor ordered Milicia; by reason, that through the lack of certain pay,
and no hope of reward for extraordinary deserts, it has come to pass, that
the soldiers thereby being made voluntary, have obeyed their Captains no
otherwise than has pleased themselves, altering and changing their weapons, as
also themselves out of one band into an other, and sometimes horsemen to become
footmen, and footmen to become horsemen; besides their forraging and
straggling from their Ensigns without order; as also their negligence and lack
of vigilancie in their watches, bodies of watches and sentinels, and by
disordering themselves upon every light occasion both in battallion, squadron
and troop. Captains also, have oftetimes formed, or rather deformed their
bands, both on horseback and on foot, with armors and weapons, new invented
by themselves, without controlment, different from all orders Military. The
Generals, and whole armies also, both of the one side and of the other have
very seldom, or never, according to the Art Military, lodged themselves in
any camp formed, but dispersed and scattered by bands in many Towns and
Villages with great disorder. Besides that, both Captains, Soldiers and all
other men of war, for lack of ordinary pay, have lived a great deal more
upon the spoil, and misusing of the common people, their fellow-subiects and
friends, than upon any spoil, or annoying of the enemy armed: through which
great disorders and lack of piety, contrary to all divine and humane laws, it
has come to pass, that such Officers, Captains and Soldiers that have
served any long time in such licentious and tumultuarie wars (be they subjects
or mercenaries) can very hardly after be reformed and reduced to contain
themselves, and live under any discipline Military, where Justice without
favor is executed, because they never before lived under any severity of laws
Martial; but have spent their times, and learned their chief soldiorie, in
such disordered and licentious wars, where in respect of spoil and gain, they
have accounted and holden both friends and enemies al in one reckoning and
degree. Now the civil wars of France having grown to be so disordered, and
without any discipline through their intestine dissentions (as I have before
mentioned) with many other disorders, a great deal more orderly, and
particularly set down by that brave soldier, Monsieur de la Noue in his
discourses: how far of further, then is it evident, that the tumultuarie, and
confused wars of the Low Countries have been from all order and discipline
Military, where both mercenaries and subjects, have served under subjects,
called by the title of States? which government has been popular, and
consisted of sundry heads, and of those very few Noble; but Merchants,
Citizens and Burghers; whose pay as it was many years to the English, French
and other mercenaries more by words and promises, than by any good performance:
so the services of such hirelings, were as disordred, and void of all
discipline Military; as it has most manifestly appeared by their proceedings
and actions; some part of the which, (by the help of almighty God) I will set
down, that thereby it may be apparantlie discovered, what kind of men of war
those disordred wars of the Low Countries have bred and brought forth, and
of what experience and sufficiency, they may be esteemed to be, that do with
such an ouerweening disesteeme, and condemn the great Captains of times past,
as also the old men of war of diverse Nations yet living, in respect of
themselves; saying further, that their wars of the Low Countries do far
exceed and excel the wars of times past in all perfection. And therefore, I
will set down and compare part of the opinions, proceedings and orders
Military, of the great Captains and men of war, both ancient and modern;
with the strange opinions, new kinds of Milicias (or rather Malicias, and
disorderly proceedings of our such men of war. And in all those things which
I in this Proeme will mention concerning them and their wonderful errors and
disorders Military, I will not set down any thing of mine own knowledge,
nor invented, nor devised by me, but a very few of the smallest of an infinite
number of their disorderly proceedings, contrary to all piety, and
discipline Military, which I have heard many, and many times publikelie
reported by many valiant Gentlemen of our Nation, that have detested the same;
diverse of the which are of very good houses, and not any one of them but that
has served in those wars, some of them fifteen or sixteen years past, in
the time of the Commendator major Requesenes, others of them a dozen years
past in the time of Don Iuan de Austria, and others at the Earl of Leicesters
going over, and also before. All which Gentlemen having been eye witnesses of
those wonderful disorders (which have redownded to the consumption and loss
of many thousands of young Gentlemen, Yeomen, and Yeomen sons, and others of
the most dispost and lusty sort of people of our Nation) have moved me (not
upon any hate, I protest, that I bear unto any of them in respect of my self,
but only for the great love that I bear to my Prince, Country and Nation) to
commit those things with great blame of writing, to the intent that hereafter
the same may be some kind of terror to all others to take such barbarous and
base proceedings in hand. And therefore will proceed to the matter.

First, it is very well known to all men of experience and judgment in
matters of Arms, that all such great Captains as have been Lieutenants
generals to Emperors, Kings, or formed Common wealths, or that with regiments
of their own Nation have served foreign Princes, as mercenaries (knowing that
Justice is the Prince of all order and government both in war and peace, by
the which God is honored and served, and Magistrates and Officers obeyed) have
at the first forming of their Armies or such Regiments, by great advise of
Counsel established sundry laws both Politic and Martial, with Officers
for the superintending and due execution of the same, which have been notified
to all their men of war, as also at every incamping or lodging have been
set, written or printed in certain tables in convenient places for all
soldiers and men of war to behold, to the intent that none might transgress
through ignorance: All which by some of the chief of our such mercenarie men
of war have been so utterly contemned, or by them not understood, that they
never used any such matter, but in stead of the same, have only set down a
very few written laws, altogether cunningly and artificially, tending to
terrify their soldiers from demanding of their paies due; as also from
complaining of the misusages of their Captains and higher Officers: but to
terrify them from spoiling, robbing, and taking by force from the common
country people their friends, with many other great offenses, there was no
prohibition, nor penalty of laws set down; they often terming those to be
best soldiers that could live without pay, by stealing and spoiling most;
saying further, that to form and establish many laws politic and Martial,
it was the manner of old dunsicall Captains in times past, who did not
understand their excellent discipline of this time, and that all laws of
Town, Camp and Field should be in the wisdom and discretion of the
General; which their gross and ignorant conceits, through their lack of
justice, cost the lives of a great sort of brave men; for in stead of
proceeding orderly upon laws Military established (as aforesaid) they
proceeded according to such laws as they conceived in their own simple
brains. Whereof it has come to pass, that many of honest parentage have
been condemned to death upon diverse offenses, that the transgressors themselves
have not known to be transgressions of death, and others that have committed
as great, or greater offenses, have escaped with very little or no punishment
at all.

Also, whereas in all ages and times, all Emperors, Kings, and formed Common
wealths, that have employed their Generals with Armies either in wars
offensive or defensive, have established a Counsel of men of great
sufficiency both in war and peace to assist their Generals; of the which
some of the chief Officers of the Army, by the right and due of their
Offices, were always of the same counsel, as also some others, according to
the choice and liking of such Princes; and this, to the intent that their
Generals in all important matters should consult with them: The conclusion,
and resolution of such consultations notwithstanding to remain in the
wisdom, judgment and valor of the Generals. And that likewise it has bin
always the use of all mercenarie Coronels both Almanes and Italians, that have
been hired into the services of foreign Princes upon all important occasions
to consult with their Sergeants Majors, and certain other Captains and
Officers for the well ordring and governing of their Regiments. Even so
contrariwise, some of our chief men of war that have had great charges in
the Low Country wars, have not only contemned and disdained to have any
counsel about them, or to take counsel of some of their Captains and other
Officers, but have also spoken to the blame and reproach of some notable and
very sufficient Generals of this time, because they have used in all important
matters to consult with their Counselors, saying, that they were therefore
very simple men, and that they were able to do nothing of themselves, but
only by the advice of Counsel. By the which, our such men of war have not
only showed a wonderful ouerweening, and lack of discretion in those their
vain and fond opinions; but also have in the government of their charges
(which was altogether of their own heads) showed themselves as fond and void
of all reason and order Military. Also, whereas all wise and sufficient
Generals and Coronels have always had special regard, when the Enemy has
not been near at hand; that their Sergeants Majors, Captains, and other
Officers, should oftentimes in the field reduce their bands and regiments into
diverse forms, and to teach their soldiers all orders Military, with the use
of their weapons in every degree, time and place, as also how to lodge in
their quarters orderly, and therewithal to understand the orders of watches,
bodies of watches, centinells, rounds, and counterrounds, with many other
matters Military, whereby they might be made prompt and ready to encounter
with the Enemy: so contrariwise, our such men of war in the Low Countries
did very seldom, or rather never instruct nor teach their soldiers any such
matter, whereby it has come to pass, that their old soldiers Piquers with
their piques, Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers with their weapons of fire, have
in certain trainings here in England showed and used such Matiches, as they
have given occasion to be scorned and laughed at, by such old Captains of
experience as have seen their doings.

And whereas also all men of war in times past have had special care that
all their soldiers should be fitly apparelled and armed, according to the
different weapons that all sorts of their soldiers did use, and that they
should not lack any of their weapons, nor any part or piece of their armours,
but that the same should be by them fitly and aptly worn, and from time to
time kept clean and neat: So contrariwise, some of our such men of war have
holden these matters for such trifles, that they have had so little care
thereof, that they have been contented to suffer their soldiers to go evil
weaponed, and worse armed, and many of them without any kind of armor at all,
and in their apparel all to be totterd and torn, and some of them bare
legged, or bare footed like roges: a thing never before heard off in any age,
that men of war, and chiefly the English nation, going to the aid of a
foreign Nation, and the country and people wonderful rich and plentiful in
all abundance, and their Captains themselves very gallant in apparel, and
their purses full of gold; that their soldiers should be in such poor and
miserable estate. Also, whereas it has been the use of all great Captains and
Chieftaines, upon any long march and enterprise intended, with all foresight
and providence to provide plenty of victual, and all other things necessary
for the sustenance of all their soldiers, even to the meanest and least of
account; as also of great store and plenty of powder and shot, with some
overplus of weapons of diverse sorts for all accidents and employments, with all
other things requisite: So some of our such men of war upon their occasions
of marches and enterprises, have provided plenty of victual only for
themselves and their followers, suffering their bands and regime^ts to
straggle, and spoil the people of the Country oftentimes to their own
mischief, and in the rest to take their adventures, and sometimes to starve,
or at least to be driven to great extremity of hunger. Besides that, for
powder, shot, and overplus of weapons, they have provided no more than that
which their soldiers have carried about them, which have been with great
scarcity; which does argue their small care of the health and safety of their
soldiers, and their little intention to do any great hurt to the enemy, and
therewithal a great ignorance in the Art and Science Military. And whereas
also in all well ordered Milicias, the commendation and sufficiency of all
Generals, Coronells, Captains and other Officers, has consisted in knowing
how to command, govern, and order their Armies, Regiments, bands and
companies, and to win the love of their soldiers by taking great care of
their healths and safeties, as also by all examples of virtue and worthiness,
not only by instruction, but also by action in their own persons, venturing
their lives in all actions against the enemy amongst them, and therewithal
accompting of them in sickness and health, or wounds received, as of their own
children; and that all Coronells and Captains of horsemen, according to all
discipline, have used to serve amongst their horsemen on horseback, and that
all Coronells and Captains of footmen, yea even the very Lieutenants
generals, and Kings themselves (if their Armies and forces of the field have
consisted more of footmen than of horsemen) have always used by all discipline
Military, upon the occasion of any battle, to put their horses from them,
and to serve on foot, and to venture their lives in the former ranks. Even so
contrariwise, the new discipline of some of our chief men of war of the Low
Countries has been, never to win nor procure the love of their soldiers by
any affability or favor showed unto them, nor yet by any care taking for
their healthes and safeties, and upon any accidents of sickness, or wounds
received, they have presently disesteemed them, as base and vile creatures,
never coming amongst them neither in sickness nor health, but only upon
occasion of service: and for any instruction or examples of virtue and
worthiness in the actions of their own persons to be showed amongst their
soldiers, it has not been their delight nor profession; and for them to have
imitated the great and famous Captains of al other times, both ancient and
modern, in venturing their lives amongst their soldiers (as aforesaid)
according to their Milicia, that has consisted more of footmen than of
horsemen, it has been contrary to their new discipline, which has not
permitted that they should learn any thing of any great Captains, but
only of themselves: whereof it has come to pass, that some of our such
chief men of war in the Low Countries, whose strength in the field has
consisted of far greater numbers and forces of footmen than horsemen, and
that some other ordinary Captains also, whose charges have consisted only of
footmen, have (presently upon their squadrons formed, and approach or sight of
the Enemy) mounted upon horses of swift Carrires, and either have accompanied
their footmen upon the flanks or rereward, being so well mounted, or else have
put themselves into some bands of horsemen; as though it were against their
reputation to serve on foot amongst their soldiers; or rather (as it may be
thought) that upon any hard accident they might be ready (leaving their
soldiers to the slaughter) to save themselves rather with the force of their
heels and spurs, than with any of sword, which amongst many other, has
been one special cause that there have been so great numbers of soldiers at
diverse times consumed and slain, and never any Chieftaine, nor any other of
our such men of war. Which their new discipline is such a mockery, and so
contrary to all order Military, as that such are not to be accoumpted
worthy to take the charge of men, nor yet to be reckoned amongst the number
of soldiers.

And whereas also all great Captains, Chieftaines, and men of charge have
holden for a Maxim, to preserve by all means possible the lives of their
soldiers, and not to employ and hazard them upon every light occasion, and
therewithal to esteem the preservation of the lives of a very few of their
soldiers, before the killing of great numbers of their enemies: Even so
contrariwise, the new discipline of some of our men of war in the Low
Countries, has been, to send, and employe their soldiers into many dangerous
and vain exploites and services, without any reason Military, having sure
regard to their own safeties; as though they desired and hoped to have more
gain and profit by the dead paies of their soldiers slain, than increase of
reputation by the atchieuing and prevailing in any such enterprises.

Besides that, it has been sometimes a practice by some of our such men of
war, when they have borne any hatred or malice to such as have served under
them, to devise some dangerous enterprise of purpose to employ the^ in, from
whence they might hardly escape with their lives, to the intent that they might
hit two marks at one shoot, that is, take revenge of such as they hated, and
gain the dead paies of such as were there slain; which was an infernal
invention. And this I would not have set down if I had not heard it most
constantly affirmed by some of those themselves, that have been of purpose
sent to such banquets, and have with great danger escaped out of such
enterprises. And whereas there is nothing more requisite to keep men of war
in obedience and discipline, than pay and good usage of their Chieftaines,
Coronells, Captains, and other Officers, (which has been the cause that in
all well ordered wars both ancient and modern, the Generals, Chieftaines
and Captains, have always used to procure and liberally to pay, or to see
the same paid to their soldiers, without defrauding them of any part thereof:)
so some of our such men of war have in those wars procured pay for their
soldiers; but when they have obtained and received it, they have used diverse
ways to defraude them of the same, but chiefly two, specially to be noted;
of the which the first has been, that presently upon the receipt of their pay,
(or else that they have been assured that they should receive the same) within a
day or two days after, they have presently devised some very dangerous
enterprise to employ their bands and companies in, to make proof how many in
such exploytes should leese their lives, that they might enrich themselves by
their dead p^ies; during which employments, some of our such chief men of
war that devised the same, remained in great towns feasting, banqueting,
and carowsing with their dames. And their second policy and practice has
been, that they have plainly kept and converted (or rather perverted) a great
part thereof to their own uses, lodging their soldiers dispersed and straggling
in Villages, and in stead of pay have suffered them to go alla picoree, that
was, to rob and spoil the Boores their friends: whereupon it came to pass,
that the Boores fearing such mercenaries more than their enemies, did arm
themselves, and stood upon their gardes, in such sort, that at times it cost
the lives of a great number of our brave Nation. And for Captains, diverse
ways to become Merchants, and chiefly in selling their bands one to an other,
as also in letting them to farm for a yearly rent unto their Lieutenants, as
if they were flocks of milch Ewes, it has been too often put in practice.
And whereas also, all Generals and Chiefetaines of all Nations of any
judgment, upon the approach of any City, Town, or place fortified, have used
to approach the same with trenches, crosse-trenches, gabions, and diverse other
ordinary and extraordinary inventions, (according unto the situation of the
ground) for the preserving, and saving of the lives of their Soldiers, and
that they have not offered to give any assault, until by the battery and
effect of great Ordinance, planted upon (...) Caueleeres (by us called
Mounts) or by battery from the counterscarfe cut, and opened, the flankers of
the bulwarks, platformes, and reuelins have been taken away, and the
Artillery of the inward Mounts dismounted, and a sufficient breach in the
Curtine made assaultable, with the dry or wet ditches filled to take away the
effects of Casamates, as also to make the entrance of the Soldiers into the
ditches and breach more easy, and with less danger; and otherwise with great
order of their Armies of horsemen and footmen reduced into (...) Squadrons and
other forms, for the guard of their Camps and Field: So contrariwise, our
such men of war (being ignorant of all discipline Military) have been so
prodigal of the lives of their Soldiers, that they have diverse times sent
them (as it were to the butchery) to give assault to certain skonces, and
other such fortifications, without any such order of approach, or taking away
any flankers, or making any breach.

Besides that, in this later time (I mean within these very few years) most
grosely and ignorantly in the time of Winter, with some thousands of our brave
English people, they lay shooting off gunnes diverse weeks against some great
Town well fortified, with a broad and a large river nauigable being betwixt
them, without any other ways besieging of it, their Camp lying in a wet
moorish ground, where their soldiors in their watches and sentinels stood to
the mid legs in dyrt and mire, with frost, snow, rain and mysts, and small
store of victual, and at their dislodging from thence, did dislodge straggling
by bands, without any chiefetaine to direct and govern them. All which
disorders cost the lives of some thousands of our gallant English Nation, the
dead pays of the which so great numbers of soldiers so fondly and wilfully
cast away, did redound greatly to the enriching of some of our such men of
war. And now in the same later time, when all things should by all reason
have been reduced unto order and discipline, because the nature of the war
was altered from mercenary and voluntary, to princely authority; I mean the
Summer before the Earl of Leicester went over, our such men of war that had
served diverse years before in those parts devised a new invention, never
heard nor read of before amongst any men of war, but only upon some great
lackes and extremities, and that was, that their Soldiors, in stead of pay
with money, should be paid in Prouand, which was bread and cheese, and other
such victual of the best cheap and basest sort, and that taxed by measure;
saying, that it was not convenient that their Soldiers should receive their
own pays, because they knew not how to lay out their money, but that they
would spend it idly; which simplicity and ignorance, if it had been in them
(as it was not) they, and their officers, by good instruction should have
reformed the same. But such covetous men of war, under that pretense (as
though their Soldiers had been either natural fools or children) did
contrary to all Military order put the greatest part of their Soldiers pay
into their own purses, allowing them great scarcity of Prouand. By which means
it came to pass, that diverse thousands of their Soldiers in those plentiful
Countries, partly by hunger, and partly by evil lodging, and altogether by the
small care and misuse of our such men of war did perish. Besides that, great
numbers of such their sick and starued Soldiers, by the order of the Earl of
Leicester, were in those parts embarked, and transported into Essex, Kent, and
other parts of England, to recover health, of which foresaid great numbers of
miserable and pitiful ghosts, or rather shadows of men, the Essex and Kentish
carts and carters (that carried them) can testify; of which, scarce the
fortieth man escaped with life. Also, when any of their Soldiors, through the
naughtines, or scarcity of their victual, or by their evil lodging, or by
the pestering, or lying of two or three hundred of them together in some one
Church, and so in diverse Churches, upon the bare pauements, or upon diverse
other disorders, and misusages of some of our such men of war, fell sick; our
such men of war presently did casse, and discharge them out of their bands
for dead men, turning their Prouand money with all ouerplusses into their own
purses, procuring new supplies of well apparelled, and lusty young men out of
England, to the intent to serve their own turns, and to consume people after
people. All which marvelous disorders of some of our such men of war against
their Soldiers, contrary to all discipline Military, by them practiced and
used, with infinite others (which to rehearse would make a huge volume) were the
occasion that many thousands of the lustiest and dispost sort of our English
people, were in those wars (as it were) wittingly and willingly cast away;
besides great numbers, that at diverse times did choose rather to fly to the
enemy than to serve under such cruel and disordered chiefetaines; And these
wonderful disorders, with innumerable others did continue and increase until
such time as diverse young Noblemen lately coming to take principal charges in
those wars, as also diverse knights and Gentlemen of Noble and of Worshipful
houses, and themselves of great valor and woorthines did complain of, and
discover those most strange and wonderful abuses, unto the Queen, and to her
Counsel; who understanding thereof, did very nobly reform and redress diverse
of those disorders, taking further order, that the aforesaid new devised
Prouand should be abolished, and that in stead thereof, the Soldiers should
receive their own pays in money; which, with the wise and worthy proceedings
and courses of the aforesaid Noblemen, Knights and Gentlemen, that began with
great order and Discipline, to serve in those wars, some at, and others
since, the going over of the Earl of Leicester, has of late greatly prevailed
and redounded to the reformation of diverse of those strange inventions, and
abuses, invented and brought into those wars by the aforesaid new fantasied
men of war.

But now, for excuse used by some of our such men of war, for the casting away
and loss of such great numbers, and many thousands of our gallant English
people in those Low country wars, as also in later wars, (I mean not in
France, where I never heard any blame, but great honor imputed to the
Chiefetaine, and commendation to the Captains; but in a very short war of a
great deal further distance, but of a wonderful consumption of our brave
Nation, through great disorder, and lack of discipline Military: the
particularities whereof, because I have not hitherto handled, I omit) some of
our such men of war have not been ashamed, many times to report and say,
that all those brave people that have been consumed and lost in the Low
Countries, and those other forementioned wars, by their disorders (as
aforesaid) were the very scomme, thieves, and roges of England, and therefore
have been very well lost, and that the Realm (being too full of people) is
very well rid of them, and that if they had not been consumed in those
wars, they would have died under a hedge, with diverse other such brutish and
infernal speeches, even like unto themselves, and to the new discipline by
them invented and practiced, rather to dispeople a kingdom of England of the
youth and flower thereof, than any ways to do any hurt unto the enemy.
Whereas contrariwise it is very welknowen unto all the Justices of peace in all
shires of England, from whence those Soldiers did go voluntary, or otherwise,
even from the beginning of the first voluntary wars, until this day,
(saving such as were levied in the City of London by commission, and some few
roges in one year levied in other shires) that they were in a very great part
young Gentlemen, and in a far greater part of Yeomen and Yeomens sons, and
the rest of the brauest sort of Artificers, and other lusty young men, desirous
of a gallantnes of mind, to adventure themselves, and see the wars, many
thousands of the which (being the very flower of England) did far exceed,
and excel our such men of war both in goodlines of personage and worthiness
of mind; and these were no roges, nor thieves, nor the scomme of England, as
those our such men of war do ofttimes report: for it is very well known in
all shires by experience, that such malefactors and base minded people, never
had any desire, nor will to go into any wars and actions Military, but have
hidden and absented themselves away during the times of musters and leuies, and
when the same have been past, they have again followed their vile occupations
of robbing, pilfering and stealing. Besides that, it is most manifest, that
before some of our such men of war took those voluntary wars in hand,
there were very few thieves and roges in England, in comparison that there are
now, that have come out of their discipline; for it is certain, that this new
deformed Milicia and evil government of our such men of war, by suffering
their soldiers for lack of pay in those wars to go a robbing and spoiling
the country people their friends (as aforesaid) has brought many of them from
good to evil, and made most of those that have returned into England impudent
roges and thieves, that were true men before they went over. By which their
merueilous disordered, and deformed discipline, it is come to pass that many,
and many thousands of the brauest and lustiest sort of people able to wear
arms, and to serve in any wars either offensive or defensive, are (as
aforesaid) consumed in those wars, and the number of exercised and expert
soldiers, meet upon any occasion to serve the Prince and Realm, by those
services no ways increased; by reason that all such as have come out of those
services (unless it be the Captains, and a few Officers of bands) are almost
all turned from miserable soldiers that they were in those Low Countries, to
most impudent roges and thieves, that by no order, nor policy can be reformed
and reduced to any honest course of life, all which has come to pass through
the extreme evil government of some of our such men of war (as aforesaid.)
And whereas they talk and boast so much of their new discipline Military, and
of their own sufficiencies, and that they do exceed and excel all the
ancient men of war of times past, as also such as are yet living: Certainly,
all men that list may behold their new Milicia of their own forming, as
aforesaid, of thieves and roges that do swarm in all the high ways, and
gaoles of England. Which does make manifest the great insufficiencies of such
as have been Authors, actors and performers of that infernal discipline: some
of the which also have not contented themselves to work the aforesaid great
evils to their Country and Nation (before declared) but have of late years,
since they came out of those Low Country wars sought to bring to pass two
other such notorious and deformed effects amongst the English Nation, as may
in time to come, be the utter ruin of this most noble kingdom and people;
even as the like has been of diverse other great Monarchies: of the which two
effects, the one has been to celebrate; the other to abolish and extinguish.
That to celebrate, has been to the feasts of Bacchus, with carowsing and
drunkenness. Which most foul and detestable vice, is enemy to all Discipline
and Exercises Military, and to be short, to all virtues and excellencies both
of body and soul, and in the rest is the very mother and nurse of
effeminacie, of cowardice, of sensuality, of rebellion, of covetousness, and
all other vices that can be imagined; as we may evidently see by our next
neighbors the Flemings, and Dutch, whose vices and imperfections (saving only
their policy to grow rich, and gather goods) for breuities sake I ouerpasse.
And this foreign vice has been brought out of those Low Countries by some of
our such men of war within these very few years, whereof it is come to
pass, that nowadayes there are very few feasts, where our said men of war
are present, but that they do inuit, and procure all the company, of what
calling soever they be, to carowsing and quaffing; and because they will not be
denied their challenges, they will with many new conges, ceremonies and
reuerences, drink to the health and prosperity of Princes; to the health of
Counselors, and unto the health of their greatest friends both at home and
abroad; in which exercise they never cease till they be dead drunk, or as the
Flemings say, Doot dronken. Which their quaffings, and carowsings, with all
their ceremonies, is no other but a blaspheming and offending of God in the
highest degree, a touching of the honor of the Princes, unto whose healths
they carowse, and a very offering of sacrifice unto Satanas, or rather to
Beelzebub himself the Prince of feendes. Certainly, a wonderful pitiful
case, that any of our such men of war or nation under the pretense of
souldiorie, and warlike Discipline, should nowadayes in stead of praying to
God, for the health of Princes, which has been always very commendably used
amongst all good subjects, Christians, drink and carowse drunk to the health,
and prosperity of Kings, Kingdoms, and States; And that men that have been
created by God to his own similitude and likeness, should contrary to his
glory, by such filthy disorder make themselves far inferior to most brute
beasts. And this aforesaid detestable vice has within these six or seven
years taken wonderful root amongst our English Nation, that in times past
was wont to be of all other Nations of Christendom one of the soberest; And
this is one of the fruits and merchandise of their discipline that our such men
of war have brought in amongst us.

Now, the other effect that they have sought most blindlie and maliciously to
bring to pass, to the great danger that upon diverse accidents may hereafter
happen to the Crown and Realm of England and English Nation, has been, and
is to seek to abolish and extinguish the notable exercise and use of our
Long-bowes and Archerie; by which weapons our ancestors, with many miraculous
victories, have made our Nation famous both in Europe, Afric and Asia, so
that in stead of Archerie, which is the soberest exercise of all others to
avoid drunkenness and other evils, and a most manly exercise and wholesome
for the health of the body, and to increase strength; and for battles and
victories of far greater effect, than any other weapon that ever was or shall
be invented; our such men of war under pretense of the excellency of the
weapons of fire by them misreported, would bring in carowsing and drunkenness:
which two things, I mean of the neglecting and suppressing of the use and
exercise of Bows and Archerie, and bringing in of superfluities and
drunkenness, has been the ruin of many great Empires, Kingdoms and
Commonwealthes, as it is apparent by the testimony of many notable histories.
As for example, the Egyptians (before mentioned in this Proeme) under their
most valiant and mighty King Sesosis or Sesostris, and other their notable
Princes, did conquer a great part of Asia, Europe and Afric by their notable
Milicia, which did consist most of Archerie and Bows: but after, through long
peace, and the negligence of some of their effeminate Kings, the same warlike
Nation did grow to such drunkenness and gluttony, that thereby forgetting the
use and exercise of their Bows, they were conquered and subdued Alexander the
great, the greatest part of whose Army did consist of Archerie, and after that
many times subdued and kept in servitude by the Milicia and force of Archerie
of diverse other sober Nations. The Empire of Constantinople, and Rome also at
such time as they were under one Empire, and that the Emperors held their
imperial seat in Constantinople, as careful as some of those Emperors were
to keep their subjects the Grecians in exercise of Arms, and chiefly of
Archerie, yet after in the time of other Emperors that were careless and
effeminate, their subjects giving themselves, through long peace, unto feasting
and drunkenness, and neglecting the exercize of Bows and Archerie, did so
forget the use of that most excellent weapon, that they were many times
vanquished by the Milicia of the Arabians, that consisted most of all of
Bowemen: which conquering Nation at that time gave themselves to labor and
travel, and to the exercise of their bows, with great sobriety, and not to
drunkenness. And the subjects of the very same Empire of Constantinople long
after the time of their great overthrows by the Arabians, through the
negligence of some of their effeminate Emperors, as aforesaid, were by the
constraint of certain imperial statutes and ordinances of some other wise and
valiant Emperors, reduced in a great, part from their drunkenness to sobriety,
and from idleness to their ancient exercize of Archerie, by the which they did
defend themselves against the Turks and Sarazins (during the time of those
worthy Emperors) very valiantly; but after again in process of time,
through the effeminacie and negligence of other Emperors of no valor nor
worthiness, the said Grecians did return again to their former drunkenness,
superfluities, and utter forgetting of the use, and exercize of their bows and
Archerie. Whereby it came to pass, that Mahomet the second of that name of the
house of Otoman, with his notable Milicia of Turks and Ianissaries, that
consisted most of Bowemen (a Nation no ways given to drunkenness) did utterly
subdue and conquer that Empire. Besides which examples, I could (if it were
not too long) allege many others of many kingdoms, and mighty Nations, that
through the detestable vices of drunkenness, covetousness and superfluities, have
given themselves to effeminacie; and forgetting of all use of their Bows and
Archerie, and other exercises Military: by means whereof they have been after
conquered, and brought into servitude by other sober and valiant Nations, that
have had the use of the Bow in great perfection. And to be brief, there is no
man that has read many notable histories of great antiquity, as also of later
ages with observation, but he shall most manifestly see, that drunkenness,
covetousness and superfluities, have caused the forgetting and contempt of the
use of Archerie, and all other exercises Military, which has been the ruin
of most of all the Empires, Kingdoms and Nations that have been known, or
written of in Europe, Afric, or Asia; And if any of our such men of war be
so obstinate, that they will not believe such notable Histories, let them then
resort to the Bible, which is the Book of God, and then (if they be not
possessed with some infernal spirit, that does breed in them infidelity) they
shall not only there see the great account, that King David that holy prophet
made of that weapon after the overthrow and death of King Saul, slain by the
Philistines, great effects performed with that weapon by the Jews under
Iosuah their most excellent Captain, that did depose so many Kings; with many
other particularities: by the which it may be justly gathered, that God gave
such excellent effects to that weapon, that when he diverse times promised help
to the Jews against the Gentiles, he made special mention of that weapon.
And when it pleased him to punish the Jews for their idolatry gluttony, by
the hands of the Gentiles, they received diverse overthrows, by the effect of
Bows. Besides that, King David does call Bows a mighty power, and in his
Psalms, the vessels of death. By which examples before alleged (that
drunkenness and neglecting of the exercize, and use of Bows, has bin the ruin
of many Empires and kingdoms) I think all men of consideration and judgment
may evidently see what pernicious and dangerous matters our such men of war
have by their evil and foul examples, and sinister persuasions, sought to
draw, and persuade our Nation unto. Which with their innumerable disorders
Military by them committed in the Low Countries, as also elsewhere, to the
consumption, and destruction of many and many thousands of our Nation (as is
before declared:) may, I think, evidently show how unfit and unable such men
of war are to compare themselves with the great Captains of former times, or
with the ancient men of war yet living, that have been trained up in matters of
arms in the wars of Emperors or Kings, as also how much more insufficient
they are to erect and innouate any new Discipline Military amongst us, or any
ways to suppress or find fault with the exercise, use, and effects of our
peculiar, and most victorious weapon the Long-bowe.

And now that I have in this Proeme laid open many foul and detestable
proceedings and disorders of some of our such me^ of war, practiced and put in
execution by them in the Low countries, as also some here at home, greatly to
the hurt and prejudice of our country and Nation: I think it good to notify
unto your Lordships, that I have not taken it in hand, and performed the same
any ways moved thereunto upon any private hatred or malice by me to any of them
borne. For I protest, that if they were all my very near kinsmen, the cause
being public, I would respect them no more than I have respected these; but
as for those men whosoever they be, to my remembrance, I have had very little
or no conference with any of them. Besides that, there is none of them, to my
knowledge, that ever gave unto me (in respect of mine own particular) any
occasion of offense: but the very original and principal cause that has
moved me to set down my discourses following, as also this my Proeme to your
Lordships in this form and phrase, has been the exceeding love, and
extraordinary zeal that I bear unto my Prince, Country and Nation. That
seeing and foreseeing the wonderful evils that have already, and are likely
daily, and from time to time more and more to ensue (if the same be not
speedily provided for and remedied) to no less in process of time, tha^ to
the ruin or great hazard of this most noble Monarchy; I therefore thought it
my duty, all private passion of fear, of love, of hatred and affection set
aside, to make manifest unto your Lordships those great disorders and evils
before declared; that by your being put in remembrance, and knowing of them
your Lordships (being the Nobility and Magnates of the Kingdom, and the very
eyes, ears, and of the King, and the body of the watch, and redress of the
Common wealth) may provide for, prevent, and reform the aforesaid great evils
that do threaten hereafter to ensue: al which have come to my knowledge by the
certain and assured reports of very many both wise and gallant Gentlemen of
principal houses, and others of very good sort, that have served some of them
at one time, and some of them at other times, even from the first voluntary
going over into those wars, till within these two years and a half, and
within these three years last past; all which Gentlemen have greatly detested
those aforesaid infinite disorders.

And now, because that no Chieftaine, Coronell, nor Captain, that have in
those wars governed themselves and their charges with great care, reputation
and worthiness (and therefore deserved great praise, and commendation) shall
justly think themselves any ways reproached or touched, by any thing contained
in this my Proeme or discourses following; I notify unto them that no part of
my intention nor meaning, nor any word to my knowledge in these contained, do
any ways sound to the touch or blame of any such worthy men, but altogether
to their praise and commendation: for I would be sorry to err so greatly, as
any ways to touch with blame any men of worthiness, but rather with my word,
writing and action, to increase their reputations; for if I have in respect of
the public cause touched our such men of war aforesaid, with reproach, they
themselves upon a guilty conscience, will discover who they are, by blaming and
detesting my Proeme and discourses, by the which the honor and virtue of such
men of worthiness shall shine, and flourish the more through the cleerenes of
their consciences not touched, according to the old saying, that the reproching
of vice is the honoring of virtue: for in troth, mine intention in this my
Proeme, and discourses, has been only to discover the great disorders, and
evils that some men of charge of our Nation (under pretense of a new discipline
Military by them invented in the Low Countries) did with great covetousness
practice, and exercise, to their own gain and profit in that their
disordered Milicia, neglecting and contemning all true honor, reputation and
worthiness, to the great dishonor of our Country, and Nation. That thereby all
young Gentlemen that have misspent their times in those tumultuarie, and
disordered wars without any discipline, as also all other young Gentlemen
that are desirous to follow the profession of Arms may reject, and detest
such new disordered, and detestable disciplines, and reduce themselves, and
follow the true discipline Military of all warlike and worthy Nations both
ancient and modern, which do all concur and conform in one; and that is,
that all true and universal disciplines Military do (as I have learned by
hearing the opinions of diverse great Captains, as also by reading diverse
histories) briefly consist as folweth. That be he Emperor King, or a
Lieutenant general of an Emperor, or of a King that does command and govern
an Army.

First of all, that he do make God to be loved, feared and served throughout
his whole Army: the second, that he do know how to command and govern,
with great providence, care, order and justice, and by rewarding the good, and
punishing the bad, and by keeping his whole Army in discipline to make
himself to be no less loved than feared. The third is, often to consult with
his counsel, and to know, how of himself (after the opinions of his counsel
heard) with valor to resolve and perform, and in the rest, himself to know
upon all doubtful occasions and acccidents, how to prevent, remedy and
execute, as also to direct others with great skill and dexterity. And these
are the most principal points that do belong to the General of an Army.

The sufficiency of Coronells does consist in the governing of their Regiments
with all care, valor, affection and diligence; and that they do make their
Regiments as well in particular bands, as in the whole body of the same, to
observe all orders Military in lodging, dislodging, in marching, and in
fighting, as also that they do live in great order, without straggling,
spoiling or any ways iniuring: And in the rest, that the Coronells themselves
do with all obedience.

The sufficiency of Captains, does consist in knowing how to govern and
order their bands and Companies, and to win the love of their soldiers, by
all examples of virtue and worthiness, not only by instruction, but also by
action in their own persons, accompting of their soldiers as of their own
children. And in the rest to be obedient, valiant and resolute, as also of
sufficiency to perform and execute all commandments and directions with
discretion, valor and judgment.

The duty and sufficiency of soldiers, does first and principally consist,
to be obedient to their Captains, and all other their superior Officers. The
second, that they do know how to apparel and arm themselves fitly, and to
handle and use their weapons in every time and place, and to know and observe
al orders Military. The third is, to be sober, patient, and able to endure
labors and trauells.

The sufficiency of all higher and lower Officers of Armies under the
General, is to know how to perform their Offices with all care, fidelity,
diligence and obedience.

And such a Prince or Lieutenant general of an Army, as has those
sufficiencies in him (that I have before mentioned) cannot fail to frame good
Officers of his Camp and Army, as also good and sufficient Coronells and
Captains. And such Officers, Coronells and Captains cannot fail to make good
soldiers: All which, with the serving of almighty God, tends to the orderly
proceeding and managing of a war in all affairs and actions to the end of
the same with victory.

And this that I have above set down, is a principal part of a Milicia, and
discipline Military of all warlike Nations; and the contrary is tumultuarie,
and clean opposite to all Art and Science Military. And this I have written
in the end of my Proeme for a note and remembrance, for all young Gentlemen of
our Nation, that have a desire to win honor by following of actions of
Arms. And now I proceed to my discourses.

Certain Discourses concerning the forms and effects of diverse sorts of
weapons; and other very important matters Military, greatly mistaken by
diverse of our men of war in these days; and chiefly of the Mosquet, the
Caliuer, and the Long-bowe, as also of the great sufficiency, excellency, and
wonderful effects of Archers, with many notable examples, and other
particularities. Composed by Sir John Smythe, Knight. 1589. And printed 1590.
THe strange opinions, so wonderfully mistaken in these our days in all
matters Military, by diverse of our chief men of charge and war, (as they
are accounted) that have learned their greatest skill in matters of Arms,
serving under the States, in the tumultuarie, licentious, and staruing wars
of the Low Countries, or peradventure some little in the civil wars of
France, have moved me to take in hand this discourse, to discover their
strange and erroneous opinions Military, by them published to our Nobility
and chief Magistrates, as also to all the better sort of our people and
Nation; which upon any important war, either offensive or defensive, may
greatly redound to the loss and danger of our Prince, Country and Nation.
In the which discourse, my meaning is not to touch the reputation of diverse of
our ancient brave Captains and Soldiers, who were men of good skill and
sufficiency before they entered into those wars, nor yet the reputation and
honor of diverse Noble men, No Noble nor worthy men, any ways intended to be
touched in this discourse.
as also Gentlemen, of noble or worshipful houses, that of very late years
have entered into those services, rather to win reputation, knowledge and honor,
than for any hope of gain, or spoil; of the which there be diverse that by
the testimony of their honorable actions, and government of themselves, and
the charges unto them committed, have deserved great praise and honor; but
only to touch with blame and discommendation, such, as attaining (I wot not
how) to the highest places of office and charge to command our English Nation
in those parts, have through their covetousness, and lack of love toward the
soldiers of their Nation, so corrupted, or rather (as much as in them has
lien) subverted all discipline Military, to the great loss and dishonor of
our Country and Nation, that neither they themselves, nor any of their
imitators, are worthy to be accounted in the number of men of war, and much
less to be esteemed by men of experience and judgment in actions Military,
to be any ways worthy to command and govern soldiers. In this discourse
(also) I mean not at this time to meddle with the infinite numbers of
disorders Military by them committed in the Low Country wars, where they
made a far greater war upon our people and Nation, than upon the Enemies of
our Country; but to handle diverse abuses of theirs, and chiefly, the abuses
that they have sought to bring our Nation into by mistaking of fortification,
and of the effects of diverse weapons out of their due times and places,
attributing to some weapons such effects as are not to be performed with them,
and detracting (most ignorantly) the excellent effects of our peculiar and
singular weapon the Long Bow, seeking by extolling the effects by them
misreported and mistaken of the Mosquet and Caliuer, to make our Nation believe
that our Long Bows have utterly lost their ancient effects, and therefore no
more to be used, but to be utterly suppressed and extinguished, with diverse
other gross errors, contrary to all reason and experience Military of all
ancient and modern warlike Nations. The most of the which that shall fall
into my memory, I will (with the help of almighty God) answer in such sort,
as all men of experience and judgment in matters of Arms, that have served in
Armies and Camps formed, either of Emperors, Kings, or Common wealths, shall
easily discover their lack of experience and knowledge in matters Military.
And therefore I will begin with one of their toys, and so proceed to greater
matters.

These our such men of war before mentioned, in a manner, utterly ignorant
of all our ancient discipline and proceedings in actions of Arms, have so
affected the Wallons, Flemings, and base Almanes discipline, (as some of them
term it) that they have procured to innouate, or rather to subvert all our
ancient proceedings in matters Military, and therefore have left nothing in a
manner untouched, without seeking to alter and change the same: as for
example; They will not vouchsafe in their speeches or writings to use our
ancient terms belonging to matters of war, Vain innovation of our ancient
terms of war.
but do call a Camp by the Dutch name of Legar; nor will not afoord to say,
that such a Town, or such a Fort is besieged, but that it is belegard: Their
Ensigns also they will not call by that name, but by the name of Colors,
which term is by them so fondly and ignorantly given, as if they should be
apposed as young scholars in their accidens, and should (in stead of Ensigns)
be asked how many Colors of footme^ there were in the Army by Remenen under
the Count Boissu against Don Iuan d' Austria, they must then either answer, a
hundred, or more or fewer, as white, black, blewe, green, yellowe, russet,
etc. or else forsake their new term of Colors, and say so many Ensigns,
Bands, or Companies, which in troth is no direct answer to the question. The
body of the watch also or standing watch (as we were wont to term it) they
now call after the French, or Wallons, Corpse du guard, with many other such
Wallon and Dutch terms, as though our English Nation, which has been so
famous in all actions Military many hundred years, were now but newly crept
into the world, or as though our language were so barren, that it were not able
of it self, or by deriuation to afford convenient words to utter our minds in
matters of that quality.

They fondly scorn our ancient manner of arming.
But that which is more strange, these our such new fantasied men of war do
despise and scorn our ancient arming of our selves both on horseback and on
foot, saying that we armed our selves in times past with too much armor, or
pieces of iron (as they term it). And therefore their footmen piquers, they
do allow for very well armed when they wear their burgonets, their collars,
their cuirasses, and their backs, without either pouldrons, vambraces,
gauntlets, or tasses.

Their Horsemen also, and themselves serving on horseback with Lances, or any
other weapon, they think very well armed with some kind of headpeece, a
collar, a deformed high and long bellied breast, and a back at the proof; but
as for pouldrons, vambraces, gauntlets, tasses, cuisses, and greues, they hold
all for superfluous. The imitating of which their vnsoldierlike and fond
arming, cost that noble and worthy Gentleman Sir Philip Sidney his life, by
not wearing his cuisses, who in the opinion of diverse Gentlemen that saw him
hurt with a Mosquet shot, if he had that day worn his cuisses, the bullet had
not broken his thigh bone, by reason that the chief force of the bullet
(before the blow) was in a manner past. Besides that, it is a great
encouragement to al foreign Nations their Enemies that are better armed, to
encounter with them and their soldiers that they see so ill armed. And as their
ill arming is an encouraging to the Enemy, so it is unto them a
discouragement, and a great disadvantage. For in case any horseman or footman
piquer so ill armed, should be wounded on the thigh, or chiefly on the arm
or hand, either with Lance, Pique, Sword, or any other weapon, his fighting
for that day were marred; besides that, by such wounds received, he is put in
hazard either to be slain or taken. And to the same effect it has been a
maxim in all ages amongst all great Capraines, and skillful soldiers, that the
well arming of horsemen and footmen is a great encouragement unto them to fight
valiantly; whereas contrariwise being evil armed, it is a great
discouragement unto them encountering with well armed men, and most commonly
through wounds received, the very occasion that does make them to turn their
backs.

And as they do mistake the convenient arming of horsemen and footmen, so they
also mistake the weaponing of them: for whereas Swords of convenient length,
form and substance, have been in all ages esteemed by all warlike Nations, of
al other sorts of weapons the last weapon of refuge both for horsemen, and
footmen, by reason that when al their other weapons in fight have failed them,
either by breaking, loss, or otherwise, they then have presently betaken
themselves to their short arming Swords and Daggers, as to the last weapons, of
great effect and execution for all Martial actions: so our such men of war
(contrary to the ancient order and use Military) do now a days prefer
and allow that armed men Piquers, Their mistaking of swords
should rather wear Rapiers of a yard and a quarter long the blades, or more,
than strong short arming Swords; little considering (or not understanding) that
a squadro^ of armed men in the field being ready to encounter with another
squadron, their Enemies, ought to streighten and close themselves by frunt and
flanckes, and that after they have given their first thrush with their Piques,
and being come to join with their enemies frunt to frunt, and face to face
(and therefore the use and execution of the piques of the foremost rancks being
past) they must presently betake themselves to the use of their Swords and
Daggers; which they cannot with any celeritie draw, if the blades of their
Swords be so long: for (in troth) armed men in such actions, being in their
rancks so close one to another by flanckes, cannot draw their Swords if the
blades of them be above the length of three quarters of a yard, or a little
more: besies that, Swords being so long, do work in a manner no effect,
neither with blows nor thrusts where the is so great, as in such actions it
is; as also, that Rapier blades being so narrow, and of so small substance, and
made of a very hard temper to fight in private fraies, in lighting with any
blow upon armor, do presently break, and so become unprofitable. Horsemen
also, and chiefly Lances, wearing their Swords by their sides (as Soldiors
ought to do) cannot readily draw them without letting fall their bridles out
of their left hands, if their Swords be above the length of three quarters of
a yard, or a yard at the most, and yet that too long. All which considered,
their opinion of such long Swords, or Rapiers to be worn either by horsemen,
Their mistaking of daggers.
or footmen armed, is very ignorant.

Long heavy Daggers also, with great brauling Alehouse hilts, (which were
never used but for private fraies and braules, and that within less than these
forty years; since which time through long peace, we have forgotten all orders
and discipline Military) they do no ways disallow, nor find fault withal,
but rather allow them for their Soldiers to wear, than short arming Daggers
of convenient form and substance, without hilts, or with little short crosses,
of nine or ten inches the blades, such as not only our brave Ancestors, but al
other warlike Nations, both in war and peace, did wear, and use. By the
which they evidently show that they do very little consider how ouer-burdensome
and combersome, such Alehouse Daggers are for all sorts of Soldiers both
horsemen and footmen, as also how unfit they are to be used with the point and
thrust by Soldiors, Piquers or Halbardiers against their enemies in squadron.
Where, by proof, reason and experience, in all battles and other encounters,
the nerenesse and prease being so great, short, strong, and light arming
daggers are more maniable, and of greater execution amongst al sorts of armed
men, I would wish that all the piques throghout England (that are for the
field) should be reduced into one uniformity of length, that is, either to
seventeen foot long by the rule, or else to eighteen foot, and not above,
which are two foot longer tha^ the Spaniardes do use in their milicia, and
therewithal, I would have them to be made so light, and of very good wood, that
they should be both portable and maniable, which many of our piques at this
present are not.
than such long deformed Daggers, as aforesaid.

Their mistaking of piques.
Piques also (which are the strength of the field, as well against horsemen as
footmen) they do allow of diverse lengths, so that they seem long, having no
regard to their uniformity of length, nor whether they be portable or
maniable, thorough their too much wood, or no; whereby they show the little
skill they have in the use of that weapon, considering that Piquers being
reduced into squadron to fight, should have all their piques of one equal and
proportionate length, to the intent that all the ranckes being closed by frunt
and flanckes, either to charge an other squadron of Piquers their Enemies, or
to receive, and repulse a charge of Lances, all the points of the Piques of
every rank carrying one equality, and so diverse ranckes being incorporated
by frunt and flancke, with their Piques bent against their Enemies, may
altogether give a greater blow to the repulsing either of horsemen or
footmen, than if they were of diverse lengths like Organe pipes, and thereby
become of less force and resistance. Besides that, it is a very uncomely
sight to see a square of Piquers enlarged in their ranckes to march, that the
but-endes of their piques through their disequalitie of length, should
disorderly precede one another. All which being neglected and contemned by our
such men of war, is by the Almanes, Zwitzers, Spaniards, and other Nations
skillful in the Art Military, greatly regarded.

Halbards of the Italian fashion, Their mistaking of Halbards.
with long points, short edges, and long staves, to be placed within a
squadron of piques, they do better allow of, than of Halbards, or Battleaxes
with short points, long edges, and short staves. In the which they show that
they do very little consider or know, that when two squadrons do encounter,
and that the first thrush of piques being past, they do presently come to
join with short weapons, as with Swords, Battleaxes, and daggers, and that
then, weapons that are with long points, long staves, and short edges do work
no effect, by reason that the rancks being so close, and nere by frunt and
flanks in their distances, and the press on both sides so great, as in such
actions it is, they can have no room, to stand thrusting, and foyning with
long Halbards, nor Piques, as our such men of war do imagine: but then is
the time that the ranckes of short Halbards, or Battleaxes of five foot and a
half long, with strong short points, short staves, and long edges in the hands
of lusty soldiers that do follow the first ranckes of Piquers at the heels,
both with blow at the head, and thrust at the face, do with puissant and
mighty hand, work wonderful effect, and carry all to the ground. And of the
great and excellent executions of such short Halbards and Battleaxes in
battles, our most worthy Ancestors, and diverse other warlike Nations had
experience many years past, when they did use to fight many great battles.
Now peradventure some not skilful in matters Military may happen to say, that
such opinions in weapons mistaken is no great matter: howbeit they are much
deceived; for in matters Military there is no mistaking so small, that in true
understanding is not great, and chiefly the mistaking of weapons, with the
which al effects and executio^s of war are performed.

Their mistaking of the convenient height and length of Caliuers.
Caliuers also (as they term them) being of a greater length and height of
bullet, and more ranforced than Harquebuzes, and therefore a great deal
heavier, they do better allow of, than they do of light, well formed and
ranforced Harquebuzes; alleging for their reasons, that Caliuers will carry
further point and blancke, and also give a greater blow than Harquebuzes. In
the which they do very little consider, that neither Caliuers, nor
Harquebuzes (considering their uncertainty) are to be used by any skillful
soldiers with any volees of shot against the Enemy in the field, above three
or four scores at the farthest, and that Harquebuzes within that distance will
wound and kill as well as Caliuers; besides that, through the lightness and
shortness of them they are so maniable, that the Harquebuziers may skirmish a
great deal longer, and with more dexterity and certeintie, than the
Caliuerers with their Caliuers, as also that upon a hasty retraite they may
very well save and keep their pieces being so light, to the intent to make
head again, whereas the Caliuerers in such actions, through the overmuch
heaviness of their pieces, do most commonly cast them away, and trust to their
heels: whereby with great reason it may be concluded, Harquebuzes of
convenient height and length ranforced, better tha^ the ordinary long and
heavy Caliuers.
that light Harquebuzes well formed of convenient length, and ranforced, such
as the old bands of Italians and Wallons do use, are a great deal more
maniable, more fit, and therefore of greater effect for soldiers to use in the
field, than our ordinary and heavy Caliuers that our such men of war do so
much allow of.

Now, some of our such men of war that were of great offices and charge under
the Earl of Leicester, that was Lieutenant General of the Queens Army at
Tilburie this last summer 1588. seeing the Essex regiment of 4000. footmen
reduced into great bands of 400.500. and 600. to an Ensign, under the charge
and government of Knights and Esquires of great worship, discretion, and desire
to do service to their Prince and Country, they persuaded him with great
vehemency, that it was very meet and convenient that all that whole regiment
should be reduced into bands of 150. soldiers to an Ensign, Their mistaking
of small bands to be better than great.
or into 200. at the most, and therewithal that all those small bands should
be committed to the charge of our trained Low Country Captains (as they call
them) of the which there were a great number attending, some of them more
hungry after charge, spoil and gain, than skillful to do any great service,
or to win reputation, or the love of their soldiers. And the chiefest reasons
that they did allege for reducing them into such small bands, were, that the
Enemy by seeing so great numbers of Ensigns in the field, would judge the
Army to be very huge, and great in numbers of men, and therefore redoubt
them the more; besides that, by the employment of such a number of trained
Captains, the regiment, and so consequently all the whole Army assembled and
reduced into such small bands, should be the more full of men of service and
skill: which their reasons may seem pretty to such as know very little of
matters Military, and that do not fall into the reckoning of their second
meanings, which I omit. Howbeit, how vnsoldierlike persuasions and opinions
these were, how unprofitable for the Prince, and unfit and unready for
services in the field, I will (by the help of almighty God) make evident.

When the great Princes of Germany, upon any occasion or injury offered,
are disposed to make war one against another, or upon an imperial Army
assembled to invade, or resist the Turk, being bound (as they are) by their
tenures Military to the Empire, some to find horsemen, and others to find
footmen at their own charges, they then upon such occasions have always used,
and do still use, to form their regiments of footmen into great bands of 500.
to an Ensign, and that they use especially for two causes, the one thereby in
their regiments, and so consequently in their whole Armies to save the pay of
a great sort of Captains, The reasons and causes wherefore the Princes of
Germany do use great bands of 500. in their services of the Empire.
Lieutenants of bands, Ensignbearers, and other Officers, which would be
greatly increased, and so amount to a far greater charge and pay, in case
they should compose smaller bands of 300 to an Ensign, or under that number:
the other cause that does move them to form their bands so great, is, that
their milicia consisting of Harquebuziers, Piquers, and some Halbarders, with a
few slath swords for the guard of their Ensigns, that those sorts of weapons,
by reason of the greatness of the bands being in great compertiments and
divisions, may be more readily and easily drawn out and separated, and with
a great deal more celeritie incorporated with the other great compertiments of
the like weapons of other great bands, to form their squadrons with sleeves,
wings, troops, or forlorn hopes (according to the order and direction of the
Coronells, and Sergeants Majors) than if their bands were smaller either of
300. or under that number, whereby the compertiments of weapons should be also
the smaller, and thereby in number the greater, and so consequently would
require a longer time, not only to draw out, but also to incorporate
compertiments with compertiments for the forming of battles with sleeves,
wings, and forlorn hopes, as aforesaid. Besides that, such great bands, both
by reason and experience are as ready, or rather more ready to be employed
either in whole companies under their Captains and Lieutenants, or divided
into parts and Corporolates under their Corporals and Sergeants for watches,
bodies of watches, Centinells, and all other ordinary, and extraordinary
employments and actions Military in Camp, Town, or Field, than any small
bands are. Now, peradventure some such as do not understand this order
Military of the Princes of Germany above mentioned, will say, that all the
Regiments of footmen Almanes, that either the King of Spain, or the French
King have hired and employed any ways in their wars, have been but of 300.
to an Ensign, which is very true; howbeit the cause thereof has been, that
when such Princes have occasion to employ any Mercinarie regiments of Almanes,
The cause wherefore the mercinarie Almane Coronells do use small bands of 300.
in the service of foreign Princes.
they do send their Commissaries into Germany, to hire so many Coronells as
they will have Regiments, in case that they had none before in their ordinary
stipends and pay; and those Coronells do make choice of Captains for the
leauie of their Regiments, at their own pleasures, and therefore will accept
of no Captains, but of such as will compound with them and buy their
Captainship, so as the more bands the more Captains, and the more Captains
the more compositions and profit; which peradventure was the cause that moved
some chief officer, or officers under the Earl (as imitators of the Almane
Mercenaries) to persuade him to reduce all the great and honorable bands
aforesaid, into little bands of 150. or 200. thereby to have the more
compositions and sommes of money at our Low Country Captains hands, some of
the which would not let to give largely to obtain Companies, intending after
by fleecing and ransoming of their soldiers being men of wealth, to pay
themselves again with great interest, which two or three days before the
breaking up of the Camp, they very prettily did begin. Howbeit, it seems
that such great Officers and perswaders, had little regard to the profit of
the Prince, nor yet to the reducing of the Army with celeritie and dexterity
into squadrons and battles, and other forms Military as aforesaid,
considering that those small bands of 150. or 200. soldiers to an Ensign, did
consist of five different sorts of weapons, viz. Piques, Battleaxes, Mosquets,
Harquebuzes, and Long Bows, and that therefore every one of them was to be
reduced into five diverse divisions, which besides the uncomely sight to see so
many small compertiments in every such little band, it would have required a
far longer time upon the daily and ordinary dislodging of an Army reduced
into Vaward, Battle, and Rereward, to have drawn out so great a number of
compertiments out of such a number of little bands, than out of bands of 500.
to have drawn a few great compertiments, and to have encorporated and reduced
them into any form Military. Now, whereas our such men of war persuaded
with the Earl, that the Enemy would judge the greatness of the Army by the
greatness of the number of Ensigns, and therefore redoubt the more, and that by
the number of such little bands under so many trained Captains, the Army
should be so much the more full of men of service, it argues the
insufficiency and lack of judgment of such perswaders. For there is no Enemy
skillful in the Art Military, that will judge of the greatness or smalnes of
an Army in the field, by the great or small number of Ensigns or pieces of
Taffata, but by the frunts and flancks of the squadrons marching, and chiefly
by good espialls, or by prisoners taken. And as for the dismissing and cassing
of the Knights and Esquiers that were Captains of such honorable Companies,
that such Low Country Captains might have supplied their places, upon the
dividing of those great bands into hundreds and fifties, or into two hundreds,
I think it had been a great deal more meet for the reasons before alleged,
that all the whole Army (if it had been far greater than it was) for the
defense of the realm, should have been reduced into great bands of five
hundreds, under the charge of Knights and Esquiers, well chosen, and of great
worship in their Countries, and that a great part of our such Low Country
Captains ((...) never knew what discipline Military meant, nor yet what it is
to command and govern, as it may well appear by their infinite disorders in
the Low Countries) should have been distributed, and placed throughout those
great bands as Sergeants, or Ensign bearers under such discreet and
worshipful Gentlemen, to the intent that they might first learn to obey,
before they should have authority to command and govern the Yeomanrie of
England.

Now, whereas I have heard of some of our ancient and most sufficient
Captains, that our English milicia of footmen many years past, did consist
of bands but of 100. to an Ensign; and that I have likewise heard by diverse
old and notable Captains Italians, that the Italian milicia also before the
Emperor Charles, as also in the beginning of his time, did consist of bands of
footmen but of 100. to an Ensign, and that those bands of hundreds did consist
every one of them but of one sort of weapon, as amongst the Italians of a
hundred Piques, (saving that of that number there were a very few partisans
for the garding of their Ensigns) and of a hundred Harquebuziers: so our bands
of hundreds did also consist of 100. Archers, and of 100. Battleaxes, without
composing them of diverse sorts of weapons, according to the modern use, which
certainly (in mine opinion, saving only for the increase of the charges of
the Prince) was a very convenient order, considering that every sort of
weapon being reduced into bands by themselves, without compertiments of diverse
sorts of weapons in any one band (unless it had been of Battleaxes with Piques,
because those two sorts of weapons are to enter into the body of a squadro^)
would have wrought that the Sergeants Majors, and other Officers of the field,
might with great facility and celeritie have reduced any mean Army into
many forms of battles both to march and fight, as also that they might have
been lodged in their quarters with great order and readiness in a Camp, or
Camps formed.

Now, whereas our such men of war did persuade with the Earl for the
reducing of the great bands of footmen into small companies of one hundred and
fifty (as is before declared:) so did they likewise persuade with him to
reduce all those small bands into little Regiments of one thousand under every
Coronell; Their mistaking of small Regiments to be better than great.
by which their persuasions they did very manifestly show that they
understood very little, for what causes and reasons Regiments were first
instituted, and since amongst many Nations continued: howbeit, I do persuade
my self by that which I have heard, partly from their own speeches, partly
also from others of very great credit, that in all their proceedings in
matters of war, they do rather follow the new fashions of the disordered
wars of France, and the Low Countries under the States, than any reason and
experience Military. For in troth, bands of horsemen and footmen, of which
Armies do consist, were at the first reduced into Regiments for diverse causes,
and chiefly for five.

The first, that they might be the better and the more orderly governed, and
the more ready upon all occasions to be commanded and employed.

The second, that they might be the better, and the more conveniently lodged
in their quarters.

The third, that they might be the more orderly and readily placed in their
watches, bodies of watches, and Centinells.

The fourth, that they might for the defense of their Camp be the more readily
reduced into diverse puissant bodies of squadron by themselves, with sleeves and
wings in the places of assembly.

And the fifth, that upon the dislodging of an Army reduced into Vaward,
Battle, and Rereward, diverse Regiments might the more orderly and readily
incorporate, and reduce themselves into three mighty battles, or more,
according to the order and direction of the Lieutenant general, or high
Marshall of the field, or else of the Sergeant Mayor Mayor, by some called the
Sergeant Mayor general.

Now, the Launce-knights Almanes (which is the Nation of Christendom most
skillful of all others that ever I saw, to perform these actions and effects
before declared, with many other matters Military both for the Camp and
field) to the intent to perform al such actions with the more celeritie and
dexterity, have used of great antiquity to form all their Regiments of
footmen of ten Ensigns to every Regiment, and so they did use many years
past, when every one of their Regiments did consist of five thousand soldiers,
at which time their bands did consist of five hundred to every Ensign. And of
later years they reduced their Regiments to be of four thousand, and their
bands to be of four hundred to an Ensign. And last of all, their Regiments to
be of three thousand, and so their bands to be of three hundred to every
Company, which does at this present continue, unless it be in the public
services of the Empire against the common Enemy the Turk, or in their own
private services, as is before declared.

Now, if our such perswaders before mentioned were of so great consideration
and judgment, as they would seem to be, they would very well know that great
Regiments of five, four, or three thousands that do consist of great bands of
five, four, or three hundreds, are a great deal more ready to be commanded
and governed, and therewithal to perform all actions Military, with a great
deal more celeritie and dexterity, than if they were reduced into little
Regiments of thousands, and small bands of hundreds and fifties. And that may
be with great facility considered by the like comparisons and reasons, which I
have before alleged, that great bands of five hundreds, and so consequently
by the like reasons of four or three hundreds are more ready to be reduced
into form, and employed in all important services with more celeritie and
dexterity, than small bands of hundreds and fifties, or two hundreds are:
Besides all which, by forming of such small Regiments of one thousand, the
Prince does consume a far greater pay, than by forming of great Regiments of
five, four, or three thousand, by reason of the great number of officers,
which are increased by such great numbers of little Regiments. And for further
proof and confirmation of every forementioned particularitie, I were able to
allege many more reasons, if it were not to avoid prolixitie. Howbeit,
peradventure it may now be said unto me, that the Tercios of the Spaniards that
have served many years in the Low Countries, do consist some of them but of
twelve hundred, and others of fifteen hundred, and some of more, and others of
fewer, which I confess to be true, but that has proceeded of this, that they
are not entire Tercios, nor never were since they were drawn out of such
principalities where they before were resident, as for example: when the Duke
of Alba was to come out of Italy with his Army, to suppress the intestine
tumults of the Low Countries, the whole Tercios of Sicilie, Naples, Sarden^a,
and Lumbardy were not drawn out of those gouernme^ts, but certain great parts
of them, which notwithstanding were called by the names of Tercios, with
additions of the names of the governments and principalities from whence they
came, as though they had bin entire, whereas in troth they were but certain
great parts of those Tercios. For a Tercio is not to be holden for complete
of any smaller number than of 3000. soldiers, according to the ordinary
regiments of Italians, Wallons, and other Nations that are in these days of
the like number.

Caliuers and Mosquets for services in the field they extol and magnify,
Their vain opinions of the effect of Caliuers and Mosquets.
and chiefly Mosquets, persuading as much as they can all Magistrates, and men
of account, that battles and victories in these our days are to be obtained
chiefly by the force and excellency of those weapons; and that the foreign
Enemy seeking to invade us in any Haven with a Navy and Army royal, should
with four or five thousand Mosquettiers and some Caliuerers, be repulsed and
kept from landing. And that certain Sconces by them devised without any
Bulwarks, Flanckers, Trauesses, Mounts, Platformes, wet or dry Ditches in
form, with Counterscarps, or any other good form of fortification, but only
raised and formed with earth, turfe, trench, and certain points, angles, and
indents, should be able to hold out the Enemy landed some three or four
days, until the force of three or four shires were assembled. They also do
further attribute such excellency unto Mosquets, that no squadrons of horsemen
or footmen, what number soever they have of Archers, are any ways able to
abide the volees and terror of that weapon, being in great numbers within 20.
or 24. scores, but that they must of necessity be dismembered and broken. To
the weapon of Caliuers before mentioned, they also give exceeding commendation
for skirmishes and encounters in the field, saying that they may skirmish with
that weapon 10. or 12 scores of, to the great terror and hurt of the Enemy.
Upon which excellent effects by them attributed to the aforenamed weapons of
fire, they have persuaded (as much as does in them lie) that all our bands of
late years erected for the defense of the Realm, should be filled with many
Mosquettiers and Caliuerers, and few Piques, and for short weapons being Bills
(which I call Battleaxes) they make small account.

Now, for answer to some of these vnsoldierlike opinions, I say, that if any
such as do hold that wonderful opinion of the effects of Mosquettiers (how
good soldiers soever they think themselves) were at any Haven in England with
five or six thousand of the best Mosquettiers that they ever saw of our
English nation, without (...) of horsemen and footmen of other weapons to back
them, I think they would work very small effect against the Enemy landing,
although they had ensconsed themselves (as they term it) in such Sconses as
they and their Enginers formed this last summer 1588. upon the Sea coasts of
Suffolk, and in Essex and Kent, on both sides of the river of Thames. For if
they should see a Navy with an Army of thirty or forty thousand men
(besides seamen, and such as should be left for the guard of the ships) under
some notable and sufficient General enter into any capable Haven of England,
with wind and weather fit for their purpose, with intention to invade (which
God forbid) they should find themselves in their opinions wonderfully
deceived. For this they are to know, that such a General being with his whole
Navy entered into such a Haven, does take order before, that proclamation be
made throughout all his ships and vessels, that no man upon pain of death
being landed, shall straggle or stray abroad, but all soldiers to reduce
themselves with all celeritie under their Ensigns; which done, a Cannon is
discharged out of the Generals ship, which is a warning for all Captains,
Officers and Soldiers to arm themselves and to take their weapons. And upon
the second Cannon discharged, the Captains, and Ensignbearers with their
Ensigns in their hands, with such convenient numbers of Mosquettiers,
Harquebuziers, Piquers, and Halbarders, as the long boats, Shallops, Fregatts,
Azabres, and other such vessels of oars lying ready at the ships sides are
capable of, do enter into them, every long boat having two Bases aforeship
ready charged, and gunners ready to discharge them. Then upon the third
Cannon discharged, all the long boats and vessels of oars for the landing of
men, do row with all fury toward the land with a wonderful terrible noise
of trompets and drommes. Now, if our such men of war with their Mosquettiers
would give their volees of Mosquet shot upon these shipboates full of men,
with intent to destroy great numbers of them being so thick and so many,
they shall find that discharging their Mosquet shot from higher grounds
downwards into the sea, which by the Italians are called Botti di ficco,
accounted of all other dischargings most uncertain, as also by the overmuch
distance, and continual motion of the shipboates rowing, and with the swelling
of the salt water (how calm soever it be) made more uncertain, they shall
shoot very vncertainlie, and therefore work very little or no effect to the
destroying of their enemies, or any ways to keep the^ from landing. Besides
that, the Enemies out of such their ships as are nearest unto them, will
discharge Cannon, Culuerin and Saker shot to the terrifying of them; so as
their shipboates in despite of their Mosquets coming to land, and they
presently sending certain troops of Harquebuziers, with some Halbarders under
their conductors, to skirmish and entertain the Mosquettiers, whilst the
Piquers and other weapons do reduce themselves into form under their
Ensigns, they shall find in the space of three or four hours above twelve
or fifteen thousand men landed; who then taking some ground of advantage to
fortify, and to place their victual, powder, and all sorts of munitions, they
with all speed possible do proceed to the landing of their Artillery and
Munitions, with all the rest of their Army both of horsemen and footmen. Which
being by them performed, they presently make their approach upon their
indented Sconce, not with any crooked or cross trenches, gabions, nor mounts,
according to the order of approaching, and battering of places in form
fortified, but with other inventions gardable against Mosquet shot (that
peradventure our such men of war are ignorant of) as also with Mosquet and
Harquebuze shot, with piques, and half piques, swords and targets, and with
ladders if it be needful, in such terrible sort, as that great number of our
unskillful Mosquettiers and Caliuerers within their Sconce, would be found
scarce able to abide the first charge and assault, seeing so puissant an Enemy
landed. And I doubt rather when they should see with what terror the Enemies
do approach the land, and the small annoyance that they with their Mosquet
shot should work upon them, that they would scarce abide the landing of the
first boats full of soldiers, without abandoning both Sconce and shore to the
Enemy.

And whereas our such men of war the last summer had many devises in their
heads of ensconcing of Sconces for the defense of diverse Havens; A vain
opinion of insconsing of Sconces in the dry grounds of England.
if they were men of understanding in fortification (as they would seem to be)
they might very well know that there is a great difference betwixt the
scituations and natures of the dry grounds of England, and those of Holland,
Frizeland, and other such low and flat Countries full of rivers, great ditches,
marshes, and wet grounds, where they may ensconce themselves with small cost
within little Islands, or upon points and meetings of rivers* or elsewhere, by
the opening of sluices and dykes, or cutting of banckes and trenches, they may
enuiron themselves with water on every side. The best sort of which Sconces
being more strong by nature and situation, than by any art or form of
fortification, may in those parts resist and hold out a weak or an unskillful
Enemy some long while: but such their ensconcings in the dry grounds upon the
Havens of England, are to small purpose to hold out a puissant Enemy, if he
should land, or any ways to keep him from landing. And therefore I conclude,
that such fortifications in England are very skornes and mockeries, and would
be rather profitable for the Enemy landed, than any ways to annoy or to
resist the Enemy. Besides all which before alleged, it is further to be
noted, that a puissant and mighty Enemy that in the time of summer intends
the invasion of foreign dominions by sea, to the intent to give battle and
subdue, does not always bind himself to land his Army in a Haven, but
sometimes upon an open coast and shore, if the sea (without hidden rocks and
flatts) be deep, and the wind and weather fair, having commodity by the
depth of the sea to approach his Navy, and to cast ancker in open road, near
unto a commodious shore and country to land and march upon. So as it behooves
all such Princes, as doubt the invasion of their dominions by sea, not only to
expect and provide for the resisting of the Enemy in their Ports and Havens,
but also to have as great regard to some such open and commodious shoares, as
are before mentioned. Which cannot be performed (...) with ensconcing of
Sconces, (...), but only with a great and extraordinary wisdom, and with
the valiant hands of a puissant Army and Camp formed. Now, whereas they
attribute such excellency unto Mosquettiers with their Mosquets, that being in
great numbers, and backed with some squadrons of Piques, An vnsoldierlike
opinion of the effects of Mosquets for services in the field.
they are able 20 or 24. scores off to break and dismember squadrons both of
horsemen and footmen; True it is, that Mosquets being in the hands of skilful
Mosquettiers, are of great effect for diverse purposes; and that kind of weapon
of that length with restes, and so ranforced, was first used in Italy above
60. years past (as I have diverse times heard ancient Captains of the Italian
and Spanish Nation say) and that at that time they were employed for the
defense of places fortified, as also out of trenches against places fortified
being besieged, which were the very natural places and of greatest effect for
that weapon; howbeit, since that time they have been used in most Armies in the
field both on horseback and on foot, Mosquettiers on horseback were used in
the Emperor Charles, and Henry the French Kings times, to flank a square of
Lances, and to give a volee at another square of Lau^ces their enemies, and
they did use to wear half cuirasses, with rests of iron, to pull forward or
put backward, to discharge their Mosquets from.
but chiefly on foot, but never in any great number until the Duke of Alba
came to govern the Low Countries; who greatly increased the number of that
weapon for soldiers on foot. To the which increase of Mosquettiers he long
before had persuaded with the Emperor Charles, howbeit he could never bring it
to pass, because there were diverse great and notable Captains, such as the
Marquess of Guast, Don Fernando Gonzaga, Iuan Baptista Castaldo, Antonio
Dorea, and the Marquess of Marin^an, with diverse other principal men of his
council of war, that did utterly mislike the encreasement of that weapon
for the field, as too burdensome and heavy for soldiers to use in battles or
great encounters; but for within towns besieged, or out of trenches against
places fortified, they did greatly allow of them: But the Duke at this time
being Lieutenant general and absolute Governor in the Low Countries (as
aforesaid) seeing the numbers of Rutters in all Armies increased, and that the
most of those Rutters, as also that many Captains and Officers of footmen
were armed at the proof of the Harquebuze, he to the intent to frustrate the
resistance of their armours, did increase his numbers of Mosquettiers, the
blows of the bullets of which, no armours wearable can resist. And this I have
heard of diverse ancient Captains both Italians and Spaniards, who did rather
allow of the opinion of those great Captains, than of the Duke of Albas so
great increasing of that weapon. Since whose time the Duke of Parma after the
death of the Commendador and Don Iuan d' Austria, being appointed by the King
of Spain to be Lieutenant general and governor there, seeing the greatest
part of the Low Countries revolted, and lost through Don Iuan d' Austrias
composition; and that he was therefore to recover city after city, and town
after town, because they were all fortified more or less, and that when he
had won them, he must keep and defend them with garrisons; for the which two
effects of winning and defending of towns and places fortified, that kind of
weapon being very excellent, he increased his Mosquettiers to a far greater
number (as I have heard) than the Duke of Alba ever had. Howbeit, I know that
the Duke of Alba had more cause to use Mosquettiers in services of the field
upon diverse occasions, than any of his successors governors of those
Provinces ever had, by reason of the often invasions of Count Lodowick, the
Prince of Orange, and others; and therefore he being (as he was) a great
Captain, and of great experience and skill in all discipline and science
Military, did use to confer with his Coronells, and Maestros de Campo, and
Sergeants Majors of the use of all weapons in their due times and places, and
of their distances in every sort, as of very important matters belonging to
the Art Military; in such wise as there was not any Captain, Alferez,
Sergeant of band, or Cabo de Esquadra, that did not know (both by instruction
and practice) the particular operations and effects of all weapons, and
chiefly of the Mosquet and Harquebuze, in which two weapons the Spaniards have
been accounted of many years to be most perfect and skillful, in such sort
as there were not any Captains or Leaders in his Milicia so ignorant, that
would permit their Mosquettiers to give any volees from their restes, either
at horsemen or footmen in march, or any motion, above 8. or 10. scores at the
farthest, because they knew (both by instruction and experience) that with
that weapon (being for diverse causes very uncertain) they should in
discharging farther of, have wrought very small or none effect to the anoyance
of their Enemies. For although the Mosquet ranforced and well charged with good
powder, would carry a full bullet point and blancke 24. or 30. scores, If
Mosquettiers may give effectual volees 24. scores of (as it is fondly
reported) then some number of Archers being chosen, that could with their
flights shoot 24. or 20. scores (as there be many that can) may by the same
reason give volees of flights at their enemies 18. scores of, which both the
one and the other are mockeries to be thought of, because there is no weapon
in the field effectual, further than to a convenient and certain distance.
does it therefore follow that they should give volees of Mosquet shot 20. or
24. scores of? whereas in failing to take their just sight at point and blancke
no more but the length of a corn, their bullets do work as much effect
against the Moon, as against the Enemy that they shoot at. Besides that, in
so great a distance of ground, how truly soever they take their sights at
point and blancke, the air does work very great effect with their bullets
that are lower by a bore than the height of their pieces, to carry them from
the mark or marks that they are shot at. As also that by proof they may
find, that in giving their volees of Mosquet shot but only twelve scores, at
either horsemen or footmen that are in motion, they shall work no great
annoyance, by reason that the bullets being so much lower than the height of
their pieces (as is aforesaid) do naturally mount and fly vncertainlie.
Besides that, no Mosquettiers in actions of the field can have the time to
charge their pieces and take their sights at point and blancke, as they may
being within trenches, or from out of Bulwarks, Curtins, and Rampires in
places fortified; where, with great leisure they may charge their pieces with
full bullets and charges, and shoot from very certain rests, as it were de
man puesto (as the Spaniards call it.) By which reasons and experiences of the
use of that weapon in the field, the lack of experience and judgment in our
such men of war, that talk of 24. or 20. scores like nouices and Vison^os,
may very evidently appear and give occasion to any such as have seen the
true effects thereof, to think that they never saw any important matter
performed with that kind of weapon in the field.

Now, whereas they give so great commendation to the Caliuer, that with that
kind of weapon soldiers may give volees of shot in the plain fields 10. or 12.
scores off, to the great annoyance both of horsemen and footmen; To that I
answer, that it is a very vnsoldierlike opinion, and contrary to all
experience and use of old soldiers, and chiefly of the old bands of Italians,
Spaniards, and Wallons, who by long experience do better know what effects
both Harquebuzes and Mosquets of all heighthes do work, than they do. And
because that by continual experience they know the wonderful uncertainty of
those kinds of weapons in the field, they will never skirmish, nor otherwise
give any volee above 10.20.30. or 40. paces off at the farthest, although it
be at a whole squadron or troop of horsemen or footmen: saving that true it
is, that the old soldiers Harquebuziers Spaniards, seeing their enemies in the
field some 8.9. or 10. scores off, by the commandment of their officers do
sometimes give a very few shot at their enemies, with no other intent but to
abuse and procure them to give their volees with all fury, that thereby they
may spend their powder and bullets, heat their pieces, and work no effect,
whereby they still keeping the force of their shot, may after give their whole
volees at their enemies, approaching within 10.15. or 20. paces; and for that
effect the Spaniards do use this phrase; This phrase may be interpreted,
discharge a far of, to draw on, and deceive dotterells.
disparese de lexos, para atraher, y engan^ar bobos, which our such men of
war may truly confess, if ever they saw, and encountered with any
puissant numbers of those Nations in the field.

Now, because they do so much mistake the effects of those two weapons of
fire, the Mosquet and Caliuer, attributing such excellency unto them for the
field, as is not to be performed with them, thereby to bring our Magistrates,
and the better sort of our people and Nation into misliking of our ancient
weapon the Long Bow, wishing the utter extinguishing of that kind of weapon as
unprofitable and of none effect for the wars of these our days, I will set
down the perfections and imperfections both of the Mosquet, Caliuer and the
Long Bow, attributing unto each one of them the true effects, that by common
experience and reason have been, and may be wrought with every sort of them in
the field, that by comparing the perfections, imperfections, and effects of the
soldiers, and their weapons of fire, with the perfections, imperfections, and
effects of the Archers and their Bows, all men of consideration and judgment
(be they soldiers or men of peace) may judge which of those three sorts of
weapons are of greatest effect for battles and great encounters, and other
actions in the field, and not in places fortified.

And therefore beginning with Harquebuzes, by many miscalled Caliuers: which
Harquebuzes if they be well ranforced, and the Cannons of them not above a
yard in length, and the bore and bullets not too great, with stocks of good
form, I think them to be very maniable weapons, for such soldiers as are well
practiced, The proper times and places for Harquebuziers.
and do know how to use them, and do work most effect in woods, and whereas
vines or shrubs do grow, and from behind old ruined walls, as also whereas
there be trenches, deep ways, bancks, hills, rocks, or hedges, or any other
covert, where they may lie close, and find any thing to serve them for rests
to discharge their pieces from, and so upon the sudden giving volee after
volee are of great service, and chiefly for ambushes, being fair weather over
head. And also in the plain fields two or three ranckes of them being placed
almost close to the frunt of a squadron of piques, and likewise upon the
flanckes and back of the same squadron, are of good effect to give their
volees at a squadron, or diverse squadrons of Lances charging the piques; and
that they must perform altogether upon their right knees from under the
piques, which must guard them against the charge of the Lances. But they must
take heed that they do not give their volee at the horsemen till they come
within eight, ten, or twelve (...) and not eight, ten, or twelve scores, as
our such men of war do fondly talk and teach; and in that sort they may
work very good effect, if their pieces be charged as they ought to be. If
two squadrons of Piquers also should come to join and charge the one the
other, certain numbers of Harquebuziers being reduced into sleeves. wings, and
troops, upon the flanckes and corners of a squadron, are of good effect,
giving their volees not too far off, so long as there are no horsemen in the
field to break them.

Harquebuziers also being reduced into wings, and little squares and troops in
the field, advanced and retired with some societies, or Cameradas of loose shot
are of good effect for skirmishes against the like weapons, and against
Mosquettiers, so that they be backed with Piques, Halbards, or Battleaxes, and
that in that kind of action, they do not discharge their pieces above thirty,
forty, or fifty yards, or three score at the most, and that with great order
and discretion. And these are the chief effects of that kind of weapon.

Now, as for Mosquettiers with their long ranforced and heavy pieces of great
munition and bullet, they do work very good effect in the like places and
seasons, saving that they are not to be employed as loose shot in skirmishes:
howbeit, the very proper and apt places for Mosquettiers in the field, is to
be reduced into sleeves, wings, broad squares or troops, to flancke a (...) of
armed men, or to defend a straight. The most apt and proper places for
Mosquettiers to work good effect.
For those kind of soldiers having their Mosquets long, ranforced, and of great
munition and bullet, clapping their pieces upon their forkes, may shoot with
some certainty from of those rests, to the annoyance and mischief of well
armed men, be they on horseback or on foot: howbeit, for the skirmish they
work little effect, by reason that the soldiers being in continual motions,
and troubled with heavy pieces of great length, as also with their forkes
hanging upon their fingers, cannot use their Mosquets with so much readiness
and dexterity, as the Harquebuziers their Harquebuzes; being a great deal
more light and short, and without forkes. And to use their pieces without
restes (as some of our such men of war do permit them, when they come new
to the field lusty and strong) is contrary to the use of that weapon, because
they perform no effect against the Enemy, by reason they are not able (how
strong soever they be) to bear their Mosquets with their left arms at any
point and blancke, being in continual motions; besides that, it is the next
way to make them lame in their arms, shoulders, and backs. Two ranckes of
Mosquettiers also being reduced before the frunt of a squadron of piques,
kneeling upon their knees, and encouered with piques, and using their Mosquets
as skillful soldiers should do, may work the like effect, or better against
a squadron of Lances charging, than three ranckes of Harquebuziers can do.
But they must take heed that they give not their volee of shot at the Lances
any greater distance off, than fifteen or twenty yards, because they may
shoot the more certeinlie, and not fail to light either upon the horses or
men. And now having declared the chief effects of both those sorts of weapons,
I will proceed to the imperfections and common accidents of them both, as also
of the better sort of such soldiers as do handle and use those weapons, of what
Nation soever they be.

All Harquebuziers in skirmishes, or great encounters, or being reduced into
any form, do commonly discharge their pieces without taking any certain
sight at point and blanck, and out of their point and blancke they do neither
kill nor hurt, (...) If Harquebuziers also or Mosquettiers in taking their
sights, do fail but the length of a wheat corn in the height of their
point and blancke, The imperfections and uncertainties of the Harquebuze and
Mosquet.
they work no^^ effect at the marks that they shoot at, although they be
very great; and in case they do take their sights at just point and blanke,
yet by reason that their bullets are lower by (...) boares than the height of
their pieces, the said bullets do naturally mount, and fly vncertainlie and
wide from the mark or marks that they are shot at, and the further in
distance the more they fail. The Harquebuze and Mosquet also being discharged
but seven or eight shootes in have, do grow hot, and then do work small
effect, but danger to the soldiers that do occupy them.

If the powder also with the which they are charged be not well corned, and
with sufficient quantity of saltpeter, and kept very dry, it furreth the
pieces, and carries the bullets point and blanke but a little way, and many
times go not off at all. The match also if it be not of very good substance,
well wrought, and very well twisted, and kept very dry, whereby the cole of
the same may be hard and good, it gives no fire to the touchpowder; besides
that, if the touchpowder be not dry it takes no fire, how good soever the
cole of the match be. The Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers also, charging their
pieces in any actions of the field, if in moving or traversing their grounds,
they do not look well to the keeping up of the mouths of their pieces, but
that by any chance the ends of them do go any thing downward, the bullets
that are smaller by (...) boar than the height of the cannons of their
pieces, do fall to the ground; whereupon it happens, that many
Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers thrusting nothing after their bullets to keep
them close to the powder, do in vain discharge the powder without the
bullets. Also if harquebuziers or mosquettiers do not continually keep their
pieces clean without moisture or rust, and also take great heed that they do
not ouercharge the^, they either put their pieces in hazard of breaking, or else
themselves to be overthrown with the reculing of them. Or if Harquebuziers or
Mosquettiers in charging their pieces, do not charge them with convenient and
full charges, and chiefly the Harquebuziers, and that the powder be very
good and dry, as also that they do with their scouring sticks thrust either
paper or felt, or something else between the powder and the bullets, or at the
least after the bullets, whereby the whole charges of powder being restrained
may take fire, and give the more force to the bullets likewise restrained, they
perform but small effect; for such Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers, as charging
their pieces in actions of the field, do not use to put any thing between
the powder and the bullets, nor yet after the bullets to keep the powder and
bullets firm and close together, do discharge much of the powder whole out of
the mouths of their pieces vnfired, unless the powder be merueilous dry and
good; for bullets for the field being smaller and lower (as is aforesaid) than
the heighths of the pieces by (...) bore, the first powder within the Cannons
next unto the touch hole taking fire, does drive out the bullets, with the
powder next unto the bullets vnfired, because that both the powder and bullets
do lie loose unrestrained, by means whereof the bullets do neither work
that effect in their distances of point and blancke, that otherwise they would
do, nor yet in the force of their blows. Besides all which defaults and
defects, neither the Harquebuze nor the Mosquet in wet weather in the field do
work any effect. All which so many imperfections of Harquebuziers and
Mosquettiers (as are before declared, with many others that I omit) are the
causes that upon many great skirmishes and encounters that have been very
hot, and continued many hours, with new supplies on every side, it has
often happened, that in discharging on both sides many thousands of bullets
within three, four, or five scores, and nearer, there has not been on both
sides slain and hurt with bullets thirty men, Very few hurt in skirmishes
with Harquebuze shot in the field.
which greatly argues the insufficie^cie of those kinds of weapons for
battles and great encounters. So as it is to be noted, that such of our men
of war as do give so singular commendations and praises to the effects of
Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers, as also to those weapons, and do not know all
their imperfections and failings before declared, with many more, do show
that they have had very little experience of those weapons in the field, nor
yet that they themselves do know how to handle and use them, and therefore
do talk like nouices they wot not what. Another great insufficiency of
Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers in the field.
Moreover, concerning the insufficiency of those weapons of fire, it is
farther to be noted, that if there be any number of horsemen either Lances
or Stradiotts in the field, where Mosquettiers or Harquebuziers are in action,
and that they have no horsemen on their side to answer them, that it does then
behoue the shot with all celeritie to reduce themselves under the guard of their
squadrons of piques, or if the number of them be so great that the squadrons
of piques cannot encouer them, the overplus must retire themselves to some such
grounds of advantages, as the horsemen may not be able to come to charge the^:
for in case they should abide in the plain field, not encouered with piques,
nor guarded with any ground of advantage, Mosquettiers and Harquebuziers not
able to abide the charge of Lances nor Stradiotts.
a thousand brave Lances or Stradiotts, were able to break three thousand of
the best Mosquettiers, or Harquebuziers of any Nation. And now to the
perfections and imperfections of our ancient weapon the Long Bow, comparing
the different effects and aduauntages of that weapon, with the aforenamed
weapons of fire.

The imperfections of the Long Bow.
The imperfections of the Long bow, do consist only in the breaking of the
Bow or bowstring, for the which in times past (when there was great account
made of Archerie) there was special care had, that all Liueray, or war Bows
being of the wood of Yewgh, were longer than now they use them, and so very
well backed and nocked, that they seldom or never brake: Besides that, the
Archers did use to temper with fire a convenient quantity of wax, rosen, and
fine tallowe together, in such sort that rubbing their Bows with a very
little thereof laid upon a woollen cloth, it did conserve them in all
perfection against all weather of heat, frost, and wet; and the strings being
made of very good hemp, with a kind of waterglewe to resist wet and
moisture; and the same strings being by the Archers themselves with fine
thread well whipped, did also very seldom break; but if any such strings in
time of service did happen to break, the soldiers Archers had always in
readiness a couple of strings more ready whipped, and fitted to their Bows, to
clappe on in an instant. And this I have heard of diverse Yeomen, that have
served as soldiers Archers in the field.

And now having before in this discourse declared all the greatest and most
perfect effects of Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers for services in the field,
and but a part of the imperfections of them, and their weapons of fire; because
there are many more, which for breuities sake I have omitted, and that I have
last of all declared that the imperfections of the Bow do consist only in
the breaking of the Bow and bowstring; because that Archers, if they be well
chosen, and sound of limbs, their weapons do not permit any such accidental
imperfections and failings in them, as the forenamed weapons of fire do in the
soldiers that do handle and use them; which has already appeared, and shall
after in this discourse be made more manifest. I will now therefore proceed to
the consideration and examining of three most important things, Archers do
far exceed and excel all Mosquettiers and Harquebuziers in three most
principal effects.
in the which al effects of Mosquettiers, Harquebuziers and Archers, and their
weapons do consist; and that is, whether Mosquettiers or Harquebuziers with
their weapons of fire, or Archers with their Bows and sheafes of arrows, upon
all occasions in the field, be most ready with all dexterity and celeritie
to execute the effects of their weapons, by discharging and giving volees at
their Enemies. The second is, whether the Archers with their weapons, or the
other soldiers with their weapons of fire, do fail least to shoot,
discharge, and give their volees. And the third is, whether by reason and
common experience the bullets of weapons of fire in the field, or the arrows
of Archers do annoye the Enemies most, be they horsemen or footmen.

To the first I think, that there is no man of any experience in the aforenamed
weapons, that will deny, but that Archers are able to discharge four or five
arrows apeece, before the Harquebuziers shall be ready to discharge one
bullet; I mean the Harquebuziers beginning to charge when the Archers do
begin to take their arrows to shoot. The reason is this, because good
Harquebuziers are first to charge their pieces with powder by one of three
ways: the first (which is best) is out of the mouths and charges of their
flaskes: the second is by certain charges filled with powder, which
Harquebuziers do wear, or carry diverse ways: and the third is by cartages,
with the which they do charge their pieces both with powder and bullet all at
one time, and yet by which of all these ways soever, or any other they do
charge them, they must (if they be good Harquebuziers) use with their scouring
sticks to thrust a quantity of paper or felt, or something else both before,
but chiefly after their bullets, to keep them close to the powder; to the
intent that their bullets upon no accidents may fall out, or at least lie loose
unrestrained from the powder, as also that their pieces may carry the further
point and blancke, and their bullets give the greater blows; which done, they
must presently put touchpowder into their pans, and their matches into their
cocks or serpentines; al which to perform requires a good time. Whereas the
Archers in the field continually having their Bows bent, have no more to do
but to draw their arrows out of their cases and sheafes, to nocke them in
their Bows, to draw them to the heads and shoot; all which is performed
almost in an instant. Now to the second; Archers have no accidents nor
impediments to hinder them from the performance and execution of their
dischargings and volees, whereby they should any ways fail to discharge the
same, unless their Bows or bowstrings should break: whereas Harquebuziers have
not only the same let, in case their pieces by ouercharging, or ouerheating,
or crackes, or rifts, do break, but also if that through the negligence of
the Harquebuziers, the powder with the which they charge their pieces, by any
accident have received any wet, or moisture, or that through the lack of the
closenes of their flaskes, the air of some moist weather has penetrated and
entered into the flaskes, and caused the powder to give and danke, by means
whereof the Harquebuziers giving fire with their matches (...) serpentines to
the touchpowder, oftentimes their pieces do not discharge, or sometimes lies
sissing in the touchhole or piece, until the Harquebuziers have lost their
point and blanke, and then peradventure in vain do go off. The touchpowder
in the touch-boxes also, if either by the negligence of the Harquebuziers (as
aforesaid) or by the fault of the touch-boxes, through the moystnes of the
weather, the powder has given, and become dancke, then oftentimes the powder
will take no fire; whereby the Harquebuziers do not only fail of their
dischargeings, but also become unprofitable, till they have dried or changed
the same. Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers also in pouring touchpowder into their
pannes, the wind (if it be great) will blow and disperse the same, in such
sort, that they shall very often fail to discharge their pieces; and so
likewise if Harquebuziers in putting their matches into their serpentines do
fail to set them of a convenient length, that thereby they may strike just in
the powder and pannes, but that they do set the same too long, whereby the
matches, if they be any thing too lythe, do hang downward, and with the
coming down and stroke of the cocks they fall double and short of the pannes
and powder; or if the same matches by any accident have received outwardly
any wett or moisture, then the coals do burn inward, leaving a beard
outward, so as thereby although the ends thereof do light in the midst of
the pannes and powder, yet the same do give no fire to the towchpowder. By all
which aforesaid means and accidents, with diverse others both Mosquettiers and
Harquebuziers, do fail to discharge their pieces: of all which imperfections
and other accidents, Archers with their Bows are void. So as by all reason
and experience, it is most manifest that Archers are four times more ready to
give their volees of arrows, than Harquebuziers, or Mosquettiers their volees
of bulletts. Besides all which vnreadynesses, and failings before mentioned, if
in the time of any battle, great encountre, or skirmish, the weather does
happen to rain, hail, or snow, the aforenamed weapons of fire can work no
effect, because the same does not only wett the powder in their pannes and
touch holes, but also does wet the match, put out, or at least dampe the fire,
and does mar the powder in their flaskes and towchboxes; unless the
soldiers have very good provision, and besides; be wonderful careful with
their saltenbergs or mandillions to encouer and preserve the same. Whereas
contrariwise, neither hail, rain, nor snow, can let or hinder the Archers
from shooting, and working great effects with their arrows. All which argues
and proves a singular advantage and excellency of Archers and their weapons,
above al Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers with their weapons of fire. Now,
peradventure some not skilled in the perfections and imperfections of
Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers, will say that they have seen the soldiers of
those weapons of fire, charge and discharge with a great deal more celeritie
than I have before mentioned; whereunto I answer, that although it be very
commendable for all Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers to know how to charge and
discharge apace, with all other particularities belonging to weapons of fire,
yet such Harquebuziers or Mosquettiers as do use to charge and discharge so
fast, are the worst of all others. For by often experience, such soldiers for
have do commonly charge their pieces with uncertain charges of powder, and do
neither use with their scouring sticks to thrust paper nor any thing else
betwixt their powder and bullets, nor yet after their bullets to restrain and
keep close the same, whereby their dischargings against the enemy might be
the more effectual: besides that, in their dischargeings, they take no kind of
sight at poinct and blank, nor yet at the ends of their pieces, but do
discharge at a venture; whereby it comes to pass, that such quick and hasty
Harquebuziers, do work no other effect but spend powder, match and shot, and
heat their pieces oftentimes to their own mischiefs; and therefore (in
troth) are more meet to scarre Crows in a corn field (unless they reform
themselves) than with any weapons of fire to be employed against the Enemy.

And now to the third, and last; which is, whether by reason and common
experience, the bullets of weapons of fire in the field, or the arrows of
Archers do annoye the Enemies most, be they horsemen or footmen. I think it
superfluous again to reiterate, and set down the different aduauntages and
chief effects of Harquebuziers, Mosquettiers, and Archers; because I have
already made them so manifest, as also that the Reader hereafter shall see in
many parts of this discourse diverse reasons, and many notable examples and
experiences, that Archers in the field do far exceed and excel all
Mosquettiers and Harquebuziers in terrifying, wounding, and killing both horses
and men. And therefore will only in this place answer one objection, which I
have diverse times heard alleged in commendation of the effects of weapons of
fire, and the dishabling of the effects of Archers, and that is; there are
many that have reported that the blows of the bullets of Mosquets and
Harquebuziers, are no less than death to such as they light upon; whereas
contrariwise the blows of arrows do but only gall, or lightly wound:
which in troth is greatly mistaken by all such as do hold that opinion. For
that by common experience it has been seen in all skirmishes and great
encounters, that for every one that has been slain dead in the field by the
shot of Mosquer or Harquebuze, there have been four that have not died by the
hurts of such weapons of fire, although some of them have remained ever after
maimed, and some not. Whereas by true experience, Archers with their arrows
do not only greatly wound, but also sometimes kill both horses and men, in
such sort as they never depart out of the field alive, as it shall hereafter
appear by diverse ancient as also modern examples. Besides that, I, and
diverse other Gentlemen of our Nation yet living, that were in France in King
Edward the sixts time, and also diverse times since, have many times heard
French Captains and Gentlemen, attribute all the former victories of the
English against themselves and their ancestors the French, more to the effect
of our Archers, than to any extraordinary valiancie of our Nation; and
therewithal further report and say, that they did think that the English
Archers did use to poison their arrowe heads; A wrong opinion conceived by the
French Captains and Gentlemen of our English Archers.
because that of great numbers of the French Nation that many times had been
wounded or hurt with arrows, very few had escaped with their lives; by
reason that their wounds did so impostume, that they could not be cured. In
which their co^ceipts they did greatly err; because in troth those
impostumations proceeded of nothing else but of the very rust of the arrowe
heads that remained ranckling within their wounds; and therefore by the common
experience of our ancient Enemies, (that we have so often vanquished) not
only the great, but also the small wounds of our arrows have been always
found to be more dangerous and hard to be cured, than the fire of any shot
vnpoysoned.

Besides all which, it is to be noted, that horses in the field being wounded,
or but lightly hurt with arrows, they through the great pain that upon
every motion they do feel in their flesh, veins, and sinews by the shaking
of the Arrows with their barbed heads hanging in them, do presently fall a
yerking, flinging and leaping as if they were mad, in such sort, as be it in
squardron, or in troop they do disorder one an other, and never leave until
they have thrown, and cast their masters. Whereas contrariwise, horses that
are in their vital parts hurt with bulletts, or that the bones of their
legs, shoulders, or backs be broken, they do presently fall down, or
otherwise, although they be strike^ clean through, or that the bulletts do
still remain in them, they after the first shrinck at the entering of the
bullett do pass their Carrire, as though they had very little or no hurt: And
this of the hurting of horses with bulletts, both I my self, and all others do
know, that have seen any actions performed in the field. And the other of the
great disordering of horses with the hurts of our English arrows I have read
in diverse histories, and also heard reported by diverse Gentlemen of our nation
that have seen the same. But now because I have diverse times heard many vain
objections objected by some of our Captains of the Low Countries against
Archers, to the disgracing, and dishabling of them, and their weapons in
comparison of Mosquettiers and Harquebuziers and their weapons of fire: I will
(with the help of almighty God) answer as many of them as shall fall into
my memory; and therefore will begin with one of their little fancies that they
do allege against the Longbow, and so proceed to their greater, and greatest
objections.

Among many other their fancies they do allege, that the Archers bows, being
by them used against the Enemy in the heat of summer, An objection against
Bows contrary to all experience.
will grow so weak, that thereby they will leese their force and effects.
Whereunto I answer, that this objection is a new fancy, and a very dream
contrary to all ancient and modern experience of English Archers, whose Bows
being made of that excellent wood of Yewgh, do never so decay in strength,
neither by hot nor wett weather, nor yet by often shooting in them, but that
they will with arrows wound, and sometimes kill both men and horses a greater
distance off, then the shot and bullets of Harquebuziers and Caliuer(...)
employed and used in the open fields, by skillful Conductours and Leaders; by
reason of the wonderful failings and uncertainties of those and all other
weapons of fire maniable: diverse of the particularities whereof: I have before
in this dicourse made manifest.

Also they do further allege, Another vain objection contrary to all
experience and use military.
that upon an invasion of foraine dominions beyond the seas, the weapons, and
furniture of Archers, as of Bows, sheafes of arrows and bowstrings, can not
be found and provided where Archerie is not used; whereas contrariwise, all
kinds of munition belonging to the weapons of fire, are easy to be found and
provided in all foraine dominions. Which is as much, as if they should say,
that if an Army of five and twenty, or thirty thousand of our English nation
under some sufficient General were sent to invade France, and disembarking in
Normandy, and winning Newhauen and Roan, should straight march to Paris:
(which is no more tha^ diverse Kings of England and their Generals have done)
where after some encountres and skirmishes the Army coming to lack powder and
shot, they should with facility for money provide the same in the heart of the
Enemies Country, where all the Towns in which that provision is to be had
are fortified, which is a very mockery and dream to be thought on. But some
of our such men of war peradventure will further allege, that they might
have the same provision by the way of conuoy, either from Newhauen or Roan, in
case they were possessed of those Towns: whereunto it is to be answered, that
first the conuoy had need to be very strong; besides that, there is no man of
any consideration and judgment, but that does very well know, that
Mosquets, Harquebuzes, powder, match and lead, are as heavy, and a great deal
more heavy to be carried, than Bows, sheafes of arrows and bowstrings are.
Besides that, by such their ignorant objections, they do evidently show that
they have not read, nor heard, or else for lack of reason not believed, the
proceedings of the notable Kings of England in their invasions of France, and
other Dominions; for if they had, they would not then doubt, but that a King of
England, or his Lieutenant general inuading foreign dominions, would upon
such an enterprise carry all sorts of munition, belonging to Archers, to serve
them for many battles and great encounters, as well as King Edward the third,
and Henry the fifth, and their Lieutenants general did, whose Armies did
sometimes consist of nine, or ten thousand al Archers, and not above four or
five thousand armed men on horseback and on foot; which Princes, and their
Lieutenants did never omit (according to their milicia) to carry great plenty
of sheafes of Arrows, Bows, and all other things requisite as well for their
Archers, as for their armed men, By this objection they discover that they
never saw any Army royal march in the field.
and all other effects. Besides that, by that their simple and fond objection,
they do discover that they have very seldom or never seen an Army royal
march in the field; for if they had, they then would very well know, that
there is no puissant Army formed either to invade or defend, that does consist
of a well ordered milicia, that does not in the public carriages of the Camp,
ordinarylie carry all kinds of munitions of weapons and armours offensive and
defensive, with all other munitions and necessaries requisite for all purposes,
for the public employments and use of Camp, Town, and field.

Now, whereas some of our aforesaid men of war do further allege, rather
upon fancy than upon any souldiourlyke reasons and experience, many vain
and frivolous objections, partly against the Bows (as aforesaid) but chiefly
against the Archers that do use them, An objection that they object against
Archers.
how good soever they be, saying that Archers when they have lain some long
time in Camp in the field, will become so decayed in strength either by sickness,
or otherwise, that they will not be able to draw their Bows, and work that
effect that Archers should do; whereas contrariwise, Mosquettiers and
Harquebuziers will give as great blows with their bulletts out of their pieces
being decayed in strength by long lying in Camp, or sickness, as if they were
whole. Thereunto I answer, that true it is, that the small love that such men
of war as they are, have borne to their soldiers in the Low Countries,
allowing them nothing but prouand, and lodging them in Churches, upon the bare
stones and pauements, as well in winter as in summer, with many other their
abuses and disorders, contrary to all discipline military, have made most of
their soldiers unfit and unable to use any sort of weapons, as soldiers
should do in the field: howbeit in favor of Archers, to convince their simple
and ignorant opinions, Harquebuziers decayed in strength, or having cricks, or
aches, not able to use their Harquebuzes.
I say, that if Harquebuziers happen to be decayed in strength by sickness, or
that by long lying in Camp in the field, they shall happen to have any ache,
or aches in their necks, shoulders, arms, backs, thighs, legs, or feet,
although that they be otherwise heart whole enough, shall be as little, or rather
less able in services in the field to perform the effect of Harquebuziers,
than Archers the effect of Archers; for Harquebuziers in such services must be
lythe in all their ioints and sinews, that they may stoop to their pieces,
and trauerse their grounds, now retiring having discharged, giving place to
their fellows, and then advancing again, giving their fellows retiring time
again to charge, with such agilitie, and dexterity, that they may be ready
upon every opportunity, to stoop, and take every little advantage of hillocks,
bancks, vines, trenches, shrubbes, or any such like; besides that, they must
have their arms and shoulders very sound to carry their pieces firm in
their dischargings at the Enemy, as also to use their scouring sticks, and
charge again; which effects they are no ways able to perform if they be
grown weak by lying in the field, or if they have achs, or cricks in any part
of their limbs, as aforesaid.

Mosquettiers also, it does behoue to be strong and puissant of body without
sickness, achs, or other impediments, and every way sound of wind and limb:
for if they be decayed in strength of body by lying in the field, Mosquettiers
must be sound of body, or else they are not able to use their Mosquets.
or that they have any impediments of cricks, or aches in their necks,
shoulders, arms, backs, thighs, or legs, it is not possible that they should
be able to use their Mosquets in the field to the annoyance of their Enemies,
their pieces being so wonderful heavy, and they troubled with the carrying
and use of their rests, and laden with their other ordinary and heavy
furniture, if they be any ways decayed, as aforesaid, and therefore are become
unprofitable for services in the field: whereas Archers that are not troubled
with so heavy weapons and furniture as the Mosquettiers, nor bound by the
effects of their weapons to any such nimblenes, Archers although with some
aches are able to work the effect of Archers.
stoupings and agilities, as Harquebuziers are, may very well draw their Bows,
if they be sound without aches from the girdle upward, what aches soever they
have from that part downward, so long as they are able to march as fast as
armed men Piquers, because that according to the ancient and true use of that
weapon, they are to be used rather for battles and great encountres, than for
light skirmishes.

Armed men also Piquers and Halbarders, Armed men must be sound and strong, and
without aches
will be very unable to march in the field armed, and with their weapons, if
they be decayed in strength of body by long lying in the Camp, or by
sickness, or that they have any aches, or cricks in their limbs, besides that,
upon such diseases they will be a great deal less able to encounter with
their enemies in the field upon any occasion of battle or great encounter,
and to use their piques and other weapons, as armed men should do in such
actions. All which rightly considered, their inconsiderate speeches, and
enablings of Mosquettiers. and Harquebuziers, and disabling of Archers upon the
accidents and occasions aforesaid, does argue their insufficiencies in matters
military; because such as pretend to be men of war, or old soldiers, should
not speak rashly, Old soldiers should speak with consideration, and
judgment.
and (as the Frenchman says) a la volee, but with consideration, reason and
judgment; for otherwise, how long soever they have served in wars, it may
be rightly deemed that they have spent their times, and employed themselves
more to some other base and vile occupations, than to the consideration and
exercises of matters Military. Moreover, they object against Archers, An
objection against Archers answered.
that men in this age are not so mighty and strong of body, as they have been
in former ages, and therefore cannot shoot so strong, and work so good effects
with their arrows, as their forefathers have done in times past; which is as
frivolous an objection as all the rest: and the reason is this, that they may
see by experience, (if they list) throughout England, as also amongst other
Nations, as many sons, as tall or taller than their fathers, or bigger and
stronger, as they shall see lower, slenderer, and weaker. Now, peradventure
with more troth some may say, that the subjects of England within these thirty
or forty years, have not had so much exercise in Archerie, as their
forefathers in times past were wont to have, whereby it comes to pass, that
Archers in number are greatly decayed, which I confess to be very true:
howbeit, that has chiefly proceeded through the great fault and negligence of
sorts of Magistrates, who having excellent statute and penal laws established
in other kings times for the increase and maintenance of Archerie, and that
boys from their young years should be taught the exercise and use of the
Bow, that being come to man's state, they might be the better able to serve
their Prince and Country with that kind of weapon, have so neglected, or
rather contemned the due performance and execution of those laws, that a great
deal more through their own fault, than through the fault of the people, it
is now come to pass, that the Realm has so few good Archers: which their
negligence, or contempt, whether it has proceeded of that they have been
carried into the fancies of liking the aforesaid weapons of fire, because they
fill men's ears and eyes with such terrible fire, smoke and noise, or else that
they have been persuaded thereunto by some old newfangled men of war, that do
neither understand the true effects of Mosquetterie, Harquebuzerie, nor
Archerie, I wot not. But this I know, that if that weapon hereafter shall come
to be forgotten and extinguished, through the negligence and lack of good
execution of such good laws, that whereas in times past we were wont to give
battle, and fight with our Enemies with a weapon so terrible unto them, that
they never had any use or skill of, but only to their mischief, and
therefore of great advantage for us, and wherein our people and Nation of a
singular gift of God, and as it were by a natural inclination with good
execution of laws, came to be so perfect and excellent, without any public
cost and charges either to King or Realm, we shall then upon any occasion of
war offensive or defensive, be driven to fight with them with their own
weapons, to our great disadvantage, that is, with the Harquebuze and Mosquet,
in the which they had and have continual practice and exercise, A great
disadvantage for the English against foreign Nations.
by reason that they are in the continent, where every kingdom and state does
join one to another without any partition of sea, and therefore driven to
keep continual garrisons and exercises of war, whereas we contrariwise
living in long peace without any such exercises Military, upon the occasion
of a war (as aforesaid) must leauie and enroll new soldiers, and go about to
train and exercise them with those weapons that they never handled before,
when we should go to fight and give battle to the Enemies Army, that is,
of old soldiers of long time trained and exercised in those weapons.

The excellency of the Long Bow for battles and great encounters.
Now, these weapons the Long Bows (which our such men of war have so much
condemned) being in the hands of such soldiers Archers as can well use them,
are weapons of singular advantage and effect for battles and great
encounters, both against horsemen and footmen, and chiefly being so evil
armed, as all Nations in these our days both on horseback and on foot are,
because that the Bow is a weapon wonderful ready in all seasons, both of
fair and foul weather (which Mosquets and Harquebuzes are not) and does
wound, gall and kill both horses and men, if the arrows do light upon any
disarmed parts of them; besides that, the Archers being good, they do direct
their arrows in the shooting of them out of their Bows with a great deal
more certainty, being within eight, nine, ten, or eleven scores, than any
Harquebuziers or Mosquettiers (how good soever they be) can do in a much
nearer distance, by reason that Mosquettiers and Harquebuziers failing in their
points and blancke, do neither kill nor hurt (unless it happen as the blind
man shooting at the Crow;) besides that, in their points and blancke, through
the imperfections before declared, they do very seldom hit, whereas
contrariwise the arrows do not only wound, Differences specially to be
noted.
and sometimes kill in their points and blank, but also in their discents and
fall; for if in their discents they light not upon the Enemies faces, yet in
their lower discents they light either upon their breasts, bellies, codpeeces,
thighs, knees or legs, and in their lowest descent, and fall even to the
very nailing of their feet to the ground, which with the terrible coming of
the arrows in the eyes and sight both of horsemen and footmen, causes in the^
a wonderful fear and terror. Whereas contrariwise, Harquebuziers and
Mosquettiers with their weapons of fire do no ways terrify neither horses,
nor men that are but four, or five times used to their crackes, smoke and
noise, unless by great chance they happen to be stricken with bullets; and the
reason is this, that the bullets being discharged are invisible, Both horses
and men that are used to harquebuze and mosquet shot, are not afraid thereof.
and therefore do no ways terrify the sight; whereof it comes to pass
that when horses and men that have been in three or four skirmishes do see
that they receive no hurt neither by the fire, smoke, nor noise, nor that in
many thousands of Harquebuze and Mosquet shot, there are not twenty men
slain nor hurt, they grow after to be far less in doubt of those weapons of
fire, tha^ of Piques, Halbards, The vollees and sight of arrows flying in the
air, do wonderfully terrify.
Lances and swords: Howbeit the volees of Archers arrows flying together in
the air as thick as hail do not only terrify and amaze in most terrible
sort the ears, eyes and hearts both of horses and men with the noise and sight
of their coming, but they also in their discents do not leave in a whole
squadron of horsemen, nor footmen (although they be in motion) so much as one
man nor horse, vnstrike^ and wounded with diverse arrows, if the number of the
Archers be answerable to the number of the squadron. And therefore for the
experience that both I and many others, both Noblemen, Gentlemen and great
Captains of many nations, that I have served amongst, have had of the small
effect of weapons of fire in the field, with the reasons and differences before
alleged; for my part I will never doubt to adventure my life, or many lives
(if I had them) amongst eight thousand Archers complet, The opinion of the
author of the great effects and advantages of Archers.
well chosen and appointed, and there withal provided and furnished with great
store of sheafes of arrows, as also with a good overplus of Bows and
Bowstrings, against twenty thousand of the best Harquebuziers and
Mosquettiers, that are in Christendom. For this I know (as it is before
declared) that Harquebuziers, if they be led by skillful Conductours, are not
to give any volees of shot above three, or four scores (...), nor
Mosquettiers any volees of bullets above eight, ten or twelve scores, at any
squadro^s of horsemen or footmen in motion; and yet that too far, unless
their leaders do thinck rather to terrify their Enemies with smoke and noise,
than with any hurt of the bullets. Whereas Archers reduced into their
convenient forms, being in so great numbers (as aforesaid) do dim the light
of the sun, darken the air and cover the earth with their volees of arrows,
eight, nine, ten and eleven scores distant from them; in such sort, as no
numbers of Mosquettiers, Harquebuziers, or Argolettiers, nor yet squadrons of
Lances nor of footmen, Horsemen and footmen ill armed in these days.
being so ill armed as in these days they are, shall be found able to abide the
incredible terror of the shot of such infinite numbers of arrows. For there
is no doubt but that Archers with their volees of arrows, will wound, kill, or
hurt above an hundred men and horses, for every one that shall be slain or
hurt, by the volees of so great numbers of Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers, as
are before mentioned.

Now, whereas our such men of war do further dishable our Archers, saying,
that they are to work in a manner no effect neither against horsemen nor
footmen, and that Archers are not able in the field to abide the terror of
the shot of Mosquettiers nor Harquebuziers, with many other vain and fond
objections, contrary to all reason and experience: certenlie, it is not to be
thought strange in them, considering that as their ouerweening and presumption
has extended to show their lack of skill in many other matters military
before mentioned, that they pretended to have most knowledge of, as namely in
the mistaking of the conueniencie of diverse sorts of weapons in their due
times and places, with many other very important matters before mentioned; so
in these matters of our Archerie, it is not to be meruailed at, that they do so
grossly err in their fond opinions conceived and alleged, against the
excellent effects of that weapon, of the which they never had any experience,
nor yet do know how to order them; as it did very evidently appear to all
men of judgment, that saw their disorderly placing of Archers in the battles
they formed at Tilbury this last summer. A great mistaking in placing of
Archers, showed at Tilburie.
1588. where the Earl of Leycester, being Lieutenant general of the Army
assembled for the defense of the Realm, commanded all such men of war as
were the chief Officers of the Army under him, to consider of some excellent
order and forms of battle, that should be presented within three or four
days after, in the presence and sight of the Queen, her Council, and
Nobility: at which time some of the chief Officers of the Camp, that of long
time had served in the Low Countries, being there assembled to form three
battles, a Vaward, Battle and Rereward, with wings, sleeves, squares and
troops, according to their best skill, and that warning had bin given them of
the Queens coming so long before; and therefore had consulted how to reduce
them into most strong and beautiful form that they could, to have given
battle if the Enemy had bin there; they with many terrible oaths and cursings
and bannings of Archers and their Bows, partly for the hatred they bare to
that weapon, but chiefly (as I think and as it after appeared) because they
knew not where to place them; in the end (after long and much a do) they
placed certain ranckes of Archers in the midst of their squadrons of Piques,
behind the Ensigns, and seven rancks of Archers they placed behind upon the
very back of the battle, and all the rest they reduced into sleeves, close by
the flanks of their three battles, of which sleeves some of them were of five
in a rank, and some three in a rank; and because they should be surely
guarded with shot, they reduced sleeves, or rather squadrons of Caliuer shot
close to the flanckes of the Archers, of which sleeves of Caliuer shot, some
were of nine and twenty in a rank, other of fifteen in a rank, and the
smallest sleeves of eleven in a rank, which to all men of any judgment in
matters Military, might be a wonderful scorn and mockery. For in case that
they should in that form have marched against the Enemy to have given
battle, they themselves, by their fond and unskillful placing of the Archers,
had taken away the whole effect of the volees of their arrows. For it is to
be understood, that when any squadrons of Piquers do approach, with intent
to give battle and join with other squadro^s of Piquers, or to receive a
charge of horsemen, they all upright their piques, and do close themselves by
frunt and flanckes; then the Archers are to give their volees of arrows at the
Enemy, approaching within eight, nine, ten, or eleven scores; and to
perform the same, they ought not to have any other weapon placed before them,
that may any ways take away their sights to direct their arrows toward the
Enemies faces; but as they were placed, their sights had not only been taken
away upon such an action with the smoke of the shot, and with so many
ranckes and Ensigns closed in frunt and flanckes as were before them, but also
the most of their volees of arrows should have flien through the taffaties of
the Ensigns, and have glaunced or lighted upon the piques, either cleaving
them, or beating them down: besides that, (to the Archers great disadua^tage)
they should have lost a great part of their ground, in giving their volees of
arrows at their Enemies, by reason of the distance, so many ranckes of other
weapons being before them: which most gross and ignorant errors by them
committed in their reducing of Archers, contrary to all science Military,
with many other their disorders (which I omit) do manifestly show their lack
of skill and insufficie^cie, any ways to control or find fault with that most
excellent and renowned weapon. Now therefore, I will proceed to the ancient and
orderly forming and use of Archers that has been used of great antiquity by
the notable Kings and great Captains of our English nation, who with the grace
of God and merueilous effect of that most singular weapon, have achieved so
many and so wonderful victories against both Pagans and Christians.

The ancient order of forming Archers in the field.
The ancient order of reducing Archers into form by our most skillful and
warlike ancestors, was into hearses, that is, broad in frunt, and narrow in
flanck, as for example, if there were five and twenty, thirty, five and
thirty, or more or fewer Archers in frunt, the flancks did consist but of
seven or eight rancks at the most: and the reason was this, that if they had
placed any more ranckes than seven or eight, the hinder ranckes of Archers
should have lost a great deal of ground in the volees of their arrows at
their Enemies, considering the convenient and proportionate distances betwixt
rank and rank, and ranckes before them, as also that the sight of the
hinder ranckes should have been taken away by so many former ranckes from
directing their volees of arrows toward their Enemies faces. And whereas the
small skill of our such me^ of war at Tilbury did (as it were) lock up all
the Archers, depriving them of all use and effect of their arrows, our
ancestors had so great experience of the wonderful effect of that weapon,
that they placed their hearses of Archers either before the frunt of their
armed footmen, or else in wings upon the corners of their battles, and
sometimes both in frunt and wings. And in this sort, they placed them in the
face of the me^ at arms of France, and all other brave horsemen of foraine
Nations, who in those days were far better armed tha^ any Nations in these our
days are. And yet with this good order, the wonderful effect of our Archerie
and arrows was such, that flying in the air as thick as snow with a terrible
noise, much like a tempestuous wind preceding a tempest, they did leave no
disarmed place of horse or man vnstriken and wounded, as may well appear by
many battles and victories; Froissart, and the French Chronicles.
and namely by the battle of Crecy, that kind Edward the third and Prince
Edward his son won against king Phillip of France, where the said king
Phillip had eight or ten thousand men at arms, and fifteen thousand Genoueses
Crossebowers (which were no ways inferior for services in the field to the
Mosquettiers of this time) with so puissant an Army also on horseback and on
foot, very well armed and appointed of diverse Nations, that they were six at
the least, for every one of the English, in which battle were slain eleven
Princes, and twelve hundred Knights, besides thirty thousand soldiers of all
Nations. The notable effect of Archers at the battle of Crecy.
And the wonderful effect and terror of the shot of arrows was that day
such, as neither the French king with his men at arms, nor yet any other of
his great Captains with their brave and well armed bands of horsemen of
diverse Nations, were able to enter and break the Archers although they had no
piques, stakes, banckes, nor trenches to guard the^, but being in the plain and
open fields, the Archers with their volees of arrows did break both horsemen
and footmen, wounding or killing both horses and men; in such sort, that the
French King himself being in great perrill, The French Kings horse slain
under him with arrows.
had his horse with the shot of arrows slain under him. By which example, and
diverse others that I will hereafter allege, it may be apparent to any man
that is possessed with the grace of God, and therefore of sound judgment, that
Archers being in great numbers, and reduced into the form of hearses, or
double hearses, as wings to a battle, or squadron of piques (that they may
the more conveniently give their volees of arrows) need not to be guarded
with piques, nor yet stakes (as some talk of the battle of Agincourt) but
they themselves are most brave Piquers; for as a squadron of Piquers well
formed do with their piques in their hands work great effect in resisting a
charge of Lances, or by encountering with another squadron of Piquers their
Enemies: so the arrows of brave Archers reduced into hearses, being delivered
out of their Bows, do become so terrible piques in the eyes and sight of the
horses, as also in lighting upon their shafrons, cranets, or steel
pectorells; or being not barbed, upon their bare faces and every disarmed
part, that the horses with the huzzing, striking, and unaccustomed noise, and
with the blows and wounding of the arrows do fly back and athwart the one
the other, in such sort, as no force of spurs can make them to go any
further against the Archers, but that they do disorder and overthrow one
another. Besides that, against squadrons of armed footmen, the volees of
arrows flying in the air, and coming in their eyes and sights as thick as
hail, and lighting upon their faces, and every other disarmed part, do so
amaze them, that they come to loose their ranckes and disorder themselves,
before they can come to join with another squadron of armed men their Enemies:
and also with their terror do wonderfully confuse and confound the greatest
and brauest Captains in their directions and commandments. As it may very
well appear not only by the battle of Crecy before mentioned, but also by
the battle of Poictiers, where certain years after the same Prince Edward,
that was at the battle of Crecy with King Edward his father, having not in
his whole Army above eight thousand English and Gascoignes, (of the which
there were six thousand Archers, and two thousand armed men) ouerthrewe King
John of France that valiant Prince, who at that battle was accompanied with a
great part of the Nobility of France, and of other Nations, as Dukes, Princes,
Earls, and other great Captains, and had in his Army above threescore
thousand horsemen and footmen, of the which there were above ten thousand men
at arms, and of horsemen of all sorts above thirty thousand; where a little
before the battle, Froissart, and the Chronicles of France.
the Prince with his notable Captains considering the small number that he had
to make head and resist the French King with so huge an host, did take a
ground of some strength and advantage for the guard of the flanckes and back of
his small Army, and placing a great part of his Archers in frunt, in the open
place where the French horsemen and footmen were to enter and give battle, the
Archers with their wonderful volees of arrows (through the great goodness of
God) did that day so wound, The wonderful effect of arrows at the battle of
Poictiers.
kill, and mischief both horses and men, that he overthrew King John of France
with his whole Army, and took him and one of his sons prisoners; and of
Earls, Barons, Knights and Esquiers, to the number of sixteen hundred or
more; besides that, there were slain the Duke of Athens, with so many Earls,
Barons, Knights and Esquiers, that they were numbered to be above seven
hundred, and so many prisoners of all sorts taken by the English and
Gascoignes, that they far exceeded the number of the Princes Army.

The battle of Nauarretta.
The battle also of Nauarretta in Spain fought by the same Prince Edward in
favor of Don Pedro el cruel, against Don Henry of Castil, may testify the
wonderful effect of Archers, where there were above a hundred thousand
Spaniardes, Frenchmen, Portugueses, Genoueses Crossebowers and Mores, both
horsemen and footmen overthrown in that battle.

The French Chronicles.
The famous victory and battle of Agincourt, also of later years fought by
king Henry the fifth against the whole power of France, does evidently show
the most excellent effects and execution of Archers, where with the grace of
God and incredible volees of arrows, the French kings army was ouerthrown, The
notable effect of Archers at the battle of Agincourt.
which consisted of above forty thousand horsemen and footmen, of the which
there were ten thousand men at arms, all Knights, Esquiers and Gentlemen;
whereas king Henry's Army did consist but of ten thousand Archers, fifteen
hundred Lances, and two thousand footmen of other weapons. In which battle
were slain the Dukes of Lorain, of Brabant, of Alincon and Bar, with a great
number of Earls, Barons, Knights and Esquires; besides that, there were taken
prisoners, the Dukes of Orleans and Bourbon, with many other Earls, Barons and
Knights.

The battle of Herrings also (so called by the French Chronicles) fought in
king Henry the sixts time near unto a village in France called Rouuray, The
marvelous effect of Archers at the battle of Herringes.
not far from Orleans, does evidently show the great excellency of Archerie
against all other sorts of weapons; in which battle Sir John Fastolf, with
other brave English Captains by the grace of God and terrible shot of the
Archers, ouerthrewe the bastard of Orleans, the Lord high Constable of
Scotland, the Count of Clermount, with many other Captains of great accoumpt
and their whole Army of Frenchmen and Scots, in the which there were a great
number of French Harquebuziers and Crossebowers, which against the Archers
wrought no effect.

I might also allege for the excellency of Archers the most wonderful
victory won by king Richard the first in the holy land, many years before
any of these battles before mentioned; where, being General of the
Christian Army, by the grace of God, and wonderful effect of his English
Archers, he in a most famous battle ouerthrewe that brave Saladin, Souldan of
Egypt, with his notable milicia of Mamelucks (by many called Sarasins) and all
the rest of his Army, which did consist of an innumerable number of horsemen
and footmen Turks and Arabians. But for breuities sake, I will omit the
particularities of that most famous battle, and of many other great victories
that I could allege for proof of the incredible effects of our English
Archers in battles: And will now come to answer certain other frivolous
objections of smaller moment than these that I have already by such notable
examples and experiences of great battles and victories answered.

Some of our such men of war (because by common and modern experience, no
number of Mosquettiers nor Harquebuziers in the plain fields, without succors
of some other weapon or ground of advantage, are able to abide the charge of
half so many Lances or Stradiots in number as they are, without being
overthrown and broken) do therefore think and commonly report, Another
objection and opinion against Archers answered.
that with a very small number of horsemen they will break a far greater
number of Archers: by which their opinions and reports, it seems that as they
are utterly ignorant, and without any experience of the effects of Archers,
so are they as ignorant of all notable histories, or else according to the new
fashion, that they do believe nothing but that which they themselves have
seen, which in troth appears to be very little.

For answer whereunto (according to the testimony of the French Chronicles) I
say, that in King Henry the sixts time, John Lord of Bellay, being accompanied
with two hundred Lances at the least, and taking his way to a town called
Man's, met by chance with an English Captain, called Berry, that had to the
number of fourscore Archers, who perceiving the French men, A wonderful
effect of a few Archers.
presently reduced his men into a hearse, turning their backs to a hedge,
because the Lances might not charge them in back, but only in frunt, and so
giving their volees of arrows at the French Lances charging, did so wound and
kill their horses, that they ouerthrewe them, and slew and took diverse of
them prisoners.

And within a while after a French Captain of the country of Main, called
Guion du Coing, departed from a town called Sable, accompanied with six score
Lances to seek his adventure, The French Chronicles.
where he might find any English men in the fields, who happened to meet with
an English Knight called Sir William (...) betwixt Man's and Alincon, that had
in his company sixteen or twenty Archers on horseback, who perceiving so
many French Lances, alighted on foot, and reducing themselves into form in
a broad high way, where the Lances could not charge them but in frunt, A
merueilous effect wrought by a small number of Archers.
they put their horses from them, and the French Lances charging them, the
volees of arrows of those few Archers wrought such notable effect against the
French horsemen, that they brake and overthrew them, in such sort, that there
were diverse of the French slain and taken prisoners.

And in our time king Henry the eight being at the siege of Terouenne and a
conuoy of munitions and victuals being at that time to go from Guiens toward
Terouenne, Martin du Bellay.
all the French Captains of Picardy and Vermandois having intelligence
thereof, did assemble all their men at arms and Lances of those provinces,
with some number of shot also both Harquebuziers and Crossebowers, and attended
the English conuoy in ambush more than a league beyond the town of Ard,
toward Terouenne, where encountering with the English light horsemen auant
courirs, they did overthrow them, which being perceived by the English
Captains of the conuoy, they presently reduced their carriages into a
convenient form, and placing convenient numbers of Archers in the two open
places of the carriages before and behind, and forcing all other places betwixt
carriages and carriages with Archers, where the French Lances might have any
entrance; after a long fight and many charges by the men at arms of France and
their shot given, the terrible effect of the volees of arrows was such, that a
great number of their horses were wounded or slain, A notable effect of Archers
and one of their chief Captains, called Monsieur de Plessis lifting up his
sword to strike, was with an arrowe shot in at the arm hole through his gusset
of maile, and there slain, with many other men at arms, and French Gentlemen
of good account: In such sort, that the French, which did far exceed the
English in number, were that day repulsed and overthrown by the excellency of
Archers. And at this action there is an old English Gentleman yet alive, whose
name is Master Caudwell that was there present. And these examples aforesaid,
are sufficient (I think) to convince and confound the vain opinions and
objections before mentioned.

Now, if the effect of volees of arrows be so terrible both against horsemen
and footmen armed (as I have before declared by so many reasons and examples)
what then are the volees of arrows able to perform against Mosquettiers and
Harquebuziers, that are in a manner altogether disarmed, whose weapons of fire
in the field, do rather terrify and make afraid yonglings and nouices of
war, with smoke and noise, than with any often killing, hurting, or
wounding them with bullets, whereof not only old soldiers, but horses also
that are a little used to their fire, crackes and smoke, are not any thing
amazed nor afraid; but three or four volees of arrows lighting amongst any
number of Mosquettiers or Harquebuziers (how old and brave soldiers soever they
be) will so amaze and terrify them, that they shall fail to charge their
pieces, to put touch powder into their pannes, and their matches into their
serpentines. Besides that, they will either wound, kill, or mischief them, in
such sort as happy those that with three or four arrows in their bodies,
faces, arms or legs, throwing down their Harquebuzes and Mosquets, can
escape out of the terror and danger of the volees of arrows. For confirmation
whereof, there be diverse modern examples, with very honorable testimony of
such as are yet living, very honorable by birth and parentage, as also by
titles of honor and worthiness, of the which that noble Gentleman Ambrose Earl
of Warwick is one, Ambrose Earl of Warwicks experience of Archers, penned
with his own hand.
that accompanied the Duke of Northumberland his father (then Earl of
Warwick) a man of great valor and sufficiency for the governing and
conducting of an Army, who in the year 1548. was sent by King Edward the
sixth, as his Lieutenant general with an Army of horsemen and footmen, to
suppress the rebellion of Ket in Norffolke, who at that time lay encamped with
a great power of notorious and hardy rebels by the City of Norwich, upon a
high hill called Mount Surrey, to the which City the Duke with his Army being
come, he with great order did encampe and lodge himself and his Army on the
other side of the city and river, and the next day he entered the town and
brought in four and twenty field pieces, to the chief charge whereof he
appointed the Coronell Courpenick an Alman and a great soldier, with his
regiment of Almans, which was twelve hundred, the most of them brave shot, and
all old soldiers, with diverse other English bands and valiant Captains of our
own nation for the guard of the same; but before they could thoroughly entrench
themselves, those furious Rebels contrary to all expectation, descended down
their hill with such a fury of shot of arrows, being al Bowmen, Swords and
Bills, that they gave such a terror and fear to our people both strangers and
English, as they were feign to run away with the loss of the Ordinance, and
slaughter of a great sort of soldiers, and before the Duke could make head
against them, they had recovered eighteen field pieces, and carried them up to
their hill even with very force of men. And within two or three days after,
those gallants did not let to abide the battle against the Duke and his whole
Army in the plain field, where the battle was so manfully fought on both
sides, that it could be hardly judged by the best soldiers that were there,
which side was like to prevail, but in the end, God giving the victory, it
was seen by that battle that arrows were a most noble weapon. And whereas
the Duke at his first assembling and forming of his Army, had changed many
Archers into Harquebuziers (because he had no opinion of the Long Bow) he
after that victory and suppression of the Rebels, upon the experience that he
in those actions had of the danger and terror of arrows, (his own horse
being wounded under him at that battle with three or four arrows, whereof
he died) did both then and many times after openly protest his error before
Count Malatesta Baglion, an ancient and a noble soldier Italian, and other
great Captains Italians and Almans, saying, that from that time forward he
would hold the Bow to be the only weapon of the world, and so did all the
notable Captains both English and strangers affirm the same. And this I have
set down almost verbatim, from the report of the aforesaid Ambrose Earl of
Warwick that now is, who was present at that action, and had his horse also
wounded under him with two or three arrows.

In the same year of the reign of King Edward the sixth also, and in the same
summer, Sir John Russel knight, Lord privy seal, that was after Earl of
Bedford, being sent by the King as his Lieutenant general with a great power
both of horsemen and footmen, against the Rebels of the West parts,
accompanied with the Lord Gray of Wilton, Sir William Herbert, (after Earl of
Penbrooke) the Lord of Hunsdon that now is, with many others both Knights and
Esquiers of great worship, and coming to certain skirmishes and encounters
with the Rebels, the Archers of the Rebels did so behave themselves with
their volees of arrows against diverse old bands Harquebuziers Italians and
Spaniards, that they drove the^ from all their strengths, as from bancks,
ditches, hedges, and other advantages of ground, to the great mischief of
many of those strangers. And of these great effects of Archers against
Harquebuziers, The Lord of Hunsdons experience of Archers.
I have heard the Lord (...) aforesaid (who was there an eye witness) very
notably report. Besides that, many years past I have heard Captain Spinola
an Italian (who was a very brave soldier, Captain Spinolas opinion and
experience of Archers.
and wounded with arrows in those services and actions, give singular
commendation of the Archerie of England.

To the like effect and singular commendation of Archers, I have also heard the
aforesaid Earl of Warwick diverse times further report, This was also penned
by Ambrose Earl of Warwick himself.
that in the year 1562. he being at Newhauen in Normandy Lieutenant general
for the Queen that now is, the notable and great Captain Chastillon Admiral
of France (being then at the siege of Caen in Normandy, and at that time
favored by the Queen of England) did send to the Earl for a succor of some
English bands, of the which he desired that the most might be Archers. But the
Earl at that time having no Archers on that side the sea, sent unto him a
supply of six hundred brave Harquebuziers, with some armed men also, which he
very thankfully received, but therewithal signified unto the Earl that he had
rather have had two hundred Archers, The Admiral Chastillons opinion of
Archers.
and that he would have performed greater service with that small number of
Bows, than with all those brave Harquebuziers. And this message was sent from
that great Captain to the Earl by Sir Francis Somserset, Sir Nicholas
Throgmorton, and Sir William Pelham.

And shortly after, that notable Coronel Alman the Reingraue (who had served
many years in France) accompanied with many other brave Captains both
French and Almans, with a great power both of horsemen and footmen, coming
down and encamping not far from Newhauen, there happened a great skirmish
betwixt certain English bands of Newhauen, and the French and Alman companies,
which continued very hot, with many volees of Harquebuze shot, and new
supplies on every side, but at the length the French and Almans exceeding the
English far in multitude, forced them to retire with disorder even to the
very gates of Newhauen; during which action, it happened that fourscore tall
Archers (Hamshire men) did at that time land in the Haven, who taking their
Bows and sheafes of arrows, with their other furniture, did presently march
without any tarriance through the town into the field where the skirmish was;
upon whose coming, the English bands that a little before were forced by the
often charges and great multitude of the shot of their Enemies, to retire even
to the very town-ditches and gates, taking courage a fresh, they and the
Bowmen entered again into skirmish with the Almans and French, where the
fourscore Archers did behave themselves so notably against the enemies with
their volees of arrows, that with the brave and valiant charges which they and
the rest of the English bands gave upon their enemies, but chiefly with the
excellency of the Archers, they forced them not only to retire, but to turn
their backs: in such sort, as putting a great number of them to the sword,
they became masters of the field. Upon which notable effect of those few
Archers, as also upon diverse others that the Reingraue had before time seen in
serving against the English, he shortly after upon the return of a message
that had been sent unto him by the Earl of Warwick (Sir Edward Horsey being
the messenger) did most highly commend the notable effects, that he long before
in diverse services had seen performed by the English Archers against both
horsemen and footmen: and said also, that long before that time he knew by
experience, that great numbers of English Archers were able to perform very
great matters in the field; but that so small a number of Bowmen as were in
that last great conflict, should be able with their arrows to do so great
mischief against his old bands of Almans, French and Gascoignes, The
Reingraues opinion of Archers.
he would not have believed, if he himself had not seen it. And therefore did
with great reason and experience protest and acknowledge, the Long-bowes of
England to be the most excellent weapons for the field that were used by any
Nation in Christendom, and said that the Queen of England had great cause so
to esteem and account of them. And to this effect I have diverse times heard
the Earl of Warwick himself very notably report.

Sir James Crofts experience of Archers.
I have also heard Sir James Croft, that honorable and most sufficient
Gentleman, that has served diverse of our Princes in many great and principal
offices and charges Military, both in England, France, Scotland and Ireland,
declare very notable effects, which he himself has seen by our Archers in
diverse actions performed. The particularities whereof, as also his opinion
concerning the excellency of that weapon, I remit to his own report.

Now, notwithstanding all these notable experiences and examples of the
excellent effects of Archers against Harquebuziers; our such men of war have
used to allege, that neither the Harquebuzes were so good, nor yet the
Harquebuziers so skillful in those days, as now their Caliuerers are:
whereunto it may be answered with great reason and experience of diverse
ancient Captains both Italians and Spaniards, Harquebuziers were as maniable
and of as good form fifty or threescore years past, as now they are.
that I have known (of the which some are yet living) that not only the
Harquebuzes which the Italians and Spaniards did use fifty or three score
years past were as maniable, and of as good form as now they are, but also
that the Harquebuziers were as skillful and perfect with that kind of weapon,
as they are now in these our days. Harquebuziers Italians and Spaniards were
as skillful fifty or threescore years past, as now they are.
And that has manifestly appeared by the infinite numbers of great skirmishes
that have bin very effectually performed with Harquebuze shot in the Emperor
Charles, and the French Kings wars in Italy, France, the Low Countries, and
Burgundy, as also in Barbary against the Turks and Mores, and in the wars
of Germany, betwixt the said Emperor and the Duke of Saxony, and other
Reystates and Princes of Germany. Which opinions aforesaid misconceiued, and
very ignorantly alleged by our such men of war, to the disabling of the
Harquebuziers of other Nations in times past, and enhabling their Caliuerers of
this time, thereby to detract the excellent effects of our Long-bowes, does
further manifest their lack of sufficiency to judge of the exercises and use
of those weapons of fire, not only of times past, but also of this present
time, and that has appeared in diverse of their services of the Low Countries,
as I have heard certain of our old Captains of good experience affirm, that
have seen some of their unskillful services in those parts; and was also
confirmed by the fained skirmish that some of their Captains, Officers, and
old bands of Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers of the Low Countries of their own
training, did the last summer most disorderly perform before my Lord
Treasurer at Tilburie, where they discharged one in another neck, and having
discharged their pieces, did run out of their troops and stand still, and
charge their pieces again, and returning to give new volees, did discharge
their pieces at their fellows hammes, legs and backs, running together
thick and threefold so disorderly, that it was a scorn to behold them: and
this in the opinion of many Gentlemen, and some old Captains of good service
and experience that were there present and beheld the same, who concluded the
insufficiency of our such men of war of the Low Countries, by the lack of
skill, imperfections, and insufficiencies of their trained soldiers, according
to the old proverb; In discipulis magister videtur, like masters like men.
Which aforesaid action at Tilburie, does not only make manifest that our such
old soldiers Harquebuziers are now as unskillful, as the new Soldiers Vison^os
Spaniards of two months pay were many years past, but if that any foreign
enemy with such unskillful Harquebuziers as they were, should assail a
quarter of the like number of our Archers, they should not be able to abide two
volees of arrows, without casting away their pieces and turning their backs.

And now having in this my discourse made manifest the excellency of our
Long-bowes and Archers, by many reasons and examples, ancient and modern, both
against well horsed and armed Lances, as also Harquebuziers, which I think by
all reason may suffice to convince and confound all the ignorant opinions and
frivolous objections of our such men of war, as also to induce all such as
are of any right consideration and judgment, to acknowledge the sufficiency
and excellency of that weapon; and that it is further evident by all foreign
Histories that have made any mention of the differences of Bows, used by many
Nations, as also by such as have travailed in many parts of Europe, Our English
Archers and Bows are the most excellent of all other Nations.
Affricke, or Asia, that our English Bows, arrows and Archers do exceed and
excel al other Bows used by all foreign Nations not only in substance and
strength, but also in the length and bigness of the arrows: I will now further
show the wonderful effects that has been wrought by diverse sorts of foreign
Bows, as Gothian, Parthian, Arabian, Turkish, and Tartarian, all which (as
aforesaid) are inferior unto ours: that by such notable effects by the^
performed, all such as are of sound judgment, not carried with toys, fancies
and new fashions, may very well know, that God has given such exceeding and
excellent effects unto that weapon, that of all others it has ever been, and
yet may be justly accounted the chief weapon of battles and conquests.

I think it is most manifest by all Histories, that have written of puissant
and conquering Nations, that in many and diverse ages under their great and
notable Captains, have given themselves to enlarge their dominions, or with
force to possess the habitations of other foreign people, that they have
erected some kind of milicia and discipline military, to atchieue and
perform the same. And as the best kinds of weapons in the hands of well
disciplinated, obedient and exercised soldiers, is a principal part of a
milicia, Al conquering Nations have used the Bow as their chief weapon.
to atchieue victories; so I think it is most evident, that all those
conquering Nations have made chief choice of the Bow, as of the most
excellent kind of weapon for victories and conquests.

And although they have not used in their armies that weapon alone, but other
weapons also incorporated with them, yet it is most manifest, that the greatest
number of such mighty armies have consisted more of Archers either on
horseback or on foot, than of any other sorts of weapons, and by their
excellent effects chiefly, have been achieved most notable and wonderful
victories; as for example: Were not diverse Emperors and great Captains Romans
with puissant armies many times inuading the Parthians and Persians, All great
conquests, next unto God, achieved chiefly with the force of Arrows.
sometimes overthrown, and many times repulsed by them, and that chiefly by
their Archers? Were not Crassus and Cassius with a mighty army which did
consist of many legions of old soldiers Romans, overthrown and vanquished
in the plain fields with the force of the Parthian arrows? And was not
Valerian the Emperor overthrown and taken prisoner, in a great battle by
the Persians, and that chiefly by the great effect of their arrows? Besides
all which it is most evident by diverse Histories, that neither the notable
Consulls of the ancient Romans, nor yet after them the Emperors Romans with
their conquering milicia were ever able to conquer the Parthians and Persians,
defending themselves chiefly with that excellent weapon of Archerie on
horseback.

But now to speak of four mighty and conquering Nations, that of later
years, but in diverse ages, have vanquished and subdued diverse great parts of
the world. It does appear by many Histories, that the Goths, Vandalls, Alans,
and other septentrionall Nations, under their notable Princes, and great
Captains, making war at diverse times upon the Emperor Romans, The Goths,
Vandalles, and other Septentrionall Nations did atchiue all their victories
chiefly with their Bows.
and inuading Greece, did besiege the imperial city of Constantinople, and
did spoil the Panonias, now called Hungary, and Austria, with Illyria,
Dalmatia, and many other provinces. Also they invaded and wasted Italy, sacked
the most ancient and famous city of Rome, with a great number of other
Cities. And in diverse notable battles wounded and killed many great
Captains, and some Emperors and their Generals with their arrows. After
which they passed through and spoiled France, invaded and conquered Spain, and
carried their armies to the straights of Hercules, now called Gibraltar. Also
the same Vandalls and Alans passed the straights, and invaded Affrike, and
conquered in a manner all the Leuant sea coasts of the same now called Barbary.
And it is most evident, that they did perform and atchieue al those their
battles, victories and conquests, more with the effect of their Archers and
Bows, than with all the rest of their weapons.

And not many years after that, The Arabians with great numbers of archers on
horseback did atchieue wonderful victories and conquests.
the Arabians (a nation before that time little spoken of) under their false
Prophet Mahomet, and his successors Halifas, with infinite numbers of Arabian
Bowmen on horseback, and some numbers of Zagaias (which are double headed
Lances) did invade the dominions of the Empire of Constantinople. And with
those weapons chiefly did conquer al Mesopotamia, Suria, Armenia, and Persia.
Also, they did win Jerusalem and many other Cities and Provinces, and brought
the Emperor Heraclius and some other of his successors to be tributaries unto
them. And in diverse great battles with their arrows did wound and take some
Emperors and many of their Generals, prisoners.

Also, they invaded Affrike, conquered Egypt, and subdued all Barbary even to
the very Ocean sea. And shortly after passing over the straights of Gibraltar
into Spain, and finding the Goths and Vandalls possessours of the same,
through the exacting and tyrannical government of their two last kings
Goths, Vitissa and Don Rodrigo, brought from all their ancient exercises
military and use of their Bows, they did conquer the kingdom even to the
very mountains Perineos, and achieved many other notable victories and
conquests in Italy, Greece, Sicilie, Candia, and other Islands of the
Archipelago, and all those chiefly, by the wonderful effects of their
Arabian Bows.

The Arabians forgetting their Art military, and use of their Bows were
conquered by the Turks.
After all which notable conquests achieved by the Arabia^s under their
Halifas, and that they through long peace and some civil dissension, were now
grown into ambition, envy and covetousness, and to neglect their ancient
discipline military and use of their Bows, the Turks (a new Nation at that
time in a manner unknown) coming at the first but with five thousand, all
Archers, from beyond the mountains of Caucasus to the aid of Mahomet, then
King of Persia, under their brave Captain Tanglaropice Mucaleto, did perform
great services unto the Persians. And after upon lack of pay, and some other
injuries unto them by the Persians offered, retiring themselves to the
mountains, they did most valiantly defend themselves, until that new aides and
great numbers of Archers and Aljauas Turks came to join with them. At which
time inuading the Persians, and overthrowing and killing their King in
battle, they conquered all Persia; The Turks with great numbers of Archers
did atchieue many great victories and conquests.
and after inuading Armenia did vanquish and kill the Halifa of ^aldac, and did
subdue in a manner all the Dominions that Mahomet that false prophet, and his
successors Halifas had in certain hundreds of years before conquered in
Asia. And all those conquests, with many battles and victories he and his
Turks achieved chiefly with the wonderful effects of their Bows, of which
weapon their milicia did principally consist. After whose time, the Soldans his
successors, and Otoman the first Emperor of the Turks, and his successors
did win many battles and victories against the Emperors of Constantinople,
chiefly with the advantage of that weapon.

And it is further apparent by diverse Histories, that the Tartars inhabiting
toward the North and Northeast seas of Asia, being reduced into a discipline
military under diverse of their Princes and Captains, as Hocata Cham, The
Tartars with innumerable numbers of Archers on horseback, did atchieue
wonderful victories and conquests.
Gabo Sabada, and Haloon, did with their innumerable numbers of Archers, and
Aljauas on horseback, not only subdue all the East parts of Asia, even to
the very Ocean seas, but did in diverse ages invade the West parts of Asia,
vanquishing and overthrowing in many battles diverse Soldans with their great
armies of Turks, and spoiled and made tributarie unto them Parthia, Persia,
Media, Armenia, Mesopotamia, and Suria.

And last of all Tamberlan, that valiant Emperor of the Tartars inuading Asia
minor, and coming to battle with Bayezet, at that time Emperor of the
Turks did overthrow and vanquish him and his mighty army and took him
prisoner. Which battle and victory he achieved by reason that his army of
Tartars did far exceed the Turks in numbers of Archers. Which most
excellent effects of Archers before mentioned, was the very cause that moved
Amurat (the second of that name) Emperor of the Turks, within few years
after to institute for the guard of his person that milicia of the Ianissaries
on foot, who being Christian men's children renied, and taught from their youth
the exercise of the Bow, The institution of the Ianissaries on foot is all
Archers.
as also of later years of the harquebuze, do become most excellent in both
kinds of weapons; so as when the Turk does send any numbers of them under his
Basshas to the besieging of any Cities, or towns, they al use to take with them
both their Bows, and their Harquebuzes; Their Harquebuzes to use in trenches
against places fortified, and their Bows for services of the field. Howbeit,
whenever the Turk in person with an imperial army does invade any Prince
or Nation, he has always with him twelve or fourteen thousand Ianissaries
on foot with their Bows and cemitories without any Harquebuzes, for his last
and most assured refuge, and guard of his person: So as it is most evident that
the Basshas, Bellarbies, and Senjaques of the Turks (of the which there be so
many notable and excellent Captains able to govern, conduct and command
great and mighty Armies, as all the West parts of Christendom have not so
many, nor the like) who knowing all the effects of weapons of fire, as well as
the best men of war of Christendom, do by all reason military prefer
their Bows before their Harquebuzes for all battles, and great encounters in
the field: And even so likewise two other most puissaunt and mighty Empires of
Asia and conquering Nations, the one of the Tartars, and the other of the
Persians, Parthians, and Medians under the Sophie, which Empires and Nations
although they have known and had the use of weapons of fire long before they
were known in Europe, The invention of artillery, powder, shot, and small
pieces of fire was not first in Germany (as some do write and tell) but they
were first invented, in the kingdom of Cataia, and in use in diverse parts of
Asia above 800. years past: and that I have read, and also heard reported in
Spain by two Ambassadors, the one of Venice, and the other of Portingall.
yet have they always, and do still greatly prefer their Archers and Bows
on horseback for battles and victories, before their weapons of fire.

And now as I have before in diverse parts of these discourses briefly set
down many notable effects of our English Archers, against both horsemen and
footmen of all sorts of weapons, with such and so many notable battles and
victories achieved by our English nation, chiefly (next unto God) by the
excellency of our said Archers; And that I have last of all briefly declared
the wonderful victories and conquests in diverse ages achieved by four so
notable Nations, and that most of all by the notable effects of their Bows, (I
mean the Goths, Vandals, and other such septentrionall people, their
companions and fellows in arms, as also the Arabians, the Turks and
Tartars): So I might further with the testimony of many notable histories, and
partly by the very Bible it self, (if it were not to avoid prolixitie) show
and prove, that all the notable and famous Nations of Europe, Afric and
Asia, that have since the beginning of the world, Some peradventure will say,
that the Spaniards without Long bows, but with Cros-bowes, Harquebuze shot,
and other weapons, have conquered a great part of the west Indies: whereunto it
is to be answered, that those Indians were simple people, that went naked, and
had no use of iron nor steel.
even until this present time, achieved infinite victories and conquests,
have achieved the same by the wonderful effects of Bows, as by the weapon of
all others that God has put into the hearts of men, to devise and use
sometimes to defend themselves withal against foraine Nations, that have
unjustly assailed them; and sometimes to invade, and by battles and
victories to chasten and punish other such Nations, as in former times had had
the perfect use of the same; and yet after in process of time, by the
permission of God for their sins, had neglected and forgotten the use
thereof, that thereby they might receive the punishment of God, by the well
exercised hands in those weapons of other warlike Nations, that were either
more in the favor of God, or else appointed by him as instruments, with blood
to chasten and punish such transgressors. Diverse of the which examples, because
I have in my Proeme of these discourses briefly declared, I think it would be
holden for superfluous to rehearse, and digress into such innumerable examples
of the excellency and merueilous effects that have been in all ages, wrought
by infinite Nations with that most miraculous weapon; and therefore will reduce
my self, and proceed to the proouing and concluding, that although skillful
Harquebuziers and Mosquettiers with their weapons of fire, be very excellent
in their convenient and due times and places (as I have in diverse parts of this
discourse particularly declared) yet that for battles and victories in the
field, they are no ways co^parable to our English Archers and Bows.

And now again to return to the answering of other objections of our such men
of war, who (notwithstanding so many reasons and examples by me before
alleged in due and just commendation of Archers) have not been ashamed many
times most phantastically to report, An opinion contrary to all reason and
common experience.
that our arrows will not wound men through single buffe Ierkins, nor scarce
through their ordinary clothes: which ignorant and fond speeches were more
seemly to come out of the mouths of nouices and yonglings that never saw
any thing, than from such as professing arms, ought to speak with
consideration, reason and judgment. And therefore it is greatly to be
pitied, that men of so great ignorance and small understanding in affairs and
actions of war, are grown to such an ouerweening in their own conceits,
that in their fond bablings they do make so light of those our weapons, that
the great Captains of France, and other Nations in King Edward the thirds
time, and other kings times, did by the experience of their dangers and
mischiefs so greatly redoubt, that they caused their footmen (although they
were as well armed for the defense of their bodies and heads, as footmen now a
days are) to carry pauoises of seven foot long, and a foot and a half, or
two foot broad, with little holes toward the upper end armed with steel, for
them to look through; which pauoises did cover their faces, and al other
disarmed parts even down to their toes. And that their men at arms also
(because our arrows were so terrible in the sights of their horses, and that
they did wound them in the eyes and legs, and every bare and disarmed place,
which made them run athwart the one the other, as is before declared) did
oftentimes forsake their horses, and reducing themselves into esquadron, came
upon our Archers with their lances and swords, the beuers of their helmets
down, and armed cap a pie, as it does appear by diverse great encounters
mentioned in Froissart, and other histories.

But because the wonderful effects and mischief of arrows, may further
appear to be far different from the dreams and reports of our such
fantastical men of war, I will now of many Emperors, Kings, and great
Captains that have been wounded and killed foreign Archers and arrows,
inferior unto ours, allege a few examples to avoid prolixitie, beginning
first with some testimony out of the Bible.

Examples out of the scripture of diverse kings that have bin wounded and slain
with arrows.
Was not Saul (the first King of the Jews, and a valiant Prince) in his last
battle fought with the Amalakites, afraid of the volees of their arrows,
and himself wounded with an arrowe? And was not Ioram King of Israel slain by
Iehu his successor with the shot of an arrowe, that struck him into the body
and through the heart? And was not Achab also king of Israel, in a battle
against the Sirians, overthrown and wounded with an arrowe, that struck him
into the body between the joints of his armor, of the which wound he that
night died? Examples out of notable histories of many Emperors, Kings, and
great Captains wounded and slain with arrows.


Besides that, it is further manifest by many other notable histories, that
Alexander the great, that most mighty Conqueror, besieging the City of Gaza
in Siria, was himself sore wounded through the habergin into the shoulder with
an arrowe, in such sort, that he was by that wound in great danger, and his
whole Army thereat greatly amazed. Vespasian also that famous and excellent
Emperor, was wounded himself with an arrow in a great encounter and conflict,
that he had against the Jews by the city of Iorpata in Judah. The Emperor
Decius also was overthrown and slain in a battle against the Goths; and
Decius Caesar his son stricken dead with the shot of arrows. The Emperor
Valens also was overthrown in a great battle by the Goths, and himself sore
wounded with an arrowe. Don Alfonso also King of Leon in Spain, and Don Sancho
King of Aragon were (although at diverse times, and in diverse places) wounded
and slain by the Arabians and Mores with arrows. Manuel also Emperor of
Constantinople, was overthrown in a great battle against the Sultan of
Iconio, and himself wounded with arrows, notwithstanding his armor and
target, in the which he had thirty arrows sticking. Orcan also son unto
Otoman and second Emperor of the Turks, was overthrown, wounded and slain
with arrows, in a merueilous great battle fought betwixt him, his Turks and
the Tartars. And finally, Mahomet the second of that name Emperor of the
Turks, that wonderful Conqueror, that did so prosper in all battles, and
besiegings of towns, that he wan the two Empires of Constantinople, and
Trepizonda, and killed the Emperor Constantine Dragon Paleolego, as also the
Emperor of Trepizonda, called Colojani, and besides conquered ten Kingdoms of
Christians, and slew four Kings, and all this chiefly by his notable milicia
of Archers, yet notwithstanding all those his great victories and conquests, in
a great battle fought betwixt him and that famous Vayuod Iuan Huniades
Coruino, he was himself wounded with an arrowe, and his Turks thereat so
wonderfully amazed, that thereupon he and they were by the Christians
vanquished, and compelled with great disorder, dishonor, and loss of his
people to retire to Constantinople. Which notable examples of wounding, and
killing of Emperors, Kings, and great Captains by foraine Archers, and
arrows inferior unto ours, may very well show the ouerweening, and lack of
consideration and judgment of our such men of war, that have sought by their
vain and ignorant speeches and words, to deface the force, violence, and
wonderful effects of our English Archers and arrows, contrary to infinite
examples and notable histories in diverse languages, and experiences of many
conquering Nations, and most excellent Captains both ancient, and also of
this age.

And now having in this my discourse endeavored my self by many reasons and
examples, to make manifest how our such men of war have mistaken the use and
effects of diverse sorts of weapons out of their due times and places, with
diverse other their errors Military, contrary to the modern opinions and use
of diverse foreign warlike Nations, as also that I have (according to my first
proposition) particularly set down the most of the perfections and
imperfections of Mosquettiers and Harquebuziers, and of their weapons, with the
perfections and imperfections of Archers and their Bows, with many reasons
and examples also to show and prove, that the ancient effects of our Archers
and arrows, are no ways decayed nor blemished by the effects of Harquebuziers
and Mosquettiers, but that they do in the field far exceed and excel the
effects of all weapons of fire maniable, and further, that no horsemen nor
footmen are able to abide the terror and danger of the volees of our arrows,
with many examples of battles, victories, and conquests, of great encounters
and skirmishes, of wounding and killing of mighty Emperors, Kings, and great
Captains with arrows; I now come to conclude, that our Archers, being yet so
excellent as they are, although in number not so many as they were in times
past, may (being well ordered) work as great or greater effects in the field,
The conclusion of this discourse.
than they did in former ages; considering that al Nations of the occidentall
parts of Christendom both horsemen and footmen, do now use to wear fewer
pieces of armor to cover and defend their bodies, than they did a hundred, two
hundred, or three hundred years past, when our Archers wrought so wonderful
effects, not only against the men at Arms of France, and other well armed
Nations, but also against the shot and volees of armed Crosse-bowers; who as
they were very skillful with that weapon in those days; so were they no ways
inferior to the shot of Mosquettiers and Harquebuziers of these our days.

A brief comparison betwixt Reisters, Carabins, or Argolettiers, so much used
in foreign parts in these our days; and Crosse-bowers and Archers on
horseback, which were used by the English, and diverse other Nations many
years past: With mine opinion also, concerning which of those weapons are of
greatest effect for services in the field.
Diverse of our English Captains and Gentlemen that have served in the (...)
wars of the Low Countries, or peradventure some time in the civil wars of
France, do so praise and magnify the shot of Carabins or Argolettiers (as they
term them) and of Reisters, which are Pistollettiers, that they will not admit
any shot on horseback to be comparable unto them, imitating therein diverse
foreign Nations, that in these days do use those weapons on horseback. In
which their opinions I do not mean to touch them with any blame, because I do
not remember any Nation in these West parts of Christendom, that do use at
this present any other. Howbeit, when I come to consider of such shot on
horseback as has been used in times past, which are the Long-Bowe and the
Crosse-bowe, and that there be some principal Gentlemen and Captains of
diverse Nations yet alive, that have seen them used in the field, as namely of
our English, that grave and most experienced Gentleman sir James Crofte; and
that I do compare the vnreadines, imperfections and small effects of the
weapons of fire aforesaid, with the readiness, perfections and great effects
of Crosse-bowes and Long-bowes. I do (in mine opinion) greatly prefer those
two ancient weapons on horseback before the said weapons of fire for all
services in the field. And because it may appear unto such Gentlemen as may
peradventure read this my opinion, how, and in what sort I would have such
Archers and Crosse-bowers to be horsed, armed and weaponed, I will first make
mention thereof, and after briefly proceed to the fortifieng and proving of
mine opinion by diverse reasons.

All the Crosse-bowers on horseback under sufficient conductours well skilled
in that weapon, How Crosse-bowers on horseback should be horsed, armed and
weaponed.
I would they should have Crossebowes of two pound and a half of the best
sort, with crooked gaffles hanging at their strong girdles after the manner of
Germany, that they might on horseback bend their Crossebowes the more easily
and readily, with four and twenty quarrels in a case, well and fitly set at
their saddle pommells, mounted upon good cold geldings of mean size,
themselves armed with good murrians of the Spanish fashion upon their heads,
collars, light and short wasted cuirasses and backs, with sleeves of maile or
chained with maile; or else, that they should be armed with murrians, light and
easy Brigandines, and sleeves chained with maile, with broad short swords by
their sides of not above a yard in length, How Archers on horseback should be
horsed, armed and weaponed.
and short daggers. The Archers on horseback under their Captains or
conductours skilful in Archerie, I would likewise have mounted upon good quiet
geldings of mean size, with deep steel skulles in very narrow brimbd hats,
well stuffed for the easines of their heads; and either iackes of maile,
according to the ancient manner when they were called, Loricati Sagittarij, or
else light and easy brigandines, or at the least Ilet-holed doublets very
easy and well fitted to their bodies, their sleeves chained with maile, with
broad short swords and short daggers, their Bows of good Yeugh, long and well
nocked and backed, and all their strings well whipped, with sheafes of four and
twenty arrows apeece, with shooting gloves and bracers after the manner of
our Archers in times past. And all these both Archers and Crosse-bowers I
would have them to be well practiced, that they might know how to discharge
their arrows and quarrels gallopping upon the hand, and in all other motions
of their horses, and the Crosse-bowers to bend again with great readiness. And
diverse bands being thus horsed, armed, weaponed and exercised, as also
reduced into little bands of fifties under sufficient conductours, and other
Officers skillful in those weapons, should (in mine opinion) be able to
perform greater services in the field either against horsemen or footmen,
Crosse-bowers and Archers on horseback of greater service than weapons of fire
on horseback.
than any of the forenamed weapons of fire on horseback, considering that both
Archers and Crosse-bowers may with their arrows and quarrels very certainly
wound or kill in their points and blancks either horsemen or footmen that are in
esquadron or troop, two or three scores off; and rouing six, seven, or eight
scores, may greatly mischief and annoy the enemy: whereas the Argolettiers
and Pistolettiers are not to work any effect against esquadrons, or troops of
horsemen or footmen above ten or fifteen yards off at the furthest, and if it
be enemy to enemy single, then they are not to discharge their pieces above
three or four yards off, unless they will fail four times before they hit
once, so uncertain are those weapons of fire: the judgment whereof, (because
this mine opinion may seem strange to such as do not know the imperfections
of those weapons of fire on horseback) I refer unto any Captains or
Conductors of those weapons either Italians, Spaniards, or French that have
been used to receive the pay of Emperors or Kings: and if it be of the
Pistolettiers, then to the Reisters themselves. Harquebuzery more uncertain on
horseback than on foot, with the imperfections thereof.
Besides whose judgments, by all reason it may appear, that if the shot of
Harquebuzrie on foot in their distances in the field be so uncertain, as I
have in my former discourse declared, then of necessity it must be a great
deal more uncertain upon horseback, where, by every motion and stirring of
their horses (although they be very quiet) they shall in a manner as often hit
Barnacles flying in the air, as hurt or kill any horses or men, unless they
be very thick and wonderful near. Besides that, the charging of their pieces
on horseback (be it with flaskes, cartages or charges) is so uncertain as
they shall as often spill their powder besides the mouths of their pieces, and
fail of their chargings, as charge the same. And also putting their
touch-powder into the pannes of their pieces, although there be no wind to
disperse the same, yet upon every motion of their horses, they are ready to
power the powder beside their pannes. And if their pieces be Petronells, then
if their stones should happen to break, or not to stand right in their cocks,
whereby they should fail to strike just upon the wheels being fire-lockes, or
upon the hammers or steeles, if they be Snap-hances, or being of match, if
their matches be not good and stiff, and well set in their serpentines or
cocks, they also shall fail in their discharging; besides the difficulty
that they shall find at one time to charge their pieces, to have an eye to
their enemies, and to govern their horses, using also their scowring sticks as
they ought to do: which imperfections of weapons of fire, with many more, in
the experience of all old and skillful soldiors, are the cause that the shot
of them do terrify and scare new soldiors and nouices of war a great deal
more with crackes, smoke and noise, than with any often hurting with the
bullet. All which vnreadinesses, disaduantages and imperfections of
Argolettiers, Carabins, Pistolettiers, or Reisters considered with the
readinesses, advantages and perfections of Archers and Crosse-bowers for all
services in the field. I come to conclude, that Crosse-bowers on horseback
used by many foreign Nations of great antiquity, and that Archers on horseback
used by our ancestors many years past, as also at this present by the
Turks, Tartars, Persians, Arabians, and other mighty Nations, do far
exceed and excel all weapons of fire on horseback.

An exhortation to the Magistrates and Gentlemen of England.
THese discourses which I have handled and set down, with many reasons aledged,
as also with very notable examples and opinions of great captains, and
testimony of most approved histories, concerning the excellency of Archers and
diverse other weapons in their due times and places, with many errors and
abuses military by our such men of war practiced, and in public places
persuaded and taught, I have not taken in hand and performed with any
intention or hope to reduce them from their erroneous opinions martial, or to
persuade them to give credit to any thing by me alleged and proved, because
they are grown to such a selfe-wil and liking of their own opinions or rather
fancies military, that their ouerweening, wilfulnes and presumption do extend
so far, that diverse of the chief of the^ will give no credit to any history
alleged, nor any experience nor example that they hear by their elders
reported, nor yet any thing by diverse reasons proved; but only unto their own
fancies and such few things as they themselves have seen: which does most
evidently argue in them a wonderful arrogancy, and obstinat barbarousnes, and
that they neither have, nor ever will have any understanding in the science
military. For it has bin alwais a principle in the opinion of al great
Captains, as also in all reason and experience, that no man can attain to any
sufficiency and excellency in the art and discipline military, but by three
principal means, that is, by seeing actions of arms and of war performed, by
conference with others to understand the reasons of things in action or already
done, and by the discourses of men of experience, and histories of things in
times past performed and done: as for example; What does it avail any Nobleman
or Gentleman how excellent a wit and courage soever he has, incase he had
seen all the chief and best fortifications that are in Europe, as also many
encampings of armies in camps formed, dislodgings, marchings in diverse forms,
with many battles, skirmishes and great encounters: If he neglecting to
learn and understand the causes of those things which he has seen, has
given himself to dicing, carding, making of love and drunkenness? Or if his
pride, arrogancy and ouerweening, have so possessed him, that he has
disdained to harken or confer with others, that have been able by experience to
instruct and give him the reasons of things by him seen; Many have seen much
in matters military, and do understand but little.
which in truth are the very causes that there are so many Captains, and
Gentlemen of diverse Nations that have been in many camps, and have seen
diverse armies and actions, and yet do understand very little of the Art and
Discipline military.

Now therefore, those our men of war being such as I have before declared, and
that notwithstanding there have been such wonderful opinions conceived here at
home of their sufficiency, that they have been not only compared with the
greatest Captains of this age, but also thought to be the only men of war
of Christendom: certeinlie, it is greatly to be meruailed at how any such
opinion should be conceived of them, considering that they never served in any
imperial or royal wars of Emperors, Kings, nor formed Common wealths within
the continent of Europe, Affricke, nor Asia, where they might attain to any
such knowledge in the Art Military, but only in the disordered and
tumultuarie wars of the Low Countries under the States (where the sovereign
government and commandment has consisted of a broken and uncertain
authority, all things tending (with great disorder and confusion) more to the
spoil, than to any discipline or Martial service) or peradventure some very
little or nothing in the licencious and civil wars of France; in both which
wars for the lack of certain and assured pay for the men of war, as also
rewards for particular and extraordinary deserts and worthiness, it has been
impossible to establish and continue any formed milicia and discipline
Military, No discipline military in civil wars.
whereby either Captains or soldiers should grow to any skill and sufficiency,
but rather to errors and ignorances, as it may very well appear by the
politic and Military discourses of that notable and brave soldier Monsieur
de la Noue, where the imperfections and insufficiencies of such as have
attained to their chief skill in those wars, are very manifestly set
down. To the particularities whereof (because his book is not only extant
in French, but also translated into English) I remit those that are disposed to
see and consider. Besides all which, the wonderful disorders, and lack of
understanding of our such men of war, in all their proceedings and actions
Military have been such, so many, and so great, almost in all matters that they
have taken in hand in the Low Country wars, that not only in the judgment
of all the great Captains Italians, Spaniards, Burgonnions, and other Nations,
that either have known their services, or served against them, but also in the
opinions of some of the wiser sort of the States themselves, they have been
judged to be men of no understanding, nor sufficiency in matters of war,
although it has bin given out and reported far otherwise to their advantage
here at home amongst us, altogether to their merueilous and incredible
commendations and praises: whereupon there has been such credit given to
their fond speeches and ignorant persuasions, by the better sort of our Nation,
that they have not only since our Nation began first to go over to serve as
mercenarie soldiers in the Low Countries under the States, brought in great
numbers of disorders and abuses Military, far different, or rather clean
contrary to the ancient and modern experience, use, and proceedings of all
warlike Nations, but also in a great part defaced, and decayed the account,
use, and exercise of our most excellent weapon the Long-bowe; which in short
time to come (if it be not very speedily provided for by the execution of
such penal statute laws, as have been in times past ordained and established
for the exercise and maintenance of the same) will grow to be forgotten, and
in a manner utterly extinguished; which, if through the negligence of the
better sort of our Nation, imitating and following the simple and ignorant
opinions of our such unskillful men of war, it should come to pass, it does
in mine opinion argue nothing more, than that God has withdrawn his hand, and
all right judgment in matters Military from us, and that in time to come, upon
any great war either offenciue or defenciue, we shall, when it is too late,
repent the same, greatly to the hazard and peril of our Prince, Country and
Nation. The consideration whereof, for the great love that I have always
borne, and do still, according to my duty, The principal causes of writing
these discourses.
bear to the Crown and Realm of England and English Nation, was the first
and principal cause that moved me to take these discourses in hand, to the
intent to advise and persuade (as much as in my power and small ability is)
the Nobility, Magistrates, and better sort of our Nation, with all care and
diligence to revive, and put in execution the ancient statutes provided and
established, for the increase and exercise of the youth of England in Archerie,
that as God of his great goodness has blessed our Nation with a wonderful
aptnes and dexterity in that weapon, The English, of all other Nations the
best Archers.
more than any other Nation that I have seen, heard, or read of throughout the
universal world: so that we may not through the frivolous and vain
persuasions of a few unskillful and ignorant men in these our days, as
unthankful, neglect that great and especial goodness of almighty God, and
singular gift that he has endued us withal: but that we do with all care
and diligence believe, and imitate the great experience of our most worthy
Ancestors, that in diverse ages, with the advantage of that most excellent
weapon, have achieved such and so many wonderful and miraculous victories
against diverse Nations, both Christians and Pagans. As also that we do give
credit to the greatest Captains of our Nation, and diverse other Nations that
have lived in our time, some of the which being yet alive, and of principal
sort and calling, have seen the mighty works and wonderful effects of our
English Archers, and therefore with all right judgment, rejecting all new
fancies and toys, that we do embrace and esteem that singular weapon, to be
the chief and principal of all others for battles, victories and conquests.

And now to make an end, I do again (as I did in the beginning of my
discourse) notify that mine intention has no ways extended by any thing in
my discourses contained, No honorable nor worthy minded men any ways
intended to be touched in this discourse.
to touch the reputation or honor of any Noblemen, nor Gentlemen of noble or
worshipful houses, nor yet any others of worthy minds that have entered into
those Low Country services, rather to win reputation, knowledge and honor,
than for any hope or desire of spoil, or greedy gain, but only such of our
men of war, as neglecting and contemning all true honor and discipline
Military, have brought in amongst us a most shameful and detestable art and
discipline of carowsing and drunkenness, turning all matters Military to their
own profit and gain, neglecting to love and to win the love of their soldiers
under their governments and charges, making in a manner no account of them, nor
of their lives; in such sort, as by their evil conduction, staruing and
consuming great numbers and many thousands of our most brave English people, as
also by their infinite other disorders, they have made a far greater war
upon the Crown and Realm of England and English Nation, than any ways upon
the enemies of our Country.

Honor and gloria in excelsis, Deo, omnipotenti, sempiterno, and
incomprehensibili. Amen.
