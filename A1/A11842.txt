burden and commodities, with the manner of their fight, and names of men of

LONDON Printed by R. B. for William Barley and are to be sold at his shop in
Gracious street. 1592.

RIght-woorshipfull, for that at my being at London diverse and sundry reports
passed, touching the taking of the great Carricke called the Mother of God
lately arriuinge at Dartmouth in the West, where I now remain, about your
affairs, I have thought it good: under your worships favor, to advertise your
worship of the truth thereof, as I have credibly gathered by such as bare
office and are principal officers in the same: Beseechinge you to acquainte
master E. H. with others my good friends, and your worships favorites with
the same, for that I know the gentleman to be well disposed, and so well given,
as he will not be the reporter of any novelties, but such as shall bear
credit, my self unworthy to be ioynde with one of so high esteem, am loath
to geeue my self that credit, to be a reporter of any other as your woorship
knows, to whom in all humbleness I refer my self: yet such is the desire
I have, to have the well deserving, reap their reward, and be had in
exteeme according to their worthiness. As I have herein done my best to
signify the same unto you and others, and could well wish it were published,
to the view of the world, to the end, their names who have hardly adventured
for it: may reap the honor they have deserved, to the encouragemente of
others. To the like, hauty and full of courage has been those resolute
Gentlemen and their followers, and thereby deserved more reputation then I can
with my base report yield them: yet imitating those which have lived in
elder years, that wished their countries honor, unworthy though I be to write
their deserved praises, I have adventured the same, and hope it shall be as
acceptable as I desire, wherein if your worship be satisfied, I have my wish in
some sort: and that I may not be tedious unto you, nor such as by you shall
have view of this my unworthy writings, I will with friuoulous matter no
longer detain you, but proceed to the matter which was this.

Her Majesty's Ships and others, having spente the most part of this last
Summer about the Islands, as well for the safety of our countrymen that way
aduenturinge, as also to annoy our professed ennemies the Spanyardes, whom
reports gave out, were in great Fleetes at Sea, this Fleet aforesaid
spending their time with little profit to any of them, with consent of their
Admirals dispersed themselves diverse ways: some taking their course for one
Island, and some for another, to discry if they might: what shipping our
ennemies had at Sea, amongst the which dispersed Fleet, Sir John Burrowes
knight, a most resolute and polliticke gentleman, thirstinge to show his
valor at Sea: there, in his countreies service to gain fame, to the ennemies
disgrace, as against them on land, both in the Low Countries and France, he
had most nobly adventured, to the great commendations not only of himself,
but his whole posterity, and countries great good, This worthy knight being
Commander of the good Ship called the Row-Bucke, and having in his company, an
other fortunate and brave Ship named the Dainety, whose owner is that worthy
knighte Sir John Hawkins, the Captain a brave Mariner, and a most forward
man, called master Thomson of Harwiche, and one other Ship of London called
the Dragon, whose Captain is master Newporte of Limehouse a most hardy and
forward man and resolute in perfourminge any thing to his charge committed,
the owner of which Ship, is master Becket of Limehouse, late master of the
Trinytie house, these ships above named, commanded by that brave kinght,
being best of accounpt at that time the Queens Ships being absent and one
that the rest being desirous to be governed by, called to Captain Thomson,
being in the Dayntie, and him desired as God would permite them that he would
keep him company, offeringe him many large profferes, Captain Tomson
accepted and promised what help he could do if occation served he would be
reddy with his best power and all his company to accomplish, this concluded,
they keept company all that night, and the next day. These other Ships
being far to windward of them, (viz) the Foresight, the Teager of my Lord of
Cumberlandes, the Samson, his Lordships also, and a black Ship of M. Newtons
of London marcha^t called the Prudence, whose Captain and Master was Hugh
Merricke of London, a man well reputed for his valor and skill in marine
causes, and oftentimes as a man of choice for his virtues, has taken charge in
her Majesty's Navy, with one small Bark of Porchmouth, called the Phoenix,
which served for a Pinnace: her Master and owner was Edward Grant, a man
fortunate and happy. These Ships, last named, being as I said, and it is
credibly reported to Windewarde of Sir John Borowes and the Dainty, They
first discried the one Carrycke, of the burden of nine hundred tuns or there
abouts with whom, the Roebuck and the Dainty bare all the night and gave them
chase long before the rest (descried her) as they supposed, who, immediately
upon the view thereof, seeing Sir John and Captain Thomson had her in chase,
bare with her all the night, in hope to have that they wished, the Dainty
being headmost, for that she is good of sail followed sharpest, which the
Carricke perceived, and fearinge to be taken bare with the Isle Flowers,
being not far from the shore, and between the shore and Sir John
Burrowes, which do they what they might, that advantage could not be gotten
from them, albeit many occasions was ministered: the worse was the good
knights fortune and the rest. Well sir, this Carricke being thus closly
pursued, recovered the Island, and letting fall four Anchors, run all a
shore, Sir John Burrowes and the rest anchored by them, and night being upon
them, determined the next morninge to have boorded her: But God that disposes
of all things, how forward soever man is in aduenturinge, and gives
victories, at his good pleasure. That night when all the Fleet had greatest
hope to have had their desire, and to have enjoyed that Carricke whom they had
guarded with great policy. It pleased God to send a marvelous great storm,
the wind coming off the Sea, which troubled them very much, so that they were
enforced by the extremity of the weather, the place well known to be very
dangerous, to weigh Anchor, and put again to Sea, committinge themselves to
the harshenesse of the waves, and the mercy of God, yet took such order, that
they should al keep as close as they might and if God sent fair weather,
they might not so loose her. This night past, and the storm by his grace,
that gives all grace, seized. The whole Fleet bare again with Floweres and
coming near the Illand might perceive the Spaniards, how they labored, to
save the best they had aborde, having not ceased all that night from hard
trauaill and carryinge a shore what they might. These envious villains, seeing
no remidye but to fall into their hands, that would have taken great care of
her, Fyred the Caricke before any of our Fleet could lay her abord, and almost
all forsook her. In such sort increased the fire, that do what men might,
albeit great pains was therein taken, they could not quench the marcilesse
flame until all her upper work was consumed, when with much ado, they
quenched the same, where they found of Pyliage such as contented poor men.
This over past, they chanced to take one of the company, who being a Spaniard,
on certain Articles, he confessed much matter touching that Caricke, and
gave also notice of the coming of the other, the which was afterward met
withal and taken, and it is called the Mother of God. The Fleet stoared with
resolute minds, when as they heard this news, were all frolic: their
joyful hearts presaged good success to follow: and having taken what they
could of the first Carrick, they determined to disperse their Ships again,
to the end some of their fortunes, by Gods good favor might be to light
upon her, and with this resolution, they put to Sea again, the Row-Bucke and
the Dainty, keeping still together, as near as they might. Night coming on,
they hulled almost the whole night, or carried very little sail: continuing
in this manner two nights and two days, the second day in the morninge, the
Dainetie beeinge headmost again, as for her sail she exceeds many, discried
the great Carricke all a hie: seeminge to them in their top, to be some huge
thing, as indeed she is, this sight pleased them so well: as he that had the
best stommacke to his victuals, was so joyful, that they forgotte their
Breakefast: hopinge before dinner, to have an host that should make them right
merry, and hoysinge their sails, bare with her all the day. The Row-bucke,
seeinge her make such sail, caused one to look out, who likewise presently
discried her, to their no little joys and reioysinge, and fitting their sails
likewise, lived in great hope of Gods good favor therein, and so hoaped to be
better sharers, then with the first. The Foresight and the rest of the Fleet,
being far off, hadd likewise discried her, and bare with the rest. By noone
or one of the clock of that day, being the third of August, the Dainty came
near her, so that the Gunner, whose name was Thomas Bedome, being a proper
tall man, and had very good aim at any thing, and good luck withal: desired
the Captain, he might give them a shoot, to let them understand, that they
were Englishmenne, and under her Highness, Commander of the Seas. The
Captain having great care, and not willinge to have any shoot shot in
vain: commanded him to forbear till they should come nearer her, which was
not long, when the Captain himself commanded him to do his best, and
carowsinge a kanne of Wine to his company, encouraged them to begin the fight,
and coming up, haled them after the manner of the Sea, and commanded them
to strike for the Queen of England, which they no sooner refused, but the
Gonner beeinge ready, gave fire to two whole Culueringes in her chase, and
racked and toare her pittifullye: Bearinge up with them, gave them the whole
side, and boorded them presently, who resisted most courageously, and putt us
off again: Thus continued the Dainetie in fight, a pretty while, before any
other could come to help her, in which time she laid her aboorde three
several times, toare her Ancient from her poope, and slew her Captain, and
more harm had done them, but that by chance a shot, bare their foremaste by
the Boorde, which they were compelled to splice again, to their great trouble.
The next that came to her rescue was the valiant Sir John Burrowe, who
attempting with great valor to boorde her, was putt off again, and received a
shot which had like to have endaungered himself. The third was the golden
Dragon of London, whereof was Captain Master Newport, who most bravely gave
the attempt, but was likewise put off, the Carricke beeinge so huge, that
those Ships did but little good. In boording they slew many of their men, and
spoiled them marueilously. The next was her Majesty's good Ship the
Foresighte, whose commander for that service was Captain Crasse, a man well
approved in marine causes, and far has adventured, who with his Ship
laid her a boorde, and very valiauntly assailed them, and was most stoutely by
the Spanyardes also repulsed: in so much, that the brave Captain, of whose
men, many were weak, and yet beeinge loath her Majesty's Ship should be
shaken off without victory, fyred the Carricke, rather wishinge her to be
burnte, then the ennemies to enjoy her. But the proud and lofty-minded
Spanyardes, standinge on their reso^ute points, returned the fire again, or
some other, which three times was kindled: to the great comber of Captain
Cross and his Company, that would not so leave them. This dangerous
conflict between these Ships endured long time, which the Phoenix of
Portchmouth perceiuinge, and beeinge able to yield her little other comfort,
by reason of the hugeness of the Carricke, she being but of threescore tuns
or there abouts: albeit the Master would gladly have done his best, and was
willing to board her also: yet left he her for a time standinge with their
Admiral and Uice-Admirall, which was the Teager and Sampson, who coming up
with them, declared unto them the hardy fight of the Foresighte, who presently
bare up with them all the night: the Sampson being the first, coming up
with the Carricke, gave her the whole broadside, and shuttinge up into the
Foresightes quarter, entered his men into her, Captain Norton, that brave
and worthy gentlemanne, laid her also a boorde having the Teager with him,
and so entered together being a hundred men at the least, all resolutely
minded: at whose enteraunce, they yielded so great a cry, as the dismayed
Portingalls and Spanyardes, could not beethincke themselves what course to
take to help themselves, in such a mase were they stricken, although they
were Eighte hundred strong, all well appointed and able men, and of ours but
one hundred. But standinge thus as men amassed, at length yielded themselves
vanquished: and so perforce gave possession, to them that challenged it for
their own, as won with their swoordes and hazard of their lives: as the
pitiful slaughter of the dead carcasses, which they found a board witnessed,
the sight whereof was able to mollify the hardest heart in the world. To see
the slain men, here and there lie welteringe in their own blood, and the
grievous lamentation of the wounded, amongst which some lackinge their legs,
some their arms, and other members of their bodies, whose misery, our
countreymenne (though they were our hateful ennemies) greatly bewailed: yet
acknowledged it to be but the chance of Wars, which was and is, as it
pleases God. They gave God hearty thanks for their own safety: and did their
best endeavor in procuringe remedy for as many as was possible, whereby they
have acquisted unto themselves and their country, exceeding great
commendations: such is the good conditions of Englishmen, in fauouringe their
conquered ennemies: be their fury never so great. The conflict ended, it were
a world of wonder to recount unto you, the true reports, how our men be
stirred themselves, in searchinge and prying into every corner of her, as far
as they might, as they might well do having with so great danger ouercomen
her. The sight of the ricches within the same contained, did so a maze the
companies that were within boorde of her, and that still came from every
Ship, being desirous to see what God had sent them, after so long and hot a
fight: that many of them could not tell what to take, such was the stoare and
the goodness thereof: yea, he that hadd known, what things had been worth,
in a little room might have contrived great wealth, for it is credibly
reported, that some yonkers happened to find many Iarres of Ceuitt, which is
of great worth, and being of some long time closely kept, when they opened
the same, was cause it yielded no savor: and they ignorant and not knowinge
what it should be, thinkinge it but trashe as it came to their hands, heaued
it ouer-boord: much other things was so spoiled for want of knowledge, when
every man had sufficient, and that not one had cause to complain: Sir John
Burrowes and other the Principals of the Fleet, calling a Counsel, in the
same determined to take some course for the goods, valued according to the
Spanyardes own reports, to be above seauenteene hundredth tons, and in value
as they thought, many thousand pounds, besides the other great treasure that
was in her. Thus a view being taken, they began to consulte, what were best to
do with the Prisoners, which were many, and findinge their great scarcity
of victuals, and not knowing what weather they might have, nor how it might
please God with good wind to prosper them, it was concluded, to Ship as
many of them as they might, and to send them for Lisbona, this they fully
determined, and provision was made of a Bark of Dover, which they met, the
Fleet taking in, her men, and such provision as they had in her, and the rest
embarked the Spanyardes and Portingalles with their Negroes, whereof were many,
and gave them with them stoare of victualles, and so gave them leave to
depart, detayninge none but the principallest of them. It was supposed that
the Uice-Roy for the Indies was amongst them: but it is not so good, for he
upon some special cause, (as it was reported) rests behind until the next
year: whose fortune, if it be by the providence of him that disposes of all
men's joys, to send them for England, no doubt he should be welcome to a
great many.

Thus Sir with favor, have I boldly troubled you, with such good tydinges as
here is, as duty wills I should, knowinge your joy to be great for our
brave countrymens good success, who after a long and perilous fight, which
endured almost twelve hours about eleven or twelve a clock in the night,
they became masters of this huge Carricke, to their great joy, and comfort of
all faithful and true hearted Englishmen. A matter worth the hearing and
strange, of whose wealth your woorship shall better understand hereafter,
when it may with leisure and discretion be valued and esteemed: besides which
she had in her good stoare of Ordinance, fit for to serve for the Realms
defense, both of Brass and Iron, whole Cannons, Cannon Periall, Culueringes,
Demi Culueringes and Sakars, to the number of threescore, amongst which, this
is not the woorst, and I wish heartily, that all the rest in the kings
dominions, that has been conuayed out of our own country by such greedy
cormorantes, as rather seek the filling of their own bags, then their
countries benefit and safetye, were here with these: And they whose minds
have been such as to convey them away, were known to her Majesty and her
honorable Counsel, to the end they might receive, what they have woorthely
deserved. But God in time will lay them open, and make them taste the sower, as
well as they have done the sweet. Wherefore we had not need to be slack in
praying to the God of all power, wisdom, and strength, that it will please
him to increase the number of faithful and obedient subjects, continue the
reign of our most Sovereign Lady, and consounde all her foes.

Other news there is none, but general good tidinges of all our men of war,
that spent the Summer abroad, who have prospered well: whose actions
deserving commendations, when I shall certainly know, I will further
advertise you: Till when I humbly recommend my self unto your worships
service. Dartmouth this last of September 1592.
