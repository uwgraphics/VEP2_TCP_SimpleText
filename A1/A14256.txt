(...) wife / but cruelly and fyersly answer unto her. False strompet
dyshordynate of as much as thou art with child I ought little to rejoice me
/ for I am so much informed of thy government yt I have nothing / and that
dysloyally thou haste habandoned thyselfe unto other than me. When they saw
that ye Emperor would not refrain him nor appese his Ire for nothing / by a
common accord they took her and led her in to a chamber. And the most
amyably that they might held her with words in shewy^ge unto her her great
fault / and the sorrowful lady was dysorned in the chamber that had her face
dysteyned with blood. The ladies that were next her person brought her fair
water to wasshe her withal. And at that hour entered in to her chamber her
squire named Blandymayn. And when he saw her in such estate / he wept for
pity / and said unto her. Ha madame I se well that you are falsely betrayed. I
beseech god that cursed be ye person that has purchased you this evil. For
god my right dear lady take a little comfort unto you. And if you will by leave
me I shall led you in to France again toward the king Pepyn your brother /
the which gave me unto you for to serve you in your necessytees / the which
thing I would do after my puyssau^ce. Believe my counsayll and we shall return
in to France again. / For you may be sure that the Emperor shall make you
dye shortly with great shame and dishonor. Then answered the dolorous lady. Ha
Blandymain my friend it should be to me to shameful and dyshonest for to go in
such manner without other delyberacyon. And it might be byleued lightly that ye
Emperor had good cause / and that I were culpable of the deed. Wherefore I had
lever deye an evil death / than for to recover blame for a thing that I am
innocent of / and accused with out cause. After these things thus said / ye
Emperor that was with the barons a little moderate and satysfyed of his Ire /
he sent for his wife Bellyssant / ye which was brought before him quyckely.
When he saw her his heart trembled for sorrow for this that he durst not put
her to death / because of her brother king Pepyn / and his puyssaunce. With
tude words he said to her. False and cursed woman by the is mine honor
vyturped Wherefore I swear god that and it were not for thy broders sake / the
valiant king Pepyn / I should make the to be burnt in a fire / out for his
sake thy life shall be prolonged at this present time. Now I do the to wit
that from this hour I banysshe the / and expulse the from my country and
Empire / in commaundynge the expressly that to morrow thou depart out of this
cite / for if I se the any more / thou shall never have respyte till thou have
suffered death. And yet I commau^de all them of my country / that there be none
so hardy of them to accompany you / or conueye / save alonely your squire
Blandymayn that you brought out of France with you. Go where as you will goo
at your adventure / for thou shall never sleep by my side / nor in my bed /
Soon after the commandment of the Emperor that was short and sudden /
without soiourne or delacyon / the Empress Bellyssant / and her squire
Blandymayn mounted on horsbacke and came in to the Cite. Where as was shed
full many a tere / both of lords and ladies / knights / and squyers / with
all the comin people / ye which cried and sorowed out of mesure / for they
made such lamentacyons that there was never seen / nor herd so pyteous a
thing. Every body ran unto the gate / for to command the good lady unto
god that by the false Archebysshoppe was so pyteously banysshed. And at the
issue of the gate they made the pytefullest cry yt ever was herd. Now gothe
Blandymayn that conduyteth the sorrowful lady Bellyssant / And has taken the
way to go toward the realm of France. When the lady was out of the walls
of the cite / and that she saw herself in the feldes pyteously aourned / like
a woman shamed and dishonored / she wayled bytterly. For she considered the
lygnage / and ye blood ryall that she was issued out of / the right high
magnyfycence imperyall that she had been put in. And after thought on the
miserable and dolorous fortune yt was turned upon her so suddenly / she said.
Alas alas wherefore taryeth death that he will not come and abredge my life /
and fynisshe my dolours and anguysshes / Alas I was borne in an unhappy hour
for to suffer such pain / and for to fall from so hye estate unto such
pouerte / for of all the vnhappyes I am the most vnhappyest. Now is al my
joys transmued in to dystres my laughynges changed in to wepynges / my songs
converted in to syghes. In the stead of the clothe of gold that I was wont
for to were / I am as a woman publyke full of iniuryes and vytupere committed
and aourned. And of precious stones of inestymable valor / on all sides I must
the remenaunt of my miserable life arouse my vesture with bitter teeres / that
shall make my life and my days to fynysshe. O you pastorelles of ye feldes
consider my great dolours / and weep mine exyle. Now pleased it god and the
vyrgyn Mary that I were descended of as poor estate as the poorest of ye
world / at the leest I should have doloure to se me in such pouerte. Alas
wherefore lyghteth me the son / and wherefore does the earth sustain me / for
I have no need that the dangerous fountain of dystresse oppress me so sore.
For it is not in mine humayne puyssaunce / to bewail the profounde sorrow that
my poor heart endures. O false envy and treason / I ought well for to curse
the with my heart / for by the to day I am the most sorowfullest creature
living upon the earth. A my brother the king Pepyn / what shall ye do with this
poor dyscomforted. It were better for you that I had never ben borne of my
mother / or that from the womb of my mother I had been put under the earth. In
making this aspre complaynt the lady abode in a swowne upon the horsbacke /
and she was almoost fallen down or that Blandymayn might come unto her / then
he dressed her up and said unto her. Alas madame take unto you some comfort /
and enter not so in to dyspayre / have steadfast trust in god / for even so as
you are innocente he shall keep you and defend you always / Then he espied a
right fair fountain / toward the which he led the lady. And also nere it
as he might he set her down for to repose her and refresshe her. Here I will
leave to speak of them / and will speak of the Archebysshop that perseuered in
his malice dampnable and dyabolyke.

How the Archebysshop put him in the habyte of a knight / and mounted on
horsbacke for to follow ye Empress Bellyssant yt was banysshed. Ca. iiij.
Archebys.



When the Archebysshop saw that the lady was departed / he thought in himself
that he would go after her / and that with her he would do his pleasure. He
left rochet and other vesture / and as irreguler and apostate / gyrde his
sword about him / and mounted upon a swyfte courser / and followed fast after
/ for he had one of the best courser of all Constantynoble. He rode so fast
that within short time he had ryden a great way. And of all them that he met
he asked tidings of the noble lady Bellyssant. And they showed unto him the
way that she held. So long rode the false traitor Archebysshoppe that he
entered in to a mighty great forest and a long / he took the high way and
enforced him to ride a paas. He had not ryden long when he apperceyued the
lady with Blandymayn / the which were beside the fountain where as the lady
was descended for to refresshe her / and rest her for she was weary and heavy
full of sorrow and doloure / so that she might not sustain her. Whiles that
Blandymayn comforted the sorrowful lady / ye Archebysshop drew nere them / and
knew the fair Bellyssant / but she knew him not a far because that he was
dysgysed / but when he approached she knew him well enough. Alas said she
Blandymayn / I se now come toward us the false Archebysshop that is cause of
mine exyle. Alas I am to sore aferde that he do me not some vyllanye. Lady said
Blandymayn / have of him neither fere nor doubt. For if he come for to do you
evil or displeasure I shall put my body for to defend yours unto the death. At
these words was arrived the archebysshop that light of his horse / and salued
the lady in ye best manner that he might and said. Right dear and honored lady
/ if so be that ye Emperor has dechaced you / if you will accept me for to
be your love / and accomplysshe my desire / I shall do so much toward the
Emperor that he shall put you in your first estate / and be exalted more
higher than ever you were / wherefore auyse you / for I do it for your great
honor and prouf fyte. Ha said the lady / dysloyall and cruel adversary of
all honor imperyall / I ought well to have cause to love the / and hold the
dear / when that by thy false malice thou haste made the Emperor understand
that I have myserably borne me toward his majesty / and made me be deiecte
from all honor and prosperyte. / Thou have put me in the way of extremyte
and myserye / and is the causer that I shall fynysshe my days in dolorous
dystresse / for there is not a more dyscomforted lady in the world than I am.
Lady leave such words / for by me there can nothing come to you but good For I
am puyssaunt enough for to change your doloure and dyscomforte in to Joy and
solace / more than ever you had. In saying these words he enclyned hy^
toward the lady / and wend to have kyssed her. But Blandymayn sterte between
them and gave the Archebysshop so great a stroke that he felled him unto the
earth / and brake twain of his tethe. The Archebysshop gate him up and drew
his sword quyckly. And Blandymayn took a glayue that he had brought with him
and assaylled him right asprely / and the Archebisshop him. They fought so
long that they were both sore wounded. And as they were thus fighting /
there arrived on them a notable merchant / that ascryed unto them also far
as he might se them saying. Lords lords leave your debate / and tell me fro
whens it proceeds / and I shall tell you who has right or wrong. sir said
Bla^dymayn let us fynysshe our enterprise. Alas said the lady socoure us / for
here is the false priest that will take mine honor from me by force / which is
the cursed Archebysshop / that has separed me by treason from my lord and
husband the Emperor. When ye merchant understood her / he had great pity on
her / and said to the Archebysshop. Sir leave your enterprise / and touch not
the lady / for and the Emperor knew of this deed / he would make you deye an
evil death before all the world. Also soon as the Archebisshoppe under stood
the merchant speak / he left the battle quyckly and began for to fle
thorughe the wodde. He was right sorrowful that he was known / for he thought
well to have had his pleasure of ye lady. But he enterprysed such a thing /
whereby his treason was known afterward / and dysclosed as it shall be
recounted to you afterward. After the departing of the Archebysshop ye lady
abode in the wodde beside the fountain tryste and sorrowful / with Blandymayne
yt was wounded. The merchant that was abyden said. Alas lady I se that by the
Archebisshop ye are falsely betrayed / and have be^ expulsed from the Emperor.
Now god give me grace to live so long that I may accuse him of this mys deed
/ and to purchase his death. Lady to god I command you the which give you
pacyence and comfort So the marchaunte took his leave / and Blandymayn thanked
him many times. Then Blandymayn mounted the lady upon her horse / and after
mounted upon his own / and went unto a lodging that was there beside / where
as they abode by the space of.viij. days for to hele Blandymayn. When he had
rested him / and that he might ride they put them upon the way toward
France. And the sorrowful lady complained her by ye way and said. Alas
Blandymayn my friend / what may my brother and all the lords say of my pyteous
case / when they shall know that for a vyllaynous deed I am so shamefully
deiecte from the Emperor / and as a common woman banysshed the Empire of
Consta^tynoble. Alas I am right certain that my brother will believe lightly that
I am culpable of the deed / and make me dye shamefully / for he is right fyerse
of courage / lady said blandymayn be of good chere / and put your trust in god.
In speaking thus Blandymayn that the lady (...)
