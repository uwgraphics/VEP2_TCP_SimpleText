The Cucking of a Scould.
To the tune of, The Merchant of (...).


A Wedded wife there was,
(...) of years but young,
(...) she wanted wit,
(...) she lackt no tongue.
(...) years of age,
(...) was no more,
(...) would scold with any one,
From twenty to threescore.
The cucking of a Scold,
The cucking of a Scold,
Which i^ you will but stay to hear,
The cucking of a Scold.
(...)
(...) tongue did wag,
(...) have it run,
(...) Nag.
(...) wrong,
(...) show her skill.
(...) moved once
(...) not so ill.
The ^uc^ing etc.
(...) know
(...) begun.
(...) tell you for his life,
(...) would have done.
(...) a famous Scould,
(...) Scould in grain,
(...) Scould was never bred
Nor borne in Turne-gaine Lane
The cucking, etc.
Upon a (...) it chanced
And she did thus allege
A neig^bours maid had taken half
Her (...) from the hedge:
For (...) great trespass done,
This wrong for to requite,
She scolded very hansomely,
(...) and one whole night.
The cucking, etc.
(...) did mol^st
The neighbors round about:
But this was nothing to the fits
That she would thunder out.
But once, the truth to tell,
Worse scolding did she keep,
For waking of her little Dog,
That in the Sun did sleep.
The cucking, etc.
Six winter days together,
From morning eight a clock,
Until the evening that each one
Their doors began to lock:
She scolded for this wrong.
Which she accounted great.
And unto peace and quietness
No man could her entreat.
The cucking etc.
So that this little Devil,
With her unquiet tongue,
Continually both far and near,
Molested old and young.
But yet soon after this,
She made a greater brawle,
Against the Constable, that did
But piss against her wall.
The cucking, etc.
She called him beastly knau^,
And filthy Jack for this,
And said that every Cuckold now
Against her wall must piss:
And in must raging sort,
She railed at him so long.
He made a ^ow he would revenge
This most outrageous worng.
The cucking, etc.
And first of all behold,
He clapped her in the Cage,
Thinking thereby her deuillish tongue,
He would full well assuage.
But now worse then before,
She did to brawling fall.
The Constable and all the rest
She vildly did miscall.
The cucking, etc.
Thus night and day she sent
Such brawling from her drist.
That (...) neighbor in the town
Could take one hours rest.
Which when the justice knew,
This judgment than gave he,
That she upon a cucking stool
Should justly punished be.
The cucking, etc.
Upon three market days,
This penance she should hide.
And every thing fit for the same.
The Officers did provide:
An hundred Archers good,
Did first before her go,
A hundred and five nimble shot
Went next unto the Roe.
The cucking etc.
An hundred armed men
Did also follow there:
The which did guard the gallant Scould
With piercing Pikes and Spear:
And trumptes sounding sweet^
In order with them comes
A company most orderly,
With pleasant (...)
The cucking, etc.
And forty Parrats then.
On sundry pearches hie,
Were carried eke before the scould,
Most fine and orderly
And last of all a mighty wispe
Was borne before her face.
The perfect taken of a Scould
Well brown in every place.
The cucking, etc.
Then was the Scould her self.
In a wheele-barrow brought.
Stripped naked to the smock,
As in that case she ought:
Neats tongues about her neck
Were bung to open show;
And thus unto the cucking stool
This famous Scould did go,
The cucking, etc.
Then fast within the chair
She was most finely bound,
Which made her scold excessiuely,
And said she should be drowned.
But every time that she
Was in the (...),
The drums and trumpets sounded, brave
For (...)
The cucking, etc.
S^x (...) when she was duckt
Within the water clear.
That like unto a drowned Rat,
She did in sight appear.
The Justice thinking then
(...) send her straight away.
The Constable she called knave.
And knau'd him all the day.
The cucking etc.
Upon which words, I wot,
They duckt her straight again
A dozen times ore head and ears:
Yet she would not refraime,
But still reuil'd them all.
^^en (...) again they go,
Till she at last held up her hands,
Saying, I Will no more do so.
The cucking etc.
Then was she brought away,
And after for her life,
She never (...) begin to scould
With either man or wife.
And if that every Scould
Might have so good a diet,
Then should their neighbors every day
Be sure to live in quiet,
The cucking of a Scould,
The cucking of a Scould
Which if you will but stay to hear
The cucking of a Scould.
