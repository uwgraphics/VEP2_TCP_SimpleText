The spectacle of lovers,
Here after follows a little contrauers dyalogue between love and council /
with many goodly arguments of good women and bad / very compendyous to all
estates / newly compyled by wyllyam walter servant unto sir Henry Marnaye
knight Chauncelour of the Duchye of Lancastre.

Council. Love.



Here begins the prologue of the auctoure.
FOr as much as ydelnesse is rote of all vices
whom to eschew ye wyseman does us counsel
I therefore entende with some manner of business
Against the same that I might prevail
Record of Phylosepher which makes rehersayle
Better it is to write and some thing for to say
Than in slouthe and ydelnesse to spend the time away
And thus thinking my mind for to apply
To make some thing for my recreacyon
It came to my remembrance to show and notyfy
Between a lover and me the great alteracyon
Of his peteous complaynt making demonstracyon
The answers again there unto replyenge
In manner of argument together dysputynge
wherefore I require you with humble petycyon
This my poor work to take agreeable
And there as is amysse to make reformacyon
From mesure and good making which is so varyable
Let ygnoraunce excuse my fault reprouable
which made it not for any presumpcyon
But only for pastyme and recreacyon
Finis.
IN a morning for my recreacyon
In to the feldes as I went walking
To behold the ground I had delectacyon
Arrayed with flowers fair and sweet smelling
The trees buddynge and the birds syngyng
Phoebus his beams shynynge like the gold
Made my heart joy such pleasures to behold
And as I was thus walking all alone
By an herber I herd right suddenly
A lover that pyteously made his moan
Saying alas for sorrow I shall dye
Uenus darte has wounded me so cruelly
without I may my purpose soon attain
For sorrow my heart will break in twain
O goddess of love that has the sygnory
Of all creatures attend to my petycyon
Enclyne my lady that she do apply
To my desire by thine instygacyon
That love in her may have such operacyon
That our two wylles together may be knyt
For as a prisoner to her I me submyt
Alas how great sorrow it is and pain
To live in dread always Imagynynge
How her good grace that I might attain
In thought and pensyfnesse always desiring
At a good end my purpose for to bring
Thus do I live between hope and dread
Sometime trusting / and sometime not to speed
when her noble person first I did behold
The souenaunce of her beauty my heart so enbraced
That my color changed / my blood waxed cold
Love there my heart and will together enterlaced
So fyrmely that never it can be defaced
But as her true lover to love her pardurable
which for no chance shall be found varyable
Alas good lady hold me excused
If I desire the / which I am unworthy
Love had my heart so greatly abused
Above all other to love you specially
To my hard fortune I can no wise reply
But to submyt me unto your grace and will
It is at your pleasure to save or to spyll
wherefore good lady
Into your hands
Love has me brought
Lose not his life
In thought and care
Alas sweet lady
Mercy I ask
with pity do entende
As a prysonere
Let love my care amend
That loves you so dear
Ever I stand in fere
Remember my great pain
Do not my love dysdayne
By her love my mind is solycyted
That slepynge nor waking I am in quietness
But in ymagynacyons and thoughts greatly turme^ted
My color is faded / my mind for heuenesse
Is greatly oppressed / my body for werynesse
And lack of sustenaunce is so weyke of nature
That without her pity / it may not long endure
when that I do her beauty contemplayre
Her noble virtue / her goodly countenance
who that dame nature / has made so passing fair
Than am I supprysed with her remembrance
As a man that were all in a trance
Enflamed with the hot brennynge fire
Of love / that nothing may slake my great desire
I would Jesus she had the prerogatyfe
That she knew ye thoughts of al creatures humayne
Than should she know what a bitter life
I led for her / to might she not refrain
But for pity release me out of pain
And by her love to conforte me restore
For there is nothing that I desire so sore
Alas how am I thus greatly abused
That my mind to her dare not express
For if she should ones have me refused
Always in sorrow I should live confortlesse
Ones must she know my cause of heaviness
Or of my purpose I shall nothing attain
But thus still my fortune to complain
O how great joy should my heart enbrace
If that my lady of her femynyne pity
would me accept in to her special grace
That together in marriage united we might be
Than were I brought from care to felycyte
well might I say my love were not in vain
Sith her goodly person that I did obtain
Often times I have been purposed
My pyteous sorrow to (...) declare
But when my love I should have dysclosed
Despair byddeth me for to beware
Lest by dysdayne I were brought in care
Desire my mind than greatly does auaunce
Of my fortune to know the fynall chance
Thus have I lived always languysshynge
In varyaunce between love / hope and dread
with pensyfe thoughts always imagining
Of my purpose how that I might speed
And if I should be vnreguardoned
For the love that I to her do bear
Thus am I always put in thought and fere
O cruel love O love insacyable
what have I offended to be thus troubled
By the cruel darts of desire intolerable
which has my heart so greatly abused
with contynuall care to be thus tourmented
That at no time I am in any rest
But by desire and fere always oppressed
Cursed be ye my cruel eyes twain
which have perfyxed my mind so desirous
That my heart in no wise can refrain
But of my lady for to be amorous
Ye have me wounded with pains dolorous
Of sorrow and care that persed has my heart
without her conforte my life will soon depart
Consultor. when that I herd him thus pyteously complain
My heart for pity sorowed inwardly
And for to cause him his sorrow to refrain
with words of conforte I did my mind apply
For in trouble there is no better remedy
Than to a friend for to dysclose his sore
For sorrow close kept engenders more and more
wherefore these words to him did I say
why do ye thus pyteously lament
Conforte your self if that ye may
Or else right soon ye will repent
For where as sorrow on sorrow does augment
In process of time think it as no wonder
But that it will perse your heart asonder

Amator. He looked on me with face pale and wan
His face dyscouered his woeful heaviness
Alas he said I am a woeful man
That by love am brought in to dystresse
I love and dare not my love to her express
That has my heart hoolly in her cure
Marvel it is that I may this woo endure
I love a lady whose beauty does excel
Like as aurora all other sterres in light
Of her noble virtue the trewthe I can not tell
Nature and fortune has given her that might
Her noble beauty has persed so my sight
Enflamynge my heart by desire contynuall
That unto love I am made bond and thrall.

Consultor. Such dysordynat love / proceeds of ydelnesse
To behold women / having delectacyon
which by contynuaunce / does more and more encrese
Encensynge their minds / by besy Imagynacyon
To find the craft / and operacyon
To bring poor women / in to such dotage
In their love / that they might mad and rage
Some to their lovers / tokyns do send
Other delight them / in goodly apparel
Some other in writing / their lovers do commend
And by false promyses procure them to do ill
Other lewd tales / of rybaudry to tell
And to hot meats and drynkes women desire
By such prouocacyon / to set them on a fire
Thus do they daily / and study in their mind
How folysshe women / that they might abuse
And if by chance / any such they find
Than for a time / they will them haunt and use
And for an other / soon after them refuse
They do not care / how many they begyle
For such mad love lasts but a while

Amator. what man is he / that would him self abstain
From beholdynge of so noble a creature
Or what is he that would not take great pain
If that he might / to purchase such a treasure
which might be most / to his synguler pleasure
God never created thing / under the fyrmament
So noble as woman / nor to man more conuenyent
And where as ye say men have great delectacyon
To dysdayne women by some subtle train
And to be mutable of their dysposycyon
Truth it is / true love will never stayne
But to be steadfast / true / faithful and plain
Though some entende to women to do shame
All true lovers of them are not to blame

Consultor. True love / nay nay / mad love men may it call
A fool is he / he can it not deny
Where he is free to make him bond and thrall
In loving a woman with heart so steadfastly
Which by his love in no mean can apply
Yet from her love he can him not refrain
Though that he knew his love spe^^ in vain
Such is the condycyon of lovers impacyent
That do desire / that they may not attain
Which to their degrees is not equivalent
Yet by reason they can not them refrain
But of their possybylyte to complain
Of the dyffycultye they seek no remedy
Both counsel and shame they utterly deny

Amator. Why should not men love women in their mind
Sith that brute beestes do love their semblable
All thing is governed by nature and by kind
And sith that nature in beestes is so stable
Why should not a man a creature reasonable
Love a woman sith nature does him bind
Would ye have men err against their kind
Specta. of lo.
We lovers have always such hard chance
Some for to love far under their degree
Or them self more greatly do auaunce
We never be at our own lyberte
To have respect unto the qualyte
Nature has us in such subieccyon
There to love / where we ought not of reason
Love her I will while my life shall last
What so ever thereof / here after shall ensewe
My heart and will shall ever be steadfast
Her only to love / as a lover true
Reason nor counsel / my mind can not subdewe
No shame it is to love in honest
Though that she pass far above my degree

Consultor. What man is so mad to love his ennemy
Which daily puts him to such encombraunce
That at no time he can rest quyetly
Nor many times take bodyly sustenaunce
But leseth his color / and mysspendeth his substance
His credence / his virtue and all his good name
For such mad love / wise men will him dyffame
Such vices ensue mad lovers comynly
They are suspicyous and them do deedly hate
That with their lovers use to company
And with them often fight / chyde and debate
Much myschefe ensues / they be unfortunate
Now in / now out / this is their condycyon
Some lose their life / some their wit and reason

Amator. Of a noble heart proceeds gentylnesse
would ye have me my lover to dysdayne
Though she be part of my great heaviness
I am chief ground of my mortal pain
Though I her love she can me not refrain
why should I her for my mysfortune blame
Sith I my self am chief cause of the same
It was never my purpose will nor mind
By such mysgouernaunce my self to abuse
No false susspeccyons in me shall she find
For by good cause my love she might refuse
If that therein I might me not excuse
Though I her love / yet will I not go mad
Nor lose my life / my wit is not so badde
I marvel that ye love so despise
which of hertely kyndnesse is engendered
Nature a man there unto does entyse
Of myrthe and pleasure it does also proceed
Frendshyp and charity there with all agrede
Rancoure and malice it destroys utterly
All thing by it does grow and multyply
Love does quycken every man's heart
It provoke the mind to pleasure and lustynesse
Slouthe and sadness it causes to depart
Strength and manhood by it does encresse
It haieth penury / it loves largess
Love causes a man to have delight and pleasure
with a woman to do the course of nature

Consultor. For asmoche as ye he taken in the snare
Therefore ye do love more greatly auaunce
But in love there is sorrow and care
It consumes a man by space and contynuaunce
The longer ye love the more is your greuaunce
Love brenneth them so with her cruel fire
The more they take the more they do desire
Their laughters ben short their mournynges are long
Full little joy but syghes many and great
In plente of sorrow small pleasure is among
Anger and trouble their hertes does often frete
Slepynge nor waking they be in quyete
In thought and desire they brenne fervently
Such doleful pain they suffer wylfully

Amator. Love is not so as ye have made report
women to men are most profitable
Their words and beauty does men great conforte
Their kysses and lokes are much delectable
To myrthe and joy they be agreeable
where that woman be / there is great solace
Happy is he that may attain their grace
We wylfull lovers do live pleasauntly
To us by kind it is appropryed
Sometime to suffer sorrow pacyently
And in joy again to be exalted
A thing hard won shall better be loved
He that will not suffer such little pain
Is not worthy such pleasure to attain

Consultor. O foolysshe lover / false is thy sentence
To think thy pain / to be to the pleasure
For well thou do know / by experyence
That love thy reason has made dull and obscure
That will thou or not / this pain thou must endure
Love has the made / for to be aghast
That wisdom and virtue / is clearly from the past
Ye lovers delight / in slouthe and sadness
Instead of myrthe / ye syghe contynually
Despare does often encrese your heaviness
Ye be also troubled by Ialousy
By such means / ye be brought in fransy
In ydell thoughts / and slombres of the night
Such is to you / great pleasure and delyght

Amator. To se you continue in error I marvel
what man is so constaunt / in his living
But love and nature / shall him often assail
with womento have / their bodyly liking
In age / wisdom / and beauty florysshynge
I trow none can be found in any place
But that love has / or shall his heart embrace
To behold women / so fair and sweet of vysage
Their color shynynge / their members well fourmed
Their pretty countenance / with hands fair and large
Their eyes twynkelynge / their words well vttred
Their behauour and courtesy of kyndnes does proceed
What heart is so hard / that could him self refrain
To eschew their company / or at them to dysdayne

Consultor. O cruel youth / ful^yll thou art abused
To suffer so quyetly / thy pain intolerable
The flames of love / with cold thought increased
Seeing the pleasure / so short and abhomynable
Much sorrow for small joy / is not commendable
Pondre thy pain / and pleasure in thy mind
For small joy / soon much sorrow thou shall find
What is beauty / but a flower vanysshynge
The carnal felycyte / the infeccyon of the eye
The dysceyuynge of the mind of men so coueytynge
A frail pleasure full of treachery
There as it is taken / it deceyueth kyndly
Beauty and wisdom / seldom does agree
It causes them unstable / and inconstant for to be
In youth their color / is fair and florysshynge
By age and syckenesse / it is soon faded
Where they were ruddy / they be pale and lourynge
Their skin in all places / swarte and wrynkeled
There is nothing ought more to be mystrusted
For it blyndeth the eye / with such voluptuosyte
That from their danger / none escapes fre
Full hard it is / to find a woman steadfast
For if one eye weep / the other does contrary
Their troth and faith / but a small while does last
Their pleasure and lust / is hard to satysfye
In wrath and malice / they be contynually
Trewthe / shame / ne love / can not them refrain
Their synguler pleasure / but that they will obtain
What woman is so steadfast / chaste and sure
But for prayer / lust or mede she will be greable
That thou of her should have thy will and pleasure
Scante one among a thousand shall be so stable
Yet dread / shame / or wrath that one shall able
Or else she is such / the which that lacks beauty
Whom that no man desires to company
If she be a maiden that has the in favor
Will not she for small lust lose her vyrgynyte
If she be a wife / consider her error
How by her craft men deceived be
If she be a wydowe / thou may plainly se
How soon their husbands death that they do forget
Wherefore he is not wise / that in them trust does set
If she be an harlot / she makes no questyon
Of thy manner / wisdom / beauty or alyaunce
But for her reward first she makes mocyon
Or that thou of her shall have any dalyaunce
Thus does she love the / only for thy substance
As long as ye have / so long their love does last
Where poverty is / all love is clearly past
Love is conuenyent / to a man of sad dyscrecyon
For mad lovers set little by their friends
Their hertes be so take by loves prouocacyon
To dreme and syghe / and behold their semelynes
To the praise of their lovers al things they do expres
They have eyes and se not / and wit without reason
Thus be they brought to shame and confusyon

Amator. If fortune be to us / sometime contrary
And that love has put us / to anoyaunce
Fortune will turn / and love will apply
To them that seek it / in space and contynuaunce
Love heals quyckely / all sorrow and greuaunce
All thing is pleasure / that we lovers covet
Love causes us / our sorrow to forget
Against age / none can make assystence
If beauty fail / should love be mynysshed
Kyndnesse and love / would them recompense
For that they have had / for to be cherysshed
Love seldom decays / but sooner is increased
The bond of wedlock / them also does combynde
Unto their death / to be steadfast and kind
Man's reason to nature does apply
For no man can have greater delectacyon
Than with women to converse and company
And with them to have carnal copulat you
To sow their sweet sede of generacyon
what better pleasure may a man covet
Than children of his own sede to begee
God created woman for man's pleasure
without them the world could not multyply
Arystotell says / it is the greatest pleasure
Unto a man / the thing most necessary
To have a wife / of excellent beauty
Curteys / gracyous / steadfast / wife / and sad
Were not a man happy / that such a lover had
Such there be / and many in the nombre
If some be light / and unstable of condycyon
Ye ought not / on all other for to wondre
Let every for them self / make declaracyon
And as they have deserved / so regard the person
Full many in trouble / steadfast proved be
Suffryng for their husbands / both pain and pouerte
Like as the daughter / will morn and bewail
without of the mother / she be conforted
In likewise love / can no time prevail
without of gladness / it be nourysshed
There is no lover / but that he is auaunced
Sometime in myrthe / to have delight and pleasure
Or else their sorrow / they might no while endure
What causes a man / to love sooner apply
Than a quycke wit / gentylnesse and good living
Unto a wise man / it is most necessary
That can keep counseyll / and is sad of gouernynge
Their right and honest / always dyffendynge
Unkindness and shames / they utterly defye
wherefore in true love / all nobleness dothelye

Consultor. For asmoche as these words can not refrain your heart
Take ensample by them / yt have been deceived
And in thy mind / prudently aduerte
First of king Dauyd be it remembered
For all his holiness / auoutry he committed
with one Barsabe / Wife unto Vrye
And after for her sake / caused him to dye
Specta. of lo.
King Solomon yt all men in wisdom did excel
By women was enclyned unto ydolatry
The wife of king Acab / called Iesabell.
The prophets of god caused for do dye
Prognes her sone / roasted full truly
And gave him to Tereo / her husband to eat
Because her sister Phylomine / with child he begete
Sampson the strong / Was also betrayed
By balida his lemman / in whom he had confydence
Vyrgyll by a woman / in a basket was hanged
A woman rode on aristotell / with shame and vyolence
Thus were they vaynquysshed / for all their science
Medea / slew her child / like a cruel mother
And gave Jason one part / and took her self the other
The Cytees of troy / and also of Thebe
By woman's trespass / was brought to destruccyon
The wife of king Mynos / called Pasyphe
Made a Cow of wood / like in proporcyon
Covered with a skin / by which decepcyon
To fulfill her lust / with a Bull she meddled
Of whom Mynotawre / the monster she conceived
Of many other / I could rehearse the living
But for my purpose / these do no we suffyse
what auayled their holiness / wisdom and cunning
Or strength / sithe women can them so entyse
To do that thing / that men should them despise
Is not he mad / seeing the experyence
That will have in them / trust or confydence

Amator. I marvel that ye could speak or think the same
For the trespace of few / on all other for to rail
Pretending by your words them utterly to dyffame
How be it your saying / shall nothing prevail
For of as many good women I shall make rehersayle
The merytes of whom / are asmoche to be praised
As the vices of the other / should be dyscommended
Mynerua of Athenes / was called the gods
Of her wisdom / for her cunning and polycy
Carmenta of latin / found first the letters
Nycostrates also / the letters of Italy
what say you to the sybylles / with their great prophecy
Aregenes found also / first the craft of weuynge
Thus did they excel men / by their wit and cunning
What man can give them praysynge conuenyent
which studied so besyly / to get fruytfull science
To provoke man's heart / to study to be dylygent
who can express / the wifely pacyence
Of Grysell / or of Penolype the prudence
The stedfastnes of Lucres / against her will rauysshed
which slew her self / after the deed publysshed
Who will not praise the faithful and true Orestyll
which when she same Mercus prolancus to ship goo
That was her husband / against her mind and will
For his love fell down there deed for woo
Elyssa / after the death of her husband Dydo
For sorrow ran / unto the funeral fire
Her body with her lords / to brenne was her desire
Of Arthemesya / Porcya / and also Tysbe
Iudyth / Iulya / Valerya / and Hester
Reed the hystoryes / there shall ye plainly se
from steadfast love / they never did dysseuer
For length of time / their stories I dyffer
And for their virtues / I afferme certainly
That men ought them to praise and magnyfy

Consultor. If men considered / the trouble and the pain
That they should suffer when they be married
I think they would them self soon refrain
In eschewynge the dannger / that after should proceed
For an heavy life / many of them do led
which for to treat of / in every cyrcumstaunce
It would ask / a long contynuaunce
Some of them do wake / when yt they should sleep
Some for their lyuynges / labor contynually
Other adventure them / in to perils deep
where they lose life / and substance suddenly
Thus do they live in dread and ieoperdy
Some stele or borowe / to bear their importune charge
Some hanged / some in prison and dare not go at large
Some to bring up their children / are ententyfe
And greatly troubled / for their untowardness
Some with their wives / continue an heavy life
As in chiding / fighting / and other frowardness
Some by Ialousy / are put in heaviness
In care / trouble / sorrow / and seldom in tranquyllyte
Such is their life / never at no certeynte
For if she be fair / she shall have great resort
And for her beauty she shall be much desired
Few men will have pleasure or confort
To take a wife which that is dyfformed
A fair wife to keep a man does stand in great dread
A foul wife to him is but little pleasure
Thus is their mind neither stable nor sure

Amator. Hold your peace / your words are frustrate
To allege in marriage such importunyte
For many men are so fortunate
That never were married / nor never shall be
No man can continue always in felycyte
For man is predestynate by fortunes operacyon
To live in this world in trouble and vexacyon
If men should follow their natural dysposycyon
Between beestes and them there were no dyfference.
Wherefore for to have natures operacyon
By wedlock it is suffered to be without offense
Otherwise to do / is shame and inconuenyence
Both gods law and man's / he offends grievously
Wherefore no man can say / but wedlock is necessary
Better than chaste love / what thing is to be loved
Which is grounded in holiness and also in honest
Frendshyp and affynyte is thereby increased
In one body together joined be
Children borne in wedlock be lawful and fre
They be combyned with bond so charytable
That nothing but death can make them separable
Love must be first / or they be married
For by the bond of love marriage is consecrate
There ought nothing / more to be commended
Than love that with charity / and peace is confyderate
For there as is love / there seldom is debate
And if among lovers / happen any varyaunce
Seldom it is seen of any long contynuaunce
It is long of their husbands / if they do not well
wherefore ye do now / accuse them wrongfully
To follow their minds / men may them compel
But women can not to theyrs apply
what cause has a man to be than in ialousy
For if any trouble be / anger or varyaunce
women bear the brunt / and suffer the penance
What pleasure it is for a man to take a foul wife
without her virtue be the more acceptable
Full often he shall be weary of his life
A fair wife to him / shall be more agreeable
As good and as kind / and as much profitable
Folly it is / to have them mystrusted
For ill they may be / if they be so dysposed

Consultor. When brom bear apples / or homlockes honey
Than trust the words of women / and stedfastnes
That nature has given them / no man can deny
It is their proprytees / to be full of dysceytfulnes
To weep and spynne / and hyde no secretnes
To lie and flatter / such condycyous they have
Few other good propryte^s / god unto them gave
Beware of women / for they be fraudulent
Their words are venym / mengled with honey
Thou know her saying / you know not her intent
A fool is he / that in them does affye
Tell them thy council / and they will it dyscrye
Imparfyte / dysceytfull / and full of mutabylyte
Such is their kind / nature and properte
Women can look on men / with face double
For in their hertes / they be full varyable
Their feigned love / has put many men to trouble
Which have supposed them / to be ferme and stable
By blandysshynge words / their bayte detestable
Like the Scorpyon / that shows the face smiling
And with the tail / suddenly does stynge.

Amator. Fie fie for shame / ye do rail in your sentence
Them so to dysprayse / it is not commendable
Sith they bebounde / by virtue of obedyence
To obey their husbands / and to them to be seruysable
Not as a servant / but by love charytable
And as a friend / to be to them steadfast
In word and deed / while that their lives last
Why do ye despise women / so shamefully
Sith that in these offense / that men be more infecte
what is he that Justly can deny
In none of them / that he may be detect
Some women in wisdom / have better cyrcumspect
Than some have / with wisdom and prouydence
To eschew such shame / and inconuenyence
To have a friend / it is a synguler pleasure
who can have a better / than his wedded wife
For she can do to him no dyspleasure
Sith she is partener / of all his sorrow and strife
with him she must contynewe all her life
And to her power to help them at their need
For of their husbands they stand in fere and dread
Women be full of pity and compassyon
Their merytes can not be to much praised
Love is in them / by nature and complexcyon
Of hertly kyndnes / to men so perfyxed
In welthe and woe it is not mynysshed
All pain and trouble / they take agreeable
That might for us be good and profitable

Consultor. Now adays old women / and young go straungely
Like comen women / their apparel is dysguysed
To provoke young hertes / their desires to apply
Their here dysplayed / their faces painted
Their gowns low collered / their breasts enhaunced
Such ven ym they profer / though it be not acceptable
yet is their intent / approved dampnable
Thus few of them / do regard their honest
And follow their pleasure / and sensual delectacyon
For at feestes and esbatementes there will they be
where young people resort / for their recreacyon
which are dysposed / by natural inclynacyon
To talk and dally / and besyly to procure
To provoke them to apply to their disordynat pleasure
All thing that youth and courage can delight
At such feestes as is prepared comynly
Their minds to solace and pleasure to excyte
As good metes and drynkes / merry talking and mynstralsy
Dauncynge and singing / and iestes of rybaudry
Which brings women to such perplexyte
That they forget both shame and honest
O what great myschefe ensued and aduersyte
For that queen Helyn by colored devotion
Went to Uenus temple there Paris was for to se
And the other troyans making their oblacyon
To se the experyence she had delectacyon
If his beauty were as it was reported
Where by her argument after she was rauysshed
Under such color they used their hau^tes dampnable
To be new fangled it is their properte
And blasyngly to show their beauty delectable
And to be prompte in speaking such is their felycyte
By such means they break their wedlock and chastyte
For the ship should never by tempest spyll
If in the haven it continued still
When ye have a wife keep her from lyberte*
On her do not dote nor be not to tender
For by such means she will have such felycyte
That of the she will not stand in any fere
To much famylyaryte / dysdayne does engendre
Without dread be / love they soon forget
Love and dread together ill purpose does let
Specta. of lo.

Amator Why should not women unto feestes resort
One friend with another I think ordynate
To pass the time with honest game and sport
For to be solytary* the mind is fatygate
To be in company / the mind is recreate
Ill thoughts and humors / engenders of ydlenes
It shorteth the life with sloth and heaviness
To were such apparel / it is the guyse compnly
From the comen usage they may them not refrain
Their husbands pleasures for to satysfy
To were new facyons they must be glad and feign
Or as an abiecte they will at them dysdayne
And as unworldly they shall be else reprobate
Not regarding their honest and estate
To go on pilgrimage it is merytoryous
For god would be worshypped in many a sundry place
Both to body and soul it is commodyous
For by it the soul purchases pardon and grace
It febleth the body by contynuaunce and space
Their hertes to more devotion does enclyne
Wherefore at their doing men ought not to repyne
To keep their wedlock they have great dylygence
If they break wedlock they live in worldely shame
To god they make an heavy offense
Their husbands honesty they utterly dyffame
Wrong heirs enheryte by their importune blame
With peaaunce they may their sins puryfy
But the trespass and sclaundre they can never remedy
Full little a man / regards his honest
If he keep his wife / in such subieccyon
That seldom she should have any lyberte
with her friends to have recreacyon
To keep them to streyte / it is a prouocacyon
To cause a good woman / her husband for to hate
For if she be ill / nothing can her abate

Consultor. women be lykened / to the Chymer of Thesayle
Having the symylytude / or heed of a lion
The body of a Got / the last part or tail
Unto a Chure / a venymous Dragon
To this monstre / by their dysposycyon
They be lykened / by the poets faynynge
For. iij. pryncypall vices in them most reygnynge
First they do look / with a lions countenance
To have preemynence / they desire utterly
And that men should them / in every place auaunce
And to them do service / pleasure or curtesy
They frete in their hertes / for dysdaynt and envy
If they se any better / than they be apparelled
Or better taken / or more to be commended
The second to a Got / for sin and vycyousnesse
They be lykened / and to the sea swalowynge
A man shall never find them out of redynesse
How much he will do / he shall have no denyenge
But always more and more / they be coueytynge
And for as much / as one cannot suffice their appetyte
To have help of many / some of them delight
The. iij. they be lykened / to a dragon venymous
For their beys tongues / that always talk and clatter
If they be dyspleased / than be they so fumous
That they care not what they say or who they sclau^der
Much grudge and quarelynge myschefe and danger
Ensues by their tongues serpentyne
which are so double that they can byte and whyne

Amator. To dysprayse women it can not you prevail
Their good names by you can not be empayred
It becomes no man on them so to rail
Though some have done amysse all have not offended
For one woman's trespass should all be dyscommended
No man will repute your saying reasonable
To allege on them such vices detestable
Men give them preemynence by custom and curtesye
Though that women would they can it not refrain
Their duties they must use and occupye
Not by no pride such custom they do use
They are not so ignorant them self so to abuse
Nor to dysdayne any that them does excel
In beauty substance or good apparel
The Philosopher says it is expedyent
The gentle to be of greater strength and virtue
The pacyent in nature more feeble and impotent
For if they were equal than might they not subdue
The one the other nor no fruit should ensue
wherefore the oldest man is of more hoter kind
Than the hotest woman that any man can find
Why should not women / of their tongues be rise
To plede their causes / their trewthe to veryfy
They have none other armoure dyffensyfe
Their power is to feeble / their wrongs to iustyfy
To speak nor to do / none can live so pacyently
Though that they chyde / their anger is soon past
Their words of wind / is lyckened to ablast
Ten months / women with their children go
And of their bodies / that time be they nourysshed
with panges and stytches / they suffer pain and woe
In peril of death / when they be delivered
with their milk after / a season they be fed
Much pain and trouble / our mothers for us take
wherefore all women / we ought to love for their sake
To make of women men should be glad and feign
Sith they to us / be so tender with dylygence
One man for another / would not take the pain
Their kyndnesse we can not duly recompense
To love them we have good cause / by experyence
They are so much our friends in sycknesse and in health
He that them hates / loves not his welthe

Consultor. We will no longer / in these matters debate
Follow my counsel / his company eschew
If ye entende your sorrow to mytygate
In secret places / do not ye continue
Imagynacyons and thoughts / your mind will subdue
wherefore such hauntes / if ye do not cease
Love will in you / more and more increase
Experyence by fire / which is nygh quenched
with brymstone it will be kyndled soon again
In likewise love / if it be frequented
wherefore from her love / do your self refrain
Find some occasyon / at her to dysdayne
To desire her love / be not ye to mad
Except of yours / that she would be as glad

Amator. To give me such counsel / me think ye be not wise
Your sugared lyppes can not me begyle
For if I should follow your advise
My life would continue / but a small while
From her company / I can not me exyle
To leave that thing / which that I love best
No reasonable man / will make no such request
Wherefore of this talking / now let us cease
Eusamples I have / right many and excellent
Their wisdom and nobleness / for to increase
But at this time / these shall be competent
Wherefore from hensforthe / leave your false argument
And of women speak not so reprouable
For shame it is to you / and nothing commendable

Consultor. Thus did we fynysshe / our communycacyon
Desiring the assystence to take this agreeable
And in that is amysse / to make reformacyon
And also all women / I humbly them supply
At this poor treatise / for to have none envy
I have nothing said / that is to their dysprayse
But I have made answer / their honor more to raise
But for asmoche as some men have delectacyon
To rail upon women and them to dyscommende
I therefore entende to make demonstracyon
Of their opprobryous words / wherein they do offend
By reasonable answers to enduce them to amend
Whereby they may have perfytly knowledge
That women be not gyite in that they do allege
Wherefore I require you consider mine intent
Which made it not for malice or any despytefulnesse
For if I should so do / I were right neclygent
And worthy to be rebuked of shame and vngentylnesse
Both praise and dysprayse herin I do express
If I deserve blame in speaking so largely
I trust to have thank for replyenge the contrary

Lenuoy of Robert Coplande.
ENdeuer thy self thou little book I pray
To thine auctoure and unto each degree
Excusing thine impressyon always
If to their mind it fortune not to be
And where mysse is / that they will pardon me
And to correct after their good intent
With less or more as it is conuenyent.
Finis.
