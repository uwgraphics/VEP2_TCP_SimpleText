A pleasant new Court Song, Between a young Courtier, and a Country Less.
To a new Court Tune.


Upon a Summers time,
in the middle of the morn,
A bonny Less I spide,
the fairest ere was borne,
Fast by a standing Poole,
within a meddow green,
She laid her self to cool,
not thinking to be seen.
She gathered lovely flowers,
and spent her time in sport:
As if to Cupids bowers
she daily did resort.
The fields afford content
unto this maiden kind,
Much time, and pains she spent,
to satisfy her mind.
The Cowslip there she cropped,
the Daffadill and Dazie:
The Primrose looked so trim,
she scorned to be lazy,
And ever as he did,
these pretty posies pull,
She rose and fetched a sigh,
and wished her apron full.
I hearing of her wish,
made bold to step unto her:
Thinking her love to win,
I thus began to woo her,
Fair maid, be not so coy,
to kiss thee I am bent:
O fie, she cride, away,
yet smiling gave consent.
Then did I help to pluck
of every flower that grew,
No herb nor flower I mist,
but only Time and Rue.
Both she and I took pains
to gather flowers store,
Until this maiden said,
kind sir, I Will have no more.
Yet still my loving heart
did proffer more to pull,
No sir, quoth she, i will part,
because mine apron's full.
So sir, i will take my leave,
till next we meet again:
Rewards me with a kiss,
and thanks me for my pain.
The Second part. To the same Tune.


IT was my chance of late,
to walk the pleasant fields:
Where sweet tuned chirping birds,
harmonious music yields.
I lent a listening ear
unto their music rare:
At last mine eye did glance
upon a Damsel fair.
I stepped me close aside,
under a Hawthorne bryer:
Her passions laid her down,
ore-rul'd with fond desire.
Alack fond maid she cride,
and straight fell a weeping,
Why suffer thou thy heart,
within a false ones keeping?
Wherefore is Venus Queen,
whom maids adore in mind,
Obdurate to our prayers,
or like her fondling blind:
When we do spend our loves,
whose fond expense is vain?
For men are grown so false,
the cannot love again.
The Queen of love does know,
best how the matter stands,
And Hymen knows, I long
to come within her hands.
My love best knows my love,
and love repaies with hate,
Was ever virgins love,
so much unfortunate?
Did my love fickle prove
then had he cause to fly:
But I Will be judged by love.
I loved him constantly.
I hearing of her vows,
set bashfulnesse a part,
And strived with all my skill,
to cheer this maidens heart.
I did instruct her love,
where love might be repaid:
Could I, quoth she, find love,
I were an hap^y maid.
I straight in love replide,
in me thou Love shall find:
So made the bargain sure,
and eased the Maidens mind.
FINIS.
