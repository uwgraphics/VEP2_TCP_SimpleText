A Confutatio^ of vnwritte^ verities / both by the holy scriptures and most
ancient autors / and also probable arguments / and pithy reasons / with plain
aunswers to al (or at the least) to the most part and strongest arguments /
which the adversaries of gods truth / either have / or can bring forth for the
proof and defense of the same unwritten vanities / verities as they would have
them called: made by Thomas Cranmer / late Archbishop of Cantorburie / Martyr
of god / and burned at Oxford for the defense of the true doctrine of our
savior Christ / translated and set forth / by E. P.

The contents whereof / thou shalt find in the next side folowinge.

The contents.
First / the preface of the translator to his contrye men and brethren of
England. Ca. i. That the word of god / written and contained within the Cannon
of the Bible / is a true / sound / perfect / and whole doctrine / containinge
in it self fullye all things needful for our salvation. ii. That the
writings of the old fathers / without the written word of God / are not
able to prove any doctrine in religion. iii. That general counsels have no
auctorytye to make new Articles of our faith. iiii. That nothing can be proved
by oracles of Angles / touching religion. v. That apparicions be vnsufficiente
to that purpose. vi. Neither at miracles able to prove the same. vii. Custom
also is of no strength in this case. viii. Reasons against unwritten verities.
ix. Scriptures alleged by the papists for vnwritte^ verities / with answers
to the same. x. Doctors to the same purpose / with their aunswers. The papists
objections with aunswers unto them.
The Preface.
WHat Chrystyan heart (dearelye beloved contremen and brethren / in our
savior Christ) can abstain from deep sobbes and sorowefull syghinges? What
natural and kind hearted man can forbear weping / so often as he calls to
rememberaunce the Lords vyneyarde within the Esaie. v. ^.
realm of England (which he himself had of late so stronglye hedged /
walled and fenced round about / by the princes of most famous memory / Kings
and rulers, ought to be aiders and not inuaders, helpers and not hurters,
defenses and not offenses to gods people.
King Henry the eighte / and Edward the sixte / and planted therein the pure
vine of his own blessed word / by Godly preachers his gardeners) to be so
suddenly broken down / destroyed / wasted and wrooted up by the roots / by the
wild bore of the wood / and the beasts of the field / that is / by the
Romish Psalm, lxxx.
Bishop and his bloodye ministers: and now in the same vineiard to see
planted / take root and prosper brambles / briars / and he^lockes / that is /
gross ignorance / naughty doctri^e^ false worship of God / and such other
kinds of most stinkynge / vile and filthye weeds. Gods word is a svvete and
pleasant grape and comfort the heart of man to everlasting salvation. psa.
ciiii. b
Oh what a sweet and pleasant grape of godly doctrine was the^ gathered in
England / to the great comfort and rejoicing of al the^ / that louinglye tasted
thereof? Then was gods word (for that is the sweet and pleasant grape / that
makes glad the heart of man) with great freedom preached / earnestly embraced
/ and with gredy hearts in all places received.

Then was Gods great glory maruelously auaunced. Then the only merytes of
Christ / then true repentance for our former sins / then trust in gods
mercy through the death of our sauyoure Christ / with a new Christian life /
was truly published / and preached every where. Then was there the common prayer
rightlye used / and the Sacraments (Baptism I mean and the holy Communion) in
such a tongue and language set forth / that all people might understand
them. Then were they plainly ministered without any iuglinge or sorcerie /
according to Christ's institucyon and the rule of his holy word. Which word
/ at that time / had the price and bare the bell away through out the whole
land.

With that were all pulpettes filled / Churches garnished / pri^ters shoppes
furnyshed / and every man's house decked. (...) ^^tes of the most part were
naked, bare and empty, as the proof now, alas to well declares. Sin is
the cause vvh^ god takes his word from any people.
With gods word was every ma^s mouth occupied / of that were al so^ges,
enterludes / and plays made. But (alas) so long / till all was playde under
the boorde. But what was the cause of all this? Truly none other thing / but
our own sins and wickedness. For we were talkers only and not walkers /
lip gospellers, from the mouth outewarde and no farther. We were even such /
as the prophet speaks of / saying: Esai. xxix.
this people honoreth me with their lyppes / but are far from me with their
hearts. We could speak of gods word / and talk gloryously thereof: but in
our hearts we were full of pride / malice / envy / covetousness /
backebitynge / riosing / harlot hauntinge / no whitte bettered at all / then we
were before / under the Popes kingdom. Nothing was in us amended but only our
tongues / no nor they neither / if I shall speak ryghtly and as the truth was
in deed. For besides our communycacion of scripture / we used detraction of
our neighbor / filthy talk / with many proud bragges of our selves. We red
not the scryptures / neither hard them for any amendmente of our own wicked
lives: but only to make a brag and a show thereof / to check and to taunte
others / yea and to spy small motes in other men's eyes / but nothing desyerous
to see the great beams in our own. Math. vii. a.
This I say (to talk and not to walk / to say and not to do) was not only
amongst the unlearned sort: but also amongeste the great clerks and chief
preachers of gods word.

Which thing (as I judge) was the only cause / why god / by his just
judgment / suffered his elect and chosen vynclarde to be thus trodden down /
wroeted up / and myserably afflicted by this bloodye Bore of Rome / and the
fa^te Bulls of Basan / his cruel officers. Psalm. xxii.
This is the cause / why God has suffered this great Antichryste to disgrace
the merits of Christ's passion / and in place thereof / to set up men's
merytes / and in stead of his sufficyent satisfaction upon the cross once for
all / to set up his masses satisfactorye for the sins / both of the quick
and dead. The Pope gives lies for truth, poison for norishinge sustenau^ce,
and ministers death for life.


This is the cause / that this mo^sterous beast has taught the invocation of
saints / and the same to be our medyators to God / and satysfyers for our
sins. Where as before / in the forenamed vyneyarde / was planted Christ
Jesus the true bread / that came down from heaven / and that John. vi. c,
most pure well of the water of life: John. iiii. b.
now / after the wroo^ing of this mo^sterous and ravenous Bore / are up spronge
coniured bread / coniured water / to drive away evil spirits / and to pourge
our sins.

This bloody Bore / besides al mischeues that he has done to the vineyarde /
yet cease he not / with faggotfier / and all other cruel torments / to
constrain and compel men to worship Images / the work of men's hands / to
knele to them / to reverence the^ / to bow them / and with all manner of
obe^saunce to honor them / clean contrary to gods commandment / who
says: psalm. cxv. Hierm. x.
thou walte not make to thy self (much less then to honor / reverence / and
worship them) any graven Image / nor the likeness of any thing that is in
heaven above / or in the earth beneth / or in the water under the earth / thou
shall not bow down to them / nor worship them. Exo. xx. a.
But yet these shameless wretches be not abashed to say / that Images are
necessary / because they be lay men's books / teaching them / instructing them
/ and leading them to the true worship of god. Oh great blasphemy / Oh
sacrilege / Oh spitfull robbery. What is blasphemy / what is sacrilege / what
is robberi / if this be none? Gods word is sufficie^te to instruct al men in
the true worship of god, without images.
god gives his word written to be every man's book / and his pure /
everlasting and vnderfiled commandments / as sufficient instructions for
all men / to the true worship of him. But these earthly wroters (the Pope /
I mean / and his prelates) as though they were wiser then God / will teach men
to worship him with Images / although the same be vtterli forbidden by god /
through out the whole course of his holy scriptures. priests th^^ them selue^
vviser the god.


These / and such other false and fained doctrines / contrary to the
scriptures of God / contained in his holy Bible / are now blown out /
biustered and yelled forth in every pulpit. Every streate sounds of these /
yea eueri prynters house is filled with such ungodly baggage / yea and the same
are commanded by public aucthority (which is much to be lamented) to be
set forth / and the sincere doctrine of Christ's holy word / clean put to
silence / and utterly condemned. Neither may any man reason / or once doubt
of their doctrine / under pain of excommunicacion / nay rather under pain of
burning.

And when the^ be able (as they are not able at any time in deed) to prove any
of these doctrines by the word of god written / then they fly to their
unwritten verites / that is / to certain things delivered (as they say) from
the Apostles by word of mouth without writing. The Pepe maintains his
doctrine by fire and faggot, and not by the holy scriptures.
Which things ar to all men uncertain: A vveake refuge, if they were not
obstinate and shameless.
for no man knows certainly / what they are. But whatsoever pleases them /
and makes for their purpose / profit / and Lordly ambicion: that is an
unwritten verite / not to be gain said / or denied. This is their shote anchor
/ bulwark / and extreme refuge / whereunto to they fly / whenever they are
forced / and constrained by gods word. These they make their foundation /
whereupon they build / and mayntaine all their supersticio^s / Idolatries and
heresies. Which foundacions I trust by gods grace and help so to shake /
both by the open scriptures / by the full consent of all the most ancient
writers / and by probable reasons / that the building thereupon shall have a
fall.

For this is most true / that no unwritten verite is / or can be necessary for
our salvation. If unwritten verites were necessary to salvation, then gods
word were not sufficient thereunto.
For then should the sacred and holy scriptures / written by the Apostles in
the spirit of god / and sealed with their bloodes / seem to be insufficient /
and not able to bring v^ unto salvation. But what a great blasphemye that
should be to God and his most holy spirit / all men (I trust) that list to
read the same scryptures / easily shall perceive. But when these unshame fast
robbers are put to their shifts / urged and forced herein / by the open and
manyfeste word written / then have they another starti^ge hole to crepe out at
/ cryinge and yelling: ^her^. vii. a. yea this is their strong tower and
bulvvarke of defense: and ieat vveake enough, not being vvalled about with
gods word gods true church, because it is grounded upon the word of grace,
can not err in matters of salvation.
templum domini / templum domini / templu^ domini etc. the church / the church
/ the church / affirmynge in plain words / that the church can in no wise
err / or be disceaued. And hear they disceaue themselves / because they make
no distinctyon or difference of the church. For there are two manner of
churches / one true / perfect and holy in the sight of god / and another false
/ imperfect and ungodly. Truth it is / that the true church of God / being
grounded / and set upon his holy word / (I mean the gospel of grace) can
not err unto damnacion. But the other / how shining and glorious so ever it
appear / if it wander abroad / and be not contained within the compass / and
lymets of the word written / is no true / but a fained and forged church. The
church that vvandereth from gods word written, may and does err in matters
of faith and salvation. galathi. i. b.
That Church / as it is without the compass of Gods promises made in truth /
not only may but also does commonli / yea continuallyer^e and go astra^e:
for they are not c^uppeled to the head Christ / which is the life / the way
and the truth. Paul the Apostle of god / and elect vessel of salvation /
writing to the Galathians / has these words: if we (says he) or an Angel
from heaven / preach any other gospel unto you / then that we have preached /
hold him a curse^: and yet the papists / not fearing the curse of God / ^are
be bold to teach things / which Paul never knew / yea things clean
contrary to his evident and manifest teaching. The papists fear not gods
curse.
Such gross Ignorance (I would to God it were but Ignorance in deed) ^s
entered into their heads / and such arrogaunt boldness possesses their hearts /
that they are bold to affirm no church to be the true church of god / but
that which stands by ordinary succession of Bishops / in such pompeous and
glorious sort / as now is seen. For if there be (say they) no such outward
and visible church / how shall any man know / whether he be of the church of
Christ / and in the right belefe / or no^ To this I answer / that if our faith
should be stayed upon the outward / glisteringe / and pompeous church / not
ruled / nor governed by the determinate counsel of God in his word written:
we should never be certain thereof / but ever wavering and doubting / which is
the gate and ready path way to desperacion / from which god defend his
chosen flock. Cursed is he (says the scripture) that puts his trust in
man. Ierem. xvii*
And why? Psalm. cxvi* ^
for all men (as the kinglye Prophet David says) ar liars in their words /
and sinners in their works.

By which words it appears plain / that there was never man so virtuous /
so holy / nor so well learned / only the writers of the holy scripturs excepted
/ but either of Ignorance / or of negligence / there escaped some faults in
his writings and doings. Yea the general counsels themselves also / that
they make so much of / have notably erred / as hereafter shall be declared. The
general counsels have erred and that in no small trifles.
Yea such has been the truth of those seen churches / that one general
counsel has condemned another of heresy. Moreover / the outward seen
church / whereof they brag not a litel / has never since the beginning /
any space continued in the true doctrine of god. Let us begin at Moses / who
was the first law geuer / and we shall see the state of this outward church /
which consists in the ordinary succession of Bishops / whether it be so as
I have said or no. When Moses was gone up to the mount Sinai / to talk with
God / and to receive the law at his hands: Exodus. xxxii. a.
did not Aaron / the hiegh Priest and Bishop / with all the people / in the mean
space worship the golden Calfe? read the book of Judges / and you shall see how
the whole outward and visible church fell to Idolatry and worshippinge of
strange gods: as Baal / Astaroth / gods of the Edomites / Moabites /
Philistines / and the Sirians. After the reign of king David / how many
kings were there (I pray you) in whose time false gods were not openly
worshipped? All the kings of Israel served strange gods with the consent of
the Bishops / priests / and the hole people. And in Judah / there passed
not.iii or four kings after Dauyd / in whose days open Idolatrye was not
allowed and practysed / by the consent of the kings / Bishops / hyegh
priests / Scrybes and Pharisees. Which of the Prophets did not the open and
visible church persecute? Where was the visible church in the time of Elias?
Were not al / that were known and thought to be of the church / worshyppers
of Baal: in so much that Elias thought there had been left alive of gods true
church / but himself only? And yet not wythstandynge God had preserved his
church / known but only to himself / for he knows who ar his. 2. Tim. 2.
Who smote Micheas the true Prophet of God / but the chief Priest and Bishop
Zedechias? 3. Reg. 22.
And he / with four hundred Pryestes more of his own mind and religion /
disceaued Achab / and promised him victory over the Assirians / although God
had made them no such promise / but rather had pomted the contrary / as it
came to pass. Hiere. 20
Vho commanded Jeremy to be beaten for his true prophesyeng / but Phashur the
Archbishop? Who persuaded with the king / that Jeremy / the true Prophet of
God / was a sedicious fellow / and went about to discorage the people in
Jerusalem that they should not resyste Nabuchodonozor king of Babylon / but
the priests? This and such like, is the reward of al true preachers and
faithful servants of god.
Yea / and when the king delivered him out of prison / who but these holy men
of the Church / procured him to be cast again into a deep doungyo^ where
they would have famyshed him / if God had not put in the kings heart to take
him out and deliver him? These be the fruits and practyses of the vysyble and
seen Church / which / if it be true that the papists say / cannot err.
But what so ever they say it forces not: for we know what the spiritualty /
as they call themselves / have bee^ since the beginning / the very expressed
image whereof is set forth and declared in the Machabies / as they that read
the story shall perceive it well enough / by Alcinus / Simo^ / Jason / and
Menelaus. 1. (...). vii. et. ii. Machabeorum. iiii.
Now let us come to the new testament and see what the visible and known
church was under it. Who was the true church / or how was it known to the
people in Christ's time? The hiegh Priests / Bishops / Scribes / Pharisees /
and Saduces / which appeared outwardly and boasted themselves to be the
church of god: were in deed / as Christ called the^ / ser pe^tes / the
generacions of vipers / hipocrites / children of hell / painted tombs / perse
cuters of true religion / and murderers of the prophets / yea of himself and
his Apostles: Math. iii. b. xii. c. xxiii. d.
men that shut up the kingdom of heaven / so that neither they would enter
therein themselves / nor suffer the poor simple / that were desierous to know
the truth / to enter: but excommunycated / and thrust them out of the church
/ as men cast away / as heretics / and forsaken of God / whosoever believed
on Christ. Who commanded the Apostles that they should preach no more in
Christ's name? Act. iiii. d Acts. vii. g. Euse. ecc. his. lib. ii. cap. xxii.
Act. ix. Acts. xxiii.
Who caused Steven to be stoned? And James to be thrown of the pinnacle? who
gave authority to Paul to bind / and bring before them / all that professed
Christ? Who commanded him to be buffeted? Who accused him before Festus and
Agrippa? Who stired the Gentiles against him in all countries / where he went to
preach / but the church? If you will then needs Judge the outward visible
church / that sits in Moses chayer (though they do not as the chair
requires) to be the true church of god: I pray you then tell me / who caused
Constantinus the Emperor to banyshe Athanasius? Ruffini. lib. i. cap xvii.
Who exiled Chrysostom / and many other more godly and well learned Bishops /
and slew a great number of godly and well learned me / but the Priests / by
seduci^g the Empris Eudoria? Socratis. Lib. 6. cap. 18.
who put out the eyes of Constantyne the forth Emperor and caused him to be
slain / because he pulled the Images out of the church / being worshipped
co^trari to gods holy will and commandment / but his own mother / by the
counsel of the Pope and the Bishops / being then taken for the Church? Mark
well the fruits of this outward church: and by them ye shall know what they
be.
Who deposed Henry the fourth Emperor / causing his own son to rebel
against him? Who deposed Childeri^us the french king / assoiling his subjects
from their obedyence to him and made Pipine king in his stead / but the Pope
and his Church men? Let us come to our own realm and speak of things done
in our own memory. Who procured king Henry the eyghte in the beginning of his
reign to war against the french king / where beesides the murder committed
/ adultery was learned / theft and sacrilege practiced / lying / swearing / yea
and for sweringe with all other kinds of vices used / which be the very
fruits of war / but the clergy? For the pope / the^ being in war with the
French king / to make his part good and the stronger / procured the Bishops of
the church of England / being the Popes dear darlings / and chief of the
kings counsel / to entytle the king to his right of the realm and crown of
France: and to encourage the young king thereto / the Pope accursed the king
of France and al his aiders and succurrers. Then free pardons flue abroad as
thycke / as butter flies in summer: the Pope makes him self equal to God,
yea rather above him in this his promise.
but so free / that the realm thereby and the said wars was robbed of a grate
deal of our treasure / and in manner half undone. There was full remission a
pena and culpa / preached at paul's cross / and almost in eueri sermon /
through al England: promisi^g that whosoever ever died in the Popes quarrel / his
soul should be in heaven before his bones were cold. After when the same king
Henrye had iustlye / by the aucthoryte of GODS word / and the full consent
both of the parliament / and conuocacion / abolyshed the usurped power of the
Bishop of Rome: then the Pope enterdyted the whole Realm / and sent Cardinal
Poole from prince to prince / to excite and move them (if he could have
brought it to pass) to make open war against the king and the realm / as it
appears in a Sermon preached by Tonstall now Bishop of Durham / and set
out in prynte openly. This is one of the practices of prelates.


Which sermon and al other tell truths / openinge the abuses and tirannye of
the Bishop of Rome / are now put to silence. Who were the workers of all these
mischeues? who these.iii. years paste / has persecuted / prisoned / and burned
so many learned and Godly men / only for their true faythes sake grounded
upon gods most holy word (men worthy to be compared with the old martirs of
the primitive church / as well for the constancye of their faith / as also for
patience and charity showed at their deaths) but the church / as they call
themselves? The spiritual man never persecuteth the carnal man, but forgeueth
him.
who / by their cruel tyranny / has enforced so many notable members of Christ
/ (leauinge wife / children / kinsfolk / Lands and goods) either to fly
into strange realms / or else from town to town / from City to City: only
because they would not drink of the venomous cup of the whore of Babylon?
Hier. ad Gala. iiii.
who has wrought al these wickednesses / but only the mitered prelates and
their popish priests? If we shall allow the^ for the true church of god / that
appear to be the visible and outward church / consistyng of the ordinarye
succession of Bishops: then shall we make Christ / which is an innocent lamb
without spot / and in whom is found no gile / to be the head of ungodly and
disobedient members. Exo. xii. i. Pet. ii. d
Which thing is as impossyble / as to make god / which is only good / and
nothing but goodness it self / to be the aucthor / original / and cause of
al evil. For Christ / as he is pure / holy and perfyte: even so must his
church and members be / to whom he (as the head) is adjoined and coupled. Ephesians.
1. d. Collos. 1.
But if we allow the Pope / his Cardinales / Bishops / Priests / Monks /
Chano^^ / Friars / and the whole rabble of the clergy / to be this perfect
church of god / whose doings are clean contrary (for the most part) to the
will / and commandment of Christ / left and expressed in his word written:
then make we him a sinner / and his word of none effect. For as sweet agrees
with sower / black with white / darkness with light / and evil with good: even
so this outward / seen and vysyble church / consisting of the ordinari
succession of Bishops / agrees with Christ. But there they will ask me / how
shall a man know whether he be in the right faith / but by this church? To this
Christ shall make answer himself / saying in the gospel of John / my sheep
hear my voice / and shall not hear a stranger. John. 10.
And where (I pray you) has Christ left any voice to be heard or followed /
but in his word written? Search the scriptures / says he: John. 5.
for they bear witness of me. Where he bids you not search unwritten verities
/ such as the outward / seen and pompeous church shall of their own heads
show you / but the written verities / contained in the holy scriptures /
which are profitable to teach / to improve / to amend / and to instruct in
righteousness / that the man of god may be perfet / and prepared unto all good
works. 2. Tim. 3.


If thou therefore be desyerous to know whether thou be in the right faith
or no / seek it not at ma^s mouth: Psa. 116. c Gods word only certifyeth a
man whether his faith be good or no.
for all men be liars. Seek it not (I say) at a proud / glorious / and wave
ringe sort of Bishops / and priests: but at gods own mouth / which is his
holy word written / which can neither lie / disceaue / nor be disceaued. As
(...) (I say) seek / and knock by dylygent study / and earnest prayer unto god
/ who has promised to give to al the^ / that ask faithfulli of him the
certai^ti of good faith in their conscience / taught and confirmed by the holy
scryptures of the old and new testament. And here I forbid no man as though
they should not ask and learn of the learned: for that is good and necessary
/ yea and allowed by gods truth / but this would I have all men to do / to
use discretion / and wisdom in this matter: Try every spirit but allow none
further then they agree with the written scriptures.
and to know whether they be learned / godli minded / and able to instruct by
the scriptures or no. And yet if they be / believe them no further / then they
can show their doctrine and exhortacion to be agreeable with the true word of
god written. For that is the very touch stone / which must / yea and also will
/ try all doctrine or learning whatsoever it be / whether it be good or evil
/ true or false. Gods word tries all things whether they be good or badde.
And let not men of small learning be to curious in askyng or moving dark and
doubtful questions / which bread contencio^ rather then godly edyfieng but
let them be content with the plain and open places of the scriptures. Let
the^ rather be earnest to observe the commandments of faith and love /
which are plainly set forth in Gods book / then to trouble themselves / and
busy their heads with dark places: for that is a thing that has done / and
also does displease god very greatly. Yea I think surely / that these heavy
plagues / where with god most justly punishes now this realm of England
(which I beseech him of his infinite mercy either to take clean away / or
else to mitigate them for his elect sake) comes not so much for the simple /
innocente / and unlearned sort / which being begiled through their
simplicite / by the craft and subtyltie of the wily papystes / do still
continue in supersticion and Idolatrye: but rather for the curious sort / which
preach strange and far fetched doctrynes / nothing so much to edyfieng as
to contencyous brawling. Yea I would to god there were not a great number of
them / that were and are counted learned / which preach and defend doctrines
/ which themselves know to be untrue / and contrary to the evident scriptures.
Would god there were not many hu^dreds of great gospellers sometimes / that had
not subscribed with their own hands and confirmed by their open and public
sermons, the contrary of that / which they once builded in Christ. And some of
such (I know) in persuading priuatlye with their old friends, and acquai^tau^ce
/ have confessed no less / but that they have done contrary to the truth / and
the good perswatio^ of their own conscience: Their consciences shall therefore
cnode^ne the^ for so doing, if they repent not in time.
and yet the same me^ counsel their fre^des for unity and peace sake (as they
term it) but rather there maisai for fear of loss of goods and life to obey
wicked supersticio^s / naughty rites and damnable laws. But what peace / or
what unity is that / that is a gaynst god and his Christ? And what profits
it a man to win all the world and lose his own soul? For he that loves his
own life more the^ me (says christ) is not worthy of me. Math. 16
For these men's sakes therefore / that is to say / the stubburne papists /
that lead the world in blindness / contrary to their own co^scie^ces: the
wit and virtue of delicate gospellers is in their tongues.
and specialli for delicat gospelers sakes / whose wit and virtue is in their
tou^gs / hot disputers / busi talkers / tau^ters and fault fi^ders with others
/ rather the^ me^ders of themselves: for these two sorts sakes chefly (I say)
god heapeth these great plages / that is persecucio^ of his word / dearth /
danger of war / and people of strange nations / likely to subdue and vtterli
distroy that our realm / except they repent / and amend their lives in time /
and beco^e not o^li forgetful of their former evils: but also dilligent workers
and true folowers of the word / that they have so lightlye condemned / and
refused. Which if they do not / let the^ be suer / that all the plages which are
written in the book of god / and all the blood of his saints / which has been
shed from just Abel unto this present time / shall be poured upon the^. Math. 23.
But howsoever these me^ do / let us (dear brethren) whose hearts god of his
goodness has more mercyfulli touched / repent and amend our former lives / and
cease from al dead works / lest we be partakers of the same plagues with
them. But thanks be unto our god / that has so gentlye ordered us / for this
we know / that god suffers not his people long to follow their own mynder:
but shortly punishes them / which is a token of his great louinge kindness
toward them. ii. Match. vi. b.
For this grace have we of God more the^ other people (as it is written) that
he suffers not us long to sin unpunished like other nations / that when
the day of judgment comes / he may punyshe them in the fullness of their
sins.

If we sin he corrects us / but he never wythdraweth his mercy from us /
and though he punish us with aduersitye / yet does he never forsake his
people. Ebru. xii
For who^ (as Paul says) the Lord loves / him he chasteneth: yea and he
scourges every son / whom he receaueth. But to leave this digressyon and come
to our purpose again: I will brefelye show you / what the outward face of
the church and religion has been in all ages / even such as has pleased the
mighty ki^gs Emperors / and rulers of the world When Jeroboam set up golden
Calves at Bethel and Da^ / the Pryestes and Levites consented thereto / and all
Israel worshipped them contrary to gods commandment. ^. Para. 13

And generally / what relygyon so ever the king would have / that was
stablyshed for his time: As princes would, so all things were done.
so that (as Solomon says of the Judges) so mai^ we say of the Cleargy^:
whatsoever says the prince / that says the priest. But let us once again
come to the new testament. Did not the head rulers of the church / with the
authority of Herod and Pilate / condemn Christ and his doctrine as
erroneous and sedicious: Math. 26 Math. 27
and all the people followed and cried Crucifige? Did not all the Emperors
before Constantine / being seduced by their Bishops and priests / condemn
Chrystian religion as heretical / sedicious / and traiterous / and for the
same murdered many thou sands of martirs? When Constantyne was christened /
the was the true religion first set forth and openly preached by public
authority: and yet in the space between Christ and this Godly Emperor /
God was not without his church / though it were not known / seen and so
accepted of the world. In this Princes time / and by his aucthorite / was kept
the first and best general counsel of Nice: where was set forth our common
Creed / containing shortly the chief and most necessary articles of our belief.
This co^stantinus son Constantius / favoring the error of the Arria^s / in
the counsel of Arimine / decreed that Christ was not GOD / but man only.
Theodoriti. lib. 2 cap. 18.


And then to call Christ the son of God / was by the vtwarde known church
and by a general counsel / condemned for an heinous heresy. From that time
forth when Panim princes reigned / Idolatrye and worshippynge of false gods was
the public doctri^ When heretics reigned and bare the rule heresye was
openly preached for gods truth. The priests for the most part were double
faced, turn tippettes and flatteres*
When the Emperoures were Catholic / then was the true doctrine of the gospel
ope^li preached. And generally / such as was the faith of the Emperoures /
kings / or other rulers such did the priests preach. And if anibi the autorite
of gods word preched the^ contrary, or withstode their corrupt teachynges /
straight way he was either deposed from his office / condemned for an heretic
/ bani^^ed / brent / or put to some other cruel death After all these spronge
up the Pope / that triple crowned monster and great Antichrist / which took
upon him authority / not only over the Clergy / but also clymed above kings
and Emperors / deposing the^ at his pleasure / and settled him self in the
temple of god / that is / in the conseyences of men / exrolling himself above
God / dispensi^g with gods laws / and geuynge men leave to break them / and
to regard more his decrees / the^ the everlasting commandments of god. And
so it came to pass in time / that to eat flesh on the frydaye / or fasting dai
/ was counted greater sin the^ bro^kenes / adultery or perjury. And whi /
because his laws were diligentlyer and more strayghtly looked to / and the
offenders thereof sorer punished / then Gods laws. Sense this Antichrist of
Rome (I say) was stablished in his full power / what soever pleased him / that
was taken for gods law / and that was decreed upon by general counsel /
confirmed / and ratified by whole heaps of clearkes. To speak against that
was / and also now is / detestable heresy / and so heinous a crime against the
holy ghost (if it were true that they say) that it can not be forgeuen / either
in this world / or in the world to come. He that speaks against any of his
decrees / must utterly be condemned for an heritike / accursed of god / and
damned into hell for ever without redemption: These be the Popes thunder bolts
wherewith he fears the people, and makes them to incline to his ways.
except he recant / abjure / and de / ny the truth / and set forth error and
false doctrine / and promise with a solemn Oath / that he shall never preach
teach / nor defend the truth hereafter. Now let us come to our days. When
king Henry the.viii. was (as he ought to be by gods law) made supreme head /
as well of the Cleargye as of the Laite: he / by the consent of the parliament
and co^uocacion / set forth in printe a godly book of religion / not much
varieng from that / which was enacted in his sons time Edward the sixth.

But when he took displeasure with certain Bishops as they term them) of
the new learning because they would not give their consent in the
parliament / that the king should have al Abbye lands to his own use: It was
a small matter at that time to be displesed with such me^, and so much the more
for that they withstod private commodite.
but only such lands / as were given by his Aunceters / kings of England /
and that the residue of those lands should have been bestowed to Augmente
the number of learned men in the universities: to the foundinge also, of Grammar
schools in every shire of England / where children (most apt to learning)
should have been brought up freely / and without great rooste to their
friends / and kyns / folke^: to the foundyng of hospitales where pore and
impotent people should have been sufficientlye provided for / with phisicions
and surgeons / which should have ministered both phisik and surge^rye freely / not
only to them / but also to all other poor folk within this Realm: and also
in every shyre town / and other market towns / where should be thought most
mete and fit to set up diverse occupacions (most profitable for the common
wealth) where al valiant and sturdy beggars should have been set to work / and
if they refused to labor / then to force them there to by whipping / stocking /
and hunger: and the residue of the Abbye lands above these / should have been
reserved in the Common treasuries / to aid the king in his wars or other
affairs of his Realm / and thereby to have favored and eased the more his
subjects / intares / subsidies / fiftenes / and lones / and such other like
things: Private commodite, and Popish sutte Itie ouerca^e good public policy
and brought in tirannye.
king Henry / as I said before) upon the displeasure taken / and by the
incitacio^ of the old popish bishops / shortli after (by consent of the same /
or the most part of the^ / that were makers of the first book of religion) set
forth by open parliament and co^uocacion the.vi. articles* as well agreinge
with the former parlyament^ and the word of god / as black with white / light
with darkness / Christ with Belial / or with Antichrist. But after / when he
was pacified with these foresaid Bishops / co^sydering that they spoke
against the kings profit not of malice / but of good conscience and zeal to
gods glory and the commonwealth / he mitigated the.vi. articles / and from that
time forth / more and more / restored true religion / and I doubt not but if
he had lived he would have brought all things to a better state / then he
left it. But Edward the ^irte his son, succedynge in his sa^d fathers place
/ by the advice of his uncle the duke of Somersette / the lords of his
counsel / Bishops and the Clergy: ^et forth such a book of religion / as
(without boast or dysprayse of other be it spoken) was never a better set
forth since the Apostles time.

Now / after that god had plaged this realm with the most grievous plage that
ever came to it / in taking away from it so godly a king as he was / yea such
an one as has not bee^ read of / of his age / in any realm / both for wit /
learning / sobernes and godliness: They are al perjured, so many as gave their
consent to the bringing in of the Bishop of rome. The Bishops, I warra^te you
were none of those: for they can not err. these are wauer^ig redes, ct
perfect wether cocks, that turn with every wind.
in his stead he has set up Queen Marye / who in worte time has pulled down
/ that was not builded in many years / and brought in the bishop of Rome
(before justly and by law of parliament abolyshed) with open perjury of so
many / as gave their voices and consent to the same. For they had all made a
solemn oath before / never to receive his unjust usurped power into the realm
again.

Has he not (being seduced by the perjured prelates) revoked and made of none
effect / so many godly laws enacted by parlyament / that is / by the consent
of the lords both spiritual and temporal the Clergy and common house: yea
and by them / that were the thief of king Henry her fathers priuye counsel / and
setters one of him in the abolishing of the Bishop of Rome / ^uen op^n
preachers / and writers / against the Popes tyranny / with so pithy reasons and
strong arguments: as neither they themselves / nor any other after them, shall
be able at any time rightly to assoyle and answer? Yet these men were chief
of counsel / and procurers of the Queen / and first workers in the parliamente
to aluer the lords and commons / to receive the Bishop of Rome again for
the supreme head of this realm, contrari to Gods law / the laws of this
realm / and their own solemn oaths. By their deeds ye shall know the^, what
they be.
And not only this / but they have taken away the acts of mortmaine / and
praemunire / and diverse other statutes that did bridle the insatiable
coueteousnes and licencious liberty of the Popish Priests / and restored the
All ex officio. Which thing if it should long co^tinew in this state that it is
in / the great tresure of this realm should come into the Cleargies hands / and
a great part thereof should fly to Rome for. Bishope^ickes / Benefits /
Appellacyons / pardons / dispensacions and such other baggage. But (say the
Papystes) when scriptures be hard and doutful / and seem to be contrary one
to another by mistaking and wrong understanding / whereof diverse heresies do
arise: how shall a man know the truth in such diversity of opinions both
parties grounding themselves upon the scriptures / but only by the church /
which (as they say) cannot er^e? Saint Augustine shall make answer herein for
me / saying on this wise: In his.3. book of Christian doctrine cap 28.
dark places are to be expounded by more plain places / for that is the
surest way of declaring the scriptures to expound one scripture by another. In
his ^. book of Christian do^trine. cap 9.
And again he says that in things openly contained in the scriptures / are
found all things that concern faith good stuing and charity. In his ^* book
of m^^^es and forgeuenes of sins tom. 7. cap. v^^i.
And if any thig cannot be tried by the certain and cie^care places of the
Scriptures / let ma^s presu^ptio^ (says he) stay it self / not leaning to
either part: for this I am suere of / that if it were requisite to be known
upon pain of damnacion / their should not lack most plain and clear
aucthorites of the same in the scriptures. But in seking of the scriptures /
let us seek no farther then is left in writi^g by god our savior / lest in
desyerynge to much / we ^ese al. Saint Chrisosto^e also says: it is not
possible / that he / which with earnest study / and fervent desire / applies
him to the scriptures of god / should ever be neglected of god / but although
we lack a master to teach us: Upon Genesis. cap 14. hom. 35.
yet the Lord himself / enteryng our hearts from above / shall give light
into our minds / and pour his bright beams into our reason and understanding
/ and open the things that be hid / and teach us those things whereof we be
ignorant. Therefore (says the same Chrysostom) if thou will enter into the
truth of the scriptures / now ask by prayers / now knock by good works /
and search the old ancient writers / and ask diverse priests / to know
which be the true keye kepers / and which are In his imperfect work cap.
23.
the false. For all things (says he) are plain / and manifest in the divine
scriptures / what soever things are nedeful thereto be opened. But if these
aucthors will not satisfye them / then let them use saint James counsel /
saying: Jacob. 1. ^
he that lacks wisdom / let him ask it of god / which gives to al men
indifferentlye / and casts no man in the teth / and it shall be given him. For
God is not parciall / nor regards any more a Pope then a Potter / a Cardinal
then a Carter / a Bishop the^ a Boucher / a Priest then a Peddler / except his
faith and life be agreeable to gods will.

Whether should a man (desieryng to know the truth / and right under
standing and worshippinge of God) have resorted in Elias his time / when there
was no more of the true outewarde church / but he alone? To who^ should a man
have resorted for counsel of the truth / in the time of Jeremy? Of whom
should a man have learned the truth in Christ's time / when there was no
ordinarye succession of Bishops in the truth? Should they have learned
(think you) the truth of God of the head Pryestes / Scribes and Pharisees?
Then you know / what a learning they should have had / and how much Christ
should have profyted the^. How should a man have been satisfied of his
salvation at Annas / Cayphas and the test of the Pharisees hands? Even so no
doubt would they have taught and enstructed him / that if he had believed and
followed their sayings / Christ and he should never have met. And yet those
men bare the Image and name of the known church at that time / yea and the
same men condemned him of whom our faith and salvation depends / as a
sedicious fellow / as a traitor to Caesar / as an heretic / and a blasphemer of
god. Christ therefore / to teach us what we should do in matters pertaining to
his glory and our own commodite / sends his hearers to the scriptures / and
not to the church? he sai^edal so to the Saduces / ye err / because ye know
not the scriptures / and not because ye believe not the church. Math. 22.
He also promyseth his elect / that they shall hear his voice and not a
strangers voice. Mark. 12.
If ye be doubtful therefore in any point / resort to the Scryptures given
from GOD / Joan. 10. ^
and out of them search for the thing whereof thou art ignoraunte / and above
all things be not to rash in judgment / neither trust to much in thine own
wit.

Ask also counsel of such men / whom thou knoweste to be well learned and
exercised in the same Scryptures / and whose conversation thou seeste to be
agreeable to their words: and yet believe them no farther / then they can
prove their doctrines and exhortacyons to answer / and agree with GODS
mosre holy word. Seek / ask / cry / call / knock / fast / and pray with a
constaunte faith / ioynynge thereto a Chrystyan / sober and a charitable ^iuing:
and the he / that has the keye of David / who opens and no man shuts /
shall (according to his promise) give unto you all that you ask of his father in
his name / and shall send his holy spirit into your hearts: Apo. 3. b
who shall lead you into al truth / and put you in remembrance of all those
things / which Christ has commanded / nedeful and necessary for your
salvation. John. 15.
What so ever therefore the church teaches you out of the canonical books of
the Bible / believe that: but if they teach any thing beside that (I mean /
which is not agreinge with the same) believe neither that / nor them. For then
they are not the Church of Christ but the Synagog of Satan and Antichriste. For
the Church of God (as Saint Paul witnesses) ^s builded upon the foundation
of the Apostles and Prephetes / not upon the Apostles / but upon the same
foundation / which they laid / that is / Christ Jesus / and his holy^ word.
Ephe. 2. d
And all such unwritten veryties / as the Papists have in their mouths /
though they seem never so glorious a church to the face of the world / if they
be not agreinge (as they are not in deed) to the very word of god / suspect
them: yea rather I bid you utterly to abhor and reiecte the^. For their
vtwarde and seen church may and does (as is before proved) commonly err in
great and weighty matters. Stand fast therefore to sound and good doctrine /
and waver not. 2. John. epistle. c.
And if any man come unto you and bring not this doctrine with him / receive
him not into your house: bid him not god speed: nor have aught to do with him:
but count him as an abiecte from god and Christ. But cleave ye fast to the
sou^de and certain doctrine of gods infallible word / written in the canonical
books of the new and old testament / which is able sufficiently to instruct
you to eternal salvation / through Jesus Christ our lord. To whom with the
father / and the holy ghost / be al honor and praise for ever and ever. Amen.

That the writings of the old fathers / without the written word of god /

The.ii. Chapter.
IReneus libro.ii. Cap. 46. Doctrine in religion, must be grounded upon the
scriptures only.
To le^^e to the scriptures of god (which is the certain and undoubted truth)
is to build a man's house upon a suer and strong rock: But to leave that / and
leave to any other doctrins (what so ever they be) is to build a curious house
upon the ^hatteringe gravel / whereof the overthrow is easy.

IDem in Epistola.72. we may not build our faith upon men's traditions
Happy is he that sows upon the wat^r^ where the Ox and the Ass treads /

but taught / faythfullye to all nacyons / that doctrine / that they had
received of Christ.

Therefore although an Angel from heaven / should preach any other thing

ANd a little after he says. The first point of belefe is, that after the
gospel none other thing is to be believed. There is no certe^ty in that the
scripture defines not. The law, the Prophets, and the gospel, are the first
doctrines, ct therefore true.
We need to use no curiosity after Jesus Christ / nor make further search
after the gospel: for when we believe / we desire to believe no more For first
we believe this / that there is nothing else / that we ought to believe.

THe sae to Praxeas. Let this be a general rule / indifferently determined
before hand against all heresies / that that is true / what so ever is first:
and that to be forged / what soever comes after. pa. 418.

Origin in his first homily upon Jeremy. Vle must needs call the holy
scriptures to wytnes: for our judgments and exposicious / with out these
witnesses / are worthy no credit. Our words, with out gods words, are not
to be believed.


IDem upon Leuiticus / in his fyfte homilye. If the holy scripture do not
determine any thing / we ought not to admit any other writing for the
stablyshinge of our doctrine: That, which ca^ not be proved by the scripture,
leave to god.
but as for the rest / let us leave it to god.

THe same upon the third chapter to the Romans. After these as his custom is
(meaning by saint Paul) he does confirm / that he had said by the
scriptures, giving also an example to the preachers of the church / that those
things / which they speak to the people / should be armed and mayntained by
the holy scriptures / and not spoken out of their own judgments. If Paul
thought his aucthorite
For if he / being such and so great an Apostle / thought not the aucthorite
of his own words to be sufficient / except be teach those things, which
he says / to be written in the law and the prophets: ho^ much more ought we
little ones to take head / that when we teach / we utter not our own minds,
but the sentences of the holy ghost.

THe same upon Matthew / in his 26. homily no man ought (for the stablyshing of
doctrine) to use any books / that be without the canonical scriptures.

CIprian in the exposicion of the Creed / after that he has rehearsed the
canonical books of the Bible / he says. Al books which be not in the Canon of
the Bible, are called Apocrypha, and are not sufficient to prove any Articles
of our says.
These be they / which our fathers have included within the Canon / out of
the which our fathers would the doctrine of our faith to be certain:
nevertheless there be other books / which of our elders / were not called
canonycall / but Ecclesiastical: as the book of wisdo^e / the books of Sirach /
Tobie / Iudyth / Machabees / and other. All which books / they would have to
be read in the church / but not alleged as of authority to confirm any
article of our faith. Al other writings they called Ap^crypha / which they
would in no wise to be read in the church.

AThanasius against the gentyles. The holy Scriptures / being in spired from
god / are sufficient to all instruction of the truth.

BAsilius in his book of Ethikes / of his short definitions the. 26. Every
word and deed / that makes for the certentye and suertye of good men / and
the confusion of them that be evil / must be confirmed by the testimony of
Gods scriptures. And those things / which either in our nature / or in the
custom and manner of our life / are manifestly known / must we use / to
confirm those things / which we do and say.

THe same in his short definitio^s the first question. Whether it be lawful or
expedient for a man to permit himself to do what he thinks good / without
the testimony of the holy scriptures* (...) answer. Seeing that our savior
says of the holy ghost: he shall not speak of himself, but what soever he
has heard / that shall he speak: And of himself he says the son can do
nothing of himself: And again / I have not spoken of my self / but he
which sent me gave me commandment / what I should say / and what I should
speak / and I know that his commandment is eternal life: therefore those
things / that I speak I speak as the father said unto me: who is he then /
that will run into such madness / that he dare once think only any thing
of himself / seeing that he has need of the holy ghost for his aid / so
that both in mind / word and work / he may be gided in the way of truth /
and that he must needs walk in darkness / except he be lightened with the
son of righteousness / our lord Jesus Christ / which shines upon us with
his commandments / as with bright beams? For the commandment of the lord
is clear / and gives light to the eyes. For of those things that are done /
and commonly used among us, some are by gods commandment determined / and
plainly set forth in the holyscriptures / and some not expressed. No man can
dispense with gods law.
Of those that be expressed by the scriptures / there is utterly no power
given to any man (what so ever he be in the hole world) either to do any
thing of those that be forbidden / or else to leave undone any thing of them
that be commanded: Things, that be not commanded, be indifferent to be used,
or not used: but yet as charity requires.
seeing that the lord has once commanded and said, whatsoever I command
you / that take head ye do etc. But of those things that are not expressed /
the Apostle Paul has given us a rule / saying: I may do all things / but
all things are not expedient. I may do all things / but all things edyfye
not.

ISychius upon Leuiticus. lib. 5. cap. 16. Search no further then the gospel.
Let us / which would have any thing observed of god, search no more but that
/ which the gospel does give unto us.

Chrysostom upon the. 24. cap. of Math. Homilia. 49. When you shall set the
abominable desolacion stand in the holy place (that is) when you shall see
ungodly heresye (which is the army of Antichrist) stand in the holy places
of the church: In time of here^ie, there is no means to try the truth and
the true church of Christ from Antichrists church, but only by the scripturs
in that time let the / which are in Jury ^^ye unto the hills (that is) let
them / that be in Christendom / resort unto the scriptures. For like as the
true Jew i^ a Christian (as the Apostle says / he is not a Jew / which is
outward etc.) in like manner the very Jury is Christianity / the hills ar the
scriptures of the Apostles and prophets. And why does he command all
Chrystians at that time to resort^ to the scriptures? for in this time / si^ce
heresy has prevailed in the church / there can be none other proof of true
Christianite / neither can there be any other refuge for Christen men /
(wyllyng to know the truth of the right faith) but only unto the holy
scriptures. Before time / it was showed by many other means / which was the
true church of Christ, and which Gentilite: but now there is no way to know
it. And why? for all those things / which pertayne to Christ in deed / have
the heretics in their Schism: likewise churches / likewise the scriptures of
god / likewise Bishops / and other orders of clerks / and likewise Baptism /
and the Sacrament of thanks geuinge / and (to conclude) Christ him self.
Wherefore / he that will know which is the true church of Christ in this so
great a confusion of things being so like: how shall he know it but only by the
scriptures? It was also known / which was the true church of Christ / by
their manners / when the conversation of Christen men (either of all or many /
was holy / which was not among the heathen. An heavy sayi^g but ala^ to true.


But now CHRISTEN men are beecome like / or worse then the gentiles or
heret^kes: yea and there is more continencye found amongst them / then
amongst Chrystyans. Therefore he / that will know which is the true church of
Christ / whereby shall he know it / but only by the scriptures? The lord
therefore / knowing that so great a confusion of things should come in the later
time / commands that Christen men / that be willinge to know the right
faith / should fly to none other things / but only to the scriptures. For if
the^ look upon any other thing but only the scriptures / they shall be offended
and perish / not perceauing which is the true church: and so fall into the
abominable desolacyon / which stands in the holy places of the church.

THe same in the imperfect work* Has. cap. 7. Prechers most neither add nor
take (...) from gods law.
Every preacher is a servant of the law / which may neither add any thing
about the law of his own mind / nor wythdrawe any thing after his ow^e
understanding: but preach that thing only / that is had in the law / as
Solomon sateth / thou shall add nothy^ge to the word of god / nor take aughte
therefrom.

THe same of the holy ghost / tom. They, that host themselves of the holy ghost
with out scripture, be void of the holy ghost.
3 If you see any man saying that I have the holy ghost / and not spekyng the
gospel / but his own: that man speaks of himself / and the holy ghost is not
in him. And after. If any of the^ therefore / which says he has the holy ghost
/ and speaks any thing of him self / and not forth of the gospel / say:
follow my counsel / believe him not.

THe same in the. 7. of Math. Homily. 19. Upon this text: by their fruits ye
shall know them. The fruits of man is the confession of his faith / and the
works of his conversation. If thou / therefore* shall see a Christen man /
forth with consider if his confession agree with the scriptures / he is a true
Christian: but if not / he is (as Christ said) false. For so John / when he
wrote his Epistell of the heretics / said: not if any come unto you / not
having the name of Christ / bydde him not God speed: but if any bring not this
doctrine.

THe same in the same place / the. 22. Cap. and* 42. Homily. Heretics ought
first to be co^uinced by the scripturs and after by reason.
Let us first allege the aucthorite of the scriptures to the false forgers /
afterward let us show them reasons: and to them / that ask for any manner of
purpose / first let us declare unto them the reason / and afterward the
aucthorite / that we may pacify them with reason / and stablish them with
aucthorite. For we ought to confute false interpreters / and instruct them
that search.

THe same upon the last of the Romans / upon this text. To prech any thing
besides gods word, is to sow sedicio^ and heresy.
I beseech you brethren. He says that dissensions and slanders / that is to
say / heresies / are brought in of those / which bring any thing be^sydes
the doctrine and learning of the Apostles.

THe same upon the latter Epistle to Timothe / the. 3. Cap. Al things may be
determined by the scripture.
There is nothing that can not be determined by the scriptures / to reprove /
if it be to be reproved (that is to say) lies: to correct / and to teach in
righteousness. If it be nedeful (says he) that any thing should be corrected or
instructed / that is to be made contynent and sober unto righteousness / and
to execute those things that be just: all that shall be given by the scripture
/ that the man of god may be perfect: the amendment (says he) is prepared
by the scriptures / that nothing may be lacking to that man / that walks
after god. The holy scripture co^teineth all things needful for our salvation


THe same upon math. 22. Cap. Homily. 4. Whatso ever is required for our
salvation / is already co^tamed in the holy scriptures. He that is ignorant /
shall find there what he may learn. He that is stubburne and a si^ner / may
find there scourges of the judgments to come / the which he may fear: he
/ that is troubled / may find there the joys and promyses of everlasting
life / through the beholdynge of the which / he may be styrred to good
works.

THe same upon the. 2. of the Thessalo. 2. cap. Al things be plain and clear
in the scriptures / and what things so ever be nedeful / be manifest there.

THe same upon the. 2. to Timo^the. 3. chapter If there be any thing needful to be
known / or not to be known / we shall learn it by the holy scriptures: if we
shall need to reprove a falsed / we shall fetch it from thence: if to be
corrected / to be chastned / to be exhorted / or comforted / to be short / if
aught lack that ought to be taught or learned / we shall also learn it out of
the same scriptures.

The same / Homily. 1. Titum. Like as the bedell cries openly to al the^ that
be in the court / so due we preach openly: A preacher must speak nothing but
out of gods mouth.
but on that condition / that we add nothing / but preach only that thing /
that we have heard. For the office of a cryar is to speak out those things
that be committed to him / and not to add / change or take away any thing.

THe same upon the latter Epistle to Timothe / the. 3. cap. Believe him not,
that speaks without the scripture.
Therefore / neither ought there to be believed at all / except they speak
those things which be agreeable to the scriptures.

THe same upon the. 20. cap. of John Homilia. 89. He, that believes the gospel
written, needs believe no more.
But why did not the Apostles write all things? Chefely / because of the
multitude of them. More over they did consider / that he / which would not
believe these / would not beeleue more: but he that beseueth these / need no
more to attain faith.

THe same upon Genesis the. 12. Homily. The holy scripture expounds it
self / and suffers not the hearer to err.

THe same in the same book / the 21. Homily. Not ma^s wisdom but the holy
ghost is the true expositor of the scripture
Neither has the scripture of God any need of man's wisdom that it may be
understand / but the reuelacion of the holy ghost: that / the true meaning
being sucked thereout / great advantage may grow to us thereby.

HIeronymus in the prologe of the bible to Paulme. nothing is of like
authority with the holy scripture
After he had recited the books of the new testament and the old / he says:
I pray thee dear brother / among these live / muse upon these / know nothing
else / seek for none other thing.

Again upon the books of the old and new testament: These writi^ges be holy
/ these books be sou^de both in number and authority / there is none other to
be compared to these / whatsoever is besides these may in no wise be receued
among these holy things. Gods word cutteth of al traditions apostolik as they
call them, which be beside the same word. we ought not to allow any man's
doctrine without gods word. the Apostles grounded all their doctrine upon the
law and Prophets.


Again upon the first. Cap. of Agge. All other things which they seek out /
and inuente at their own pleasure without the aucthorite and testimony of the
scriptures / (as though they were the tradicions of the Apostles) the sweord
of god cutteth of.

Again in his litell commentaryes to the Galathians / upon this place:
condescend to no man / this persuasion is not of god / which has called you:
thus he i^terpreteth it: ye ought neither to consent to them / nor to me /
without the word of god.

Again upon Math. the. 13. cap. upon this place: every learned scribe. What so
ever the Apostles preached / they confirmed it by the Oracles of the law and
prophets.

THe same to Minerius and Alexander. To build upon any doctors saying without
scripture or reason agreing to scripture, were to follow Pithagoras, rather then
Christ.
Not according to Pithagoras disciples / the opinion / given sentence upon
before hand by the doctors / but the reason of the doctrine is to be wayed: but
if any man / that is of a contrary sect / do murmr why I read their
exposicio^s / unto whose doctri^es I do not co^sente: let him know / that I
willingly hear this of the Apostle: prove all things / but clean to that
which is good / and the words of our savior / saying: be ye tried bankers /
and if any money be counterfayted / and have not the Emporours sta^pe / nor be
currante money / refuse it / but that / that shows the face of Christ in the
clear light bestow it in the purse of your heart.

THe same upon Math. 23 cap. That which has none authority of the
scriptures / may as easily be rejected / as proved.

THe same in the Psalm. 98. All that ever we speak / we ought to prove it by
the scriptures.

THe same in the Psalm. 86. Be a man never so holy, and never so learned after
the apostles, yet his words, without gods word, are of none aucthorite.
The lord shall speak in the scriptures of the people etc. and how shall he
speak / not with words / but with scriptures of those princes that were in it /
that is / of the Apostles and Evangelists. And mark what he says: of those
princes that were in it / and not which are. So that (the Apostles except)
what soever shall be spoken afterward / let it be cut of / and have none
aucthorite. Be a man threfore never so holy / be he never so well learned /
after the Apostles he has none aucthorite: for the Lord speaks in the
scriptures of those princes / that were in it.

AMbrosius of virgins lib. 3. ca. 1 We justly do condemn al new things /
which Christ has To teach that, as needful to salvation which C^^yst ^ath
not taught, is da^n^^le.
not taught: for Christ is the way to the faithful. If therefore we our
selves preach any thing / that Christ has not taught / judge that abominable.

THe same in the psalm. 118. The word of god is the lively meat of our souls
/ with the which it is norished / fed and governed: the soul lives only by
the word of god.
neither is there any thing else / that makes a reasonable soul to live, but
the word of god.

THe same in his book of Paradise / Cap. 12. By that / which Eua added to the
word of god (thou shall not touch etc) we do learn how much this present
lesson puts us in rememberaunce / that we ought to add nothing to the word
of god / yea though it be for a good purpose. nothing is to be added to the
word of god although it be for a good purpose.
For if thou put to / or take away any thing / it appears to be a
tra^sgressio^ of the commandment: for there ought nothing to be added /
although it se^e good.

THe same in the Epistle to the Galathians. Capit. i. As well, who precheth
beside the gospel as against it is accursed.
Neither (says the Apostle) if they preach contrary: but if they preach any
thing besides that / that we have preached / that is / if they add any thing
to it at al / ^olde them accursed. Neither do I except my self / if I put to
any thing beside that / which was preched before.

THe same / in the same place. Even the Apostles preching besides the gospel are not to be believed.
He does affirm the gospel / which he had preached unto them / to be so firm
and true: that although it should chance themselves (that is to say / the
Apostles) beeinge changed / to preach any other thing / he teaches that
they ought not to be heard.

AVgustine of the co^se^t of the Eua^gelistes. Christ made all to be written,
that he would we should read.
He that sent the Prophets before his incarnacio^ / the same sent also his
Apostles after his asce^sio^ / yea and by that ma^hod / which he took upon him
/ he is the head of all his discipls / which are members of his bodi: therefore
forasmuch as they wrote those things / which he showed and taught the^ / it
ought not to be said that he wrote them not / seeing that his members wrote
that / which they knew by their head teaching them. we are as well bound to
believe that, which the Apostles wrote: as though Christ had written it with
his own hand
For what so ever he would have us to read / both of his deeds and words /
that commanded he them to write / as his hands of his body. Whosoever ever does
perceive this fellowship of unite and agremente of members / ministering under
one head in diverse offices: he shall none other ways take that / that he
reads in the gospel (the disciples declaryng it) then if he had seen the very
hand of the lord / which he bare in his own body / writing it.

THe same to Vince^t against the Donatistes the.6. tom. page 116. Epistola. 48.
The church is known by the scripture
We therefore for this cause are certain and suer / that no man ought to
wythdraw himself from the communion of al me^. And let none of us seek the
church in our own righteousness / but in the holy scripture.

THe same to the Mandarens Epistle. 42. All that concerns true relygion, is
contained in the scripture.
All that ever our elders made mention of to be do^e toward mankind in times
past / and delivered to us: all things also which we see / and deliver to our
posterite / which do appertain to getting and maintaining of true relygion
/ the scripture of god did not pass with silence.

Again to the brethren in the wilderness. The word written is inoughe for our
salvation
Read the holy scripture / wherein ye shall find fulli what is to be followed /
and what to be avoided.

THe same of nature and grace. lib. 1. Cap. 61. I owe my consent to the
Canonical scryptures / without any refusal.

THe same upon John.49. treatise. Cap. 11. Not all things that the Lord Jesus
did / are written / as the same Evangelist witnesses: for the lord both did
and said many things / that are not written: but things were chosen out to
be written / which seemed sufficient for the salvation of the beleuers.

THe same against Faustus the 23. lib. ca. 9. No man is bound to believe
farther then the holy scriptures teach.
That which Faustus puts forth upon the birth of mary / that she had a
certain priest to her father of the tribe of Leuye named Ioachim: because it
is not canonical / it does not bind me.

THe same of Baptism against the Anabaptists. li. 2. cap. 6. Let us not
bring deceytfull balances / wherein we may weighe what we will after our own
pleasure / saying this is heavy / this is light: The balance to try the truth
is the holy scripture
but let us bring the divine balances of the holy scriptures / as of the
treasurs of the lord / and in it let us weigh what is heavy / yea let us not
weigh / but rather acknowledge the things / that ar^ weighed of the lord.

Again upon John the.46. treates. They that sit on moses seat, and teach
their own doctrine, are not to be believed.
Sitting upon the chaier of Moses / they teach the law of god: therefore god
teaches by them. But if they will teach their own / hear the^ not / do not
after the^: for truli such men search their own / but not these things /
which are of Jesus Christ.

Again in the.3. lib of the Christen doctrine. Cap. Vlt. How much less the
abundance of gold / silver / and clothing / which that people brought with
them for the of Egypt / is in comparison of the riches / which afterward they
had at Jerusalem / which above all other was showed in king Solomon: so let
al knowledge (which is in deed profytably gathered out of the books of the
Gentiles) be such / if it be compared to the knowledge of gods scripturs. Al
evil is condemned by the scripture, and all good things are there found.
For what soever man learneth without them / if it be evil / there it is
condemned: if it be profitable / there it is found. And saying then every
manne shall find all things there / which he has profytably learned other
where: much more abundantly shall he find those things there / which can no
where at all else be learned / but only in the marvelous dep^es / and
wonderful humilite of those scriptures.

THe same in his book of nature and Grace / the 61. Cap. We may lawefulli
disse^t from all doctrine, except the scryptures only.
We may lawefully sometime dissente from other learning: but to the Catholyke
learning every man must give place / every man must subscribe / whether he be
lay mannne / Priest / King / or Emperor.

THe same in his.2. lib. of the Christian doctri^e the.9. Cap. After that he
has nombered the Canonical books / he says thus. In all these books they /
that fear god and are tamed through godlynes / do search the will of god. The
first note of which labor and travail (as we said) is to know these books /
and if as yet we ca^ not understand them / yet let us by readyng get them in
memory / or not to be altogether ignorant in them. al things that concern
faith, hope, love, and good manners: are contained in the scripture
Further more those things which be plainly contained therein / whether they
be precepts of living / or else of beleuinge / are earnestly and diligentely to
be searched: which / how many the more every man fyndeth / so much the more
is he apt in his understanding. In these therefore / which are euydently
contained in the scripture / are found all things / which contain faith /
manners of living / hope and love.

THe same of the unite of the church.3. cap. not what we say, but what the
lord, that must be heard.
Let us not hear: I say / thou say: but let us hear: thus says the
Lord. There are / out of doubt / the Lords books / to the authority
whereof we both consent / we both believe / we both serve. The church is known
by the scriptures
Let us search the church there / let us discuss our cause there.

Again in his second book of Baptism / against the Donatists the.3. Ca.
Who is he / that knows not / that the scripture canonical is so contained
within his certain bonds of the new and old testament / and is so to be
preferred above al latter wrytynges of Bishops / that a man may not at al
either doubt or dispute of it / whether any thing be true or right / that he
is suer is written in it: We may doubt of all men's doctrine but not of holy
scripturs.
but the leters of al other Bishops / which are / or shall be hereafter written
besides the Canonical scryptures / already confirmed / may be reproved /
either by more grave authority of other Bishops or learned me^ / and by the
words of every man / that is better seen in the matter.

Again in his second book of the merits and forgiveness of sins. ca.
Vlt. tom. 7. If gods scripturs can not discuss a matter in doubt let man never
go about to discuss it
Where disputacion is had of a doubtful matter / if the certain and clear
doctri^e of the scriptures of god do not help i^: man's reason ought to stay it
self / no thing leani^g to either part. For though I know not how to express
eueri one of these things: yet I believe suerli / that the scriptures of god
should be most plain herein / if a man might not be ignorant hereof without
the loss of that salvation / that is promised him.

Again in his book of pastors. Who fedeth with the scriptures, fedeth safely.
Other therefore with unwritten verites feed untruly.
He apoi^ted the hills of Israel the authors of the scrypturs of god / feed
there that you may feed safely. What so ever you hear out of that / let it
sauoure well to you / what so ever is besyds that / refuse it / lest you
wander into clouds.

Get you to the hills of the Scriptures / there be the pleasures of your
hearts / there is no noyso^e / hurtful or venomous things / no inconuenyente
things / there be most plentiful pastures.

Again of Christian doctrine. 2. lib. Cap. 9. In the scripture are all things
necessary for faith and good life, which two suffice for salvation
In these things that be plainly set forth in the scriptures / are found all
things / that contain faith and manners of living / that is to wit / hope and
charity. Then after a certain familiarite had with the speech of the scripture
of god / we must go to expound / and discus those things that be dark /
that (to give light to dark speeches) examples may be taken out of the more
plain places / and some testymonies of places / being certain / may take a
way the doubt of the uncertain sentences.

Again of the Christian doctri^e the.3. lib. Cap. 26. Dark places are to be
expounded by plainer places. That is the surest way / to expound one scripture
by another.

Again to Vincente the Donatist Epistola.48. This kind of learning (speaking
of the old writers doings) is not to be red with necessity of belief /
but with liberty of judgment. And after. There (that is) in the holy
scrypturs / it is not lawful to say / the author of this book perceived not
the truth: If any man's saying or writing cannot be proved by plain scripture
or good reason, gathered of the sa^e a man may allow or refuse it, as him
likes.
but either that the book is false / or the interpreter has erred / or thou
understand it not. But in the works of all them that come after / (which be
contained in i^numerable books / yet in no wise to be compared to the most holy
excellencye of the Canonical scryptures) although in some of them be found
the same truth / yet the aucthorite is far unlike.

Therefore / if it fortune any thing in them to be thought to dissente from
the truth / because they are not so understand as they be spoken: yet the
reader or hearer / has his free judgment / so that either he may allow that
/ that pleases him / or reiecte that / which offends him. And therefore al
such like (except they may be defended either by good reason / or by the^
canonical aucthorite / that it may be proved that they are so in deed / or
may be so / because either it is there disputed / or declared) if it displease
any man / or if he will not believe it / he is not to be blamed therefore.

THe same in the same place Epistola. 48. Gather not (my brother) against so
many / so clear / and so undoubted witnesses of the scriptures / sentences
misunderstanded / out of the writings of Bishops / either of ours / or of
Hilarie / or Ciprian Bishop and martyr of the church: for we must put a
diversity betwixt this kind of writing and the Canonical scriptures. The
old writers are not of such authority, but that we may deni them, if they
dissent from the holy scripturs.
For these are not so to be red / as though a wytnes might be alleged out of
them so / that no man might think otherwise / if they fortune to judge
otherwise / then the truth requires.

THe same to Jerome. I have learned to give this reverence and honor to those
only writers / which be now called Canonical / that I dare be bold to believe
/ that none of them did err any thing at al in writing? But if I find any
thing in those Scryptures / that seems contrary to the truth: I doubt not /
but that either the book is false / or the interpreter did not attain the
thing that was spoken / or else I understand it not.

But all other authors / (be they never so excellent both in virtue and
learning) I do so read them / nor that I think it true that they wrote /
because they thought so: We may not think al, that the old fathers did write,
to be true.
but because they could persuade me either by other Canonycall Scryptures /
or by some probable reasons / a thing not altogether abhorring from the truth.

THe same against Cresconium agramarien. lib. 2. Capit. 32. Al men's writings
ought to be weighed by the canonical scriptures.
I am not bound to his aucthorite. For I do not accoumpte Ciprians writings
as Canonical / but weygh^ them by the Canonical scriptures: and that in them
/ which agrees with the Canonical scriptures / I allow to his praise / but
that / that agrees not / by his favor I refuse.

THe same to Vincent Victor. He confesses many errors in his own books (...)
others also.
I cannot / nor ought not to deny / that like as in mine elders / so also in
my so many books / be many things: that by just judgment / (without
rashness) may be reproved.

THe same in the prologe of his book of the Trinite. Believe not his writings
except thou be suer of them by the scriptures.
Be not bound to my writings / as to the Canonical scriptures: but if thou
find any thing in them / which thou did not believe / strayghte way believe
it: in these that thou art not suer of / except thou certainly understand it /
believe it not certainly.

THe same to Fortunate Epistola. 198. we ought not to esteem man's writings
further, then they agree with the scripturs: but may refuse the^ at our
pleasures.
Neither ought we to allow the reasoninges of any men / what soever they be
/ (although there be Catholyke and laudable men) as the canonical scriptures /
so that it shall not be lawful for us (sauinge the reverence that is due to
those men) to reprove / and refuse any thing in their writings / if it
chance that they have judged otherwise then truethe is: the same truth / by
gods help / being understand either of other men / or of us. For I am
even such an one in other men's wrytynges / as I would men should be in mine.

THe same in the same place. Let us seek no further / the^ is written of god
our savior / lest a man would know more / then the scriptures witness.

CIrille lib. 6. Understand the word written, for they that learn of it,
learn of god.
Upon Leuitie^s. There be two offices of a Bishop / to learn the scriptures
of god / and by often readyng to digeste the same / or else to teach / the
people: but let him teach those things which he has learned of god / and not
of his own heart or by man's understanding / but those things which the holy
ghost teaches.

THe same in John. Cap. 6. He says / by this we learn / that only Christ
ought to be followed as a master / and we must clean unto him only.

THe same in John. cap. 20. al things perteining to doctrine and good manners,
are in the word written, which is sufficie^te
Not al things / that the lord did / ar written: but those things that the
writers thought sufficient / as well to good manners as to doctrine / that we /
shining with a constaunte faith / good works and virtues / may come to the
kingdom of heaven.

FVlgence in his sermon of the confessors. In the word of god is plentye for
the strong man to eat / there is inoughe for the child to suck / there is
also milk to dri^ke / wherewith the tender infancye of the faithful may be
nourished / and strong meat / wherewith the lus^ye youth of them / that be
perfect / may receive the spiritual encresment of holy virtue. Note this holy
fathers words, and print them in your hearts for ever.
There / provision is made for the salvation of al men / whom the lord does
vouchesafe to save: there is that / that is agreeable to all ages: there is also
that / which is mete for all states. There we learn the commandments / which
we ought to do: there we know the rewards / which we hope for.

GRegory in Job. lib. 16. Cap. 28. He that prepares himself to the office of a
true precher / must neds fetch the foundation of his matters out of the holy
scriptures. If preachers ought so then so ought all others: for they al are
prepared to come to one end by one ordinary rule.
So that all that he says / he must reduce it to the first beginning of
gods aucthorite / and in that stay the effect of his sayings. For as I
have said many times before: heretics when they study to maintain their
froward doctri^e suerly they bring forth those things / that are not
contained in the holy scriptures.

THeophilactus upon this place of Paul / the last to the Romans: I beseech
you brethren / mark them which cause division and give occasion of evil /
contrary to the doctrine which you have learned and avoid them: for they that
are such serve not the Lord Jesus christ / but their own bellies / and with
sweet prechinges and flattering words deceue the hearts of the innocents: Here
says Theophilactus that they bring in di-uisions and occasions of evil /
which bring forth any thing beside the doctrine and learning of the Apostles.

DAmascenus. lib. 1. cap. 1. All that ever was delivered by the law / the
Prophets / the Apostles and the Evangelists: we receive / acknowledge / and
give reverence unto them / searchyng nothing besides them.

BRuno the in second to Timothe doutlesse the holy Scryptures are able to
instruct thee to salvation. For every scripture being inspired from god / that
is to say / spiritually understand after the will of God / is profitable to
teach them that be ignoraunte / to reprove (that is) to convince them that
speak against the faith / to correct sinners / such as deny not them selves
to be sinners: The scriptures only are sufficient for matter of salvation.
to instruct those that be yet rude and si^ple / to instruct (I say) in
righteousness / that they may be made righteous by puttyng away their former
instructions of infidelite (I say) that he may be so taught / that / as much
as in the teacher lies / he / that is taught / may be the perfect man of god:
so perfect / that he may be instruct to do every good work.

BEda in the. 1. Epistle of Peter. Cap. 5. If any man speak / let him speak
as the words of god / fearyng least he say or command any thing besides the
will of god / or besides that / which is manifestly commanded in the holy
scriptures / and be found as a false witness of god / or acommitter of
sacrilege / or a bringer in of any strange thing from the Lords doctrine /
or else leave out or pass over any thing that pleases god / seeing that
Christ most plainly commands the preachers of the truth / concerning them
whom they had taught / saying: If any man speak, let him speak according to
the word of god: except he will be called by these names here expressed.
teach them to keep all things / that I have commanded you. Yea even the same
/ which he had commanded and none other / and he commanded his preachers to
command their hearers to keep not so^e of these / but all.

ANselmus Bishop in his book of virginity. 24. Cap. We may not believe the
general faith, except the same agree with gods word.
Gods law forbyddeth to follow the steps of the Catholyke or universal
faith any more / then the judgment of the canonical truth commands to
believe. And all other Apocryphal lies / the good policies of the best learned
fathers / have stablished in their decrees / utterly to reiecte and to banishe
them clean / as horrible thoundri^ges of words.

LYra^e upon the last Ca. of the Proverbs. Like as in a merchants ship
are carried diverse things / necessary for man's life: so in the scripture
are contained all things / needful to salvation.

THomas of Aquine. The holy Scripture is the rule of our faith / whereunto it
is neither lawful to add / nor take any thing away. the truth of our faith is
contained in the word written.
But the truth of our faith is contained in the holy scryptures diffusely and
diverse ways / in some places darklye / and to try out the truth of our
faith by the scryptures / is required long study and exercise: to the which al
they cannot come / that need to know the truth of the faith / the more part
whereof / being occupied with other business / cannot attend to study. And
therefore it was needful out of the sentences of holy scripture to gather some
thing into a short some / which should be set forth for all men to believe /
which is not added to the scriptures / but rather taken out of the scriptures.

SCotus in the prologe of sentences que. 2. Question. Whether knowledge about
nature / sufficient for a man in this life / be sufficientlye set forth in
the holy scripture. The Question is not whether any things be true that are
not written / or whether god / sense the creacion and redemption of the world
/ has done or said any thing / that is not written / and received of the
Church for the holy scripture: but this is the questyon / whether the word
of god written be sufficient for our salvation: or whether a Christen man be
bound to believe any thing / that cannot he proved by the holy scripture. And
this granted / that all things that may be gathered out of the scripture /
and every thing that upon any truth granted may b^ proved by a good argument
of the scripture / does pertayne to the holy scripture: this granted I say /
he concludes that all things / necessary for our salvation / are fully
contained in the holy scripture. The schole authors call the stay of our faith
/ the truth showed of God / and contained in the Canon of the Bible.

That the general counsels / without the word of god / are not sufficient to
make articles of our faith.

Significasti. A simple lay man / bringing forth the scriptures / is to be

before times erred / as did the counsel of Melchildense and Aquisgranum of
contracting of Matrimony. The council of Co^stance among other articles of
John Husband Hierome of Prage / unjustly condemned / condemned also this
article for heresye: that the two natures (that is) the divinity and humanity
be one Christ / which is a necessary article of our faith / expressed in the
Creed of Athanasius called qui cunque vult / where it is red: Read the Psalm.
the right faith is / that we believe and confess / that our Lord Jesus Christ
the son of god is god and man / and a little after: like as the reasonable
soul and the flesh is one man / so god and man is one Christ: the same is also
decreed by the counsel of Nice and diverse other catholic counsels / and it
is the doctrine of the church at this time. Finally it may be proved by the
express word of god / and yet these malycyous clergy were not ashamed to
condemn the same for an heresy. Note here ie^tle reader / unto what shameless
and detestable heresies their Popish / yea Antichristian general counsels have
fallen / of the which they boast so much / that they cannot err / and
whereupon che^fely they build al their errors and heresies. Moreover the most
part of the good laws and Canons be in manner altogether abrogated and no where
kept: part whereof I shall express.

Canons of the Apostles and counsels not kept nor used.
CAnone.3. Let not a Bishop / priest or deacon / by any means put away his
own wife under pretense of relygion: but if he do / let him be
excommunicated: and if he so continue / let him be deposed.

CAnone. 4. Let no Bishop / Pryest or deacon be received in to another
Bishops diocese / without a testymoniall of his good behaueour: and when
they have delivered their writings / let them be diligently examined if they
be godly preachers. If these.ii. laws were thoroughly executed by indifferent
judges / being no Priests / the realm of England should not swarm so full of
runnagates / adulterous and sodomicall Pryestes. For in wales / for their
cradel crounes paid to the ordynary / they kept their co^cubines or harlets
openly: and in England many great benefyced men keep their harlettes at rack
and maunger without any punishment / except it be by brybyng of the ordinaryes
privily: and all shame set aside / they have their own known bastards
waiting upon them in sight of the whole world. But the poor purgatory
Priests / when they be taken in open aduoutrie / flee from east to weste /
from north to southe / from diocese to diocese / and there be received without
any letters testimonial at al: where they be taken for honest and chaste
Priests. But if the rich Priests were deprived of al their promotions / so often
as they be known to be fornicators (as they ought to be) and the poor
priests not received into any strange diocese / without testymonye of his
honest demeanure / from his former ordinary: you should skarcely find Priests
for every third benefice of England / and the Pryestes themselves would be
the first earnest suitors / that they might have their lawful wives of their
own: but as long as they be their own judges (according to the old proverb /
one skabbed horse gnappeth an other) what for favor and frendshippe / what for
moeny and for slaunderynge of their order: they wynke one at another faults /
and help to cloak the same in so much / that within my memory / which is

elder then I: O what a court is this, that in suspicion of heresye acquiteth no
man, and in cause of adultery conde^neth no priest, be his crime never so
openly known
I could never perceive or learn / that any one Priest / under the Popes
kingdom / was ever punished for aduoutrye by his ordinary. And yet not long
ago / a Petye canon of a Cathedral church in England was accused of buggerye
/ by.iii. boys of the gra^er schole / to the vicedeane or subdea^e of the same
church / a man not unlike to a monk called Iodocus: of who^ Erasmus makes
mention / that he were worthy to walk openly with a bell and a cocks comb / if
he were not set forth under the holy habit of a monk. But when he perceived /
that the said Pryest could not pourge himself of the foresaid crime / he
privily paid him his quarters wages before hand / and suffered him to depart
without farther trial of the said crime: and now he ietteth in london / with
side gown and sarcenet typet / as good a virgin priest as the best. If I should
but brefely touch all the histories / that I have known of the incontinency of
Pryests / it would grow to a work thryse greater / then al my whole book / and
it would make some of the proudeste of them to blushe / if they be not past all
shame: but I will not blot my good paper with so evil matter: although they be
not ashamed openly to blot and stayne their own good names with crimes /
worthy of such reproach and ignominy.

LEt not any Bishop / Pryest or Deacone / in any wise take upon him any
secular busynes: Cano. 7.
but if he do / let him be excommunicated. But now such shameless co^te^ners
they be of their own laws / which they so greatly extol and bind all ^ther
to keep: that they be hunters / faukon^ors, stewardes / surueyars and
receyuers to all great men / yea and to the Bishops themselves.

IF any Pryeste or Deacone / or any other of the number of Priesthod / do not
receive at the Communion / let him show his cause: Cano. 9.
if it he reasonable / let him be pardoned: if not / let him be deprived from
the Communion.

IT is mete to put of from the^ Communion all Christen men (which enter into
the church / and hear the scriptures / but continue not in prayer until mass
be done: Can^o. 10.
nor receive there the holy Communion:) as disturbers / of the quietness of the
church. By these.ii. Canons be subverted / and utterly over thrown / all
private masses / where the priest only receives.

Because there be so^e that knele at their prayers on the Sunday and in Whitso^
weke: be it therefore ordained by this holy counsel / that all men stand at
their prayers / for so much as it is a convenient custom / fyt to be kept in all churches.

But now Antichriste of Rome / contrary to this decree / has extolled
himself above his fellow Bishops / as gods vicare / yea rather as god
himself: and takes upon him authorite over kings and Emperors / and sits
in the temple of God, that is / in the consciences of men / and causes his
decrees to be more regarded / then gods laws: yea and for monye he dispenses
with gods laws and al other / geuynge men license to break them.

carthage added to these the books of wisdom / Ecclesiasticus / Tobie / Judith /
Hester / and the books of the Machabees / unto which latter counsel the
papists cleave with toth and nail / and there upon stay their purgatory /
prayi^ge to saints / with diverse other errors and heresies: contrary to the
elder and better counsels. Herby you may most easily perceive / how shamefully
their general counsels have erred / as well in the judgment of the scriptures /
as also in necessary articles of our faith and good manners. Yea and the chefest
and oldeste counsels be (as Anacharsis said of the laws / made by Solon for
the Atheniens) like to cobwebbes / wherein small flies / gnattes and Miges be
taken / and devoured of the spiders: but great hornettes and ho^bellbees fly
through and break them / without any danger or hurt. And generally there is
no laws regarded / kept or maintained among them: but such as make / (as
they turn the^) pro pane lucra^do / that is / for their dignities / immunites
or libertes and prophets. Wherefore the words of our savior Christ may be
rightly veryfied of the^: Mat. 23.

man, because he wa^dereth from the word written, and is not co^te^t therewith.
so that whiles they counterfete the like things / they make void the truth
with subtlety. This (dearly beloved brethren) comes to pass by this means
/ that we resort not to the original of the truth / nor seek the head Christ
/ nor keep the doctrine of our heavenly master.

and this is the remedy of them wha^ they cease to hurt: They hurt most of all,
when they cease from hurtyng.
neither have they any other study but to call me^ back from god / and turn
the^ from the perceaui^g of true religion / to their superstition / and seeing
they be in pain the^ self / to seek those to be companio^s of their pain /
whom they have made / through their error / partakers of their sin.

They therefore fill all the world with snares / frauds / and errors / the
which because they be fine spirits / and can not be perceived / conueye
themselves into men's bodies / and being secretlye hyd within the body^ trouble
health / bring sickness / fraie men with dreams / vex men's minds with sweat

cause of all which discea^es / is dark to the^ that be ignoraunte in the
truth: for they think they profit when they cease from hurtynge / which can
do nothing but hurt. But they / which have shrunken back from gods service /
because they be enemies and tra^sgressours of the truth / go about to
challenge to themselves the name and honor of god: not because they desire any
honor^ (for what honor can the damned have) nor that they should hurt god / who
cannot be hurt: but to hurt men / whom they go about to draw away from the
worship and knowledge of gods true majesty / least they should attain
immortalytye / which they have lost through their own malice. So they cover
all with darkness / and compass the truth with claudes: Satan works miracles
by Images, and hereof springs the worshipping of Images.
so that they can not know their lord / nor their father. And that they may
easily allure men / they hide themselves in the churches / and are at hand
in all sacrifices. Yea many tims they work miracles / through which men / being
astonyed / do give to Images the faith of the godheade. Here of it comes /
that a stone was cut in sander with a rasure by a sorcerer: and that Juno of
Ve^a answered / that she would go to Rome: and that a ship followed the
hand of Claudia: and that Juno being robbed / and Proserpina of Locre^se / and
Ceres of Milet / took vengeance of those / that had committed sacrilege: and
Hercules of Appius / and Jupiter of Atimus and Minerua of Caesar. Hereof also it
comes / that a serpente delivered the City of Rome from the pestilence /
being brought from Epidaure. The devils speak in Imags as though they were gods.
But chefely they deceive men in their oracles and answers / whose Iuglynges
ungodly men cannot discern from the truth. Therefore they think / that
Empiers and victories / riches and lucky chances of things / are given of
them: though devils prophesi truly of things to come, yet all is but
dysceite, to make me^ to worship the^.
and to be short / often times common welthes to be delivered from present
dangers at their beck / which dangers they both declared by their answers /
and being pacyfyed with sacrifice / turned away. But all these be but
deceites: for seeing they know before the disposicion of god / because they
were his ministers / they thruste them selves into these businesses / so that
what so ever things either be done / or have been done of God / they might
seem cheflye to do or have done it.

And so often as any goodness is coming at hand to any people or City /
according to Gods appointment / they promise that they will do it / either by
miracles / dreams or reuelacions: if churches / if honors / if sacryfices /
be given to them. The which things being given / when that chances that
needs must be: Satan under pretense of dead men's souls de ceaueth the^,
that live: and leads them into Idolatrye.
they get to themselves great worship. For this cause be temples vowed /
for this cause be new Images hallowed. And so often as perilles be at hand /
for some foolyshe and light cause / they feign themselves angrye: as Juno
toward Varre. But these be the deceites of them / that lurkynge under the
names of the dead / intend to plague them that be alive. Wherefore / whereas
that danger / that is at hand / may be avoided: they would seem that they /
being pacified / have turned it away.

And if it cannot be eschewed / this they do / that it might appear to
chance for the contempt of them: and so they purchase to themselves great
authorite, and fear among me^ that know them not. Some men will say / why does
god then suffer these things / neither does he succoure so evil errors?
That evil things may fight with good / that vices may be contrari to virtues
/ that he may have some / whom he may punish / and some who^ he may honor.

seeing we read a like thing in the historye of Heraclides / of a Moo^ke called
Vale^t. The devil (says he) changing himself into the lykenes of our savior
/ came to him by night with a company (as he feigned) of a. M. Angels: holding
burning lamps in their hands / and with a frery charet / in the which he
feigned our savior to sit. How shall we then know any certain truth by
apparicions.
Then one of them stepped forth and said thus unto him: come forth out of thy
^ell now / and do nothing else but when thou see him come a far of / make
have to bow down thy self and worship him / and so straight way return
again to thine own house. Then he went forth out of his house / and believing
that he had seen that godly offices of heavenly ministers / and all shininge
with fiery lamps / and Christ (as he thought) himself not past a furlong of
/ fell flat upon the ground / and worshypped him / whom he believed to be the
lord. They that believe visions often worship Satan for Christ.
See here how this fearful and folyshe Moonke Vale^t / leaving very Christ /
worshipped Christ's enemy: and in stead of the truth / a counterfeit
Antichryste and Satan.

If they hear not Moses and the Prophets / neither will they believe / if one
arise from death.

LActancius in his institucions lib. 2. Cap. 2. He laugheth their foolishnes to
scorn.
The rude sort think that men's souls walk about the graves / and relics of
their bodies.

Chrysostom in his.4. Homily of Lazarus. That thou may know / that the
doctrynes of the scriptures / and Prophets / are of more force / then if they
that be raised from death should tell any thing: the scripture ought to be
believed rather the^ the testimonye of the dead: for it is gods own word, and
the other often times the devils.
consider this / that whosoever is dead / is a servant. But what the scripturs
speak / the lord himself speaks: therefore though a dead man arise / yea
although an angel come down from heaven / yet chiefly we ought to believe the
scryptures. For he / that is master of Angels / and lord of the quick and the
dead made them. If dead men should come again from thence unto us / the devil
might have brought to us false doctrines: and that very easily. For he might
have showed of ten times gostes / and have subornated men / that should
cou^terfet death and burial / and within a while after show themselves / as
though they were raised again from death / and through them to persuade the
people so begiled / what so ever him list. For if now^ when no such thing is
done in deed / yet dreams seen of many men in their sleep / as though it were
of them that are departed hence / have deceived / destroyed / and over thrown
many men: much more it should have chanced / if the thing had been done in
deed / and gotten credit in men's minds / (that is to say) if many of the dead
had returned again to life / that wicked devil would have wroughte innumerable
deceits / and brought much fraud into the life of men. The dead never return
after the death to tell their state that be dead.
And for that cause God has shut up that way / neither does he suffer any of
the dead to come again hither to tell what is done there: lest he by that means
should bring in all his wiles and subtilties. For when there were Prophets / he
styrred up false Prophets: when the Apostles were / false Apostles: when Christ
appeared / he raised false Christ's: wha^ ^ounde doctrine was brought in / he
brought in corrupt doctrine / sowing ^ockle every where. But God / from whom
nothing is hid / has ^ropped his way to those snares / and he favoring us
has not suffered that any so^e at any time should come from thence hither / to
tell what is there done to any men living / teaching us that we should rather
believe the scrypturs / the^ all other things. The scripture is to ^e believed
above all things.


THe same in Math. Cap. 8. Homily.2.9. I will not deny / but that men have
been killed of cursed charmers and sorcerers: It is not the soul of the dead
that says I am such a man's soul, but the devyl counterfeteth the dead to
deceue the living: for souls departed the body can not walk her on earth.
but that dead men's souls work with them / how shall they make me believe
that? because thou haste heard dead men's souls many times cry / I am the
soul of such a one. Yea but these words proceed out of the fraud and deceit
of the devil. For it is not the dead man's soul / that says this / but the
devil that sayneth this / that he may deceive the hearers. For these ought to
be taken as old wives fables / the words of liars / and fraye bugges of
children: neither can the soul / being departed from the body / walk in
this earth. For the souls of the righteous are in the hand of god / and the
souls of sinners ar straight / after their death / carried away. Which is
manifest by Lazarus and the rich man. The lord says also in another place:
this day shall they fetch away thy soul. The soul therefore / after it be
departed from the body / cannot wa^der here amongst us. It may be proved by
maniscripturs / that the souls of the ryghteous cannot wander here after their
death.

For Steven said / Lord receive my spirit. And Paul desyered to be losed
from the body / and to be with CHRIST. Of the Patriarchs also the Scripture
says / he was laid up with his fathers / he dyed in a good age. And that the
souls of sinners can not tarry here with us / harken to the rich manne /
what he says: consider what he asks / and obtayneth not. But if men's souls
might be conuersaunte here / he would have come as he desyered / and have
certified his brethren of the torments in hell.

Of the which place of Scripture it is manyfeste / that after the departing
from the body. the souls are carried into a certain place, from whence they
cannot return at their pleasure: but look for that terrible day of Judgment.

HIerome in the.8. Ca. of Jeremy. If you doubt of any thing (says the
prophet) know that it is written / that those nations / which the lord shall
scatter before thy face / shall harken to dreams and sothsayers: but the Lord
thy god has commanded thee not so to do / but if you will know things that
be doubtful / give yourselues rather to the testimonies of the law and the
scriptures. But if your congregation will not search the word of the lord:
they shall not have the light of the truth but shall wander in darkness of
errors. You ought to know this / that every nacyon asks counsel at their
own gods / and enquireth of the dead for the health of the quick: but god
has given you the law for your help / so that you may say / the soothsaying
of the heathen / which deceive their worshippers / is not like ours: which is
spoken out of the law / without any cost.

SAi^ct Augustine also says / that the spirit of Samuel / which the woman
sorcerer raised to Saul / was not the soul of Samuel / but the devil / which
appeared in Samuels likeness / for to deceive Saul: this does he prove both by
euydente scriptures / and strong reasons.

EXodus.7. 8. The wise men / and inchaunters of Pharao / turned their rods
into serpents / and the waters of Egypt into blood: and made all the whole
land to swarm with frogs / through their sorceries.

DEuteronum.13. If there arise among you / a Prophet / or a dreamer of dreams
/ and give thee a sign or a wonder / and that sign or wonder / which he has
said / come to pass / and then say: let us got after strange gods / which
thou have not known / and let us serve them: Harken not unto the words of
that Prophet / or dreamer of dreams. For the lord thy god tempts thee / to
wete whether ye love the lord your God / with all your hearts / and all your
souls.

IEremye.23. Behold here am I* says the LORD / against those Prophets
that dare prophesye lies / and deceive my people with their vanities and
miracles* whom I never sent / nor commanded.

MAth.7. Many shall say to me in those days / LORD / have we not prophesyed
in thy name? have we not cast out devils in thy name? and then it shall be
answered them: I never knew you / depart from me you children of iniquite.

MAth.12. An evil and froward generacyon saketh a sign / and there shall no
sign be given to them / but the sign of Jonas the Prophet.

MAthewe.24. There shall a / rise false CHRIST'S / and false Prophets / and
shall show great miracles / and wonders / in so much that / if it were
possible / even the very elect should be disceaued: Mar. 13.
but take you head / beeholde / I have showed you al things before.

THessa.2. The coming of that wicked one (meani^g Antichrist) shall be after the
working of S^than / with all lyenge power / signs and wonders / and with al
disceit of unrighteousness of them / that shall peryshe: because they
received not the love of the truth / that they might be saved. And therefore
God shall send them strong delusyo^s / that they might believe lies: that all
they might be damned / which believed not the truth / but had pleasure in
unrighteousness.

Acts.8. Simon Magus / an in chaunter / by his wonders bewitched the
Samaritans.

Acts.13. Elimas the sorcerer had of long time deceived the Antiochians. Read
the stories.

IRene lib.1. Tells of a certain Iugler / called Mark / which in the
sacrament of thanks giving wonderfully deceived the simple people. For he so
changed the color of wine / that it appeared utterly to be bludde: and a
litel wine so increased through his Iugling / that the chalyce was filled / and
ran over. By this example ye may judge of the popish miracles.
By this Iugling it is plain enough / that those miracles / that be alleged
of many men for the real presence in the sacrament of the alter / do not
confyrme their error / but be very delusions of the devil or of his iuglyng
ministers.

Chrysostom in his.4. 9. Homily upon the.24. of Math. True Christians work
miracls profitable to the seers: but the wicked without profit at all
Before time it was known which were true Christen men and which false by
miracles. but how were the false known? Because they could not work. such or
like miracles / as true Christian men did: but they wroughte vain things /
making men to wonder / but bringing no profit at al. But the Christians did
miracles / which not only brought wonders / but also profit: and by these
they were known / which were true Christians / and which false. But now
workyng of miracles is utterly taken away. Yea cou^terfet miracles are rather
found among them / that be false Chrystians: as Peter declares in Clement.
Antichriste shall have full power given him / to work great miracles.

THe same in his first oracyon against the Jews / upon this place of
Deutero.13. If there a rise among you a Prophet or a dreamer of dreams etc.
That / that he says (says Chrysostom) is this: if any Prophet say / I can
raise a dead man and give syghte to a blind man / obey me / let us worship
devils / let us do sacrifice to Idols: God sufferth wicked men to work
miracles for the trial of the faithful
moreover if a man speak thus / that he can give the bli^d his syghte / raise
the dead^ yea though he do these things: believe him not. for the Lord trieng
thee suffers him to do them / not that he knew not thy mind / but to give
thee occasyon of trial whether thou love God in deed.

THe same in John Cap. 2. The faithful need no miracles. for signs are gyven
to the vnbelevers.1. Corin.14.
In the end of the.22. Homily. There be some doubtless now a days / that ask
why men work no miracles now. If thou be faithful / as thou ought to be /
if thou love Christ / as he should be loved / thou nedest no miracles: for
signs are given to unbelievers and not to the faithful.

AVgustyne against faustus the Manachee. lib. 15. Cap. 5. The Scriptures / that
be stablyshed and set forth by so great authorite / ye despice: miracles you
work none: which though you did / yet we would beware of you / by the Lord
instructing and teachinge us / saying: there shall arise false Christ's etc.

THe same of the city of god li. 20. Cap. 19. The presence of Antichrist
shall be after the workynge of Satan / with all lyinge powers / as a fore. For
then shall Satan be let lose / and by him Antichrist / with all his power /
shall work meruelously but lyingly: of the which miracles it was wont to be
doubted / whether they be called lyinge signs and wonders for this cause /
that he shall deceive man's senses with visions / so that he seems to do the
thing that he does not in deed / or else because the same / although they be
true miracles and not counterfeit / yet they draw me^ to believe that they can
not be done / but by the power of god: whereas me^ne know not the power of the
devil: chefely seeing that how great soever power he has / he has receued
it. For when fire fell down from heaven / and with one dashe destroyed s^ great
afamilie with so many heardes of cattayll of holy Job / and a sudden whirle
wind / overthrowing his house / slew his children: these were no disceauable
visions / but for every one of these it is said: they shall be beegiled with
signs and wonders / that shall deserve to be begiled / for so much as they
have not received the love of the truth / that they might be saved. Neither
did the Apostle / fear to say and add: god shall send them strong delusyons
/ that they should believe lies. For god does send these things / because he
suffers the devil to do them: he in deed by his just judgment / although
the devil does it of a wicked and malicious purpose.

THe same of the unite of the church. Cap. 16. Let the^ show their church /
if they can / not in the sayings and in the fame of the Affricanes / not in
the determinacio^s of their bishops / not in any man's reasonynges / not in
false signs and wonders (for against all this we be warned and armed by gods
word) but in the things appointed in the law / spoken before by the Prophets /
in the songs of the Psalms / in the voice of the shepeharde himself / and
the prea things and paynefulnes of the Eua^gelys^s / that is in the authorite
of the books Canenical: Al doctrine ought to be tried by the canonical in
plain sense: and not by words, that be dark, doubtful or figuratyue.
but not so that they may gather and rehearse those things / that be spoken
da^kely and doubtfully and figuratively, which every man may understand as he
list after his own mind. For such things cannot be understood and expounded
rightly / except those things / that be very plainly spoken / be perceived
before with a constante faith. Let him not say this is true / because I say
it / or because my companyon says thus / or these my companions / or these our
Bishops / Clerks / or lay men: Miracles showed at the tombs of saints
prove no doctrine.
or else / it is true / because such miracles did Donatus / Pontius / or what
soever other: or else because men pray at the tombs of our dead men / and be
heard: or because these and these things chanced there: or that this brother
of ours / or this sister of ours saw such a vision: either wakyng / or
slepynge in his dream / saw such a vysyon or sight: Visions seen either in
dreame^ or being awake cannot make any doctrine
away with these. Either they be faynyngs of lying men / or the wonders of
deceytfull deuyls. For either they are not true / that are spoken: or if any
miracles be done among Heretykes / we ought the more to take heed of them /
because that when the Lord had said there should come some / that by workyng
diverse miracles should deceive / if it were possible / the very elect: he
added / and earnestlye setting forth the thing said: behold / I have told
you before.

Whereof the Apostle / admonishing them / speaks plainly: that in the latter
times men should depart from the faith / geuynge head to spirits of
error / and doctrynes of deuyls. Further more if any man be heard praying at
the to^bes of hereti^^ he receueth / whether it be good or evil not for the
merit of the place / but for the merit of his desyer. Men be heard at the
tombs of heretics and yet is not their doctrine true.
For the sprite of the lord / as it is written / fills the whole world / and
the earnest ear hears all things / and many be heard of god when he is
angry / of who^ the Apostle says: he had given them up to their hearts desire.
And god to many / whom he favors / gives not what they would / that he
may give them that which is profitable: wherefore says the same Apostle of
the sti^ge of his flesh / the messenger of Satan (which he said was given him
to buffet him lest he should be exalted above measure by the greatness of
reuelacions) for the which I prayed the lord thrice / that he would take it
away from me / and he said unto me: my grace is sufficient for thee / for my
strength is made perfect through weakness. Do we not read that many me^ were
hard of god himself in the high places of Iurye? which high places
nevertheless so displeased god / that kings which destroyed them not were blamed
/ and kings that destroyed them were praised. But this ought to be understand
/ that the desyer of him / that prays / is more worthy or of more strength /
the^ the place of prayer: The devil works miracles in the temples and Idols
of the ge^tils although their religion be false an detestable.
but of false vysio^s let them read what is written / both that Satan does
change himself into an Angel of light / and that their dreams have deceived
many me^: let them also hear what the heathen tell of their temples and gods /
wonderfully either done or seen / and yet nevertheless the gods of the heathen
be devils / but the Lord made the heavens. Therefore many me^ be heard and
after many diverse sorts / not only catholyke Christians but also panimes / and
Jews and heretics given to diverse errors and supersticions: doubtless they are heard either of deceitful spirits / which nevertheless do nothing except
they be permitted of god hyghly and unspeakably / judging what is mete to be
given to every man / or else of god himself either for the punishment of malice
/ or the comfort of miseri / or for the admonishme^t of eternal salvation.
Men ought to prou^ themselves to be the true church by none other me^nes,
but by the scripturs only. Neither miracles nor agreement of Bishops in doctrine
prove any thing in religion.
But to that eternal salvation comes no man / but he that has the head
christ Yea and no man ca^ have the head Christ / which is not in his body the
church. which church / like as the head it self / we must know in the
canonical scripturs / and not to seek it in diverse rumors and ^p^nio^s of me^ /
not in factes, sayi^ges and sights etc. Let all this sort of them be chafe /
and not give se^te^ce before hand against the wheat / if they be the church*
but whether they be the church / let the^ show none other wais but by the
ca^onical books of the holy scripturs. For neither do we say that men ought
to believe us / because we are in the catholyke church of Christ / or because
Optaius bishop of Miliuet / or Ambrose bishop of Miliane / or that innumerable
other bishops of our co^gregacio^ do a low this doctrine that we keep / or be
cause in churches of our co^panio^s it is preached or else because that through
the whole world in those holy places / where our co^gregacio^s resort / so many
wonders either of hearings / or of healynges be done: so that bodies of martirs
/ being hid so many years / (which if they will ask / they may learn of many)
were showed to Ambroser or that at those bodies a certain man / being many
years blind / well known to the whole city of Miliane / received his eyes and
his sight: or because he being in a dream did ^ee / or he being rapt in
spirit did hear / either that he ^old not go to the part of the Donatistes /
or that he should depart from their opinion. What so ever such things be done
in the catholic church / the church is not therefore proved catholic because
these be do^e in it. The lord Jesus himself / when he was rise^ from death /
and offered his own body to be see with the eyes / and handled with the hands of
his Apostles / lest they should the^ think themselves to be deceived / he
rather judged that they ought to be stablyshed by the witnesses of the law /
prophets and psalms shewi^ng those things to be fulfilled in him / that were
spoken so long before: so he set forth his church / biddinge repentance and
forgeuenes of sins to be preached in his name / through al nations /
beginni^g at Jerusalem. That these things be written in the law and
Prophets / himself witnesses: this is set out by word of mouth. These are
the doctrines / these are the stays of our cause. we read written in the
Acts of the Apostles of so^e faithful men / that they searched the scripturs
whether they were so. What Scryptures I pray you / but the Canonical of the
law and the Prophets? to these are joined the gospels / the Apostles Epistles
/ the Acts of the Apostles / and the Apocalypsis of Sayncte John. Search all
these / bring forth some plain thing / wherbi you may declare that the
church has remained only in Affricke: or that this (which the Lord says
shall come to pass: This gospel shall be preached to all the world for a
testimonye to all nacyons) shall be verified of Affricke. But bring out some
what / that needs none interpreter: you may not be convinced that the things
/ which is spoken of another matter / you go about to wreste to your purpose.

Chrysostom of the contricion of the heart. Not miracle workers but the
commandment kepers, ar called blessed of Christ.
Christ promised not that he would reward at the latter day them / that work
signs and wonders / but them that keep his commandments / saying: come you
blessed children of my father / receive that kingdom / which was prepared for
you from the beginning of the world He said not because you did miracles / but
because I was hongrye etc. he shall also call them blessed / not that wroght
miracles, but the humble and meke in heart.

LIril in John lib. 7. Cap. 13. To work miracles makes no man holy: nor to
work no miracles hinders his holiness,
To work miracles makes not a man one whit more holy / s^i^ge that it is also
common to evil men and abiectes / as the Lord himself also witnesses: mani
shall sai to me in that day etc. And contrary wise workyng of no miracles
hinders not a man's holiness. For John wrought neither sign nor miracle: and
yet was this no derogacion to his holiness. For among the children of women there
was none greater then he.

SAbellic upon the life of Celestine. This would be put among the apparicio^s
of the dead. Satan counterfetteth Moses.
Almost five hundredth years after Christ the devil / taking upon him the
person of Moses / showed himself visibly in the sight of the Jews / that
dwelt at Candie: promisinge that he would bring them again into the land of
promise / where Jerusalem stands / dry foted / the waters standing on either
side in manner of a wall / as when the children of Israel were brought out of
the land of Egypt. Many of the Jews rashli giving credit to these Iugli^gs /
and entering into the sea / were overwhelmed with the waves thereof: except a
few / the which at last / being warned of their vanite / became Christians.

Custom also is of no strength in this case of proving a religion.
The.vii. Chapter.
EXodi.23. Follow not the multitude to do evil.

LEuiticus.18. The Lord co^mmau^deth the Israelytes not to follow the custom
of the Egipcyans nor the Cananites. Read the chapter.

EZechyell.20. Walk not in the statutes of your forefathers / and keep not
their ordinances: and defyle not your selves with their Idols.

REgu^.4. ca. 17. Unto this day they keep their old customs / they fear not
God nor do after his customs / ordynaunces and laws.

THe same. They did not hearken unto the Lord: but did after their old
custom.

I Eremye.9. They followed the^ wickedness of their own hearts / and served
strange gods / as their fathers taught them.

TErtullian of virginite or praises. Custom for the most part / taking his
beginning either of ignorance or simplicite / in process of time waxes
strong by use: and so it is alleged against the truth. Whatsoever smells
against the truth / that is heresye / yea though it be old custom.

CIprian unto Cicilie lib. 2. Epistola.3. There is no cause / why (dear
brother) that any manne should think the custom of some men ought to be
followed. If any man have thought that only water ought to be offered in the
chalyce: we must first ask whom they followed: and that Christ only ought to
be heard the father witnesses from heaven / saying: this is my well beloved
son / hear him. Wherefore if only Christ ought to be heard / we ought not to
regard what any man before us thought to be done / but what Christ / which is
before / did first: neither ought we to follow the custom of man / but the
truth of god.

THe same to Julian. of the baptising of heretykes in vain do some men / when
they be overcome with the truth / allege custom against us: as though
custom were greater / then the truth. Saint Augustine has the same.

THe same to Pompus against Steuens epistle. Custo^e / with out truth / is an
old error: for the which cause / let us leave custom and follow the truth.

Chrysostom upon Genesis.29. Homily.59. For if the counsel be good and
profitable / yea though it be not custom / keep it: but if it be hurtful and
noisome / cast it away. For if we will be wise and care for our salvation / we
may leave of an evil custom and bring in a good custom: and so shall we give
no small occasyo^ to the^ / that come after us / to change the same / and have
the reward of those things / that be done of them.

Jerome in his preface to Job. Old custom is of such force / that vices /
which many men them selves confess / please them through it.

THe same the.9. Cap. Neither ar the errors of our fathers / nor out elders /
to be followed: but the authorite of the Scriptures: and the commandments of
god / that teaches us.

AVgustine of one only Baptime lib. 2. Distinc.8. Cap. Vhen the truth is once
known / let custom give place to the truth. For who doubts, but custo^e
ought to give place to the manifest truth?

THe same in the sameplace. Let no man prefer custom above truth and
reason. For truth and reason do ever exclude custom.

GRegorius to Guelmunde the Bishop.2. Distinct. Siconsuetudo. If thou chance
to lay custom against me / thou must take heed what the lord says: I am
the way / the truth and the life. He did not say: I am custom / but the truth.

NIcolas the Pope to Ignatyus the reuereute Bishop.8. Distinc. An evil
custom is no les to be avoided / then an hurtefull corrupcyon: which except
it be plucked up the sooner by the roots: it will be taken of the ungodly for a
law.

Reasons against unwritten verites.
The.viii. Chapter.
THe old testamente was sufficient for the Jews: and why shall not both the
new and old suffice us?

Christ and the Apostles proved al their doctrynes / by the law and Prophets.
What an arrogancye is it then in us / to teach anyethynge / which we can
neither prove by the law / the Prophets / the Apostles / nor the Evangelists.

THe devil / when he tempted Christ / was not so far past al shame to
persuade any thing without the testimonye of the scriptures: althought he did
(as his dear children / the papists / do) falsely allege them / wrest them
from their true meaning to a contrary sense / and also cut of that / which
should make against him / or declare the true meaning of the scriptures.

THis word (unwritten verites) is a new term lateli inverted / and now here
heard or red among the old writers: of which they could not have been
ignorant / if there had been any such thing / needful to salvation.

AL conte^cion / which the old fathers had with heretics / was for the
scriptures: which heretics partly denied / as Marcio^ / Ma^lcheus and
Faustus: partly they wrongly expunded: but for things / which are not contained
in the scriptures / they never accused any man of heresye.

IF there were any word of god beside the scripture / we could never be
certain of gods word: and if we be incertayne of gods word / the devil might
bring in among us a new word / a new doctrine / a new faith / a new
church / a new god / yea himself to be god / as he has already done in the
popysh kyngdo^e. For this is the foundacyon of Antichrists kingdom / to
settle himself in gods temple / which is the heart and conscience of man: of
him to be feared and worshypped / as though he were god himself.

If the church and the Christyan faith did not stay it self upon the^ word
of god certain / as upon a suer and strong foundation: no man could know
whether he had a right faith / and whether he were in the true church of
Christ / or in the synagog of Satan.

IF we be bound to believe certai^e things / delivered from the Apostles by
word of mouth only / without writing / as they would make us believe (but what
those things be no man can tell): It should hereof follow / that we are bound to
believe we wot not what

Without faith it is not possible to please god: and faith comes by hearing
of gods word. Ergo where gods word lacks / there can be no faith.

Almighty god / a fore he gave to Moses the law written of the.x
commandments) wherein he fully taught the true worshippinge of him) as it were
a preservatyue against a plage or a poiso^ to come: gave the^ this no table
lesson, worthy always to be had in memory: you shall add nothing to the words
etc. and agai^e he often times repeteth the same se^te^ce both in the law and
the Prophets / in the gospels / and the Epistles of the Apostles. And because
his people should never forget it Saynct John commands the same in the last
words of all the new testament / threatening terrible plages (that is) the
loss of his everlasting Ioies of heaven / and the pain of eternal fire of
hell / to al them / that either put to or take aughte from the word of God.

Scriptures alleged by the Papystes for unwritten verites / with answers to
the same.
The.ix. Chapter.
WHere.ii. or.iii. be gathered in my name there am I in the myddest of them.
Math. 18.
But Christ can not err: Argument.
for he is the truth it self: ergo they cannot err in their Sinodes /
conuocations / and general counsels / being gathered together in his name.

CHrist said / when.ii. or.iii. Answer
be gathered in my name etc. and to be gathered in his name / is in our
assembles to seek his only glory and not ours / to do all things by his
prescript word. Math. 7.
For not eueri one that says unto me / Lord Lord / shall enter etc. As
witches / charmers / necromansers / and coniurars / use their wicked arts /
all in the name of God and Christ: Acres. 19.
and yet is not Christ with them. For the.vii. sons of Sceua / the chief
Priest of the Jews / went about to cast out evil spirited in the name of
Jesus / whom Paul preached: but yet Christ was not with them / but the wicked
spirit / which wounded them / and drove them away naked. Moreover all
forgers of wyles / counterfetters of false instruments / and judges geuyng
false sentences / in the ecclesiastical law / they begin with this glorious
titel: in the name of god / Amen. Therefore sprang this old proverb / in the
name of God begins al mischief: and yet Christ is with no^e of these /
though they pretend to do al these things in his name. Christ says also /
many shall prophecy in my name / and cast out devils and work miracles in my
name / and then will I confess to the^ / that I never knew you^ Read Euscbius
and Athanasius / and you shall there see / what pride / contencion / hatred /
malice / envy / and desrer to bear rule / reigned in the counsels of the
cleargi at those days / not much past.iiii. C. Math. 7.
years after Christ. What think you they would say / if they saw our
counsels / where the Romish Antichrist triumphs? no doubt / that though an
Angel from heaven preach any other etc. A replicacion.
Here you will replye again: Christ says where.ii. or.iii. ar gathered etc.
Now in every counsel are not only.ii. or.iii. learned and godly men / but
many. Ergo they cannot err. Answer
I grant that in every general counsel be many good men / which do not err /
nor are deceived: and yet it follows not that the whole council cannot err.

For in councels the more part is taken for the whole / and shynges be there
determined and ordered / not by reason / learning / and authority of the word
of god: but by sioutnes / wisfulnes and consent of the more part. In those
counsels / where be mo evil and wicked men / then good and godli / it comes
often times to pass / that iniquite having the upper hand / the greater part
overcomes the better: and yet the good me^ nothererre / nor co^set to these
errors concluded by the wicked and the more part / but resist and speak
against the^ to the utmost of their power not without great danger of their
lives / yea and so^etimes it costeth the^ their lives in deed / as it is now
daily seen.

THe Scribes and the Pharisees sit upon Moses seat / Math. 23. The. 2. argument
what soever they bid you do / that do / but after their works do not: for
they say and do not. Here (they say) it appears plainly / that Christ
commands us to obey the heads of the church / how evil soever their lives
be.

FIrst let them look well what manner men they make them selves / that is /
Scribes and Pharisees the greatest enmys of god / persecutors and murderers of
his Prophets / of the Apostles / and of Christ himself / and so Antichrists.
The first answer.
Secondly Moses seat is not his office or authorite / but his doctrine: and
therefore says S. Augustine / that seat / which is his doctrine / suffers
them not to err: The second answer.
and in another place / they sitting in Moses scate teach the law of god /
therefore god teaches by the^. But if they will teach their own doctrine /
believe them not: for such seek their own and not Jesus Christ's: and Christ
hiddeth us beware of the leue^ of the Pharisees / and then the disciples knew
that the spoke not of the leven of bread but of their doctrynes / although
they sat in Moses seat / if they will needs contend / the dignite or office
of Moses / to be Moses seat / and yet erred shamfully in their doctrine.

Behold / I am with you all the days unto the worlds end: the forth argument
Math. 28
this promise was not made to the Apostles only (for they dyed shortly after
Christ) but to the church. Ergo the church cannot err.

I Beseech the^ to begin a litell before / and they shall plainly hear
Christ himself unloose this knotte. Answer
The words before ar these in Mark: go and preach my gospel to every
creature / and in Mathewe: go and teach all people / baptysinge them in the
name of the father / of the son etc. teaching them to observe all things /
what soever I have commanded you: and lo / I will be with you unto the worlds
end. Here you may see this promise of Christ / I will be with you etc. is not
absolute or universal / but given under a condition (that is) if you preach
my gospel truly / if you baptize rightly / if you teach the baptized to do all
things / that I have commanded you: lo / then I will be with you unto the
worlds end. But if you teach any other gospel / or baptize otherwise / or
bydde them do any other thing / above that which I have commanded you: you
have no promise of god / but the curse / that Paul threatens: though we or
an Angel from heaven preach etc.

I Have yet many mooe things to say unto you / but you cannot bear them away
now: The. 5. argument John. 16.
howbeit when he is come / which is the sprite of truth / he will lead you
into all truth, Here you may see / (say the enmies of gods truth) that
Christ taught not all things himself / but left many things to be taught to
the disciples / by the holy ghost after his death.

Christ said not / I have many things to say / which I will not tell you now /
but which you can not bear now. Answer
That is / you can not perceive or understand them now: and thus Christ
himself expounds these words / the co^forter / which is the holy ghost / who^
my father will se^d in my name: John. 14.
he shall teach you al things / and put you in rememberaunce of all things /
that I have said unto you / and no new or other things. For christ says
plainly that he himself had taught them all before / saying: John. 15.
all things / that I have heard of my father / have I opened unto you.

Moreover our Savior in plain words shows what things those were / that
his disciples could not understand / although he many times told them the
same before. Behold / says he / we gooe up to Jerusalem / Luke. 18.
and all shall be fulfilled / that are wryt te^ by the Prophets of the son of
man. For he shall be delivered to the ge^tyls and shall be mocked / and
despitefully entreated / and spitted on / and when they have scorged him / they
will put him to death / and the third day he will rise again: and they
understood none of these things. For these sayings we hid from them so /
that they perceived none of the things / that were spoken: although he spoke
to the^ in most plain teruis. And the cause / why they perceived not his so
plain speech / was this. They were yet carnal / and understood the prophesies
of Chrysts kingdom carnally / thinki^g that Christ should reign at Jerusalem
like a mighty conqueroure / and subdewe all the Gentyles under the yoke of
bondage to the Jews / so that the Jews should be Lords and rulers over all
the world for ever. Math. 20
And therefore James and John asked a peticio^ of Jesus by their mother / that
they / her two sons / might sit the one on his right hand / and the other on
his left hand / in his kingdom: and when he spoke of his death / Peter took
him aside and rebuked him saying: Master favor thy self / this shall not
happen unto the / to whom Christ said / go after me Satan. Math. 16
These be the things / that the disciples could not then bear or understand
/ but thought that he had spoken some allegory / ridle or dark speech unto
the^: but after his resurrection / he opened their wits that they might
understand the Scryptures / and said unto them:thus it is written / and thus
it behooved Christ to suffer. And to the two / discipls going to Emaus / he
expounded Moses / the Prophets and all the scripturs / that were written of
him. And after the ascensio^ the holy ghost appeared to the^ in fiery tongues /
and filled them with all knowledge / and they began to speak with sondrye
tongues / as the holy ghost gave them vtteraunce: and then they understood the
Scryptures perfectlye.

Again / there are many other things / that Jesus did / which / if they were
written / I suppose / the world should not be able to conteyne the books /
that should be written.

Saint John speaks not here of faith and charity but of miracles / the
knowledge whereof is not necessary for our salvation / as his words following
do declare: Answer
these ar written / that you might believe / that Jesus is Christ / the son
of God / and in believing may have life in his name. And what is more required
or desiered of a Christian / then to enjoy everlasting life? that ought to be
our whole study and endeavor / to that end ought we to apply all our minds /
words and works and prayers.

Stand fast brethren / and keep the ordinances / that ye have 2 Thessalonians. 2
argument
learned either by our preachi^g or by our Epistle. Of these words they gather
/ that Paul taught diverse things to the Thessalonians by word of mouth /
without writing: which nevertheless he commanded them to observe and do.

I Grant that Paul taught many things by word of mouth which he wrought not
in his Epistles to the Thessalonia^s. Answer.
But how that they prove / that the same things be neither written by him in
any other of his Epistles / nor in any other place of the hole Bible? For what
argument is this? it is not written in this place or to those persons / ergo it
is not written in the scripture at al. For the shortness of one Epistle / or of
one sermon / cannot sufficiently co^teine al things necessary for our
salvation: and therefore be there so many books of the scripture that what so is
omitted and not spok^ of in one place / or else darkly spoken of / might be
written plainly in another place. And for this cause S. Paul writes to the
Colossia^s* sayi^g: when this leter is read with you / cause it also to be
read to the Laodicians. And read you also the Epistle written from Laodicia.
And Saint Paul writes of himself / such as we are in our absence by leters
/ such are we in deed being present. 2. Cor. 10
Moreover Paul speaks not here of doctrynes of faith and charity / which
ever continue without changing / adding or minishyng / but of certain
tradicions / obseruacyous / ceremonies and outward rites and bodily exercyces
/ which (as he says) is litell worth to god ward / but to be used for
comlines / decent order and vniformite in the church / and to avoid schism:
which ceremonies every good man is bound to keep / lest he trouble the common
order / and so break the order of charity in offendi^g his weak brethren / so
long as they be approved / received / and used by the heads and common
consent. But they and every one of such ceremonies / as be neither sacraments
/ nor commandments of faith and charity / may be altered and changed / and
other set in their places / or else utterly taken away by the authorite of
Princes / and other their rulers and subjects in the church. Yea also the
tradycyo^s / made by the Apostles in full counsel at Jerusalem / may be / and
already are / taken away: Acts. 1^
as to abstain from things offered unto Images / from blood and strangled /
ar no where kept. And this of Paul / that a man should neither pray nor
preach capped / or with his head covered / is also clean abolyshed.

TErtullian of the croune of a soldier. Argument.
He reciting many tradicyons (as to reneu^ce the devil / his po^pe and his
Angels before Baptism / to dip the children thrice in the fou^t / to give it
pappe of honey and milk first thing after baptime / and not to wa^^e it in a
whole week after / to offer both at the day of the burial and birth / on the
so^day neither to fast neither to pray knelyng / nor also from Easter to
whitsontide / crossinge of our foreheades / with diverse such like) says: If
thou require a law of these and other such disciplines / there can be no
pretense of a law for them out of the scriptures. But thou shall either
perceive by thy self / or learn of some other / that perceaueth it: that
custom being author / confirmer / conseruer and obseruer of faith / shall
maintain and defend the cause of this tradicion and custom of faith.

BY the scriptures before alleged Ans^ere
it is euidentlye proved / that all things / requisite for out salvation / be
set forth in the holy books of the bible / and that it is not lawful to put
any thing thereto / under pain of euerlastying damnacyo^. The same Tertullia^
also / as it is before rehearsed / says that there is nothing else / that ought
to be believed after Chrysts gospel o^ce published. Understand here as
necessary to salvation.
Yea all the old authors / a thousand year after Christ / and likewise /
almost / all the new / affirm the same: and would not have us credyte their
sayi^gs without the proof of gods word.

Why should we then believe Tertullian against so plain Scripturs / against
the old fathers of the church / and also contrary to his own sayings? Yet
here will I gentlye interpret him / so as he may both agree with the
Scriptures / with the old authors / and also with himself. Tertullya^
speaks here / not of doctrines of faith / hope / and charity: but of
tradycions / outward gestures / rites and ceremonies / which he not necessary
for our salvation: but be ordained for a decente order / and conformite in the
church / as is plainly showed in the answer to Saint Paul in the Epistle to
the Thessalonia^s. And that he speaks of such rites and ceremonies it is
evident. For all those that he rehearses be mere ceremonies / and few of them
kept at this day: which noma^ might have altered or abolyshed / if they had
been necessarilye to be kept / under pain of damnacion.

CIprian to Pompeius against Steue^s Epistle. Argument.
It is of no less authorite that the Apostles delivered by the instructyon of

the Apostles delivered in their writings: Answer
as the gospels and Epistles / like as Paul says: I delivered you that I
received of the Lorde^ which thing he wrote to the^. But if they will needs
understand him of things delivered by the Apostles without writing: then
answer him as Tertullian.

Origin. Argument.
In obseruau^ces of the church / there be diverse things which al men must
needs do / and yet the reason of them is unknown to all men. And he recites

can certainly tell the cause of all these things?

Argument.
State et tenete. Hereby it is plain / that Paul delivered many things
without the scripture / not written in his Epistles / but by word of mouth
only. And these are worthy no less faith / then the other. Therefore I do

that if any thing be delivered by it / make no farther searche^.

Chrysostom) it is plain / that Paul delivered not all things in his Epistles

of credit: it is a tradicion / search no farther.

li. 2 to mo.1. Against those that call themselves Apostles.1. cor. 11. 14. 15
We must (says he) use tradicions: for all things can not be perceived by the
holy scripture. Wherefore the holy Apostles have set forth unto us some things
by the word of god / and so^e things by tradicions / as the Apostle says: as
I have delivered unto you / thus I teach / and thus I have delivered in all
churches / and thus you remember by what means I have preached unto you /
except you have believed in vain.

Answer these.iii. authors like as Tertullyan is answered: Answer
saving that they allege S. Paul for their purpose / but clearly wrested from
his true meaning / as it shall easily appear to every indifferent reader / that
is not blinded of malice to resyst the truth / as they may plai^ly perceue by
the answer made to S. Paul before. And whereas they say / that things / given
by word of mouth / are as well to be believed / as those / that be written:
they mean that they are worthy of like credit with tradycyons written. For
neither of both ar of necessite to salvation: but may be changed / and taken
away by common consent / as it is before said.

BAsile of the holy ghost. Cap. 27. Of those doctrines / that are preached in
the church / we have so^e delivered us by writing / and again / some we have
received by the tradicions of the Apostles in mysteri that is in secret: both
have like strength to godlynes / another does any man speak against these /
whatsoever he be / that has but mean experience what the authorite of the
church is. For if we (like fools) go about to reiecte the customs of the
church / which are not written / as things of small weight: we shall condemn
those things / that be nedeful for our salvation in the gospel. Yea we shall
rather cut short the true preaching of faith to bare name. and he rehearses
like tradicions / as Tertullian did.

Jerome against the Luciferians. Although there were no authorite of the
scriptures at all / yet the consent of the whole world / in this matter /
should have the force of a law. For many other things / which are observed in
the Church by tradicio^ / have obtained the authorite of a law written: as to
dip the head thrice in baptism: and when they are chrystened / to give them
first pappe made of milk with honey / for a signification of their infancy: on
the Sunday / and all Whytsone weak / not to knele at their prayers.

AVgustine upon the words of Basile. Some of the ecclesiastical institucions
we have receued by writings: some through tradicions from the Apostles /
approved by successiosn: and some use has allowed / being strengthened by
custo^e. Unto all which like usage and like affectyo^s of godliness is due. of
which who will doubt / though he have but small experiences in the scriptures?
For if we set out mind to regard light lycustomes of the church / delivered us
from our elders without the scriptures: it shall easelye appear to them that
look earnestly thereon / how great loss Christen religion shall suffer. And he
recites the same that Jerome does / with diverse other.

THese.iii. Answer
authors / and all that make for the same purpose / be answered before in
Tertullian. For not one of those things / that they make mention of / are
necessary for our salvation: and many of them are now taken away: and the rest
/ which yet remain (as to dippe the child thrice wholly in the water: to
hallowe the water / oil / and cream: or to cross it in the forthead) are not
of necessite to salvation. For John Baptized in Iorda^ and the Cha^berlaine of
the Queen of Ethiopia was Christened in the common stream / and chrildre^ in
danger of life are Christened of the midwife / or so^e other woman / without
any of these ceremonies: and yet they will not deni that al these baptismes be
good / and allowed of god. In Spain also they dippe the child but once / as it
was decreed in the counsel of Tollet. And I am suer / they will not say that all the Spaniardes / so many years / have wanted a thing necessary to salvation in
their baptism. God also regards not our outward bodily gesture in our
prayers: but he beholds the faith / and earnest desire of the heart of him
that prays / where soever he prays / and what soever his outward bodily
gesture be.

THe sa^e against Cresconi a gramarie^ li. 1. c. 33. to. 7. argument
Although we have no certain example of this matter in the Canonical
scripture: yet nevertheless / the truth of the sa^e scriptures in this matter is
retained of us / when we do that / that the hole church aloweth. Which church
the authorite of the scriptures commend. And for as much / as the holy
scripture ca^ deceive no man: whosoever fears to be deceived with any dark
speaking of it / let him ask counsel at the church there in / which without
any doubt the holy scripture does show.

THe answer is easy. Answer.
Austen was more circumspecte. the^ to think that any doctrine might be proved
by use and custom without the scripture. For baptysme of infa^tes he brings
in this text, except a man be borne again of water and the holy ghost / he
cannot be my disciple. And because the Donatists (like as the Anabaptists do
now) wrest this to them / that be of ^eres of discretion: against this
exposicio^ / he allegeth the manner of the church in christenynge of Infantes.

By the which he proves / that the church has all way taken this sentence:
except a man be borne again / to be spoken also of infantes. What manner of
argument should this be of Austen^ The exposition of the scripture / and the
use of the Sacraments / may be judged by the custom used in the holy church
always: ergo the church may make a new sacrament / and ordeine any new
Article of our faith without the scripture. By the se^tences before cited of
Auste^ himself / it may be easily judged. I also grant that every exposicio^
of the scripture / wherein soever the old / hole and true church did agree is
necessary to be believed. But our controuersye here is / whether any thing
ought to be be leued of necessite / without the scripture.

THe same against the Epistle of Fundament Cap. 5. tomo. 6. argument
I would not believe the gospel / but that the authorite of the church moves
me. Ergo (say they) what soever the church says / we must needs believe them /
as well as the gospel. This argument is naught. For the testimonye of the
church is but as a public office of a record / as the exchequer / the court
of the rolls / the office of a recorder / or a regester of all Christendom:
in which office men may search and have / of the keepers of such offices /
the true copies of such lands / or other moueables / as be due to them by the
law. And yet may nether the Regesters / Recorders / Stcwardes of courts / or
town clerks put to / or take away any thing from the first original
writings / no nor the judge himself.

But all things ought to be judged by those writings. So likewise we believe
the holy Canon of the bible / because that the Primitive church of the
Apostles / and eldest writers / and next to their time / approved them in
their regester: that is / in their wrytinges / which partlye saw them / and
partlye heard them of the Apostles. And more receue we not / because these
old fathers of the first church testify in their books / that there was no
more then these required to be believed as the scripture of god. And yet were
these wrytynges no less true / before they were allowed by them / the^ sense /
Christ witnessing and saying: I seek no witness of man.

AVstine to Cassulane. argument
In these things / wherein the scripture of god has determined nothing / the
custom of the people / and our elders ordinances / ought to be holden as a
law: and the tra^sgressors of the customs of the church at like wise to be
punished / as the breakers of gods law.

Of which things if thou will dispute / and reprove one custom by another:
there shall arise an endless strife. He repeteth also this sentence many
times: that what so ever is universally observed and not written in the
scripture / nor ordained by general councils: is a tradicio^ come from the
Apostles.

Answer him as Tertullyan: and yet of all other authors he is most plain /
that nothing is of necessite to salvation / besides the Scriptures of God.
Answer
But let us grant for their pleasures / that those customs / which they
speak of / be traditions Apostolyke: yet they be no longer nor other ways
to be observed / then the traditions Apostolic written. Which / as is before
fully proved / may (and are already) be both changed / and clearly taken
away. And as concerning custom it is plainly proved / that it is not to be
received against the Scripture / truth / or reason.

THey sai moreover that the perpetual virginite of our Lady is to be believed
of necessite / as Ciprian / Chrysostom / Jerome / Ambrose / Austen / and all
other speaking thereof say. But this is not found in the scripture: ergo there
is some thing to be believed that is not written in the Scripture.

THe minor / that is to say / that this is not written in the scripture / is
false. Answer
For first none of the old authors / that rehearce traditions of the Apostles
unwritten / make mention of the perpetual virginite of our lady / to be one of
them: but they rehearce only diverse ceremonies / or bodily gestures / and
such rites used in Baptism / prayers / holy days and fastings / which (as I
have manyfestly declared) are not necessary to salvation. But the most part of
them are clean taken away / and the contrary commanded / and used by the
universal church. Moreover all the said authors prove her perpetual
virginite by this text of Scripture.

EZechiell. 44. This door shall be still shut / and not opened for any man to
go through it: but only for the Lord god of Israel / yea he shall go through
it / else shall it be shut still. For if these / and such other fathers / had
not judged her perpetual virginite to have been written in the scriptures:
they would never have judged it to have been a thing to be believed under pain
of damnacyon.

Saint Jerome also calls Heluidiu^ a rash / and an ungodly man: because
that he taught / that our Lady had other children by Joseph after Christ's
birth / which doctrine he could not prove by the scriptures of god. In like
manner we call al them / that preach a ny doctrine in the church without the
Authorite of gods word / both ungodly / rash and wicked members of Antichrist.

ARgument. argument
Yet they bring forth to maintain their error the Baptism of infantee /
which (they say) is not contained in the scriptures: and yet this is to be
observed upon pain of da^nacio^ / of the said children Ergo there is so^e
thing to be done of necessite to our salvation / that is not contained in the
scriptures.

ON what a gappe these men open both to the Donatistes and to the Anabaptists /
that deny the baptising of infantes. Answer
For if it were not written in the word of god / no man ought to believe it
or use it. And so the Donatistes and Anabaptists doctrine were true / and outs
false. But in deed the baptism of infau^tes is proved by the plain
scriptures. First by the figure of the old law / which was circu^cisio^.
Infa^tes in the old law were circumcised: Ergo in the new law they ought to
be baptized. Again: Infa^tes pertain to god / as it is said to Abraham I will
be thy god / and the god of thy sede after thee. Gene. 17
Christ says also: suffer children to come to me / for of such is the kingdom
of heaven. Math. 19.
And again: see that ye despice not one of these little ones: Luke. 19.
for their Angels in heaven always behold the face of my father / which is in
heaven: for the son of ma^isco^e to save that / that is lost. And agai^e
Paul says / that your children art holy now. 1. Cor. 7.
By these and many other plain words of Scripture it is euidente / that the
Baptysme of infantes is grounded upon the holy scriptures.

FVrthermore the church / say they / has changed the Sabbath day into the
Sunday / which Sabbath was commanded by God / and never man found fault there
at. argument
Seeing the^ that the church has authorite to change Gods laws: much more
it has authorite to make new laws necessary to salvation.

THere be. 2. parts of the Sabbath day. One is the outward bodily rest from
all manner of labor and work: and this is were ceremonial / and was taken
away with other sacrifices and ceremonies by Christ at the preaching of the
gospel. The other part of the Sabbath day is the inward rest or ceassing from
sin / from our own wills and lusts / and to do only gods will and
commandments.

Of this part speaks the Prophet Esai. Esai. 56.
He / that takes head that he vnhalow not the sabbath day / is he / that
keeps himself that he do no evil: and they that hold greatly of the thing
that pleases me / and keep my couenau^te / unto them will I give an everlasting
name / that shall not peryuse. And moreover the same Prophet says. Esai. 58.
If thou turn thy feet from the sabbath / so that thou do not the thing /
which pleases thy self / in my holy day: Then shalt thou be called unto the
pleasant / holy and glorious sabbath of the Lord / where thou shalt be in
honor / so that thou do not after thine own imaginacions / nether seek thine
own will / nor speak thine own words. Then shall thou have thy pleasure in
the Lord, which shall carry the high above the earth / and feed thee with the
heritage of Jacob thy father: for the Lords own mouth has spoken it. This
spiritual Sabbath / that is / to abstain from sin and to do good / are all
men bound to keep all the days of their life / and not only on the sabbath
day. And this spiritual sabbath may no man alter nor chaung / no not the whole
church. That the utter obseruinge of the sabbath is mere cerimonial / saint
Paul writes plainly: as that the holy days of the new moan and of the
sabbath days are nothing but shadows of things to come. To lanuarye epist.
119. The bodily rest on the sabbath day is figuratively to be kept.


And that the outward bodily rest is a mere cerimoniall precept S. Austine
also affirms / saying that among all the ten commandments / this only /
that is spoken of the sabbath / is commanded figuratively: but all the other
commandments we must observe plainly / as they be commanded / with out any
figuratyue speech.

Jerome also to the Galathians. 4. according to the same / says: lest the
congregation of the people / with out good order / should dimmishe the faith
in Christ: therefore certain days were appointed / wherein we should come
together / not that that day is holyer / then the other / in which we come
together: but that what soever day we assemble in / there might arise greater
joy by the sight of one of us to another. To the perfect Ghristia^ al days be
like and eueri day is good friday, eueri day is Easter day, and we eat^ his
flesh always.


But he / that will answer wittelye to the question propounded / affirms all
the days to be like / and not that Christ is crucified only on good fridai and
rises only on the so^day: but that every day is the day of the Lords
resurrection / and we eat his flesh always. But fastinges and comminges
together / were ordained of wise men for the^ that give themselves rather to the
world then to God: that cannot / yea for the^ / that will not come there at all
/ there to make their sacrifice of prayers to god / in the face of all the
people.

Herby you may easily perceive / that the church has not changed the special
part of the sabbath / which is to cease from vice and sin: but the
cerimoniall part of the Sabbath only / which was abrogate / and taken away /
with other ceremonies of Moses law / by Christ at the full preachi^g of the
gospel. In place whereof the church has ordained the sunday for causes before
said.

IF the trial of true religion should rest upon antiquite of time / or upon
worldly prosperity: Answer
the^ should the gentyls / and pagans / have a great advantage of us
Chrystians: and their religion should be better then ours / by the restimonies
of our own scriptures. For idolatrye and wor^^ipping of false gods and their
image^^ was used long before the law of god / written and given to Moses / in
which errors and idolatry the heathen continewe unto this day / in great
prosperity and wealth under most victorious Emperors and Princes: whereas the
true church of Christ has been most miserably affllicted / from time to
time: first under the Egiptia^s / after by the Philistines / Cananites /
Pheresites / etc. then by the Babilonians / Assirians / Medes / Persians /
Sirians / and Romans / both subdued / conquest and led away captyues. And
last of all (by the turk and the pope / the.ii. horns of Antichrist; the true
church of christ has been mostcruelly persecuted unto death / with prison /
famine / water / fire / faggot / and sword / these.vii. or viii. years last
past. Which Turk and Pope / although they be mortal enemies the one to the
other / yet as Herod / Pilate / the Bishops / Scribes and Pharisees / although
they were utter foes each to other / conspired against iunocent Christ /
causeles condemning him to death on the cross: In like manner / I say / the
Pope and the Turk do fully agree in this one point / to persecute and murder
Christ in his faithful members. For as the son can not be without his
brightness / nor the fire without his heat: so cannot the true church of God
/ be long without the cross of persecucyon / as witnesses S. Paul: al they
that will live godly in Jesus Christ shall suffer persecucion. And our savior
Christ says plainly / that his kingdom is not of this world.

For if they persecute me (says he) they shall also persecute you: Christ's
bage.
and Christ gives not to his Apostles earthlye peace in this world / but
peace and quietness of conscience / joined with persecucion. For if the wicked
persecuted Christ himself / shall they not also persecute his servants? And
if they so handeled Christ / being the lively tre^ / what think you shall they
do to us / his withred branches? And as the true church of Christ can never
be long without persecution: in like manner can the false church of Satan /
and Antichriste / never cease from persecutynge / as it appears through
out the Historyes of the whole bible. Of the tyranny / and crueltye of
Antichrist in persecutyng of Christ's true church / prophesied Daniel long
before: Dani. 7.
speaking of the Empire and regiment of Rome. The mark to know antichrist by,
is to preuaill (by persecucion) against gods elect saints Daniel. 8. And the
mark of the true church is to be persecuted of Antichriste.
The.4. beast (says he) shall be the.iiii. kingdom / which shall be greater
then all other kingdoms: it shall devour / tread down and destroy all
other lands / he shall speak words against the higheste of all* he shall

times and laws: and again he says of Antiochus / which was a figure of
Antichrist: there shall arise a king un shamfast of face / he shall be wise in
dark speaking / he shall be mighty and strong / but not in his own strength / he
shall destroy above measure / and all that he goes about shall prosper in his
hand: his heart shall be proud / he shall slaye the strong and holy people /
and through his craftines falseheade shall prosper in his hand / and many one
shall he put to death in his weal thynes: he shall stand up against the Prince
of Princes / but he shall be slain without hand. Of the tyranny and prosperous
success of antichrist in slaying of the sayuctes of god / and the reward of
them that be slain for the witness of gods truth / speaks also saint John
in the.vi. Chapter of his Apocalips / under the openyng of the iiii. Read the
places.
and.v. seals: and in the.xvii. chapter / he lively sets forth the Pope in
his own colors / under the person of the whore of Babylon / being dronken with
the blood of saynctes: pointyng as it were with his finger who this whore of
Babylon is / and the place where she shall reign / saying: the woman / which
thou saw / is that great city / which reigns over the kings of the
earth. Now what other city reigned at that time or at any time since under the
Christian kings of the earth / but only Rome: Whereof it follows Rome to be
the seat of Antichrist / and the Pope to be very Antichrist himself. I could
prove the same by many other scriptures / old writers and strong reasons. But
for as much as Rodulphe Gualter has written hereof a notable work in Late^ /
and now of Laten translated into English by I. O. I remit the reader to his
book / wherein he may be fully satisfied hereof. Of the prosperity and securite /
that the false church has in worldly pleasures / using the same with all
gredines and voluptuousnes of carnal lusts / with the wicked devices of
tyranny against Christ and his true members / wherewith the ungodly daily
persecute and murder gods elect for his truth / with the reward also of
them that suffer for the same truth sake: it is most plainly written in the ii.
Read the Chapters
and.iii. Chapters of the book of wisdom.

By these scriptures now rehearsed it appears most plainly / that worldly
prosperity of the Pope and his clargy prove not the truth of their doctrine:
nor yet persecutyon of Gods true preachers / and other faithful people /
argues their doctrine to be false. But if thou will needs know where the
true church of Christ is and where the false / and not be deceived: herin take
this for a plain and full answer / that wheresoever the word of god is truly
preached without addicio^ of man's doctrines and traditions / and the
sacraments duly ministered according to Christ's institucion / there is the true
church / the very spouse of god / Christ be^ig the head thereof. But how many /
and who of that number / that hear the word of god / and receive the
sacraments / be gods elect and church and true members of Christ / is known
to god only. For the Lord knows who he his / and no man can tell / of an
other man / whether he be worthy love or hatred / although their works seem
never so holy and glorious before men / so great a wytch is Ipocrisie.

them / and they should be delivered from the fire of purgatory / where the
pains be greater (say they) than man's wit can comprehend. And wha^ such
masses / pilgrimages with offringes to such saints relics and images be
done for them / they appear to the same persons again / saying / that by
such means they be delivered out of purgatory into the eternal joys of
heaven: they tell also of many wonders and strange miracles / to prove their
doctrine / in all these before said things / to be true. And because they have
great profit and aduau^tage thereby / they (counting gains godlynes) have
filled all their books with such vanites and lies: of which some be so fond
/ and so directly against gods glory / that the most earneste papists (having
either learning or wit) be ashamed of the^. Yea and the pope himself has
clean put them out of gods service / used in the church of Rome: and yet must
we read them / believe them as necessary articles of our faith / or else burn
therefore like heretics.

BY the^ manifest and plain words of the Scriptures / and the consent of the
most auncyente authors before written / it is euydente / that neither the
visions of Angels / apparitions of the dead / nor miracles nor all these
together joined in one / are able or sufficient to make any one new article
of our faith / or stablyshe any thing in religion / without the express Answer
words of god: because that all such things (as is before proved) may be / yea
and have been (through gods permission for our sins and vubelefes sake)
done by the power of the devil himself / or feigned and counterfeited of his
lyuelye members / Monks / and Friars / with other such hipocrites.

But what shall satan need to tell oracles / use visions / show apparitio^s /
or work miracles now a days? what should he need to toil herin himself? or
why should he not / like a gentle man / take his ease in his inn? seeing his
subtle servants Monks / Friars / No^nes and other Pope holy hipocrites /
can and do counterfeit such things day lie / and from their beginning has
do^ diligently: par^e whereof I shall rehearse. John sleidane.
About fourtene years paste at Orlea^ce in France the Profestes wife died /
willing to beburied at the friars in the same city / without po^pe or other
solemnite commonly used at burialles. Wherefore the friars / fearinge to lease a
great pray / if this should be suffered to enter into the heads of the people
/ caused a young friar to speak in a vawte in a womans voice / many people
hearing it: and said that she was the soul of the Profests wife condemned in
hell for contemnyng of the suffrages of the holy church / commanding also her
body to be cast out of Christian burial. But the profeste so boolted out the
matter / that the yo^g friar confessed the place and the manner of his speaking:
and all the friars were openly punished for that fault / in the common market
at Orleance. But let us come home to our own realm of England. About.xxx.
yers paste in the borders of wales / within a Priory called Lymster / there was
a young woman called the holy maid of Lymster: which / as the fa^e was /
lived only by Angels food / and was enclosed within a grate of Irone. Unto
whom certain days / when the Prior of the place sayede mass / the third
part of the host went hanging in the air (by miracle / as it seemed) from the
altar / where the Prior massed / into the maids mouth: which thing brought
the people into a great opinion of holiness in her / and caused great pilgrimage
to be there used. But when the Lord of Burgauenny, with his brother sir Edward
^euel and diverse other ientle men and ientle weme^ / came to try the truth
her of: they caused the door to be opened / and strayghte ways the dogs
fought for bones / that were under her bed. Whereupon they / searching farther
/ found a priuye door / whereby the Prior might resort to her and she to him
/ at their pleasures. And then the confessed that she made (as it were).ii. fine
thredes of her own here is si^gly tied together with fine knottes: and then made
a big hole with a bed kin / through the corner of a quarter of the host /
and fastened one end of the said here to the corporas / where the said
Prior said mass / and the other end to her own bed / wherein the lay: and
tied the other here fast to the quarter of the host / and wrapped the other
end about her own finger. And when the Prior had received his portion of the
host / she wo^de vy the threde (whereto the host was tied) upon her fingers /
and so conveyed the ost into her mouth. This both the Prior and she confessed /
and did open penance for the same. To Saint Albans / about.xxviii. years
past / came a maid / crepyng upon her knees and lening upon.ii. short staves
enquiring after Saint Alba^s bo^es / affirminge that she should be made
whole and go upright / so sone as she should come to the place / where sai^ct
Albans bones were. In token whereof an Angel had delivered her a keye / whereby
she should certenlye know where his very bones were. And when she passed thus
through the streates of Saint Albans creping on her knees till she came to
Saint Albans shrine / after she had made her prayers devoutly there / she took
out the key of her purse / which she said an Angel had delivered to her: and
the^ she stood upright and opened the shrine with the said key / and then
kneled again to pray and to give thanks to god and saint Alba^e for her
healing and giving her strength to walk / which was borne la^e. And by and
the monks would have had it ro^ge for a miracle: but some wiser men thought it
mete to try the matter better and to examine her further / before they tempted
to ri^ge a miracle op^enly. And upon her examinacion / the said that she had
been lame from her birth: declarynge both her ^inred and place / where she was
borne.

Upon which confession she was committed to a no^nery called Sopwel / there to
ta^y until messengers / which they straight way sent forth / might return and
testify the truth. And so she daily and holyly visited saynct Albans shrine.
But the night before the return of the messengers she was conveyed away and
never heard of nor seen after. And the messengers declared to be lies all that
ever she had said: for there was never none borne lame / nor of her name /
where she said she was borne.

A strange thing it is / to hear of the wonderful traunces and visions of
mistres A^ne We^tworth of Suffolk / which told many men the secrets of their
hertes / which they thought no man could have told but god only: she cut
stomagers in pieces and made them whole again / and caused diverse men / that
spoke against her delusio^s / to go star^e mad. Al which things were proved
and openly by her confessed to be done by necromancy and the desceit of the
devil.

But yet Elizabeth Barton / telled the holy maid of Cou^top streat in ke^t /
passed al other in deuelish devises. Elzabeth Barton.
For she could (when she life) O diuilishe illusion.
feign her self to be in atraunce / disfigure her face / draw her mouth awrye
toward the one ear / faynynge that she was thus tormented of Satan for the
sins of the people / and delivered from his power by our blessed lady of
Courtop streat / and by her led into heaven / hell and purgatory: Read more of
herin her book set forth in print and in Halles cronicle.
and there saw all the joys and pains of those places / and took upon her to
prophesy of things to come / and of the kings death. This instrumente of the
devil drew into her confederacy both of heresy and treason / holy monks of
the Charter house / obstinate (they would be called) obseruaunt Friars of
Grenwich / nice No^nes of Sion / black monks (both of coules and conditions)
of Christ's church and saint Austyns of Canterbury / Knights / Squiers /
learned men Priests and many other: of which sort (whether they were bli^ded by
her or else of their own mere malice and ypocrisie dissembled the matter) some /
by d^e proof made against them / were iustlye condemned / both of heresy and
treason / and suffered with the saict Elizabeth Barto^ / according to their
demerites: and some / acknowledginge their own offense / were delivered by the
kings pardon. This wicked woman caused a letter to be made by a monk of
Saint Austins of Canterbury in golden letters / feining the same to be
delivered to her by an Angel from heaven. A letter forged as though it had
come from heaven.
This mo^ster was conuented both before William Warha^ / Archbishop of
Canterbury / and Thomas Wolsey / Cardinal and Archbishop of York. Who either
because that generation of the clergy has always defended idolatrye and
supersticion / or because she knew to much of their incontinency and other
wickedness of living (for she threatened them with eternal da^nacyon / except
they repented and amended their lives) Bishops ever have been bolsterers of
idolatry.
they clearly discharged her without finding of any fault in her at al. But
when the matter came to be examined by Thomas Craumer / Archbishop of
Canterbury / and Thomas Cromwell / then master of the rolls: they so handeled
the matter / that they found out the whole nest of that conspiracy: wherein was
disclosed the whole number of those confederates / their books of heresye and
treason / the authors and writers of the same / and of the letter feyned to be
sent from heaven. Al whose detestable factes / as well of idolatry / heresy and
also of treason / were so wittely and learnedly by Gods word convinced at
canterburye by Doctor Hethe / now chaunceler of England / (she being present
and openly confessing the same) and also by another learned man at Paul's cross:
that the most part of them / which were before by her seduced / did then
utterly abhor her shameless and abominable factes. what a crafty point of
legerdemaine was played about the beginning of king Edwardes reign by a Pryest?
which being at mass pricked his own finger and caused it to drop upon the ost
/ persuading the people that the oste bled of it self by the miraculous
workyng of god / for to make the world believe the body of Christ to be as
really and naturally in the sacrament / as he was born of the virgin Mari his
mother. A notable miracle.
For the which hein^us fact / proved against him and also by him confessed / he
did open penance at Paul's cross. I will rehearce one sermon / made in Queen
Maryes beginning by a momysh Monk / and so leave of their vayn and wicked
lies. A new vpstert precher / being so^e time a monk of Chrysts church in
Ca^torbury / stepped into the pulpit in saynct Paul's church / saying that the
very body of christ is realli and naturally in the sacrament of the altar:
Christ prouedre alli in the host by 2. horses, the devil sp^aking in one of
them.
yea by gods body is it / quoth he: and because that nether oath nor perjury can
prove a good argument / he proved the same by three notable miracles. The first
of an horse / refusing to eat wafers so long / as their cakye god was among
the^: the. 2. by the devil speaking in the likeness of an horse / being co^iured
of a Priest by gods body to tell what he was: and the 3. a maid of Northgate
parish in Ca^terburi / who he said in pretense to wipe her mouth kept the ost
in her ha^dkercher. And when she ca^e ho^e / she put the sa^e i^to a pot close
couerd and spitted i^ an other pot: and after a few days she / loking in the
one pot / found a little young pretty babe / about a shaftmond long / and the
other pot was full of gored blood. Here is goodly pulpit matters to prove new
articles of our faith. For if the Priests / that told the stories of the 2.
horses / or the maid that said that the bread was turned into a little child /
or the monk / that preached these shameful blasphemys / or the devil himself
/ who is father of lies / could lie / speaking in the horse or in any of them:
then do all these foresaid miracles prove nothing his purpose, But O
merciful God / in what a miserable state were we thine afflicted members / if
it were true / which they say / being both enemies to thee and to us also for
thy truethes sake? For we should not only suffer extreme miseries / as loss of
our goods / good names / and the company of our dear friends in our native
country: but also burn as heretics in this world / if we came in their cruel
handlyng / and also burn eternally in the unquenchable fire of hell / if
their cruel curses might take effect. Wherefore we yield thee most hearty
thanks / O father of al mercies / and to thy son Jesus Christ our savior:
which haste promised for his sake and in his name thy kingdom of heaven to al
them / which suffer persecucion for thy righteousness sake. How shall we then
know true visio^s of Angels from false / true apparitio^s and miracles from
counterfayte / but by the scripture of god? which is the rule / and true
measure / where with we must try all things as S. John says: beeleue not
every spirit / but prove them / whether they be of God. For many false
Prophets are gone out into the world. Herby is the spirit of god known /
says he: every spirit / which confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the
flesh / is of god etc. Whosoever ever therefore says / that there is any thing /
that pacifieth the wrath of god or obtains his favor and forgeuenes of
sins / but only Christ's death and passion: he denies Christ to be come a
savior in the flesh. Wherefore these Angels / saints / souls of the dead / and
miracles / tha^ allow worshipping of saints by inuocacio^ and prayinge to
them / the sacrifice of the mass for the quick and the dead / worshipping of
images / pilgrimages / offeryngs to holy relics / to forgive sins or to
deliver the dead out of purgatory: deny Christ to be come an only savior
by his flesh. For their make all these to be saviors from purgatory / or at
the least / coadiutores to help him in that office of salvation and delivering
those souls from sin and the pains due for the same: and so they cannot be
of God but of Antichrist. Thus I have plainly / fully and truly without fraud
of cloking or color of rhetorike and dark speech / to blind the eyes of the
si^ple people / answered to al (that I remember) which the Papists do or can
allege / either by writing / preaching or reasoning / for the defense of their
vnwritte^ verites / whereupon they build so many detestable idolatries and
heresies: and the same answers / if they be aptly applied and placed by a
discret and witty reader / will suff^ce for the answer to all that ever they
have or can bring forth for the maintaining of their unwritten and uncertain
verites.

And yet I will not be so much wedded to mine own wit or will / but that if
they be able to answer so plainly and truly to the Scriptures / authors and
reasons rehearsed by me / as I have done to theirs / and to prove their doctrine
of unwritten very^es by as plain co^se^t both of scriptures / aunciente
doctors / and as pithy arguments / as I have done mine / and set it forth
in prynte to the judgment of the whole world / as mine i^: I shall not only
acknowledge mine ignorance and error / but I shall gladlye return into
England / reca^t mine heresies / openly submyttynge myself to such
discipline and correction / as they shall think mete fo: mine offenses. But if
they refuse to answer my book by writing / and v^ing their old trade burn
both my book and the readers thereof: let them know they shall do nothing but
cut of the head of hibra. For for every heretic (as you call them) which you
shall burn / will arise many faithful and co^sta^t Christians. For except the
grayn or corn of wheat dye / it remains alone: but if it dye / it brings
forth much fruit. Wherefore I most heartily beseech the father of heaven of his
infinite mercy (if you be not indurat in your hearts with that sin / which
is irremissible and shall never be forgeuen in this world nor in the world to
come / and resyste the holy ghost impugning the truth of god of you known /
and defending and maintaining wicked doctrines / which your consciences bear
record to be idolatries and heresies) that he will mollify your stony hearts
/ and give you fleshy hearts: yea rather spiritual and godly hearts to
worship him truly in spirit / according to his godly will / expressed in his
holy word written. And I exhort al you / which fear god and be desierous to
save your own souls / to flee from this whore of Babylon and from al her
detestable idolatries and heresies / not builded upon the sure rock of gods
infallible word written but upon the qualin^re of vnwritte^ verites: Which is
Rome.
whereupon whatsoever is builded furthwith either sinketh or quite overthrows.
And stand thou fast and stay thy faith / whereupon thou shall build al thy
works / upon the strong rock of gods word / written and contained within the
old testament and the new: which is able sufficiently to instruct thee in all
things nedeful to thy salvation / and to the attai^me^t of the kingdom of
heaven. To the which I beseech the almighty father of heaven of his infinite
mercy and goodness / and by the merytes of his only son / our savior and
redemer Jesus Christ / through his holy sprite in us / bring us all.

Amen.
