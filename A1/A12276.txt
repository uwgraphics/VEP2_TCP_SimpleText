Poet Laureate.

PLa ce bo
who is there who
Di le xi.
Dame Margery.
Fa re my my
Wherefore and why why
For ye soul of Philip sparowe
That was late slain at carowe
Among the Nones blake
For that sweet souls sake
And for all sparowes souls
Set in our bid rolls
Pater noster qui
With an Aue mari
And with the corner of a Creed
The more shall be your mede.
When I remember again
How mi philyp was slain
Never half the pain
was between you twain
Pyramus and Thesbe
As than befell to me
I wept and I wayled
The tearys down hayled
But nothing it auayled
To call Phylyp again
Whom Gyb our cat has slain
Gyb I say our cat
Worrowyd her on that
Which I loved best
It can not be expressed
My sorrowful heaviness
But all with out redress
For within that stounde
Half slumbrynge in a sound
I fell down to the ground
Unneth I kest mine eyes
Toward the cloudy skies
But when I did behold
My sparow dead and cold
No creatuer but that would
Have rewed upon me
To behold and se
What heaviness did me pange
where with my hands I wra^ge
That my senaws cracked
As though I had been racked
So payned and so strayned
That no life well nigh remained
I syghed and I sobbed
For that I was robbed
Of my sparowes life
O maiden / wydow / and wife
Of what estate ye be
Of hye or low degree
Great sorrow than ye might se
And learn to weep at me
Such pains did me frete
That mine heart did beat
My vysage pale and dead
Wanne / and blewe as lead
The panges of hateful death
Well nigh had stopped my breath
Heu heu me
That I am woe for the
Ad dn^m cum tribularer clamaui
Of god nothing else crave I
BUt phyllypes soui^e to keep
From the marees deep
Of Acherontes well
That is a flode of hell
And from the great Pluto
The prince of endless woe
And from foul Alecto
With vysage black and blo
And from Medusa that mare
That like a fend does stare
And from Megeras edders
For rufflynge of phillips feathers
And from her fyry sparklynges
For burning of his wings
And from the smokes sour
Of Proserpinas bower
And from the dens dark
Where Cerberus does bark
whom Theseus did afraye
Whom Hecules did outraye
As famous poets say
For that hell bound
That lies in rheynes bound
with ghastly hedes three
To Iupyter pray we
That Phyllyp preserved may be
A men say ye with me
Do mi nus.
Helpeno we sweet Jesus
Leuaui oculos meos in montes
would god I had zenophontes.
OR Socrates the wise
To show me their deuyse
Moderatly to take
This sorrow that I make
For Phyllip sparowes sake
So fervently I shake
I feel my body quake
So vrgently I am brought
In to careful thought
Like Andromach Hectors wife
was weary of her life
when she had lost her joy
Noble Hector of Troy
In like manner also
Increases my dedly woe
For my sparowe is go
It was so pretty a fool
It would set on a stole
And learned after my scole
For to keep his cut
with Phyllyp keep your cut
It had a velvet cap
And would sit upon my lap
And seek after small worms
And sometime white bred cro^mes
And many times and often
Between my breasts soft
It would lie and rest
It was propre and pressed
Sometime he would gasp
when he saw a waspe
A fly / or a gnat
He would fly at that
And prytely he would pant
when he saw an ant
Lord how he would pry
After the butterfly
Lord how he would hop
After the gressop
And when I said / phyp / phyp
Than he would lepe and skyp
And take me by the lyp
Alas it will me slo
That Phillyp is gone me fro
Si in i qui ta tes
Alas I was evil at ease
De pro fun dis cla ma ui
when I saw my sparowe dye
Now after my dome
Dame Sulspicia at Rome
whose name regystred was
For ever in tables of bras
Because that she did pas
In poesy to endyte
And eloquenly to write
Though she would pretend
My sparowe to commend
I trow she could not amend
Reportynge the virtues all
Of my sparowe royal
For it would come and go
And fly so to and fro
And on me it would lepe
when I was a sleep
And his fether shake
Where with he would make
Me often for to wake
And for to take him in
Upon my naked skyn
God wot we thought no syn
what thought he crept so low
It was no hurt I trow
He did nothing perde
But sit upon my kne
Phyllyp though he were uyse
In him it was no vyse
Phyllyp had leave to go
To pyke my little too
Phillip might be bold
And do what he would
Phillip would seek and take
All the flies blake
That he could there espy
With his wanton eye
O pe ra
La soll fa fa
Co^fitebor tibi dn^e i^ toto cordemeo
Alas I would ride and go
A Thousand mile of ground
If any such might be found
It were worth an hundredth pound
Of King Cresus gold
Or of Artalus the old
The rich prince of Pargame
Who so list the story to se
Cadmus that his sister sought
And he should be bought
For gold and fee
He should over the sea
To wete / if he could bring
Any of the ofsprynge
Or any of the blood
But who so understood
Of Medeas art
I would I had a part
Of her crafty magyke
My sparowe tha^ should be quycke
With a charm or twain
And play with me again
But all this is in vain
Thus for to complain
I took my sampler ones
Of purpose for the nones
To sow with stytches of sylke
My sparow white as milk
That by representacy on
Of his Image and facyon
To me it might importe
Some pleasure and comfort
For my solas and sport
But wha^ i was sowing his beke
Me thought my sparow did spek
And opened his pretty byll
Saying / maid ye are in will
Again me for to kill
Ye prycke me in the head
With that my nedle waxed red
Me thought of Phyllyps blood
Mine hear right vpstode
And was in such a fray
My speech was taken away
I kest down that there was
And said / Alas alas
How comes this to pas
My fyngers dead and cold
Could not my sampler hold
My nedle and threde
I threw away for dread
The best now that I may
Is for his soul to pray
A porta inferi
Good lord have mercy
Upon my sparowes soul
written in my bid roll
Au di ui vo cem
Iaphet came and Sem
Ma gni fi cat
Show me the right path
TO the hills of armony
wherefore ye berdes yet cry
Of your fathers ^ote
That was sometime a flote
And no wethey lie and rote
Let some ports write
Deucalyous stood it high
But as verily / as ye be
The natural sons three
Of North patryarke
That ^^^de that great arc
wherein he had apes and owls
Beestes / birds / and fowls
That if ye can find
Any of my sparowes kind
God send the soul good rest
I would have yet a nest
Is pretty and as peest
As my sparowe was
But my Sparowe did pas
An sparowes of the wode
That were syns Noes flode
was ne^^ none so good
King Phylyp of Macedony
Had no such Phylyp as I
No no sir hardely
That vengeance I ask and cry
By way of exclamacyon
On all the hole nacyon
Of cattes wild and tame
God send them sorrow and shame
That cat specially
That slew so cruelly
My little pretty sparowe
That I brought up at Carowe
O cat of carly she kind
The find was in thy mind
when thou my bird vntwynde
I would thou had ben blind
The leopardes savage
The lions in their rage
Might catch ye in their paws
And gnawe the in their jaws
These serpens of Lybany
Might stynge the venymously
The dragones with their tongues
Might poysonthy liver and longes
The mantycors of ye montaynes
Might feed them on thy brains
Melanchates that hounde
That plucked Acteon to ye ground
Gave him his mortal wound
Changed to a dear
The story does appear
Was changed to an heart
So thou foul cat / that thou art
The self same hounde
Might the confound
That his own Lord bote
Might byte asoudre thy throat
Of Jude the gredy grypes
Might tere out all thy trypes
Of Arcady the bears
Might pluck away thine ears
The wild wolf Lyraon
Byte a sondrethy back bone
Of Ethua the brennynge hill
That day and night brenneth still
Set in thy tail a blase
That all the world may gase
And wonder upon the
From Occyan the greatse
Unto the Isles of Orchady
From Till bery fery
To the plain of Salysbery
So traitorously my bird to kill
That never ought the cuyll will
was never bird in cage
More gentle of courage
In doing his homage
Unto his sovereign
Alas I say again
Death has departed us twain
The false cat has the slain
Fare well Phyllyp adieu
Our Lord thy soul reskew
Fare well without restore
Fare well for ever more
And it where a Jew
It would make one rue
To se my sorrow new
These vylanous false rattes
were made for myse and rattes
And not for birds small
Alas my face waxes pale
Telling this pyteyus tale
How my bird so fair
That was wont to repair
And go in at my spayre
And crepe in at my gore
Of my gown before
Flyckerynge with his wings
Alas my heart it stynges
Remembrynge pretty things
Alas mine heart it sleth
My Phyllyppes doleful death
when I remember it
How pretely it would sit
Many times and often
Upon my finger aloft
I played with him tyttell tattyll
And fed him with my spattyl
with his byll between my lips
It was my pretty Phyppes
Many a pretty kusse
Had I of this sweet musse
And now the cause is thus
That he is slain me fro
To my great pain and woe
Of fortune / this the chance
Stands on varyaunce
Often time after pleasaunce
Trouble and greuaunce
No man can be sure
All way to have pleasure
As well perceive ye may
How my dysport and play
From me was taken a way
By Gyb our cat savage
That in a furyous rage
Caught Phyllyp by the head
And slew him there stark dead
Kyryeleyson Xp^e leyson
Kyrye leson.
FOr Phypp sparowes soul
Set in our bid roll
Let us now whysper
A Pater noster
Lauda anima mea dominum
To weep with me look ye ye come
All manner of birds in your kind
Se none be left behind
To morning look that ye fall
with dolorous songs funeral
Some to sing / and sow to say
Some to weep and some to pray
Every bird in his lay
The goldfynche / the wagtayle
Tthe jangling Iay to rail
The fleckyd pie to chatter
Of this dolorous matter
And Robyn Redbrest
He shall be the priest
The Requiem mass to sing
Softly warbelynge
with help of the red sparow
And the chattrynge swallow
This hearse for to halow
The lark with his long to
The spynke and ye martynet also
The shouelar with his broad bek
The doterell that folyshe pek
And also the mad coote
with a balde face to toote
The field fare and the snyte
The crow and the kyte
The rauyn called rolfe
His plain song to solfe
The partryche / the quayle
The plouer with us to wayle
The woodhacke yt syngeth chur
Horsly as he had the mur
The lusty chau^tyng nyghtyngale
The Popyngay to tell her tale
That toteth often in a glass
Shall read the Gospel at mass
The mauys with her whystell
Shall read there the Pystell
But with a large and a long
To keep just plain song
Our chau^ters shall be ye Cuckoue
The Culuer / the Stockedowue
with puwyt the Lap wyng
The versycles shall sing
The Better with his bumpe
The Crane with his trumpe
The swan of Menander
The Gose and the Gander
The Ducke and Drake
Shall watch at this wake
The Pecocke so proud
Because his voice is iowde
Tnd has a glorious tail
He shall sing the Grayle
The owl that is so foul
Must help us to houle
The heron so gaunce
And the cormoraunce
with the Fesaunte
And the gaglynge gaunte
And the churlysshe chowgh
The route and the kowgh
The barnacle / the bussarde
with the wind mallarde
Tthe dyuendap to sleep
The wather hen to weep
The pussyn / and the tele
Money they shall dele
To poor folk at large
That shall be their charge
The semewe, and the tytmose
The wodcocke with the long nose
The threstyl with her warblyng
The starlyng with her brablyng
The roke / with the ospraye
That puts fysshes to a fraye
And the denty curlewe
with the turtyll most true
At this placebo
we may not well for go
The countrynge of the coe
The storke also
That makes his nest
In chymneyes to rest
with in those walls
No broken galls
May there abide
Of cokoldry side
Or else phylosphy
Makes a great lie
The Estryge that will eat
An horshowe so great
In the stead of meat
Such fervent heat
His stomach so great
He can not well fly
Nor sing tunably
Yet at abrayde
He has well assayde
To solfe above Ela
Ea lorell fa fa
Ne quando
Male cantando
The best that we can
To make him our Belman
And let him ryng the bellys
He can do nothing else
Chaunteclere our coke
Must tell what is of the clock
By the astrology
That he has naturally
Conceived and cought
And was never tought
By Albumazer
The Astronomer
Nor by Ptholomy
Prince of Astronomy
Nor yet by Haly
And yet he croweth daily
And nyghly the tides
That no man abydes
with partlot his hen
whom now and then
He plucketh by the head
when he does her trede
The bird of Araby
That potencyally
May never dye
And yet there is none
But one alone
A Phenex it is
This hearse that must blys
with armatycke gummes
That cost great sumes
The way of Thurifycation
To make a fumigation
Sweet of reflary
And redolent of air
This corse for to sense
with great reverence
As Patryarke or Pope
In a black cope
whiles he senseth
He shall sing the verse
Libe / ra me
In de la soll re
Softly bemole
For my sparowes soul
Plinni shows all
In his story natural
what he does find
Of this Phenyx kind
Of whose incyneracyon
There ryseth a new creacyon
Of the same facyon
without alteracyon
Saving that old age
Is turned into courage
Of fresshe youth again
This matter true and plain
Plain matter in deed
who so list to read
But for the Egle does fly
Highest in the sky
He shall be thye se deane
The quere to demean
As provost pryncypall
To teach them their ordynall
Also the noble fawcon
with the grefawcon
The tarsell gentle
They shall morn soft and still
In their amysse of gray
The sacre with them shall say
Dirige for Phyllyppes soul
The goshauke shall have a role
The queresters to control
The lanners / and the marlyons
Shall stad in their morni^g gou^es
The hobby and the muskette
The sensers and ye cross shall fet
The kestrell in all this warke
Shall be holy wather clarke
And now the dark cloudy night
Chaseth a way Phoebus bright
Taking his course to ward ye west
god se^de my sparoes sole good rest
Requem eternal dona eis dn^e.
Fa fa fa my re
A por ta in fe re

Credo vydere bona domini.
I pray god phillip to heaven may fly
Domine exaudi oracione^ mea^
To heaven he shall from heaven he came
Do mi nus vo vis cum
Of al good prayers god se^d him Oremus.
Deus cui propriu^ est miserere and percere sum
On Phillips soul have pity.
For she was a pretty cock
And came of a gentle stock
And wrapped in a maidenes smock
And cherysshed full dayntely
Thyll cruel fate made him to die
Alas for doleful destey
But where to should I
Longer morn or cry
To Iupyter I call
Of heaven emperyall
That Phyllyp may fly
A boue the starry sky
To tread the pretty wren
That is our Ladies hen
Amen / amen / amen.
yet one thing is behind
That now comes to mind
An Epytaphe I would have
For phyllyppes grave
But for / I am a maid
Tymerous / half afraid
That never yet a said
Of Elyconys well
where the muses dwell
Though I can read and spell
Recounte / report / and tell
Of the tales of Caunterbury
Some sad stories / some merry
As Palamon / and Arcet
Duke Theseus / and partelet
And of the wife of Bath
They works much seath
when her tale is told
Among huswyes bold
How she controlde
Her husbands as she would
And them to despise
In the homylyest wise
Bring other wives in thought
Their husbands to set at naught
And though that read have I
Of Gawen and sir Guy
And tell can a great piece
Of the golden flece
How Jason it wan
Like a valiant man
Of Arturs round table
with his knights commendable
And dame Gaynour his queen
was somewhat wanton I wene
How sir Launcelote de lake
Many a spear brake
For his ladies sake
Of Trystram and king Mark
And all the hole warke
Of bele I sold his wife
For whom was much strife
Some say she was light
And made her husband knight
Of the comyne hall
That cockoldes men call
And of sir Lybius
Named Dysconius
Of quater fylz Emund
And how they were sommonde
To Rome to Charlemayne
Upon a great pain
And how they rode each one
On Bayarde Mountalbon
Men se him now and than
In the forest of Arden
what thought I can frame
The stories by name
Of Judas Machabeus
And of Caesar Iulious
And of the love between
Paris and vyene
And of the duke Hannyball
What made the Romans all
For dread and to quake
How Scipion did wake
The city of Cartage
which by his merciful rage
He beat down to the ground
And though I can expound
Of Hector of Troy
That was all their joy
whom Achylles slew
wherefore all Troy did rue
And of the love so hot
That made Troylus to dote
Upon fair Cressyde
And what they wrote and said
And of their wanton wylles
Pandaer bare the bylles
From one to the other
His masters love to further
Sometime a presyous thing
An ouche or else a ryng
From her to him again
Sometime a pretty chayn
Or a bracelet of her here
Prayed Troylus for to were
That token for her sake
How heartily he did it take
And much thereof did make
And all that was in vain
For she did but feign
The story tells plain
He could not obtain
Though his father were a king
yet there was a thing
That made tha male to wring
She made him to sing
The song of lovers lay
Musyng night and day
Mournyng all alone
Comfort had he none
For she was quyte gone
Thus in conclusyon
She brought him in abusyon
In ernest and in game
She was much to blame
Disparaged is her fame
And blemysshed is her name
In manner half with shame
Troylus also has lost
On her much love and cost
And now must kys the post
Pandara that went between
Has won nothing I wene
But light for somer grene
Yet for a special laud
He is named Troylus baud
Of that name he is sure
Whiles the world shall dure
Though I remember the fable
Of Penelope most stable
To her husband most true
Yet long time she ne knew
Whether he were on live or ded
Her wit stood her in sted
That she was true and just
For any bodily lust
To Ulixes her make
And never would him forsake
Of Marcus Marcellus
A process I could tell us
And of Anteocus
And of Josephus
De antiquitatibus
And of Mardocheus
And of great Assuerus
And of Uesca his queen
whom he forsook with teene
And of Hester his other wife
With whom he ledd a plesau^t life
Of king Alexander
And of king Euander
And of Porcena the great
That made ye romans to smart
Though I have enrold
A thousand new and old
Of these historious tales
To fill bougets and males
with books that I have red
Yet I am nothing sped
And can but little skyll
Of Ouyd or Uirgyll
Or of Plutharke
Or frauncys Petrarke
Alcheus or Sapho
Or such other Poets mo
As Linus and Hometus
Enphorion and Theocritus
Auacreon and Arion
Sophocles and Philemon
Pyndarus and Dymonides
Philistion and Ph^rocides
These Poets of auncyente
They are to diffuse for me
For as I to fore have said
I am but a young maid
And can not in effect
My style as yet direct
with englysh words clear
Our natural tongue is rude
And hard to be enneude
with pullysshed terms lusty
Our language is so rusty
So cankered and so full
Of frowardes and so dull
That if I would apply
To write ornatly
I wot not where to find
Terms to serve my mind
Gowers englysh is old
And of no value told
His matter is worth gold
And worthy to be enrold
In Chauser I am sped
His tales I have red
His matter is delectable
Solacious and commendable
His englysh well allowed
So as it is enprowed
For as it is enployd
There is no englysh void
At those days much commended
And now men would have amended
His englysh where at they bark
And mar all they warke
Chaucer that famus clerk
His terms were not dark
But plesaunt / easy / and plain
Ne word he wrote in vain
Also John^ Lydgate
writes after an hyer rate
It is dyffuse to find
The sentence of his mind
Yet writes he in his kind
No man that can amend
Those matters that he has pende
Yet some men find a fault
And say he writes to haute
wherefore hold me excused
If I have not well perused
Mine englyssh half abused
Though it be refused
In worth I shall it take
And fewer words make
But for my sparowes sake
Yet as a woman may
My wit I shall assay
In Epytaphe to wryght
In latyne plain and light
where of the Elegy
Follows by and by
Flos volucrum formose vale
Philippe. sub isto
Marmore iam recubas
Qui mihi carus eras
Semper erunt nitido
Radiantia sydera celo
Impressusque meo
Pectore semper eris
Per me Laurigerum
Britanum Skeltonida vaten
Hec cecinisse licet
Ficta sub imagine texta
Cuius eris volucris
Prestanti corpore virgo
Candida Nais erat
Formosior ista Ioanna est
Docta corinna fuit
Sed magis ista sapit
Bien men souient,
The commendacions
BEati in ma cu lu ti in via
O glo rio sa femi na
Now mine hole imaginacion
And studyous medytacion
Is to take this commendacyon
In this consyderacion
And under pacyent tolleracyon
Of that most goodly maid
That placebo has said
And for her sparow prayed
In lamentable wise
Now will I enterprise
Through the grace dyuyne
Of the muses nine
Her beautye to commend
If Arethusa will send
Me enfluence to endyte
And with my pen to write
If Apollo will promise
Melodyously it to deuyse
His tunable harp stryngges
with armony that synges
Of Princes and of kings
And of all pleasant things
Of lust and of delyght
Through 'his godly might
To whom be the laud asceybed
That my pen has enbybed
with the aureat drops
As verily my hope is
Of Thagus that golden flod
That passes all erthly good
And as that flode does pas
All floodes that ever was
with his golden sands
who so that understands
Cosmography: and the stremys
And ye floodes in strange remes
Right so she does excede
All other of whom we read
whose fame by me shall sprede
In to Perce and Mede
From brytons Albion
Both tower of Babylon
I trust it is no shame
And no man will me blame
Though I regester her name
In the court of fame
For this most goodly flower
This blossom of fresshe color
So Jupiter me socour
Se floryssheth new and new
In bewte and vertew
Hac claritate gemina
O gloriosa femina
Retribue seruo tuo viuifica me
La vi a mea laudabunt te
BUt enforsed am I
Openly to askry
And to make a out cri
Against odyous enui
that ever more will ly
And say cursedly
with his ledderey
And chekes dry
with vysage wan
As wart as tan
His bones crake
Lean as a rake
His gummes rusty
Are tull unlusty
His heart with all
Bitter as gall
His liver / his long
with anger is wrong
His serpents tongue
That many one has stonge
He frowneth ever
He laugheth never
Even nor morrow
But other men's sorrow
Causes him to gryn
And rejoice therein
No s^^pe can him catch
But ever does watch
He is so beat
with malyte and frete
with anger and ire
His foul desire
will suffer no sleep
In his head to crepe
His feule semblaunt
Ill displseaunt
when other ar glad
Than is he sad
Frantyke and mad
His tongue never still
For to say yll'
wrythyng and wringyng
Bytyng and styngyng
And thus this elf
Consumes him self
Him self does slo
with pain and woe
This false envy
Says that I
Use greeatfolly
For to endyte
And for to write
And spend my time
In prose and ryme
For to expres
The noblenes
Of my maistres
That causes me
Studious to be
Bo make a relation
Of her commendation
And there again
Envy does complain
And has disdain
But yet certain
I will me plain
And my style dres
To this prosses
Now Phoebus me ken
To sharp my pen
And led my fyst
As him best list
That I may say
Honor always
Of woman kind
Troth does me bynd
And loyalte
Ever to be
Their true bedell
To write and tell
How women excel
In noblenes
As my maistres
Of whom I thynk
with pen and ynk
For to compyle
Sow godly style
For this most gooly flower
This blossom of fresh color
So Iupyter me socoure
She flourissheth new and new
In beauty and vertew
Hac claritate gemina
O gloriosa femina
Legem pone michi domine in
viam iustificacionum tuarum
Que^admodum desiderat ceruns
ad fontes aquarum.
HOw shall I report
All the goodly sort
Of her fetures clear
That has non erthly pere
Her favor of her face
Ennewed all with grace
Confort / pleasure and solace
Mine heart does so enbrace
And so has rauyshed me
Her to behold and se
That in words plain
I can not me refrain
To look on her again
Alas what should I feign
It were a plesaunt pain
with her aye to remain
Her eyes gray and stepe
Causes mine heart to lepe
with her brows bent
She may well represent
Fair Lucres as I wene
Or else fair Polexene
Or else Caliope
Or else Penolope
For this most goodly flower
This blossom of fresshe color
So Jupiter me socoure
She florisheth new and new
In beautye and vertew
Hac claritate gemina
O gloriosa femina
Memor esto verbi tui seruo tuo
Seruus tuus sum ego
THe Indy Saphyre blew
Her veins does ennew
The Orient perle so clear
The whytnesse of her lere
The lusty ruby ruddes
Resemble the Rose buddes
Her lyppes soft and merry
Emblomed like the chery
It were an heavenly bliss
Her sugared mouth to kiss
Her beautye to augment
Dame nature has her lent
A warte upon her cheke
who so list to seek
In her vysage a skar
That semyth from a far
Like to the radyant star
All with favor fret
So properly it is set
She is the vyolet
The daysy delectable
The calumbyn commendable
The ielofet amyable
This most goodly flower
This blossom of fressh color
So Jupiter me succor
She florysheth new and new
In beauty and vertew
Hac claritate gemina
O gloriosa femina
Bonitate^ fecisti cu^ seruo tuo d^ia
Et ex precordus sona^t precoma.
ANd when I perceived
Her wart and conceived
It can not be denayd
But it was well conuayd
And set so womanly
And nothing wantonly
But tyght conuenyently
And full congruently
As nature cold deuyse
In most goodly wise
who so list behold
It makethe lovers bold
To her to sewe for grace
Her favor to purchase
The sker upon her chyn
Enhached on her fair skyn
whyter than the swan
It would make any man
To forget deadly syn
Her fauonr to win
For this most godly flower
This blossom of fressh color
So Jupiter me socoure
She flouryssheth new and new
In beauty and vertew
Hac claritate gemina
O gloriosa femina
Defecit in salutare tuu^ ai^a mea
Quid petis filio / matter dulcissia ba ba
SOft and make no din
For now I will begin
To heue in remembraunee
Her goodly dalyaunce
And her goodly pastaunce
So sad and so demure
Behauynge her so sure
with words of pleasure
She would make to the lure
And any man convert
To give her his hole heart
She made me sore a mased
Upon her when I gased
Me thought min heart was crased
My eyne were so dased
For this most goodly flour
This blossom of fressh color
So Iupyter me socour
She flouryssheth new and new
In beauty and vertew
Hac claritate gemina
O gloriosa femina
Quomodo dilexi lege^ tua^ dn^a.
Recedant vetera noua sint oi^a.
ANd to amend her tale
when she list to auale
And with her fyngers small
And hands soft as sylke
whyter than the milk
That are so quyckely vayned
where with my hand she strain
Lord how I was pains
Unneth I me refrayned
How she me had reclaymed
And me to her retained
Enbrasynge there with all
Her godly myddell small
with sides long and streyte
To tell you what conceyte
I had than in a tryce
The matter were to nyse
And yet there was no vice
Nor yet no vyllany
But only fantasy
For this most godly flower
The blossom of fressh color
So Jupiter me succoure
She floryssheth new and new
In beauty and vertew
Hac claritate gemina
O gloriosa femina
Iniquos odio habui
Non calumnientur me superbi.
BUt where to should I note
How often did I tote
Upon her pretty foot
It raised mine heart rote
To se her tread the ground
with heles short and round
She is plainly express
Egeria the goddess
And like to her image
Emportured with courage
A lovers pylgrimage
There is no be savage
Ne no tiger so wood
But she would change his mood
Such relucentgrace
Is formed in her face
For this most goodly flower
This blossom of fressh color
So Jupiter me succor
She flouryssheth new and new
In beauty and vertew
Hac claritate gemina
O gloriosa femina
Mirabilia testimoi^a tua
Sicutnauelle pla^tato^es i^ iuue^tute sua
SO goodly as she dresses
So propeeyly she presses
The bright golden tresses
Of her here so fine
Like Phoebus beams shine
where to should I disclose
The garterynge of her hose
It is for to suppose
How that she can were
Gorgiously her gere
Her fresshe habylementes
with other implementes
To serve for all ententes
Like dame Flora queen
Of lusty somer grene
For this wost goodly flower
This blossom of fressh color
So Jupiter me soconre
She florisheth new and new
In beautye and vertew
Hac claritate gemina
O gloriosa femina
Clamaui i^ toto code exaudi me
Mr^ia tua magna est super me
Her kyrtell so goodly lased
And under that is brased
Such plasures that I may
Neither write nor say
Yet though I write not with ynke
No man can let me think
For thought has lyberte
Thought is frank and fre
To think a merry thought
It cost me little nor naught
Would god mine homely style
Were publysshed with the fyle
Of Ciceros eloquence
To prase her exeellence
For this most goodly flower
Thus blossom of fressh color
So Jupiter me succoure
She flouryssheth new and new
In beauty and vertew
Hac claritate gemina
O gloriosa femina
Principes persecuti su^t me gratis
Oi^bus co^sideratis. Daradisus vo
Iuptatis. Hec virgo est dulcissima
My pen it is unable
My head it is unstable
My reason rude and dull
To praise her at the full
Goodly maystres Jane
Sobre / demure Dyane
Jane this maystres hight
The lode stare of delyght
Dame Uenus of all pleasure
The well of worldly treasure
She does excede and pas
In prudence dome Pallas
This most goodly flower
This blossom of fresshe color
So Jupiter me socoure
She floryssheth new and new
In beauty and vertew
Hac claritate gemina.
O gloriosa femina.
BEquie^ e^erua^ dona eis dn^e
with this psalm / Dn^e pro basti me.
Shall sail over the sea
with tibi domine commendamus
On pylgrimage to faint Iamys
For shrympes / and for pranys
And for stalk cranys
And where my pen has offendyd
I pray you it may be amendyd
By discrete consyderacyon
Of your wise reformacyon
I have not offended I trust
If it be sadly dyscust
It were no gentle gyse
This treatise to despise
Because I have written and said
Honor of this fair maid
wherefore should I be blamed
That I Jane have named
And famously proclaimed
She is worthy to be enrolde
with letters of gold
Car elle vault

Thus ends ye book of Philip sparow / and her follows an addicyon made by
master Skeleton
THe gyse now a days
Of some jangling iayes
Is to discommende
That they cannot amend
Though they would spend
All the wits they have
What ayle them to deprave
Phillip sparowes grave
His dirige: her commendacyon
Can be no derogacyon
But mirth and consolacyon
Made by protestacyon
No man to myscontent
with Phillyppes enterement
Alas that goodly maid
why should she be afraid
why should she take shame
That her goodly name
Honorably reported
Should be set and sorted
To be matriculate
with ladies of estate
I conjure the Phillip sparow
By Hercules that hell did harow
And with a venomous arow
Slew of the Epidanres
One of the Centaures
Or onocentaures
Or hipocentaurius
By whose might and main
An heart was stayne
with horns twain
Of glytteryng gold
And the appels of gold
Of Hesperides withhold
And with a dragon kept
That never more slept
By marryall strength
He wan at lenght
And slew Gerion
with three bodies in one
with mighty courage
Anaunted the rage
Of a lion savage
Of Dyomedes stable
He brought out a rabble
Of coursers and rounses
with leapes and bounses
And with mighty iuggyng
wrestlyng and tuggyng
He plucked the bull
By the horned skull
And offered to Cornucopia
And so forth per cetera
Also by Erates bower
In Plutus ghastly tower
By the ugly Eumenides
That never have rest nor ease
By the venomous serpent
That in hell is never brent
In Lerna the Greeks fen
That was engendered then
By Chemeras flames
And all the dedly names
Of infernal posty
where souls frye and rousty
By the stygyall flood
And the streams wood
Of Cocitus botumles well
By the feryman of hell
Caron with his beerd hoar
That roweth with a rude^or
And with his fore top
Gydeth his bote with a prope
I conjure Phylyp and call
In the name of king Saul
Primo regum express
He had the Phitonesse
To wytch craft her to dress
And by her abusyons
And dampnable illusyons
Of marueylus conclusyons
And by her supersticyons
And wonderful condityons
Se raised up in that stead
Samuel that was deed
But whether it were so
He were / idem in numero
The self same Samuel
How be it to Saull did he tell
The Philistinis should him ascry
And the next day he should dye
I will my self dyscharge
To lettred men at large
But Phylyp I conjure the
Now by these names three
Diana in the woods grene
Luna that so bright does shine
Procerpina in hell
That thou shortly tell
And show now unto me
what the cause may be
Of this perplexite
Infera Philippe Scroupe pulchr^ Iohanns
Instanter petut / cur nostri carminis illam
Nunc pudet / est sero / minor est infamia vero
Than such as have disdayned
And of this work complained
I pray god they be payned
No worse than is contained
In verses two or three
That follow as you may se
Luride cur liuor volutris pia funera da^n^^
Talia te rapiant / rapiunt que fata volucre^^
est tamen inuidia mors tibi contenua.
