To the Christian Reader.
IT was not my meaning (Gentle reader) when I first published this little
treatise, so soon again to have imprinted it: but after some more distance of
time, and with more mature deliberatio^ to have performed my promise of
perfecting the same: yet when I saw the first impression so suddenly dispersed,
and a greater number required: I was content once again to let it pass the
press, without that extreme and last hand which my desire was to have put into
it. But because I durst not so far abuse thy patience, as in nothing to
increase the former edition: it may please thee to understand, that I have
taken care in good part, to better and to amend the same, for thy benefit. For
besides the correction, enlargement, and addition of many necessary and
profitable things, I have now also set down in a manner the whole History of
the Gospel, from point to point, as I could collect the same out of the
Evangelists. Observing also after the judgment of the best Chronographers of
our age, the year and time wherein every thing was done. Further I have
distinguished the whole book into six periodes of years, as I thought would
fitliest serve for help of thy memory, and to avoid confusion and
tediousness in so great variety. Moreover, I have added unto this edition an
Index of the names of all the Patriarchs, Judges, Kings, Prophets, Priests,
Emperors, Governors, Countries, Cities, Persons, Books etc. which though
perhaps it may seem to some in so small a volume altogether superfluous: yet I
persuade my self thou shall find it in use both pleasant and profitable unto
thee. For the things which already I have admonished thee of in my former
preface, I think not necessary now again to trouble thee with the^. Only
thou may understand, that the principal causes of that difference which is
between mine Author and Functius with others, in accounting the years of the
world, by his adding to their number almost 180. years; are these three, First
that Codomanus takes nothing from the years expreslie mentioned in the story
of Judges: Secondly that according to S. Stephen Acts 7. he sets the death
of Tharah before that peregrination of Abraham, which he being 75. years old,
undertook at the commandment of God Ge^. 12. And thirdly that he begins
the years of the Grecians reign, mentioned in the books of the Machabees,
immediately after the death of Alexander the great. Wherein because his meaning
was not to preiudicate the opinion of others, but simply to express his own
judgment; it ought not to be to any an occasion of offense. If it shall mislike
thee that I have taken so many things out of the Apocrypha and other writers,
besides the books of the Canonical scriptures: it may please thee to
understand, that finding it done by mine Author, only to continue the
History, and for other co^pleme^t, I could not conveniently neglect the same.
Holding firmly nevertheless, that known and necessary difference in
authority, which is between the sacred monuments of the spirit of God, and the
frail and doubtful writings of men. If any further thing have escaped the
diligence of the Printer, in so many numbers of so great difference, I pray
thee gentle Reader friendly to correct what thou find to be amiss. And so
I bid thee most heartily farewell in the Lord. This eigth of June. Anno. Dom.

A DESCRIPTION OF TIME, FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD, UNTO THE YEAR OF our
Lord 137. containing 4279. years. Wherein the several Histories of holy
Scripture are briefly comprised, and placed in their just order.
The whole may be divided into seven periods.

The first period from Adam his Creation unto the birth of Noah has 1056.
years.
Heaven and earth. THe first day of the world God created Heaven and earth,
containing a co^fused mass, whereof afterward all things were made. This day
was our Sunday, or the Lords day: and as is thought, the 22. day of the month
of April. The Light. Then God created the light, separated it from the
darkness, and called it Day. Genesis 1. 1. 5.

The Firmament. The second day being our Monday, God made the firmament, and
called it by the name of Heavens. Genesis 1. 6. 8.

Land, Sea, herbs, etc. The third day which was our Tuesday, God separated the
waters from covering the earth, which at his commandment brought forth grass,
herbs, and trees, having their seed and fruit. Genesis 1. 9. 13.

Sun, Moon, Stars. The fourth day being our Wednesday, God made and placed
in the firmament of Heaven, the Sun Moon, and Stars. Genesis 1. 14. This day
being the five and twentieth of April, was that time of the Spring wherein the
days and nights are of one length. Then also the Moon was in the Prime. Other

Creation of Angels. The creation of the Angels is most probably assigned unto
the first day. Of these some hold the integrity of their creation, and are
called holy and elect Angels: The fall of Angels. some are fallen, and called
Devils, whose fall is most certain; but the time of their fall uncertain:
saving that they must needs fall before the fall of man.

The fall of Man. The fall of Adam and Eve being most certain, the day and
time is uncertain: and therefore it is curiosity to inquire, where the word
keeps silence, and boldness to pronounce. That they fell not the day of their
creation, beside the multitude

Man restored. The same day wherein they fell, they received the promise of
grace in the seed of the woman, which should break the Serpents head. Genesis 3.
15.

children, as should appear by the reason of Caiin his name. Genesis 41.

greatly multiplied in both sexes: And therefore the same is most fitly to be
assigned unto the year 129. or not much less. Genesis 4. 8.
