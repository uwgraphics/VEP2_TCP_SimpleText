In Musicen Tho. Whithorni Hexasticon ad Lectorem.
CAndide sum tibi, lector, praeludia musae,
hocque lube^s spectes, quod modo surgit opus.
Authoris mentem metire, and consule recte,
vt merita meritum laud fruatur opus.
Nec multu^ curat, probat, improbat aemula turba,
ipse bonis manult, quam placuisse malis.
Eiusdem carmen Phaleucium sieve Endecasyllabum.
QVi clar(...)am nitore musam
Fecit, (...)is videre lucem:
Rarum prodit opus Whithornus ille,
Et cunctis reserat suas camaenas
Plenas Pegasei liquore fontis.
Hic dat lautitias, iocos, lepores,
Hic dat delitias, sonosque dulces,
His iunxit numeros venustiores.
Hauritque eloquium, phrasinque nostram
Materno penitus sapore cultam:
Perpende has pretio, has ames, emasque:
Hae curas minuunt, leuant dolores,
Tollunt taedia, si qua sunt molesta,
Aspires igitur pio Whithorno,
Praeclaro ingenio faue, valeque.

three voices.
^ IF every one that goth about, to set abroad for common view, a work, has any
fear ^ or dout, that the faut finding carping crew, should utterly the same de
face, few ^ works set forth then should we have: but who by virtue does
purchase, their state aye lastes lie ^ they in grave, their state aye lastes
lie they in grave.

^ AS many heads have many wits, so diverse men of virtues have, and virtue
likes her ^ riches so, as other goods she does not crave: nor to be celebrate
of those, which be but of the common ^ sort, because that of her self she has
no need of praise or good re port, ^ because that of her self she has no need
of praise or good re port.

^ WHen fliering fortune favors, the false world then smi leth, but turn she
once a- ^ bout her wheel, strange changes shall thou feel. Wherefore as now I
counsel thee, use truth and ^ honesty: so shall thou stand and never quail,
though fortune do thee fail, though fortune do thee fail.

^ WHen Cupid had compelled me, to serve my fained friend, Pallas from that
persuaded me, ^ lest trouble I should find: for though thy love does seem,
quoth she, thy good will to re- ^ quite, yet in the end thou shall well see,
thy gwerdon shall thee spite, yet in the end thou ^ shall well see, thy gwerdon
shall thee spite.

^ SUch as in love would have long joy, their choice must be for ver tues sake,
if ^ otherwise they seek to knit, no deep root shall their true love take, no
deep root shall ^ their true love take.

^ THe restles race, the restles race the young man runs, is strange to know in
each de- ^ gre, now heaps he joys, and cares, and cares he shuns, a non his
mirth away does fle, ^ now heaps he joys, and cares, and cares he shuns, a non
his mirth away does fle.

^ THough friends be frail, though friends be frail in every place, in every
place, though friends be ^ frail, though friends be frail in every place, in

land, if therwithall, if therwithall he do not ^ link in band, wisdom,
knowledge, and other virtues rare, his judgment then of reason is but ^ bare,

^ THou shall soon see, thou shall soon see in each estate, where yt do take deep
root these fautes, where ^ that do take deep root these fautes, suspitiousnes
beyond ye race, that needful is, or like assauts, or like as- ^ sauts of hasty
mind, or gelous mood, great sorows ay to be their food. ij.

^ THe happy life as I do take, the quiet mind thereof is ground, ij. which
sour so- ^ rows does still forsake, ij. digesting them as they a bound: for
who from cares will pass ^ to ease, must take all troubles in good part, and
if the mind take no disease ij. all troubles ^ else will soon reuert, ij. will
soon reuert.

^ HE that contemns injuries, his state better appear shall soon, then his
who frets, then ^ his who frets, then his who frets maliciously, ij. till he
revenge offenses done: for ^ as malice torments his heart, and all his health
does straight vnwrest, and all his health does straight ^ vnwrest, the other not
forcing thereof, ij. returns soon to quiet rest, ^ returns soon to quiet

^ BEware how sorrows thee oppres, ij. let wisdom rule thy fan- ^ tasie, let

not pos ses, ^ with deadly dread thy faith to try, thy faith to try.

^ FOr to reclaim to friend a froward foe, or bring to pass affairs weighty
and great, if patience ^ chiefly does work it so, as virtue rare it may be

^ THe gifts of nature well disposde, are pleasant to the sight, the like of
fortune rule the roast, ^ be it in wrong or right: though both or none of these
be had, yet to ye gifts of mind, the wise have ^ the prerogative, in all ages

^ THough choler cleapt ye heart about, and set it all on fire, which causde the

^ IT is a world some sots to see, who measure honesty by wealth, accounting
all honest to be, ^ as they posses of worldly pelth: and Lazarus with God did
rest, when the rich gulch to hell was ^ pressed, to hell was pressed.

^ I Can not deem them happy sure, who can but only crake of mucke, I mean
riches ^ which worldlings lure, from heavenly cares them selu's to pluck: but
if virtue to wealth joined ^ be, twice happy then they be I see, they be I see.

^ ALL ye that serve ye blind God love, ij. all ye that serve the blind God ^
love, shall in ye end your labor loose, he is a fool and will not move, and
will not move, ^ but where he lights there to choose, and how should he give
due reward, ij. ^ who thereto never had regard. Perchance his shaftes may pearce

^ IT does me good when Zephrus rains, in Dians walk for to dis port, where

this time may ^ see, ij. so often as I this time may see.

^ PRefer not great beuatie before virtue, the much gazing thereon, the much
gazing thereon many ^ may rue, ij. the much gazing thereon, the much gazing

^ IT has been proved both even and morrow, it has been proved both ^ even and
morrow, yt a little mirth is worth much sorrow, that a little mirth is worth much

^ Many that have toyled and wrought in vain, and that each part of case did
little take, yet in ^ the end for to quench all their pain, they did the^ rest
and sport, and good cheer make, they did them rest ^ and sport, and good cheer

^ WHen fortune seemd so much my friend, to place me with assured stay, then

^ WHo so that list, who so that list his chance to try, on fortunes fickle

aloft on that her ^ stage, from high to low she will him set, and all his pomp
as swage, from high to low she ^ will him fet, and all his pomp as swage, and
all his pomp assuage.

^ THough fortune frown on me al way, turning my joy to pensiuenes, yet do I
still hope ^ for the day, that all my woe shall have redres: And no mishap shall
take the place, to bring me in this ^ woeful case. For all my hope is in my
God, whose look dame fortune dare not bide, his force ^ and hers is so far
odd, from where he is she will soon slide: And why should I pray for her ^
aid, since on her wheel she has few stayde?

^ POnder the proof so far as thou, in worldly works be proved shall, how vain
they ^ are in deed and show, how dangerous to deal withal: and nothing else you
shall then find, ^ this world (thus working in his kind) but wide scaffold for
us each one, to play our tragedies ^ up on, but wide scaffold for us each one, to
play our tragedies up on.

^ THe doutfull state that I posses, does trouble all my wits throughout, one
while good hap seems ^ it will not cease, then by and by it makes me dout: And
thus standing in hope and dread, I wish ^ often times that I were dead, I wish
often times that I were dead.

^ IS there no choice for me, but still to taste this strife? shall all misease
and pensive thought, ^ torment me all my life? O Lord to thee I call, now let
thy pleasure be, to keep me ^ from this misery, in joy with thine to be, to
keep me from this misery, in joy with ^ thine to be.

^ THe diverse chance that God does send, the diverse chance that God does send,
to vex the ^ mind and body both, it does proceed as we offend, ij. or as his
love toward ^ us groth: ij. Sometimes for that, sometimes for that our sins
increase, our sins en- ^ crease, sometimes to try, sometimes to try our

^ THe great offense of my most sinful ghost, with terror great does ouerflow

life past out of frame. When I for grace lift ^ up my daseld eye, unto the
throne from whence it does descend, even then despair seems to approach me ^
nigh, to make my hope in me for to take end. But lo, dame faith bids me leave
slipper hold, and take ^ sure gripe on promise made of yore, by him whose eyes
disdains not to behold, the humble cheer, with ^ heart tormented sore. So that
mercy, for mercy I do cry, unto ye Lord, from who^ springs all mercy, ^ so that

^ O Good Lord have mercy on me according to thy great mer cy, and do away

^ I will yield thanks to thee, O Lord in Trinity, because thou have heard me,
my prayer all: ^ and in my turmentre, my hope in thee shall be, to turn mine
enemy, when I thee call, to turn ^ mine enemy, when I thee call.

^MY soul and all that in me is, to praise my God always, shall ready be to do
the same, in the ^ best sort I may. For he to me has shewde his grace,
unworthy though I be, therefore will I ^ set forth his praise, to all of each
degree, therefore will I set forth his praise, to all of each degree.

^ SInce I embrace ye heavenly grace, in sort as I would have, rejoice I must,

Was never ^ none, did sigh and moan, I think more often then I, for deep
despair, me did empaire, confou^ding me ^ well nigh, confou^ding me well nigh.
But then Gods grace, appeard in place, putting back that foul ^ feend: and

of his pasture, and the sheep of his hands. To day ^ if ye will hear his
voice, har den not your hearts: When your fathers tempted me: pro- ^ uoked me,

said: it ^ is a people that do err in their hearts, for they have not known my
ways. Unto whom I swear ^ in my wrath: that they should not enter into my

^ IT does belong more of good right, to such as have cou rage gen tle, to show

how to use him to that ^ end, thou shall now know thy turn to serve. Both
gentle nes and courtesy, to him to ^ use ij. see that thou do. Let no rough
speech his patience try: ij. nor crooked ma- ^ ners see thou show. Forbear him
when he is angry. In his error gently reprove. ^ When aduers chance does
touch him nigh, comfort him then as does behoue. So may thou ^ not only
retain, thy friend so long as life does last: but double love thou oughtst to
gain, as gwer- ^ don, as gwerdon for thy friendship past. But when thou have so
