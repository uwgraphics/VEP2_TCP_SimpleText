She had a desire often to be wedde
And also to lie in an other man's bed
Little rought she therefore
She is as soft as a lamme if one do her meue
And like to ye devil wan a man does her grieve
So well is she set
O good condycyon to her housbonde
If he call her calat she calls hy^ knave again
She shyll not dye in his debt
By saint Jone said Cock than
These be fair virtues in a woman
Thou shalt be my launder
To wasshe and keep clean all my gere
Our two beds to gyder shall be set
Without any let
The next that came was a coryat
And a cobeler his brother
As rich as a new shorn sheep
They offered Cock a blechynge pot
Other Iewelles they had not
Scant shoes to their sete
The coryer dresseth so well his lether
That it would drink water in fair weder
Therefore he has many a crystes curse
And the cobeler for his clourynge
The people blesses him with evil cheuynge
To knytte fast in his purse
Ashomaker came to these other two
Bytweue them two was much a do
For a pyese of lether
They togged with their teth and gnewe it there
And pulde as it had been grehondes at a hare
It was a shepes skyne of a wether
And than they tanned it when they had done
To make lether to him with men's shone
And all for their avail
For as soon as the hemme is tore
The sho is lost for ever more
And it is little marvel
A tanner for evil tannynge of leder
They four with sorrow Cock did set together
And never a good without fail
Than came one with two bolddogges at his tail
And that was a bocher without fail
All be gored in reed blood
In his hand he bare a flap for flies
His hosen gresy upon his thyes
That place for magottes was very good
On his neck he bare a cole txe logge
He had as much pity as a dog
And he were ones wroth
He looked perysshe and also row
A man would take him for a shrewe I trow
And of his company be loathe
Than came a gonge fermourer
Other wise called a masser scourer
With him a canyell taker
Their presence made Cock and his me^ to spewe
For as sweet was they brethe as henka^ or reme
To wasshe them they laked water


On these Irysihe cople I will not tare
Cock did set the^ there as knaves should be
Among the slouenly sort
Than came two false towlers in next
He set them by pykers of the best
For there should they abide
But before yt they were plonged in the river
To search their bodies fair and clear
Thereof they had good sport
A myller dustypoll than did come
A Ioly fellow with a golden thome
On his neck a sack was
Many said that he with reprefe
Of all crafts was next a thief
In that Cock found no lack
He said that the touled twys for forgetynge
And stele flower and put chauke therein
Be shere we him that taught him that
Cock bad him grynde cherystones and peson
To make his men bread for a season
By cause whete was very dear
Than came a pardoner with his book
His quaterage of every man he took
But Cock would their names here
The pardoner said I will read my roll
And ye shall here the names poll by poll
There of ye need not fere

Thou makeste me weary hold thy pease
A thing tell thou me
What profit is to take thy pardon
Show us what mede is to come
To be in this fraternity
Sir this pardon is new found
By side London bridge in a holy ground
Late called the stews bank
Ye know well all that there was
Some relygyous women in that place
To whom men offered many a frank
And by cause they were so kind and lyberall
A merueylous adventure there is be fall
If yelyst to here how
There came such a wind from wynchester
That blewe these women over the river
In wherye as I will you tell
Some at saint Kateryns stroke a ground
And many in holborne were found
Some at saint Gyles I trow
Also in aue maria aly and at westmenster
And some in shordyche drew theder
With great lamentacyon
And by cause they have lost that fair place
They will bylde at colman hedge in space
A another noble mansyon
Fayrer and ever the half street was
For every house new paued is with gras
Shall be full of fair flowers
The walls shall be of hauthorne I wot well
And hanged with white motly yt sweet does smell
Grene shall be the colors
And as for this old place these wenches holy
They will not have it called the stewys for folly
But makes it strabery bank
And there is yet a chapel save
Of which ye all the pardon have
The saint is of symme trollanke
I will rehearse here in general
The indulgences that ye have shall
Is these that follows with more
At the our of death when ye have need
Ye shall be assoyled of every good deed
That you have done before
And ye shall be part taker of as many good dedde
As is done every night a bed
And also ferthermore
At every tavern in the year
A solemn dyryge is song there
With a great drinking
At all ale houses trewely
Ye shall be prayed for hertely
With a Ioyefull weeping
And the pope darlaye has granted in his byll
That every brother may do what he will
While that they be waking
And the pardone gives you that has the pose
On your own sleue to wype your nose
Without rebuke taking
Also pope nycoll grants you all in this text
The coughe and the colyke the gout and the flyxe
With the wholesome tothe ache
Also it is granted by our bulls of led
That when any brother is deed
To the church dogs shall carry him
A rich pal to ly on ye corse late fro rome is come
Made of an old pair of blewe medly popley hosone
For ye worship of all ye brethren.

That all his men should him know
With that the^y cried and made a shoute
That the water shoke all about
Than men might here the ores classhe
And on the water gave many a dasshe
They sprede their sails as void of sorrow
For he they rowed saint George to borowe
For Joy their tru^pet^^^ did they blow
And some song heue and how rombelowe
They sailed fro garlyke head to knaves in
And a pele of gonnes began they ring
Of colman hedge a sight they had
That made his company very glad
For there they thought all to play
Between tyborne and chelsay
With this man was a lusty company
For all raskyllers fro them they did try
They banysshed prayer peace and sadness
And took with them myrthe sport and gladness
They would not have vertune yet devotion
Gaudeamus oe^s

But ryotte and revel with Ioly rebellyon
They song and daunsed full merely
With swerynge and staring heaven hye
Some said ye they were ge^tyl m^^ of great might
That there purses were so light
And some went in fured gowns and gaye shone
That had no mo faces than had the moon
Of this day glad was many a brothell
That might have an ore with Cock Lorell
Thus they daunsed with all their might
Till that phoebus had lost his light
But than came lucyna with all her pale hew
To take her sport among the clouds blewe
And marcury he true down his golden bemes
And sperus her silver stremes
That in the world gave so great light
As all the earth had be paued with white
Tha^ Cock wayed anchor and housed his sail
And forth he rowed without fail
They sailed England through and through
Vyllage town cite and borowe
They blessed their ship when they had done
And drank about saint Iulyans torn
Than every man pulled at his ore
With that I could se them no more
But as they rowed up the hill
The boat swayne blewe his whystell full shryll
And I went homwarde to mow shame stere
With a company did I mete
As ermytes monks and freres


Chanons chartores and Inholders
And many white nonnes with white vayles
That was full wanton of their tails
To mete with Cock they asked how to do
And I told them he was a go
Than were they sad euerychone
And went again to their home
But my counseyll I gave them there
To mete with Cock another year
No more of Cock now I write
But merry it is when knaves done mete
Cock had in his hand a great route
The third person of England
Thus of Cock Lorell I make an end
And to heaven god your souls send
That redeth this book over all
Christ cover you with his mantell perpetual.
AMEN
